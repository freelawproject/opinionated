Patricia Smaller, Julie Miller, and Todd Weaver filed separate appeals of family court decisions regarding modification of spousal maintenance. Patricia Smaller and Julie Miller appeal orders reducing their spousal maintenance awards based on findings that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>their financial circumstances had experienced real, substantial, and unanticipated changes. Todd Weaver appeals a decision denying his motion to modify spousal maintenance because the family court found no changed circumstances. We consolidated the appeals for decision because they involve a similar question of law \u2014 when does cohabitation or remarriage constitute a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances under 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 758. In <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>we conclude that the family court was within its discretion in deciding that recipient spouse\u2019s new husband\u2019s contributions to the household expenses constituted a change in circumstances, and thus affirm the court\u2019s decision to eliminate husband\u2019s spousal maintenance obligation. In <em>Smaller v. Smaller, </em>we reverse the family court\u2019s decision to eliminate husband\u2019s spousal maintenance obligation because the court\u2019s findings show that the recipient spouse\u2019s financial circumstances were not substantially improved by actual support from a cohabitant. In <em>Loubengeiger v. Weaver, </em>we affirm the family court\u2019s decision to deny the obligor spouse\u2019s motion to modify maintenance because the motion, and supporting affidavit, do not demonstrate that any improvement in the recipient\u2019s financial circumstances from support by her cohabitant was unanticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">I. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"A3I\">A. <em>Miller v. Miller</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b6 2. Julie and Lee Miller were divorced in December 2001, after eleven years of marriage. The divorce decree required husband to pay spousal maintenance of $975 per month until June 2007, and $750 per month from July 2007 until June 2009. It also obligated wife to pay a significant amount of debt, including approximately $100,000 in principal on two home mortgages and $22,126 in various unsecured debts. At the time of the divorce, wife\u2019s monthly housing expenses, without food costs, were $1551. At that time wife was also supporting four minor children \u2014 two children of the parties and two from a former marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b6 3. Following the divorce, wife filed for bankruptcy and discharged all of her unsecured debt except for one loan on which she pays $200 per month. She remarried, in August 2002, to Shane Taylor, a self-employed logger, and moved into his home. Soon thereafter, the bank foreclosed on the home she was awarded in the divorce decree because of her failure to make mortgage payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b6 4. Husband moved to modify the spousal maintenance order in November 2002 because of wife\u2019s improved financial circumstances. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Although wife\u2019s work income of $20,000 per year had not appreciably increased, he alleged three other improvements: financial support from wife\u2019s new husband, reduced expenditures because of the bankruptcy and the foreclosure, emancipation of one child of wife\u2019s first marriage, and reduced living expenses of the other. After hearing, the family court found a real, substantial, and unanticipated improvement in wife\u2019s financial circumstances, and eliminated husband\u2019s spousal maintenance obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b6 5. At the hearing, wife testified that her financial agreement with Mr. Taylor is to evenly split the household bills, including mortgage, property taxes, utilities, heat, home maintenance, and food. She stated that Mr. Taylor earns around $500 per week and is expected to contribute $1000 per month to the household expenses, but is not always able to provide that amount due to other personal debts. She confirmed that when Mr. Taylor makes his full contribution, she pays $839 per month for all housing expenses, except food.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b6 6. Wife also testified that she had incurred substantial new debt since declaring bankruptcy and remarrying. At the time of the divorce, she paid $212 per month for a 1994 Pontiac Transport valued at $12,000. After the divorce, however, she purchased a new $40,000 automobile on credit and owned it approximately two years before it was repossessed. She then purchased a 2003 GMC Envoy for $23,000, incurring a monthly car payment of $571 per month. Additionally, she took out a $5000 personal loan for car and house repairs, and owed roughly $1500 in new credit card debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b67. Finally, wife testified that circumstances had changed with respect to the children of her first marriage. One had graduated from high school and was working, but was still living with her without contributing to household expenses. The other was in college in Florida on a full scholarship that covered all living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b6 8. Based on the evidence presented, the family court concluded that wife\u2019s remarriage constituted a real, substantial, and unanticipated change in circumstances. The court found that Mr. Taylor\u2019s income was sufficient to contribute approximately $1000 per month to the household. It also found that wife\u2019s financial circumstances and lifestyle had substantially improved since the time of her divorce as a result of her clearing her debts through the bankruptcy and foreclosure. While she argued that her current debt load was approximately the same as at the time of her divorce, the court determined it was primarily her own fault as a result of her decisions to purchase a more expensive vehicle and make improvements to her home on credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>B. <em>Smaller v. Smaller</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b6 9. In October 2002, the Windsor Family Court granted Patricia and Mark Smaller a divorce, and ordered husband to pay wife $1200 per month as spousal maintenance until such time as either died. In November 2002, wife moved out of the marital home and into an apartment of her own. In April 2003, her new partner moved into her apartment, but they have not married and the new partner has not paid rent or substantially contributed to household expenses. In January 2004, husband filed a motion to modify maintenance, claiming a change of circumstances because: (1) subsequent to the original maintenance order his wife began cohabitating with another person who contributes to her support; and (2) wife received a promotion which resulted in a greater income. After hearing, the family court found that wife was cohabitating with a new partner, but the new partner did not, in fact, contribute to rent or other household expenses. The court determined, however, that wife\u2019s cohabitation with a person who works full-time and could contribute to the household expenses constituted a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances. The court reasoned that husband should not have to pay to maintain his former wife\u2019s home and lifestyle when she chose not to accept money from a cohabitant who was capable of contributing to household expenses. It also found that wife\u2019s income had increased since the time of the divorce but concluded that the increase was not sufficient, alone, to constitute a substantial change of circumstances. The family court modified the maintenance order, reducing husband\u2019s monthly spousal maintenance payment by $350, based on the amount in rent and utility expenses wife\u2019s new partner should be expected to contribute as a fully-employed cohabitant. Wife subsequently filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">C. <em>Loubengeiger v. Weaver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b6 10. Janet Loubengeiger and Todd Weaver separated in September 1999 and divorced in August 2000 as a result of husband\u2019s extra-marital relationship. During their eight-year marriage, they had one child. At the time of the divorce, husband was employed by IBM and earned a salary of approximately $100,000. Wife was a full-time mother and was not employed outside the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b6 11. The parties negotiated a spousal maintenance stipulation, which the Addison Family Court accepted in January 2002. The stipulation required husband to pay wife maintenance of $1400 per month for sixty consecutive months and to transfer to her $115,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>from his pension and retirement accounts. The stipulation stated that it would not be modified \u201cwithout the necessary change of circumstances required under Vermont law\u201d and that separation by either party from his or her current partner could not be asserted as grounds for a modification of spousal maintenance. Apparently, the latter provision was added because both husband and wife were in committed relationships with new partners, who were named in the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b6 12. In July 2004, husband filed a motion to modify spousal maintenance arguing that the maintenance amount agreed upon in the stipulation anticipated that former wife would have to pay for her own housing and that she would make efforts to gain employment and training. He claimed that a change of circumstances had occurred because she remained living with her new partner, made no efforts to gain employment or training, enjoyed a higher standard of living than that established during the marriage, and received twenty percent more than the $68,500 the maintenance order anticipated she would obtain from his pension distribution after taxes and fees. The family court denied this motion, holding that the stipulation did not make payment of spousal maintenance contingent on former wife seeking employment or training and that no basis existed for a finding that a substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b6 13. In August 2004, former husband filed a motion for reconsideration, reiterating the arguments from his initial motion. The family court denied the motion without explanation, and husband appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">II. The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b6 14. Family courts may order spousal maintenance upon a finding that the spouse seeking maintenance \u201clacks sufficient income, property, or both ... to provide for his or her reasonable needs.\u201d 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 752(a)(1). These needs are based on the \u201cstandard of living established during the marriage,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 752(a)(2), and may additionally include compensation for the \u201ccontribution of a homemaker to the family\u2019s well-being.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>175 Vt. 32, 37, 819 A.2d 684, 688 (2002) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b6 15. Upon a motion by either party, the court may modify a spousal maintenance order if it finds a \u201creal, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances.\u201d 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 758. The burden of proving this change of circumstances lies with the party seeking modification. <em>Mayo v. Mayo, </em>173 Vt. 459, 462, 786 A.2d 401, 405 (2001) (mem.). \u201cThere are no fixed standards for determining what meets this threshold, and ... evaluation of whether or not any given change is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>substantial must be determined in the context of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>175 Vt. at 36, 819 A.2d at 688 (quotations omitted). We will not reverse the family court\u2019s ruling on maintenance unless its discretion \u201cwas erroneously exercised, or was exercised upon unfounded considerations or to an extent clearly unreasonable in light of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b6 16. We have combined these cases for decision because each involves a situation whereby an obligor spouse alleges a recipient spouse\u2019s post-divorce relationship as grounds for a maintenance award modification. We have addressed this situation where the recipient spouse has remarried, holding that \u201c[r]emarriage does not necessarily improve the spouse\u2019s financial security,\u201d and therefore it \u201cdoes not automatically justify a termination of maintenance payments.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>155 Vt. 36, 42, 580 A.2d 503, 507 (1990); accord <em>Coor v. Coor, </em>155 Vt. 32, 35, 580 A.2d 500, 502 (1990). We amplified this holding in <em>Taylor, </em>explaining that the point of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Coor </em>is that we view \u201cremarriage as relevant to an ongoing maintenance obligation only to the extent it bears on the \u2018financial security\u2019 of the recipient spouse.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>175 Vt. at 38, 819 A.2d at 689. We characterized this rule as consistent with our holdings that substantial, unanticipated \u201cchanges in the nonmaintenance income available to the recipient spouse\u201d could warrant a modification of a maintenance award. <em>Id:, </em>see also <em>Bullard v. Bullard, </em>144 Vt. 627, 629, 481 A.2d 1049, 1051 (1984) (\u201c[S]inee an original maintenance decree issued in Vermont takes into consideration the financial capabilities and prospects of both spouses, it is only reasonable and fair that in considering a modification of that original order, a court examine the evidence relating to the change in financial circumstances of either or both spouses.\u201d). We acknowledged that we have not followed the majority of jurisdictions on this point \u2014 they presume that maintenance will be reduced or terminated on remarriage of the recipient spouse. <em>Taylor, </em>175 Vt. at 37, 819 A.2d at 689. Under <em>Taylor, </em>the obligor spouse may seek a modification of the order if remarriage causes an increase in the recipient spouse\u2019s income that \u201csubstantially reduces the need for maintenance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 819 A.2d at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b6 17. We have not addressed the effect on a maintenance award of a post-divorce relationship of the recipient spouse where the spouse cohabits with another partner but does not remarry. Our cases concerning cohabitation have been limited to consideration of the applicability of remarriage clauses in divorce stipulations. <em>Porter v. Porter, </em>137 Vt. 375, 376, 406 A.2d 398, 399 (1979); <em>Stahl v. Stahl, </em>136 Vt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>90, 91, 385 A.2d 1091, 1092 (1978). We have held that cohabitation does not equal remarriage for purpose of such clauses. <em>Porter, </em>137 Vt. at 376, 406 A.2d at 399. These cases are otherwise unhelpful because they arose before the amendment to 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 758 that allows modification of maintenance awards \u201cbased upon a stipulation or an agreement\u201d for the same grounds as for maintenance awards not based on such agreements. 1981, No. 247 (Adj. Sess.), \u00a7 13; see also <em>Cliche v. Cliche, </em>143 Vt. 301, 303 n.*, 466 A.2d 314, 314 n.* (1983) (explaining that after the amendment, maintenance awards based on a stipulation can be modified \u201cupon a showing only of changed circumstances\u201d). Thus, to the extent the obligor in those cases argued that modification should occur based on cohabitation, he had to show the grounds for modifying a contract, a much greater burden than changed circumstances. <em>Porter, </em>137 Vt. at 377, 406 A.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b6 18. The majority rule in jurisdictions without a specific statute is that cohabitation by the recipient spouse can result in reduction or elimination of a maintenance award only if it improves the financial circumstances of the recipient spouse enough to substantially reduce the need for maintenance. <em>Smith v. Mangum, </em>747 P.2d 609, 611 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1987) (stating majority rule that \u201ccourts modify the amount of spousal maintenance received by the cohabiting ex-spouse only if the spouse\u2019s support needs have changed\u201d); accord <em>Lombardo v. Lombardo, </em>992 S.W.2d 919, 922-23 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999); <em>Gilman v. Gilman, </em>956 P.2d 761, 764 (Nev. 1998); <em>Gayet v. Gayet, </em>456 A.2d 102, 104 (N.J. 1983); see generally 2 H. Clark, The Law of Domestic Relations in the United States \u00a7 17.6(5), at 285-90 (1987). This majority rule is essentially the rule we have adopted for remarriage as explained in <em>Taylor. </em>Thus, it is entirely consistent with our current law and creates no disincentive to remarriage, a concern in states where remarriage results automatically in the termination of maintenance. We adopt the majority rule for cohabitation situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b6 19. In doing so, we particularly note the cautionary words of the North Dakota Supreme Court in <em>Cermak v. Cermak, </em>1997 ND 187, \u00b6 10, 569 N.W.2d 280:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">The length of [the recipient spouse\u2019s] relationship is unknown; it may last until her death, or may sour tomorrow. On this record, any support [she] may receive from her cohabitant is provided from his benevolence and comes with no reciprocal or continuing obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>See also <em>Gilman, </em>956 P.2d at 765 (recognizing that \u201ccohabitants owe no legal or financial support to one another\u201d). As the Kentucky Supreme Court explained, we do not intend \u201cto open the floodgates to motions to terminate or suspend maintenance payments in every situation in which the maintenance recipient has begun dating, or has formed casual relationships with persons of the opposite sex.\u201d <em>Combs v. Combs, </em>787 S.W.2d 260, 262 (Ky. 1990). Cohabitation has become sufficiently common that it could be claimed in many instances where there is a divorce maintenance award. It can, of course, also affect the economic capacity of the obligor spouse. To constitute changed circumstances, cohabitation must approach the permanency of marriage. Thus, any claim of changed circumstances must include \u201csome permanency or long-term relationship.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b6 20. We also caution that changed circumstances presuppose a substantial improvement in the financial circumstances of the recipient spouse as a result of some measure of support by the cohabitant. See <em>Van Dyke v. Steinle, </em>902 P.2d 1372, 1385 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995) (remanding on question of reduction of spousal maintenance where wife\u2019s cohabitation raised issue of fact regarding \u201cwhether husband has established a substantial and continuing change of wife\u2019s economic circumstances\u201d). We recognize that sharing of household expenses may produce some measure of financial improvement because some of those expenses are not directly proportional to the number of household occupants. This improvement cannot alone be changed circumstances unless we are prepared to hold that a former spouse who takes a roommate to reduce expenses will lose the savings because of an offsetting reduction in maintenance. Maintenance recipients should normally retain the benefit of actions they take to five more economically.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b6 21. Finally, we caution that any economic benefit from cohabitation must be \u201cunanticipated\u201d to justify a reduction of maintenance. See <em>Haag v. Haag, </em>609 A.2d 1164, 1165 (Me. 1992) (finding that trial court abused discretion in eliminating husband\u2019s obligation to pay alimony in part because the possibility of wife\u2019s cohabitation was \u201cnot unanticipated by the original decree\u201d); <em>Cermak, </em>1997 ND 187, \u00b6 18 (\u201cA change of circumstances must be unforeseen at the time of the original divorce decree.\u201d). This is the holding of <em>Gil v. Gil, </em>in which the obligor spouse argued that the recipient spouse\u2019s maintenance should be terminated because she was in a \u201clong-term cohabitation relationship\u201d which involved sharing of expenses. 151 Vt. 598, 599, 563 A.2d 624, 625 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>(1989). We affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to find changed circumstances because the cohabitation relationship was in existence at the time of the divorce order, and it was not unanticipated that the cohabitants would share expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 563 A.2d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">III. Applying the Law</p>\n<p id=\"ALk\">A. <em>Miller v. Miller</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b6 22. In this case, wife appeals the Windsor Family Court\u2019s decision to eliminate husband\u2019s spousal maintenance obligation and to reimburse husband for spousal maintenance paid since January 1, 2004, arguing that the court could not find the real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances required by 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 758. She claims that, despite her remarriage, her financial situation is no better than it was at the time of her divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b6 23. At the outset we note that this case only partially depends upon the recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage as the basis for the finding of the requisite changed circumstances. The recipient spouse improved her financial circumstances through bankruptcy and the elimination of a large housing debt when the mortgage on the home awarded in the divorce was foreclosed and the bank took title to the home. Further, the recipient spouse was no longer required to provide substantial support to the children of her first marriage, although she voluntarily chose to provide such support with respect to one of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b6 24. We need not decide whether these facts alone were sufficient to find changed circumstances because we agree with the family court that the remarriage could also be considered in this case under <em>Taylor. </em>As that case states, remarriage is relevant to a showing of changed circumstances \u201conly to the extent it bears on the \u2018financial security\u2019 of the recipient spouse.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>175 Vt. at 38, 819 A.2d at 689 (explaining <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Coor). </em>The spouse seeking modification must show that the \u201cremarriage causes an increase in income so that a real and substantial change of circumstances is present.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>155 Vt. at 42, 580 A.2d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b6 25. Here, the recipient spouse testified that she had a financial agreement with her new husband whereby he paid half of the household bills. She testified that he earned $500 per week, an amount she also stated on her financial affidavit, and that he contributed approximately $1000 per month to their household expenses. She testified that he could not always pay his full share due to other personal debts, but admitted she knew very little about his financial situation. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>this testimony, the family court found that the new husband made actual contributions to the household expenses at \u201caround $1000 per month\u201d and that his salary gave him the financial capacity to continue contributing at that level. As we state above, expense sharing alone is generally not sufficient to show an improvement in financial circumstances, but here the recipient spouse became half-owner of her new husband\u2019s house and, as a result, had a much lower housing cost than at the time of the divorce. Based on these circumstances, the family court concluded that wife had experienced a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances and terminated the maintenance obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b6 26. Despite the financial support of her new husband, and the other financial improvements found by the family court, wife argues that no real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances has occurred because her financial straits are just as dire as they were at the time of her divorce. The family court disagreed, concluding that the circumstances that led to her dire financial state at the time of the divorce had been alleviated, but that she had assumed new debt thereafter. The court particularly cited: her decision to buy a new car for $40,000 and, after it was repossessed, to buy another new car for $23,000; her assumption of new debt for house and car repairs; and her decision to continue supporting her emancipated daughter from her first marriage despite no obligation to do so. This conclusion is based on the findings, which are supported by the evidence. We, therefore, find no abuse of discretion and affirm the family court\u2019s decision. See <em>Taylor, </em>175 Vt. at 36, 819 A.2d at 688 (articulating that family court decisions to modify spousal maintenance should be affirmed unless the court erroneously exercises its discretion, or exercises it \u201cupon unfounded considerations or to an extent clearly unreasonable in light of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b6 27. In affirming the family court decision, we stress what is not covered by this opinion. Wife, recipient spouse, appealed only the decision to find changed circumstances and not the modification decision reached by the family court once it found changed circumstances. Thus, we have not reviewed the amount of the reduction with respect to the improvement of wife\u2019s financial situation. Nor have we determined whether part of the original maintenance award in this case was compensatory. If it was, we would question the family court\u2019s authority to terminate that part of the maintenance award. See <em>id. </em>at 39-40, 819 A.2d at 690 (recognizing that family court cannot eliminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>compensatory part of maintenance award); <em>Stickney v. Stickney, </em>170 Vt. 547, 549, 742 A.2d 1228, 1231 (1999) (mem.) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">B. <em>Smaller v. Smaller</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b6 28. Recipient spouse argues that the family court erred by finding a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances based on her cohabitation with a new partner without finding that her economic situation had actually improved. Thus, she argues that the court relied on its finding that the new partner had the ability to contribute to household expenses, even though he did not so contribute. We agree with recipient spouse\u2019s characterization of the family court\u2019s decision. The court found credible recipient spouse\u2019s testimony that, except for a minimal amount in groceries, she and her partner did not share household expenses. It concluded, however, that husband\u2019s maintenance obligation should be reduced because wife chose to have her partner live with her rent-free.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b6 29. Under the general principles set out above, we agree with the recipient spouse that her financial situation has not improved as a result of the cohabitant relationship. If there was any effect on her financial situation, it was negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b6 30. In essence, the court held that the obligor spouse should have the benefit of expense sharing, as if it occurred, because the new partner had the financial capacity to share in expenses and should be made to do so. We understand the sense of injustice that results from an appearance that an obligor is supporting both his former wife and her new partner. Nevertheless, we cannot hold that this sense of injustice alone supports a finding of changed circumstances. See <em>Van Dyke, </em>902 P.2d at 1382 (noting that failure of cohabitant to contribute to household expenses does not reduce recipient spouse\u2019s financial need);<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Mitchell v. Mitchell, </em>418 A.2d 1140, 1143 (Me. 1980) (same). Contrary to the reasoning of the dissent, we adopted a rule in <em>Taylor, Johnson, </em>and <em>Coor </em>that allows modification, even on remarriage of the recipient spouse, only upon a showing of actual improvement of the financial circumstances of the recipient spouse. Imputation of income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>from one cohabitant to another \u2014 the rule the dissent seeks and the effect of the trial court decision in this case \u2014 is totally inconsistent with the <em>Taylor </em>rule because it corresponds to no actual improvement in financial circumstances. Moreover, even if the new partner contributed equally to the expenses of the household, we would not hold, as we explained above, that this alone is a substantial improvement in the recipient spouse\u2019s financial circumstances so as to warrant a modification of maintenance. Thus, even if we imputed contribution, as the family court has done here, changed circumstances would still not result. We hold that the family court abused its discretion in modifying the maintenance award based on the amount it decided that wife\u2019s new partner should contribute to her household expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">C. <em>Loubengeiger v. Weaver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b6 31. Obligor spouse claims that the family court abused its discretion in denying without hearing his motion to modify spousal maintenance, and raises four points in his argument to this Court. First, he states that the spousal maintenance stipulation was based on the expectation that wife would terminate her relationship with her new partner and find her own housing. Because wife continues to live with the same partner, and is being supported partially by him, husband argues that this represents a change of circumstances requiring a reduction of his maintenance obligation. Second, he claims that the maintenance payments are rehabilitative and were intended to assist his wife while she gained the skills, training, and employment necessary to become self-sufficient. He argues that a change of circumstances has occurred because she has not attempted to gain skills and does not work as was anticipated at the time of the stipulation. Third, he claims that the family court improperly denied his motion to modify because the maintenance agreement was in the form of a stipulation rather than a court order. Finally, he claims that the court erred in dividing his pension and Tax Deferred Savings Plan (TDSP), which resulted in his former wife receiving $80,000 after taxes and fees rather than the intended $68,500. In light of the alleged error, he argues that a reconsideration of his maintenance obligation is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b6 32. We start with the arguments that are not directly related to the recipient spouse\u2019s cohabitation with a new partner. Obligor spouse\u2019s main argument is that the maintenance obligation should be reduced because wife is not seeking employment or training, as was expected at the time the maintenance stipulation was signed. The maintenance awarded is time-limited and, thus, rehabilitative. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Klein v. Klein, </em>150 Vt. 466, 476, 555 A.2d 382, 388 (1988) (explaining that rehabilitative maintenance is \u201ctemporary maintenance in order that the spouse can acquire the skills and experience to become self-supporting\u201d). The purpose of rehabilitative maintenance is to give the recipient spouse the opportunity to develop or redevelop employment skills that will allow her or him to achieve economic self-sufficiency in the future. <em>Strauss v. Strauss, </em>160 Vt. 335, 339, 628 A.2d 552, 554 (1993); <em>Klein, </em>150 Vt. at 476, 555 A.2d at 388. The time limit creates an economic incentive to maximize income production as soon as possible, with the understanding that the obligor\u2019s maintenance obligation will normally end at a time certain, irrespective of the recipient\u2019s need.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b633. The family court denied the motion to modify, without hearing, because nothing in the stipulation underlying the order, or the order itself, made the maintenance obligation contingent on the recipient seeking employment or training. We would add that obligor\u2019s argument is basically inconsistent with the nature of rehabilitative maintenance. If, for example, the recipient spouse entered training, or began a career at lower wages, nothing in the order suggests that these acts would affect obligor\u2019s payment obligation. Indeed, it is central to obligor\u2019s argument that these acts were anticipated. Thus, we do not understand how wife\u2019s failure to take these steps should affect that obligation. Whether or not she takes steps to improve her employability and income potential, the rehabilitative maintenance obligation will end in five years. <em>Strauss, </em>160 Vt. at 341, 628 A.2d at 555 (noting that rehabilitative maintenance allows parties to get on with their independent lives after the time period expires). Husband reveals the weakness of his argument by expressing it in terms of his expectations that wife would work. \u2018What must be shown is an actual change in circumstances, not a failure to change according to the defendant\u2019s alleged expectations.\u201d <em>DeKoeyer v. DeKoeyer, </em>146 Vt. 493, 495, 507 A.2d 962, 963 (1986). We find nothing erroneous about the court\u2019s exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b6 34. Next, husband claims that the court denied his motion because he had entered into a stipulation. He argues that the court\u2019s action is inconsistent with 15 V.S.A. \u00a7758, which allows modification of a maintenance order even if it is based on a stipulation. Although the court referred to the stipulation underlying the maintenance order, its point is that the order did not condition the maintenance obligation on the recipient spouse finding employment. Thus, it held that \u201cthere is no basis for the court to find that there has been a <em>substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>holding rested on the relevant legal standard, not on the fact that the maintenance order was based upon a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b6 35. The obligor\u2019s third argument is that wife realized $80,000 after taxes and fees rather than the $68,500 she was intended to receive from his pension and TDSP accounts. Thus, obligor requests that we reduce his maintenance obligation so that he can recoup the difference. We find no merit in this argument, as the language of the stipulation and order reflects \u201cthe parties\u2019 understanding and intention that [wife] will realize a <em>minimum </em>of $68,500 once all penalties, taxes and any related fees are paid.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Whatever may have been husband\u2019s expectation, the order clearly provides that $68,500 is a floor and not a firm amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b6 36. We are left then with obligor\u2019s argument that a change of circumstances occurred because wife is being supported at a higher standard of living by her new partner. The trial court never responded to this argument either in its initial decision or in its denial of the motion to reconsider. Moreover, the court never held a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b6 37. Under Vermont Rule for Family Proceedings 4(j)(2), obligor was required to support his motion for modification with an affidavit. The affidavit needed to \u201cset forth specific facts sufficient to warrant the required findings.\u201d V.R.F.P. 4(j)(3). Obligor submitted an affidavit that stated, among other items, that at the time of the stipulation \u201cplaintiff and her boyfriend were parting ways and plaintiff was going to be looking for housing of her own,\u201d and that \u201cplaintiff and her boyfriend have reconciled, making their relationship one of almost five years.\u201d It also stated that at the time of the stipulation \u201cshe would be on her own for housing,\u201d whereas at the current time (June 2004), she was in \u201ca long term relationship with a financially secure partner, several vacations, new vehicles and multiple homes.\u201d With one exception, we agree with husband that the affidavit was sufficient to state a case for modification under the standards we have announced above and to obtain an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b6 38. The one exception is that the motion and affidavit did not show that the former spouse\u2019s financial circumstances were unanticipated. As she argues, her circumstances at the time of the family court hearing were exactly those present at the time of the stipulation or, as in <em>Gil, </em>a logical extension of those circumstances. 151 Vt. at 600, 563 A.2d at 626 (holding that it was not unanticipated that \u201ccohabitating parties would eventually share expenses\u201d). As obligor admits, wife\u2019s cohabitation had gone on for a substantial period of time, approaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>five years. Although not precisely addressing the situation presented by obligor, the stipulation addressed the effect of the relationships with the new partners on the maintenance obligation, even specifying the partners by name. Although obligor\u2019s expectation may differ from how the facts developed, it is the circumstances and not the expectation that controls. <em>DeKoeyer, </em>146 Vt. at 495, 507 A.2d at 963. If obligor desired to claim a change of circumstances when wife remained in her relationship, rather than leaving the relationship, he should have included this eventuality in the stipulation or sought it in the court order. For this reason, we conclude that the family court was correct in denying obligor\u2019s motion to modify, even without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\n<em>The family court\u2019s decision in Miller v.

Because I believe that the trial court acted within its discretion in finding changed circumstances in <em>Smaller v. Smaller, </em>I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion in that case. Although I would remand for additional findings of fact, it was not error for the family court to consider the economic effects of wife\u2019s cohabitation arrangement in its analysis of changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b6 40. Pursuant to 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 758, the family court may modify a maintenance order \u201cupon a showing of a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances.\u201d As the majority recognizes, the family court has discretion in determining whether changed circumstances exist, and this Court will not disturb its determination \u201cunless the discretion was erroneously exercised, or was exercised upon unfounded considerations or to an extent clearly unreasonable in light of the evidence.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>175 Vt. 32, 36, 819 A.2d 684, 688 (2003). By concluding that the sharing of household expenses, in addition to cohabitation, can never constitute changed circumstances, the majority deprives the family court of its ability to fully exercise its discretion in considering motions to modify. Specifically, in <em>Smaller, </em>I believe that the family court acted within its discretion in considering the significance of the \u201cfinancial security\u201d provided to wife by her cohabitation arrangement. See 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 752(b)(1) (requiring court, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>fashioning maintenance award, to consider \u201cfinancial resources\u201d of party seeking maintenance, among other factors); <em>Taylor, </em>175 Vt. at 39, 819 A.2d at 690 (recognizing that recipient spouse\u2019s \u201cimproved financial security\u201d will support modification of maintenance award); <em>Bullard v. Bullard, </em>144 Vt. 627, 629, 481 A.2d 1049, 1051 (1984) (observing that because original maintenance decree \u201ctakes into consideration the financial capabilities and prospects of both spouses, it is only reasonable and fair that in considering a modification of that original order, a court examine the evidence relating to the change in financial circumstances of either or both spouses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b6 41. The family court found that at the time of the parties\u2019 divorce wife was living in the marital residence but spending several nights a week at the home of her boyfriend, Tony Garland. After the divorce, wife rented her own apartment, and Mr. Garland moved in five months later. Mr. Garland continues to live with wife, and he does not maintain a separate residence. While the court did not make specific findings as to Mr. Garland\u2019s income or his ability to contribute, it did find that he works full-time but does not pay rent or contribute to the household expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b6 42. Based on this evidence, the court concluded that husband had established a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances since the final divorce order. Since that date, the court explained, wife had been involved in a long-term relationship with Mr. Garland, and the two now lived together in her home. The court concluded that, regardless of whether Mr. Garland actually shared expenses with wife, if he had the ability to do so, he lived in the same household, and he earned an income, then this constituted another source of support and income that was potentially available to wife. In other words, the court reasoned, wife could not avoid a modification of spousal support by allowing her partner to live with her rent-free, even though he was working full-time, simply because she did not want her maintenance award to be modified. The court explained that wife could choose not to have Mr. Garland pay for half of the rent or the utilities, but it was unfair to make husband pay for wife\u2019s decision. It therefore reduced husband\u2019s maintenance obligation by $350, which was approximately half of the rent and the utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b643. The majority holds that the family court erred in finding changed circumstances because the family court\u2019s conclusion rested on its sense of injustice rather than any substantial change. According to the majority, any financial savings that a recipient spouse realizes from the sharing of household expenses alone cannot constitute changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>circumstances. See <em>ante, </em>\u00b6 20 (recognizing that sharing of household expenses may produce some measure of financial improvement but holding that this improvement alone cannot be changed circumstances unless Court is prepared to hold that former spouse who takes in a roommate to reduce expenses will similarly lose such savings because of an offsetting reduction in maintenance). The majority thus concludes in <em>Smaller </em>that, even if wife\u2019s partner had contributed equally to the expenses of the household, this alone would not constitute a substantial improvement in wife\u2019s financial circumstances so as to warrant a modification of maintenance. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b6 44. I cannot accept this conclusion. First, living with a roommate would not constitute \u201ccohabitation\u201d as defined by the majority, and thus its roommate analogy is inapt. See <em>ante, </em>\u00b6 19 (\u201cTo constitute changed circumstances, cohabitation must approach the permanency of marriage. Thus, any claim of changed circumstances must include \u2018some permanency or long-term relationship.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Combs v. Combs, </em>787 S.W.2d 260, 262 (Ky. 1990)). More importantly, I am not prepared to conclude that the sharing of household expenses, in addition to the existence of a long-term relationship, can never constitute changed circumstances. Indeed, in a cohabitation case (not a \u201croommate\u201d case), it is difficult to conceive of a situation where a court could find changed circumstances in the absence of such economic factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b6 45. While the majority states that it adopts \u201cthe majority rule for cohabitation situations,\u201d <em>ante, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Smith v. Mangum, </em>747 P.2d 609, 611 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1987)), the majority rule does not foreclose a trial court from considering evidence of shared expenses in determining whether changed circumstances exist. See <em>Mangum, </em>747 P.2d at 612 (holding that, although cohabitation is not, in itself, the de facto equivalent of marriage that would warrant modification of spousal maintenance, \u201call evidence relating to the economic nature of the relationship between [wife] and [cohabitant] would be relevant and admissible to show that [wife\u2019s] support needs have changed\u201d). To the contrary, the cases cited by the majority support the proposition that the sharing of household expenses is a proper factor for the trial court to consider in determining if changed circumstances exist in a cohabitation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b6 46. In <em>Van Dyke v. Steinle, </em>902 P.2d 1372 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995), for example, the court explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018focal point\u2019 of the court\u2019s inquiry in a cohabitation situation is the recipient\u2019s need for continued support,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1378 (quoting <em>Mangum, </em>747 P.2d at 612), and thus a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>court should conduct a factual inquiry into the economic effect that the cohabitation actually has on the supported spouse. <em>Id. </em>at 1382. As the <em>Van Dyke </em>court observed, \u201conly evidence relating to the economic nature of the cohabitation would be relevant\u201d to show that a recipient spouse\u2019s support needs have changed since the final divorce decree. <em>Id. </em>at 1378. The <em>Van Dyke </em>court concluded that a factual question existed as to whether wife\u2019s cohabitation resulted in changed circumstances, and it held that, on remand, the trial court could consider house maintenance and repairs performed by wife\u2019s cohabitant, as well as \u201cany other reductions in wife\u2019s household expenses, or expenditures she incurs by the addition of [the cohabitant] to her household\u201d to determine to what extent, if any, wife\u2019s spousal maintenance should be reduced. <em>Id. </em>at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b6 47. In <em>Lombardo v. Lombardo, </em>992 S.W.2d 919, 923 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999), another case cited by the majority, the court recognized that \u201ctrial courts should be allowed to take into account the third party\u2019s support of the receiving spouse, and the receiving spouse contributions to the support of the third party\u201d in determining whether a cohabitation arrangement has resulted in a substantial and continuing economic change of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The Nevada Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in <em>Gilman v. Gilman, </em>another case on which the majority relies. 956 P.2d 761, 764 (Nev. 1998) (explaining that those courts who have adopted the majority rule in cohabitation cases \u201chold that alimony payments used to benefit the cohabitant should be eliminated or reduced to meet the recipient spouse\u2019s actual needs\u201d). The <em>Gilman </em>court recognized the \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d that can result from cohabitation, and it emphasized that the \u201ceconomic needs\u201d test that it adopted allowed the \u201clower courts to focus upon the specific facts of each case, while retaining their substantial discretion when making spousal support modification decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765-66; see also <em>In re Marriage of Schroeder, </em>238 Cal. Rptr. 12, 15 (Ct. App. 1987) (recognizing that cohabitation may reduce the need for spousal support because sharing a household gives rise to economies of scale and, more importantly, the cohabitant\u2019s income may be available to the recipient spouse); <em>Van Gorder v. Van Gorder, </em>327 N.W.2d 674, 679 (Wis. 1983) (recognizing that where cohabiting couple share expenses, it may be appropriate to decrease or terminate maintenance payments because, under some circumstances, two people living together can live more cheaply than if they lived separately, but noting that certain living expenses, such as rent, would in many cases be the same whether the recipient spouse lived alone or not).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u00b6 48. Here, the trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that wife\u2019s financial situation has changed since the date of the final divorce order. The family court\u2019s consideration of the \u201cfinancial security\u201d afforded wife by her cohabitation arrangement is consistent with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Taylor. </em>In <em>Taylor, </em>the obligor argued that his ex-wife, as a result of her remarriage, had \u201caccess to such income and wealth that she no longer need[ed] maintenance.\u201d 175 Vt. at 39, 819 A.2d at 690. Although we did not hold that the motion to modify should necessarily be granted, we recognized that wife\u2019s improved \u201cfinancial security\u201d provided proper grounds for the motion to modify. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we note that in <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>discussed above, the family court concluded that there had been a substantial improvement in wife\u2019s financial circumstances based on its finding that wife\u2019s new husband had the \u201cfinancial capacity\u201d to contribute $1000 per month toward the support of their joint household. This is precisely the type of \u201cfinancial security\u201d that is relevant in considering a motion to modify, and the majority errs by foreclosing the family court from considering it. To hold, as the majority does, that shared expenses between cohabitants is never sufficient to show changed circumstances constrains the trial court\u2019s discretion and suggests that a recipient spouse might structure his or her living arrangement so as to avoid a modification of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b6 49. The majority recognizes that the family court has discretion in determining whether changed circumstances exist, <em>id. </em>at 36, 819 A.2d at 688, and as this Court has explained, \u201c [t]here are no fixed circumstances for determining what meets this threshold, and ... evaluation of whether or not any given change is substantial must be determined in the context of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Pigeon v. Pigeon, </em>173 Vt. 464, 466, 782 A.2d 1236, 1238 (2001) (mem.) (quotations omitted). I believe that the family court in <em>Smaller </em>acted within its discretion in applying the relevant factors and concluding that a substantial change of circumstances existed where wife was involved in a long-term relationship, her boyfriend was living with her (rather than the other way around), he was employed and had the ability to contribute to household expenses, and he did not do so. It was not error to conclude that these factors significantly affected wife\u2019s financial security or \u201cfinancial resources\u201d and they justified modification of the initial maintenance award. In fight of the absence of specific findings as to Mr. Garland\u2019s income and his ability to contribute, however, I would remand this case to the family court for additional findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u00b6 50.1 am authorized to state that Chief Justice Allen (Ret.) joins in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
