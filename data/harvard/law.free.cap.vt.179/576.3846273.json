Plaintiffs appeal from the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment upholding the Williams-town School Board\u2019s disciplinary action against plaintiff Kristopher Tremblay. The disciplinary action arose from a May 7, 2004 incident in which two Williams-town Middle School students, accompanied by Tremblay, removed pellet guns from Tremblay\u2019s house and brought them to a field at the school, where one of the students shot another student in the leg. Following a disciplinary hearing, the Board prohibited Tremblay from participating in any \u201cco-curricular activities and/or school functions through the end of the 2003-2004 school year,\u201d warned him that \u201c[a]ny subsequent incidents), during the 2004-2005 school year through May 21, 2005, that warrant a school suspension will result in expulsion for the remainder of the calendar year suspension,\u201d and filed a report about Tremblay with the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Tremblay and Tricia Rouleau, Tremblay\u2019s mother, brought an action in the superior court under Vermont Rule of Civil Procedure 75, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the Board\u2019s decision. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment, and the court found in favor of the Board. This appeal followed. We hold that the evidence against Tremblay was sufficient to support the Board\u2019s decision, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">\u00b6 2. We review a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment using the same standard as the trial court. <em>Hardwick Recycling &amp; Salvage, Inc. v. Acadia Ins. Co., </em>2004 VT 124, \u00b6 14, 177 Vt. 421, 869 A.2d 82. \u2018We will affirm summary judgment if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id; </em>V.R.C.P. 56(c)(3). Here, both sides agree that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and the only questions for our review are questions of law. Our review of questions of law raised by motions for summary judgment is plenary and non-deferential. <em>Hardwick, </em>2004 VT 124, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u00b6 3. Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in upholding Tremblay\u2019s punishment because the Board\u2019s findings were inconsistent with its conclusion that Tremblay violated the district\u2019s weapons policy. The policy, adopted pursuant to 16 V.S.A. \u00a7 1166(b), prohibits \u201c[p]ossession and/or use of any dangerous or deadly weapon or facsimile of any dangerous or deadly weapon in any school building on school grounds -or property.\u201d Williams-town School District Weapons Policy \u00a7 II (1999) [hereinafter Weapons Policy], The policy also prohibits any action that \u201cin any way encourages another student to bring weapons to school,\u201d and it subjects such actions to the same sanctions as possession and use. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 VI. These sanctions include an automatic one-year expulsion for any violation of the policy\u2019s provisions, subject to case-by-case modification based on mitigating circumstances. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 IV. According to a letter from the school\u2019s principal to Rouleau describing the results of Tremblay\u2019s hearing before the Board, the Board \u201cdetermined that [Tremblay] was in violation of the District\u2019s Weapons Policy when he was involved with other students who brought a soft pellet gun on school grounds on May 7, 2004.\u201d The letter also indicated, however, that the Board found Tremblay \u201cdid not bring a gun onto school grounds, made an effort to stop the other students, and eventually told an adult.\u201d Based on these findings, the Board chose not to expel Tremblay.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">\u00b6 4. Plaintiffs argue that the findings listed in the principal\u2019s letter demonstrate that Tremblay did not \u201caid\u201d or \u201cencourage\u201d the other students to bring the pellet guns to school, and that the Board\u2019s finding that Tremblay was \u201cinvolved with other students\u201d who violated the weapons policy does not merit punishment under the policy. This argument essentially asks us to treat the principal\u2019s letter describing the Board\u2019s decision as if it were an opinion describing the formal findings of a trial court. We do not conduct such a searching review of the decisions of a specialized board. Instead, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting quasi-judicial decisions under Rule 75, we determine only \u2018\u201cwhether there is any competent evidence to justify the adjudication.\u2019\u201d <em>Hunt v. Village of </em>Bristol, 159 Vt. 439, 441, 620 A.2d 1266, 1267 (1992) (quoting <em>Royalton Coll., Inc. v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>127 Vt. 436, 448, 251 A.2d 498, 506 (1969)). Plaintiffs\u2019 brief argues that failing to require formal findings prevents \u201cany substantial avenue of review short of blind deference\u201d to the Board. This assertion ignores not only the Legislature\u2019s delegation to school boards of \u201cthe power to establish educational policies, and to prescribe rules and regulations for the conduct and management of their respective schools,\u201d see <em>Rutz v. Essex Junction Prudential Comm., </em>142 Vt. 400, 405, 457 A.2d 1368, 1370 (1983) (citing 16 V.S.A. \u00a7 563 and emphasizing that \u201c[s]tudent discipline is an important and necessary element of school management\u201d), but also the undesirability of exhaustive judicial review of each and every decision of local school administrators. Our review balances competing considerations of fairness and deference by ensuring that disciplinary decisions are supported by some competent evidence without forcing school boards to observe the formalities required of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\u00b6 5. Regardless of the language used by the principal to summarize the Board\u2019s findings regarding Tremblay\u2019s actions, the undisputed facts were sufficient to support the Board\u2019s decision. Neither side disputes that the school determined that the students who brought the pellet guns to school took the guns from a locked box in Tremblay\u2019s house, while Tremblay was present. As the trial court noted, these facts alone could have supported inferences by the Board \u201cthat [Tremblay] was the one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>knew what was in the box and where the key was located in the house; that he therefore enabled the other students to access the guns; and he went to the school property with the students who had possession of the guns.\u201d According to the principal\u2019s letter, the Board took three mitigating factors into account: Tremblay\u2019s lack of possession or use of the weapons, his efforts to prevent the students from using the weapons, and his eventual notification of an adult. None of these factors, however, is necessarily inconsistent with a determination that Tremblay\u2019s actions violated the district\u2019s weapons policy; even if Tremblay later reconsidered his decision to allow the other students access to the weapons, the Board could have punished him based on that decision alone. Whether Tremblay was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the presence of the weapons on school grounds, as the principal put it, or he \u201cenabled\u201d the other students to bring the weapons onto school grounds, as the trial court found, the Board was within its discretion in determining that Tremblay\u2019s behavior violated the policy\u2019s prohibition of actions that \u201ccause, encourage, or aid any other student to possess, handle, or transmit\u201d weapons at school. Weapons Policy, \u00a7 VI. The Board\u2019s determination did not become any less valid when the principal failed to describe the violation using the precise wording of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
