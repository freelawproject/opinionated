This case turns on the ever-changing location of East Shore Road, a town road that runs along Knee Deep Bay in South Hero, Vermont. Over time, Lake Champlain has eroded the shoreline, and plaintiff Town of South Hero has responded by moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the road further inland onto defendants\u2019 land. In 2000, the Town sought a declaratory judgment as to the existence, location, and width of the road, and defendants \u2014 the four landowners on whose properties the Town claims the right-of-way for the road is located \u2014 counterclaimed for damages and injunctive relief. The trial court held that a right-of-way for the road was created by dedication and acceptance of the changes in the road\u2019s position until a time just prior to the maintenance work the Town did in August of 2000, and that any road work by the Town outside of that right-of-way was a taking. As explained below, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination of the location and width of the right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b6 2. The roots of this dispute, now submerged in the waters of Knee Deep Bay, go back much further than the filing of this action. Maps dating back to 1819 depict a road running along the shore of the bay, and, although there has never been a formal laying-out of the road, the parties acknowledge its \u201chistorical existence.\u201d The court used a 1942 aerial photo to fix the original position of the road \u2014 now eighty or more feet offshore \u2014 finding it \u201cmore likely than not that the 1942 center line of the road has long been the center line of the subject road ... as it was historically dedicated by use.\u201d The court then determined the location of the road in 1962, and the parties appear to agree that the Town\u2019s movement of the road to that location was proper. The question here is the legal significance of the road\u2019s post-1962 migrations. We must determine whether, as the Town contends, the right-of-way for the road continuously moves along with the incremental, changes resulting from erosion and maintenance of the roadway, or, as defendants argue, it remains fixed at its 1962 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b6 3. The evidence reflects that East Shore Road, while not a heavily-trafficked thoroughfare, was regularly used as a road for decades. Charles Tourville, a seventy-two-year resident of South Hero, and John Roy, a sixty-two-year resident, both testified that they used the road since they were boys. Robert Frechette, the brother of two of the defendants, testified that he drove on the road \u201ca couple times a year.\u201d In addition to the trial testimony, the record includes sworn statements made by a number of residents in October 2000. Those statements demonstrate that people have driven on the road for many decades, and continued to do so up until 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b6 4. Over the years, as the north shore of the bay continuously eroded, the Town maintained the road by adding material and cutting trees as needed. The road is seasonal; over the years, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Town has plowed it sporadically during the winter, and it has been underwater and thus impassable in the spring. At trial, Mr. Tourville testified that the Town opened the road every year from 1966 to 1988 (his entire tenure as road commissioner), and Mr. Roy, who became road commissioner in 1990, testified that the Town opened the road in the years other than 1996 through 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b6 5. In 2000, the Town indicated that it was going to perform significant maintenance work on the road that would encroach upon, defendants\u2019 property. On August 21, 2000, defendants\u2019 attorney sent a letter to the Town objecting to the proposed construction. Four days later, the Town filed the declaratory judgment complaint that began this case. On August 28, 2000, three days after filing the lawsuit, the Town began the construction work, which it completed in September 2000. The construction work moved the road further inland, placing most of it between 100 and 160 feet further inland from its 1942 location, and more than twenty-five feet inland from its 1962 location.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b6 6. In September 2000, defendants counterclaimed for damages and injunctive relief. Based on the parties\u2019 stipulation, the trial court bifurcated the question of the road\u2019s location from the issues of damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. In 2003, the court held a bench trial to determine the location of the right-of-way for the road. It held that \u201c[t]he right-of-way for the road was created by dedication and acceptance,\u201d and described the right-of-way as \u201cthree rods wide, one and one half each side of the center line of the traveled portion as it moved slightly up to 2000.\u201d In other words, the court used the 1962 location of the road as its starting point, and held that the right-of-way included the changes made by the Town \u201cas dedicated and accepted over the years until 2000.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court based its conclusion that defendants dedicated the land on their \u201c[l]ong acquiescence in use by the public and allowance by the owners of repairs at public expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b6 7. The court rejected the Town\u2019s \u201cshifting highway\u201d and \u201crolling easement\u201d theories and held that \u201c[p]art of the 2000 construction by the Town is outside of the right-of-way and constitutes a wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>taking.\u201d It pointed out that the Town \u201cmust proceed to follow statutory procedures if parts of the new roadway are to remain as constructed in 2000\u201d and to pay damages for property taken outside the right-of-way. The court then issued a final partial judgment defining the location and width of the right-of-way, permanently enjoining the Town from doing any further road work on defendants\u2019 land lying outside the right-of-way, and setting for trial the parties\u2019 remaining claims for damages, liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Defendants appealed, and the Town cross-appealed. We address defendants\u2019 appeal in Section I and the Town\u2019s cross-appeal in Section II.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b6 8. Defendants argue that the court erred in concluding that the right-of-way had moved by dedication and acceptance farther inland from the 1962 location of the road. Specifically, they contend that the evidence at trial precluded the court from ruling that they intended to dedicate any land outside the 1962 roadway for public use, pointing to trial testimony describing four discrete incidents. First, Harlow Frechette, Sr., their predecessor-in-title, twice during the 1960s put up barriers to attempt to stop people from using the road, both of which the Town removed. Second, in the mid-1970s, defendant David Fifield encountered Charles Tourville, then the road commissioner of South Hero, operating a grader on East Shore Road. Mr. Fifield testified that he asked Mr. Tourville what he was doing. When asked at trial if he did anything other than ask Mr. Tourville what he was doing, Mr. Fifield responded, \u201cNo. It was quite evident that it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. He was not the person to pursue the complaint with.\u201d Third, Mr. Fifield testified that in 1991 he walked the beach with road commissioner John Roy and complained about the road, pointing out cut trees that had been \u201cdumped well beyond a 50-foot right-of-way.\u201d Fourth, the minutes of the Town selectboard reflect that the Frechettes and Fifields attended an August 5, 1991 meeting \u201cto discuss the road being built up in front of their camps\u201d and expressed concern about the removal of trees and about the public\u2019s use of the beach without asking permission of the landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b6 9. In response, the Town argues that the court correctly concluded that defendants\u2019 evidence of their unwillingness to dedicate the roadway is outweighed by the evidence showing intent to dedicate \u2014 namely, defendants\u2019 long acquiescence in the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the road and acceptance of the Town\u2019s efforts to maintain it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b6 10. \u201cDedication is the setting apart of land for public.use, either expressly or by implication of law.\u201d <em>Druke v. Town of Newfane, </em>137 Vt. 571, 574, 409 A.2d 994, 995 (1979). Dedication of a roadway requires both an offer to dedicate the land and an acceptance of that offer. <em>Smith v. Town of Derby, </em>170 Vt. 553, 554, 742 A.2d 757, 759 (1999) (mem.). In determining whether there has been a dedication and acceptance, \u201c[i]ntent is a question of fact\u201d that we review for clear error. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Accordingly, we will uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that defendants intended to dedicate land for the road \u201cunless, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and excluding the effect of modifying evidence, there is no reasonable or credible evidence to support [it].\u201d <em>Mann v. Levin, </em>2004 VT 100, \u00b6 17, 177 Vt. 261, 861 A.2d 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b6 11. Because dedication may be express or implied, the offer to dedicate need not come in the form of a writing or an affirmative act by the owner. <em>Druke, </em>137 Vt. at 574, 409 A.2d at 995. For example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[l]ong acquiescence in use[] by the public, if the attending circumstances clearly indicate an intent by the owner to devote the land to public use, is evidence upon which a dedication may be predicated. The allowance by the owners of repairs at public expense is one circumstance that strongly tends to show the intent to dedicate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 575, 409 A.2d at 996 (citations omitted). This follows because the \u201ctheory underlying dedication is that owner-permitted use of private property by the public creates ... an expectation of continued use that estops the owner from preventing it.\u201d <em>Town of Newfane v. Walker, </em>161 Vt. 222, 226, 637 A.2d 1074, 1076 (1993); see also <em>Druke, </em>137 Vt. at 576, 409 A.2d at 996 (\u201c[D]edication is actually a form of estoppel in pais, in which the offer by the owner is the representation, and the use by the public is the reliance that completes the estoppel.\u201d). Thus, in the context of an implied dedication, the public\u2019s use of the land or resource in question looms large. See <em>Walker, </em>161 Vt. at 226, 637 A.2d at 1076 (noting that \u201c[u]se, not ownership, is the crux of dedication\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00b6 12. As described above, the court had before it some evidence that tended to disprove an intent on defendants\u2019 part to dedicate land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>beyond the 1962 location of the road, including testimony about a handful of instances where defendants expressed concern about the road<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one or two instances of defendants\u2019 predecessor-in-title erecting a physical barrier across the road. The court concluded, however, that defendants made an implicit offer to dedicate the land, citing the \u201c[l]ong acquiescence in use by the public and allowance by the owners of repairs at public expense\u201d and the fact that \u201cthe parties acknowledge the historical existence of the road.\u201d Each of these facts was supported by \u201creasonable or credible evidence.\u201d <em>Mann, </em>2004 VT 100, \u00b6 17. In effect, the court weighed the conflicting evidence on this issue and decided that the evidence supporting an implied dedication outweighed the evidence against it, a determination well within its province as trier of fact. Therefore, we hold that the court\u2019s weighing of the evidence on this issue was not error, and we affirm its conclusion that defendants impliedly dedicated a right-of-way for the road encompassing the road\u2019s movements up to August 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b6 13. The court correctly decided, based on the circumstances leading up to the road work, that the date of the August 2000 construction was the endpoint of the dedication. First, defendants not only \u201cvocally objected\u201d after the Town indicated its intent to do the maintenance work, they also voiced their objections in writing in the August 21, 2000 letter to the selectboard. Within days of receipt of that letter, the Town commenced this action, which put the question of the location of the right-of-way for East Shore Drive squarely in issue. In light of those circumstances, the court\u2019s implicit conclusion that defendants\u2019 intent to dedicate additional land could no longer be implied was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b6 14. Defendants next argue that if we uphold the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a dedication occurred, then the resulting right-of-way\u2019s inland boundary should be the \u201cnortherly line of the traveled portion of the road as it existed prior to the August 2000 construction.\u201d This argument challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cright-of-way is three rods wide, one and one half each side of the center line of the traveled portion as it moved slightly up to 2000.\u201d Defendants\u2019 argument would effectively characterize all of the 2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>construction as a taking, rather than only that portion of the construction that extends beyond the three-rod right-of-way fixed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b6 15. When, as here, the boundaries of a road are not properly recorded,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the law presumes a roadway width of \u201cone and one half rods on each side of the center of the <em>existing </em>traveled way.\u201d 19 V.S.A. \u00a7 32 (emphasis added). This presumption applies regardless of whether the existing traveled way has wandered from its original route. <em>Town of Ludlow v. Watson, </em>153 Vt. 437, 441, 571 A.2d 67, 69 (1990). Thus, 19 V.S.A. \u00a7 32 creates a rebuttable presumption that East Shore Road extends one-and-one-half rods from the centerline of the traveled way as it existed prior to the 2000 construction. See <em>Watson, </em>153 Vt. at 440, 571 A.2d at 69 (interpreting the statute as \u201can evidentiary method of proving the boundaries of a public highway otherwise incapable of ascertainment from public records\u201d (quotations omitted)). Defendants argue that they have rebutted the presumption because there was no evidence that they \u201cintended to dedicate any land farther inland than the northerly edge of the road\u201d as it existed prior to the 2000 maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b6 16. The evidence shows instead that the land was dedicated to public use as a road. Dedication \u201cpasses an easement to use the property in a manner consistent with the dedication.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>161 Vt. at 226, 637 A.2d at 1076. Thus, because the dedication was based in part on the public\u2019s long use of the land <em>as a road, </em>the scope of the dedication necessarily included the public\u2019s interest in the right-of-way, in addition to the portion actually traveled. This interpretation is supported by the deeds held by defendants, which state that the lands conveyed are subject to the road and its right-of-way.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the dedication was based in part on defendants\u2019 long acquiescence in the Town\u2019s maintenance of the road as a town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>highway. Thus, the town should be entitled to rely upon the three-rod presumption when maintaining roads in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the location and width of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b6 17. In its cross-appeal, the Town argues that there can be no taking in this case because the shoreline is \u201cthe only true monument\u201d for determining the location of the road and the Town has respected that location \u201cfor as long as the road has been there.\u201d The Town reasons that it is entitled to a three-rod right-of-way centered at the centerline of the existing traveled way \u2014 wherever it may be \u2014 because 19 V.S.A. \u00a7 32 applies \u201cwhether or not the traveled way has changed over time.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>153 Vt. at 441, 571 A.2d at 69. According to the Town\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 32, \u201c[s]mall changes in boundaries or lines should not require continuing recondemnation----For gradual changes, ... the presumption acknowledged by <em>Town of Ludlow v. Watson </em>is the better policy.\u201d In essence, the Town asks this Court to create a \u201crolling easement\u201d for East Shore Road that moves with the eroding shoreline. Therefore, the Town contends, there is no taking because, even after the 2000 construction, \u201cthe newly-constructed highway is within the presumed right-of-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b6 18. We disagree with the Town\u2019s analysis. A \u201ccommon-law dedication ... does not pass fee simple; rather, it passes an easement to use the property in a manner consistent with the dedication.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>161 Vt. at 226, 637 A.2d at 1076. Thus, the implied dedication discussed above resulted in the Town acquiring an easement to use the land occupied by the traveled way as it existed prior to the August 2000 construction and nothing more. The Town cannot justify further inland relocations of the road by successive applications of \u00a7 32\u2019s three-rod presumption because doing so would amount to a unilateral change in the location of the easement without the consent of defendants, the owners of the servient estates. See <em>In re Shantee Point, Inc., </em>174 Vt. 248, 261, 811 A.2d 1243, 1254 (2002) (recognizing that once an easement is fixed, it cannot be unilaterally enlarged or relocated by the owner of the dominant estate without consent of the owner of the servient estate). Accordingly, we reject the Town\u2019s argument that \u00a7 32 allows it to undertake \u201cgradual changes\u201d that move the road beyond the inland boundary established by the dedication without compensating defendants. To hold otherwise would enable the Town to rebuild the road within, but at the far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>inland edge of, the current right-of-way, and then apply \u00a7 32 to \u201cslide\u201d the right-of-way inland by centering it at the centerline of the new traveled way \u2014 a process which, in theory, could continue indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b6 19. The Town\u2019s reliance on <em>Feinman v. State, </em>717 S.W.2d 106 (Tex. App. 1986), is misplaced. There, the Texas Court of Appeals held that a statute that pegged the location of a public beach easement to the vegetation line of a beach created a rolling easement that moved up or back as the vegetation line changed. 717 S.W.2d at 110-11. The statute defined the \u201c\u2018line of vegetation\u2019\u201d as \u201c\u2018the extreme seaward boundary of natural vegetation which spreads continuously inland\u2019\u201d and the public beach as \u201c\u2018extending inland from the line of mean low tide to the line of vegetation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107 n.2, 109 (quoting Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. \u00a7 61.001(2) (Vernon 1978)). The court concluded that \u201cthe vegetation line is not stationary and that a rolling easement is implicit in the Act,\u201d noting that a \u201crigid construction\u201d requiring the public to prove that it has an easement to the vegetation line every time the line changes \u201cwould defeat the purposes of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111. Thus, <em>Feinman </em>turned on the wording and purpose of the Texas statute. Given the absence of an analogous Vermont statute, <em>Feinman </em>does not support the adoption of a \u201crolling easement\u201d theory in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b6 20. Finally, the Town contends that, after the August 2000 construction, the road remained completely inside the three-rod right-of-way centered on the centerline of the preconstruction traveled way created by the dedication. In so arguing, the Town refers to defendants\u2019 trial exhibit C, a large map that depicts the location of the traveled way prior to the construction, the traveled way after the construction, and the boundaries of the three-rod right-of-way centered at the centerline of the preconstruction traveled way. While we decline to rule on whether and to what extent the August 2000 construction worked a taking, we note that, contrary to the Town\u2019s contention, defendants\u2019 exhibit C appears to shows several small areas where the post-construction traveled way sits outside of the three-rod right-of-way. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, the trial court will determine during the second phase of this bifurcated matter whether the August 2000 construction was a taking of defendants\u2019 land and, if so, to what extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b6 21. In conclusion, the trial court correctly decided that the right-of-way for East Shore Road as it existed prior to the August 2000 construction work was established by dedication and acceptance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the incremental changes in the roadway\u2019s location up to that time. Additionally, the court applied 19 V.S.A. \u00a7 32 properly in centering the right-of-way at the centerline of the traveled way, rather than setting the inland edge of the traveled way as the right-of-way\u2019s boundary. The court also correctly rejected the Town\u2019s theories that would have the effect of moving the right-of-way further inland from that location. Therefore, we affirm the partial judgment and remand the matter so that the second phase of the litigation can proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> There was no specific testimony about the road\u2019s status in 1989 because Mr. TourviUe\u2019s tenure as road commissioner ended in 1988, and Roy\u2019s began in 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\"> The partial judgment order signed by the court on August 4, 2004 confirms that the \u201ccenterline of the road is hereby declared to be the centerline of the road as it existed prior to the construction work done by the Town in 2000.
