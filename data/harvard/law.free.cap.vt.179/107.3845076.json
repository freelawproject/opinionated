This appeal arises out of the suicide of twenty-two-year-old Melissa Issler, whose estate filed this action against Lamoille County Mental Health Services, Inc. (hereafter \u201cdefendant\u201d) alleging that defendant\u2019s negligence in treating Ms. Issler\u2019s suicidal condition was the cause of her death. The estate (hereafter \u201cplaintiff\u201d) appeals from a summary judgment in favor of defendant. Although we do so on slightly different grounds, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. Based on controlling law and the undisputed material facts, we hold that plaintiff faded to adduce evidence sufficient to prove that defendant\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">\u00b6 2. The material facts are undisputed. On January 19, 1999, Ms. Issler (hereafter \u201cdecedent\u201d) was brought to Copley Hospital in Morrisville after taking an overdose of Xanax tablets. There, as alleged in the complaint, she \u201creceived treatment and was evaluated by emergency room staff and an Emergency Service Worker\u201d employed by defendant, which had contracted with the hospital to provide mental health evaluations. After her physical condition was stabilized, decedent was interviewed by the emergency services worker, Kathleen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Greenmun, for a period of between fifteen and twenty-five minutes. In her notes from the interview, Greenmun reported that decedent appeared \u201cgroggy\u201d and \u201cpale,\u201d that she had recently experienced a series of seizures, and that after a particularly severe seizure \u201cshe felt something snapped, and she attempted to swallow a bottle of medication not her own.\u201d According to Greenmun\u2019s notes, decedent stated that \u201cthings had piled up\u201d and that \u201cshe felt overwhelmed.\u201d Decedent acknowledged, however, that \u201ctaking the overdose was a stupid, impulsive act.\u201d She \u201cdenie[d] any current suicidal ideation or plan,\u201d and indicated that she wanted to go home to rest at her boyfriend\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b6 3. Based on the interview, Greenmun concluded that decedent was not a suicide risk, and could safely go home. The interview notes indicate that Greenmun encouraged decedent to call Lamoille County Mental Health to discuss counseling, and to contact the mental health agency if she again felt overwhelmed. Decedent\u2019s boyfriend and another friend met her at the hospital. Greenmun recalled that she talked with them about removing medications from the house, but said nothing about firearms. Decedent\u2019s boyfriend stated that he removed and destroyed a number of medications from the home, but that it did not occur to him to remove a loaded pistol that he kept in his truck. Six days after the initial incident, on the morning of January 25, 1999, decedent entered the truck, removed the pistol from its holster, and shot herself in the head. She died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b6 4. In January 2001, plaintiff filed this action against defendant, alleging that decedent\u2019s suicide was a proximate result of Greenmun\u2019s \u201cnegligence in treating [decedent\u2019s] suicidal condition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff alleged specifically that Greenmun had been negligent in failing to determine whether any guns were available to decedent at her boyfriend\u2019s home, neglecting to enter into a \u201csafety contract\u201d with decedent, failing to initiate and schedule a follow-up appointment for decedent, and failing to contact decedent\u2019s treating physician regarding the reported seizures. In support of the claim, plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Dr. David Ellenbrook, Ph.D., offered his opinion that Greenmun had deviated from professional standards of care in evaluating and treating patients at risk of suicide in several respects, including her decision to conduct the evaluation while decedent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>still groggy rather than to wait until she was more alert, and her omissions in failing to conduct an adequate suicide assessment, to enter into a written safety contract with decedent, and to schedule follow-up appointments with decedent before her discharge. It was Dr. Ellenbrook\u2019s opinion that these additional steps would have resulted in \u201ca decreased probability\u201d of decedent\u2019s committing suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b6 5. Defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff had failed to adduce expert testimony establishing the requisite causal link between the alleged negligence and decedent\u2019s suicide. Plaintiff opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that defendant had violated certain safety regulations, requiring a finding of negligence per se. The trial court issued a written decision in October 2003, ruling that the expert\u2019s testimony was deficient on several grounds, and that defendant was therefore entitled to summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b6 6. Plaintiff principally contends the court erroneously rejected the testimony of her expert witness, Dr. Ellenbrook. The court found that Dr. Ellenbrook\u2019s testimony failed to establish the requisite causal link between defendant\u2019s conduct and decedent\u2019s suicide because, in the court\u2019s view, \u201cit is an opinion without basis, without substance.\u201d The court asserted that the testimony offered \u201cno explanation as to the mechanistic steps of causation!,] ... no analytic brick building.\u201d Accordingly, it concluded that the opinion failed to establish the necessary causal element of 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1908(3), which requires the plaintiff to prove \u201c[t]hat as a proximate result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s failure to exercise the requisite degree of care \u201cthe plaintiff suffered injuries that would not otherwise have been incurred\u201d in order to establish medical negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b6 7. We are uncertain as to the precise meaning of the court\u2019s ruling or the basis of the \u201csubstantive\u201d or \u201cmechanistic\u201d deficiencies to which it refers. Nevertheless, it is axiomatic that a judgment predicated on one theory that proves to be unfounded will be affirmed if it may be correctly resolved on another. See <em>Gochey v. Bombardier, Inc., </em>153 Vt. 607, 613, 572 A.2d 921, 925 (1990) (this Court \u201cmay affirm a correct judgment even though the grounds stated in support of it are erroneous\u201d). In this case, it is undisputed that plaintiff failed to adduce an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>expert opinion that decedent\u2019s suicide would not have occurred in the absence of defendant\u2019s alleged negligence. Accordingly, as explained more fully below, we agree with the trial court\u2019s fundamental conclusion that plaintiff failed to establish the essential causal element of her claim, and that defendant was therefore entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b6 8. The principal basis of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the focal point of dispute between the parties, was the legal sufficiency of an expert opinion that failed to assert decedent\u2019s suicide would not have occurred in the absence of defendant\u2019s alleged negligence. Plaintiff\u2019s expert-witness disclosure statement had described her expert, Dr. Ellenbrook, as holding the opinion that defendant\u2019s negligence \u201cwas a substantial and significant factor in the patient\u2019s death.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney attempted to explore this statement at Dr. Ellenbrook\u2019s deposition, asking whether it \u201cmean[s] that except for those failures to meet the standard of care that you have testified to, Melissa Issler would not have killed herself?\u201d Dr. Ellenbrook responded, \u201cI would say that there is a decreased probability that she would have.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney had the question reread on the ground that the answer was nonresponsive, but Dr. Ellenbrook maintained the same response, stating: \u201cOther than the answer I gave you, I can\u2019t answer that question, other than to give you that answer.\u201d When pressed again, Dr. Ellenbrook\u2019s response remained essentially the same, to the effect that the risk of decedent\u2019s suicide would have been \u201c[significantly decreased if the standards of care had been met, or at least decreased.\u201d Beyond that he would not, or could not, go.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b6 9. As noted, defendant argued below that Dr. Ellenbrook\u2019s testimony failed to establish a necessary statutory element of plaintiff\u2019s claim, to wit, that \u201cas a proximate result\u201d of defendant\u2019s failure to meet the standard of care \u201cthe plaintiff suffered injuries that would not otherwise have been incurred.\u201d 12 Y.S.A. \u00a7 1908(3). Plaintiff argued, in response, that to establish proximate cause it was sufficient merely to show \u2014 as Dr. Ellenbrook had essentially stated \u2014 that defendant\u2019s negligence was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in placing decedent at a \u201cgreater risk\u201d of harm. The trial court appeared to accept plaintiff\u2019s formulation, but rejected the testimony as inadequate on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b6 10. We have recently reaffirmed the common-law and statutory principle that in medical malpractice, as in tort law generally, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove that as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct the injuries \u201cwould not otherwise have been incurred,\u2019 \u201d and therefore \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>act or omission of the defendant <em>cannot </em>be considered a cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury if the injury would probably have occurred without it.\u201d <em>Smith v. Parrott, </em>2003 VT 64, \u00b6 12, 175 Vt. 375, 833 A.2d 843 (quoting 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1908(3)). The plaintiff in <em>Smith </em>had urged adoption of the so-called \u201closs of chance\u201d doctrine to permit recovery where the defendant\u2019s malpractice had increased the risk of harm, even where the plaintiff could not adduce evidence of a probability that, as a result of the malpractice, the plaintiff suffered injuries that would not otherwise have occurred. <em>Id. </em>\u00b67. In addressing the issue, we recognized the several \u201cpolicy arguments in favor of the doctrine, most notably the harshness of the traditional rule in denying recovery\u201d where the defendant\u2019s negligence may have significantly increased the risk of harm. Id. \u00b6 8. Nevertheless, we declined to adopt the loss-of-chance doctrine, noting that it represented a \u201csignificant departure from the traditional meaning of causation in tort law,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 13, and posed ramifications for the practice of medicine, as well as perhaps other professions in Vermont, better addressed through legislative action \u201cwhere hearings may be held, data collected, and competing interests heard before\u201d a correct decision is reached. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b6 11. The same considerations impel a like conclusion here. We recognize, as in <em>Smith, </em>the difficulties of proof that may inhere in meeting the traditional causation standard in malpractice cases, and the potentially harsh outcomes that may result. Such difficulties may, indeed, be uniquely complex and challenging in cases involving suicide, where even under accepted standards of care predictions of suicide are notoriously difficult and compounded by the fact that the patient, unlike other malpractice situations, may be actively working at cross-purposes to the practitioner\u2019s goals. See, e.g., <em>Peoples Bank of Bloomington v. Damera, </em>581 N.E.2d 426, 429 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (noting that unlike typical malpractice case, the suicidal patient may not \u201cshare the goal of his physician of getting better\u201d); <em>Randall v. Benton, </em>802 A.2d 1211, 1215 (N.H. 2002) (affirming judgment for defendant psychologist where plaintiff\u2019s expert testified that defendant\u2019s deviations from standard of care \u201csubstantially contributed to [decedent\u2019s] death by suicide\u201d but \u201cfailed to provide any evidence that [decedent\u2019s] suicide would not have otherwise occurred\u201d); <em>Nieves v. City of N.Y., </em>458 N.Y.S.2d 548, 549 (App. Div. 1983) (concluding that although plaintiff\u2019s expert was able to testify that decedent\u2019s suicide \u201ccould have been\u201d a result of his premature discharge from emergency room and that it was \u201cpossible\u201d decedent would not have committed suicide otherwise, such evidence was insufficient to meet traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>causation standard); see generally P. Coleman <em>&amp; </em>R. Shellow, <em>Suicide: Unpredictable and Unavoidable </em>\u2014 <em>Proposed Guidelines Provide Rational Test for Physician\u2019s Liability, </em>71 Neb. L. Rev. 643, 644-45 (1992) (discussing factors that make suicide difficult for mental health practitioners to predict).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b6 12. Such complexity does not, however, militate in favor of lowering the causation threshold, but rather reinforces <em>Smith\u2019s </em>conclusion that such a departure implicates an array of medical-practice, economic, and social issues better addressed through the legislative process. Nor, in fact, does the traditional causation standard represent an insurmountable barrier to recovery in malpractice claims involving suicide. While plaintiffs\u2019 verdicts in such cases \u2014 as in medical malpractice cases generally \u2014 may be difficult to achieve, they are not uncommon. See, e.g., <em>Bramlette v. Charter-Medical-Columbia, </em>393 S.E.2d 914, 916 (S.C. 1990) (rejecting hospital\u2019s claim that plaintiff had failed to establish \u201cbut for\u201d causation where patient on recreational outing jumped from bridge); <em>Husted v. Echols, </em>919 S.W.2d 43, 45 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995) (holding that it was error to direct verdict for defendant where expert testified that defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to adequately evaluate and treat [decedent] was a direct proximal cause of his death by suicide\u201d); <em>Providence Health Ctr. v. Dowell, </em>167 S.W.3d 48, 53-56 (Tex. App. 2005) (upholding judgment for parents of suicidal patient released from emergency room of hospital who subsequently hanged himself and rejecting claim that plaintiffs had failed to prove but-for causation); see generally P. Kussman, Annotation, <em>Liability of Doctor, Psychiatrist, or Psychologist for Failure to Take Steps to Prevent Patient\u2019s Suicide, </em>81 A.L.R.5th 167, 199-201, 203-04, 216-19 (2000) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b6 13. Nor is it the case, as plaintiff argues, that we have applied a lower causation standard under the guise of the so-called \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s premise \u2014 that a \u201csubstantial factor\u201dmeans something less than but-for cause and therefore may support liability in this case \u2014 is fundamentally mistaken. Although the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 431(a) (1965) employs the phrase \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in its definition of proximate cause, it is widely recognized \u2014 as explained in the comments to the most recent Draft of the Restatement of Torts \u2014 that \u201c[w]ith the sole exception of multiple sufficient causes, \u2018substantial factor\u2019 provides nothing of use in determining whether factual cause exists.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Proposed Final Draft No. 1 \u00a7 26 cmt. j, at 443 (2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the comments to the Draft Restatement (Third) of Torts explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">The essential requirement, recognized in both Torts Restatements, is that the party\u2019s tortious conduct be a necessary condition for the occurrence of the plaintiff\u2019s harm: The harm would not have occurred but for the conduct. To the extent that substantial factor is employed instead of the but-for test, it is undesirably vague. As such it may lure the factfinder into thinking that a substantial factor means something less than but-for cause____Thus, use of substantial factor may unfairly permit proof of causation on less than a showing that the tortious conduct was a but-for cause____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALF\">... [I]ts overuse, abuse, and the confusion generated by it in determining factual causation counsel against its continued employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 443-44; accord D. Robertson, <em>The Common Sense of Cause in Fact, </em>75 Tex. L. Rev. 1765, 1776, 1780 (1997) (\u201cIn the narrowest and only fully legitimate usage, the term [substantial factor] describes a cause-in-fact test that is useful as a substitute for the but-for test in a limited category of cases in which two causes concur to bring about an event, and either cause, operating alone, would have brought about the event absent the other cause____When courts begin turning to the substantial factor vocabulary in a broader range of cases, valuable precision of analysis is lost and nothing is gained.\u201d) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">\u00b6 14. A claim similar to plaintiff\u2019s was recently considered by the Oregon Court of Appeals in <em>Joshi v. Providence Health System of Oregon Corp., </em>108 P.3d 1195 (Or. Ct. App. 2005), where the plaintiff argued that the Oregon courts had abandoned but-for causation in malpractice cases \u201cin favor of a more lenient \u2018substantial factor\u2019\u201d test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1198. The court categorically rejected the claim, explaining: \u201cWhen employed as a standard for determining cause-in-fact, the phrase \u2018substantial factor\u2019 generally does not eliminate the concept of \u2018but-for\u2019 causation. Rather, the substantial factor standard is an alternate description of the cause-in-fact test and requires a showing of \u2018but-for\u2019 causation in all but a few cases.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>see also <em>Viner v. Sweet, </em>70 P.3d 1046, 1051 (Cal. 2003) (noting that the substantial-factor test <em>\u201csubsumes </em>the \u2018but for\u2019 test\u201d and holding that there is nothing distinctive about legal malpractice cases \u201cthat would justify a relaxation of, or departure from, the well-established requirement in negligence cases that the plaintiff establish [but-for] causation\u201d). Like these and other courts, we have occasionally employed the phrase \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in referring to proximate cause, see, e.g., <em>Lorrain v. Ryan, </em>160 Vt. 202, 206-08, 628 A.2d 543, 546-48 (1993); <em>Chater v. Cent. Vt. Hosp., </em>155 Vt. 230, 234-35, 583 A.2d 889, 891 (1990), but we have never abandoned the but-for test of causation or suggested that \u201csubstantial factor\u201d represents anything other than an equivalent formulation of the but-for test. Accordingly, we find no merit to plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b6 15. Finally, plaintiff contends the trial court erred in ruling that the medical malpractice statute, 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1908, applies here, and that expert testimony was required to establish the proximate-cause element set forth in \u00a7 1908(3). As to the first part of the claim, plaintiff asserts that the mental health worker who evaluated decedent does not fit within the category of hospital \u201cpersonnel\u201d covered by \u00a7 1908 because the evaluator was an employee of Lamoille County Mental Health under contract with Copley Hospital rather than a hospital employee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s claim is contained in a footnote in her opening brief, and is not sufficiently briefed or argued to warrant consideration on appeal. See <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>158 Vt. 160, 164 n.*, 605 A.2d 857, 859 n.* (1992) (Court will not consider claims so inadequately briefed as to fail to meet standards of V.R.A.P. 28(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b6 16. Nevertheless, even assuming, without deciding, that \u00a7 1908 does not apply, it is of no consequence. The malpractice statute, as we have previously noted, merely codifies longstanding common-law principles relating to causation in negligence law, and therefore adds nothing substantive to the causal requirements of plaintiff\u2019s case. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Smith, </em>2003 VT 64, \u00b6 11 (noting that the malpractice statute \u201cessentially codifies the common law elements of a medical malpractice action\u201d) (citation omitted). Plaintiff\u2019s case rests squarely on the allegation expressed in her complaint that defendant\u2019s negligence \u201cin treating [decedent\u2019s] suicidal condition\u201d proximately caused her death. We have repeatedly held that the standard-of-care and causation elements of professional negligence claims \u201c [o]rdinarily ... must be proved by expert testimony,\u201d <em>Jones v. Block, </em>171 Vt. 569, 569, 762 A.2d 846, 848 (2000) (mem.), and this is no less true of claims relating to the negligent treatment or assessment of patients at risk of committing suicide. See, e.g., <em>Dimitrijevic v. Chi. Wesley Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>236 N.E.2d 309, 313 (Ill. App. Ct. 1968) (whether defendants were negligent \u201cin not characterizing decedent as a suicidal risk falls within the general rule requiring the affirmative testimony of experts\u201d); <em>Kanter v. Metro. Med. Ctr., </em>384 N.W.2d 914, 916 (Minn. Ct. App. 1986) (because \u201cpotential tendencies of patients suffering from mental illness\u201d are not easily determined \u201cwithout special training and knowledge,\u201d court did not abuse discretion in requiring expert testimony to establish nurse\u2019s alleged negligent care of patient who committed suicide); <em>Moats v. Preston County Comm\u2019n, </em>521 S.E.2d 180, 188 (W. Va. 1999) (determining whether mental health center\u2019s negligence caused suicide \u201cinvolves complicated medical issues, specifically, the manner and method of protecting someone who is suicidal,\u201d that are not within knowledge of lay jurors); see also <em>Estate of Joshua T. v. State, </em>840 A.2d 768, 772 (N.H. 2003) (holding that because \u201c[s]uicide is not easily explained or understood\u201d and \u201c[i]ts causes, prevention, triggers and warning signs cannot be readily calculated,\u201d expert testimony is required to establish causal link between suicide and alleged negligence in placing decedent in foster home).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b6 17. Plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendant deviated from the standard of care by prematurely evaluating decedent while she was still feeling the effects of the overdose; failing to conduct a sufficient suicide-risk evaluation, including the risk posed by firearms; failing to require a written safety contract; and failing to schedule follow-up appointments, together with the claim that such conduct was the proximate cause of decedent\u2019s suicide, all involve complex psychiatric/medical issues relating to the causes, warning signs, and prevention of suicide. These are plainly not issues within a lay juror\u2019s common knowledge and experience. See <em>Estate of Fleming v. Nicholson, </em>168 Vt. 495, 497-98, 724 A.2d 1026, 1028 (1998) (expert testimony not required \u201c[w]here a professional\u2019s lack of care is so apparent that only common knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>and experience are needed to comprehend it\u201d). Accordingly, we find no error in the court\u2019s ruling that expert testimony was required under traditional common-law principles, and thus no basis to disturb the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\"> The complaint also named Copley Hospital, Inc. as a defendant, alleging violations of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (2005), but plaintiff settled with the hospital and dismissed the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\"> Plaintiff also contends in this regard that the trial court erroneously \u201cexcluded\u201d Dr. Ellenbrook\u2019s testimony, but the court merely stated that the testimony was so deficient in \u201csubstance\u201d and \u201cbasis\u201d that \u201cit would not be admissible under Vermont Rule of Evidence 702.\u201d The court did not, however, actually rule the opinion inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-12\"> The classic illustration of \u201cmultiple sufficient\u201d or \u201cindependent concurring\u2019\u2019 causes involves a situation where two separate fires (only one of which was caused by the defendant) join together to damage property, and either of which was sufficient to cause the harm, but it is impossible to determine which actually did so.

In such a case, \u201cthe substantial-factor test can be useful because it substitutes for the but-for test in a situation in which the but-for test fails to accomplish what the law demands.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts, Proposed Final Draft No. 1 \u00a7 26 cmt. j, at 444.
