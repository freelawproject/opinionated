Mack Molding, Inc. appeals from the Commissioner of Labor and Industry\u2019s decision that it is responsible for paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits for its former employee, claimant Ramiz Cehic. The Commissioner, after a contested hearing, concluded that a 1998 injury claimant incurred while employed at Mack Molding, rather than a more recent 2001 lifting incident at a subsequent employer, Pike Industries, was responsible for claimant\u2019s continued impairment and need for back surgery in 2002. On appeal, Mack Molding argues that the Commissioner erred in considering the later lifting incident as a temporary flare-up of a preexisting condition, instead of analyzing the incident as an \u201caggravation\u201d of a preexisting injury, for which the latest employer would be responsible, or a \u201crecurrence\u201d of an old injury, for which Mack Molding would remain liable. Alternatively, Mack Molding argues that this Court should abandon the current aggravation-or-recurrence analysis and, instead, adopt a bright-line rule that the employer at the time of the last injurious exposure is always liable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">\u00b6 2. Claimant was employed by Mack Molding in 1998 when he injured his back in a lifting incident, suffering a herniated disc in his spine, an injured facet joint, and strained lower lumbar muscles. In 1999, as a result of the injury, claimant had surgery on his spine, which removed part of the facet joint and large amounts of disc material. After the surgery, claimant continued to experience pain, worked part-time for a while, and was gradually released by his doctor to work full-time, but with lifting restrictions. In May 2000, while his workers\u2019 compensation claim against Mack Molding was still under adjustment, claimant began work at Pike Industries, a New Hampshire employer. In November 2000, Mack Molding sent claimant to an orthopedic surgeon, who determined that claimant had reached a medical end result for the 1998 injury, with persistent back and leg pain and a permanent disability amounting to a ten-percent impairment of the whole person.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">\u00b6 3. Eight months later, on July 31, 2001, after lifting a pipe at Pike Industries, claimant experienced back pain and leg numbness and sought medical treatment. Claimant missed some time from work, engaged in physical therapy, and returned to full-time work by September or October of 2001. Claimant was laid off from Pike Industries on January 4, 2002. Shortly thereafter, claimant underwent a surgical fusion of his lower lumbar vertebrae. Claimant first filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the New Hampshire Department of Labor, which determined that Pike Industries was not responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">\u00b6 4. Claimant next filed for workers\u2019 compensation in Vermont against Mack Molding. Mack Molding denied coverage, contending that it was not answerable for the pipe-lifting episode at Pike, since it was not a recurrence of the Mack Molding injury, but an aggravation of that injury while in Pike\u2019s employ. At the time of the hearing in 2004, claimant had not resumed employment. After a contested hearing, the Commissioner concluded that the back pain and numbness incurred in July 2001 at Pike was a \u201cflareup\u201d for which Mack Molding was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>responsible. The Commissioner determined the flare-up prompted claimant to seek <em>medical treatment, </em>but did not alter claimant\u2019s underlying condition remaining from his earlier accident at Mack Molding. The Commissioner further determined, however, that once claimant\u2019s condition returned to his pre-Pikeinjury \u201cbaseline\u201d in late September or October 2001, Mack Molding continued to be liable for benefits due on account of claimant\u2019s underlying condition. See <em>Pacher v. Fairdale Farms, </em>166 Vt. 626, 629, 699 A.2d 43, 47 (1997) (mem.) (describing \u201cbaseline\u201d as achieved when a claimant reaches the condition he or she was in prior to the subsequent, distinct injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">\u00b6 5. The Commissioner based his conclusion on opinions from three medical experts, including one hired by Mack Molding, that the Pike incident changed nothing in claimant\u2019s underlying condition from his earlier injury at Mack Molding. Two of the experts related the need for fusion surgery to the earlier Mack Molding injury. Two of the experts opined that claimant returned to his prePike-injury baseline four months before the 2002 surgery. That claimant\u2019s condition never stabilized after the earlier injury was further supported by medical indications that he still had pain and could work only with lifting restrictions. Notwithstanding an opinion to the contrary from a fourth medical expert, whose opinion was not supported by the MRI, the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion was amply supported by the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\u00b6 6. Our review in a direct appeal from a decision by the Commissioner of Labor and Industry is limited to questions of law certified by the Commissioner. 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 672. We are bound by the Commissioner\u2019s findings so long as they are supported by the evidence. <em>Wroten v. Lamphere, </em>147 Vt. 606, 611, 523 A.2d 1236, 1239 (1987). The sufficiency of the findings are considered from a point of view favorable to the award. <em>Coburn v. Frank Dodge &amp; Sons, </em>165 Vt. 529, 533, 687 A.2d 465, 467 (1996). \u201c[W]e will overrule only where those findings have no evidentiary support in the record or where the decision is based on \u2018evidence so slight as to be an irrational basis for the result reached.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 687 A.2d at 467-68 (quoting <em>Kenney v. Rockingham Sch. Dist., </em>123 Vt. 344, 348, 190 A.2d 702, 705 (1963)). Where the Commissioner\u2019s conclusions are \u201crationally derived from the findings and based on a correct interpretation of the law,\u201d we will affirm. <em>Pacher, </em>166 Vt. at 627, 699 A.2d at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\u00b6 7. The question certified by the Commissioner was whether \u201ca lifting incident at Pike Industries in 2001 or an injury at Mack Molding in 1998 [was] responsible for claimant\u2019s current condition, his January 2002 surgery and lost time from work.\u201d Mack Molding argues that application of the traditional aggravation-or-recurrence analysis would conclusively result in a determination that claimant\u2019s current condition and need for surgery in 2002 resulted from an aggravation at Pike of his preexisting condition. We disagree with Mack Molding\u2019s contention that the aggravation-or-recurrence standard was the only applicable theory of liability for categorizing the Pike lifting injury, or that the Commissioner erred by relying on another theory, which was supported by the evidence, in analyzing that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\u00b6 8. We have stated that where a dispute concerns a compensation claim involving successive employers and successive injuries, liability will remain with the first employer if the second injury is a recurrence of the first. <em>Farris v. Byrant Grinder Corp., </em>2005 VT 5, \u00b6 4, 177 Vt. 456, 869 A.2d 131. \u201cIf, however, the second incident aggravated, accelerated, or combined with a preexisting impairment or injury to produce a disability greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>than would have resulted from the second injury alone, the second incident is an \u2018aggravation,\u2019 and the second employer becomes solely responsible for the entire disability at that point.\u201d <em>Pacher, </em>166 Vt. at 627-28, 699 A.2d at 46. We have also observed, as in <em>Pacher, </em>that at least a third option exists where an incident is neither an aggravation nor a recurrence but causes \u201ca new injury distinct from claimant\u2019s prior injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628, 699 A.2d at 46. The Commissioner, relying on <em>Pacher, </em>determined that the injury claimant incurred at Pike fell within this third option as \u201ca so-called flare-up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">\u00b6 9. The Commissioner\u2019s melding of a distinctly new injury and condition, as discussed in <em>Pacher, </em>with a flare-up may lend more confusion than clarity to the issue. <em>Pacher </em>acknowledged that just because a claimant incurs a subsequent injury does not mandate a finding that the injury is either a recurrence or an aggravation; alternatively, a subsequent incident may be an entirely new injury. See <em>Pacher, </em>166 Vt. at 628, 699 A.2d at 46-47 (upholding the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that a later injury during subsequent employment to right lower back was new and distinct from earlier injury, from prior employment, to left lower back and left leg). \u201cFlare-up\u201d most appropriately connotes a temporary worsening of a preexisting disability caused by a new trauma for which the new \u201cemployer is responsible for paying compensation benefits until the worker\u2019s condition returns to the baseline, and not thereafter.\u201d See <em>Wood v. Fletcher Allen Health Care, </em>169 Vt. 419, 424, 739 A.2d 1201, 1206 (1999) (summarizing the Commissioner\u2019s use of the temporary flare-up doctrine, but finding it inapplicable to the facts of the case). Regardless of the terms employed, the crux of the Commissioner\u2019s inquiry in the instant case was whether there was a distinction between the two incidents and their respective effects on claimant\u2019s overall condition so as to fairly apportion liability between the successive employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\u00b6 10. The temporary flare-up doctrine, like the aggravation-or-recurrence analysis, rationally serves the Commissioner\u2019s obligation to determine, if possible, the relative liability of multiple employers for different and distinct injuries to a worker. See <em>Pacher, </em>166 Vt. at 629 n.2, 699 A.2d at 47 n.2 (noting Commissioner\u2019s ability to fairly define and apportion liability of different employers where different accidents produce distinct injuries and obligation to do so pursuant to 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 662(c)); see also <em>Stannard v. Stannard Co., </em>2003 VT 52, \u00b6 11, 175 Vt. 549, 830 A.2d 66 (mem.) (\u201cAs <em>Pacher </em>established, in workers\u2019 compensation cases involving successive injuries, the employer/carrier at the time of the first injury remains liable unless the medical evidence establishes that the second injury \u2018causally contribute[d] to the claimant\u2019s disability.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Pacher, </em>166 Vt. at 627, 699 A.2d at 46)). \u201cMere continuation or even exacerbation of symptoms, without a worsening of the underlying disability, does not meet the causation requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The flare-up rule is not, as urged by Mack Molding, inconsistent with either theory of aggravation or recurrence. In a flare-up, the finding of a distinct new injury, as here, precludes a conclusion that the injury is a recurrence; and, while that new injury temporarily worsens a preexisting condition, the finding of a return to baseline, as here, precludes a conclusion of aggravation because the injury, once resolved, did not \u201ccausally contribute\u201d to any increased disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\u00b6 11. The Commissioner\u2019s expression of the analysis may be inexact, but we find no error in its application here. Nor do we find unsupported the Commissioner\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Mack Molding was not responsible for lost work or medical treatment associated with the 2001 back strain suffered at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Pike, but was responsible for claimant\u2019s underlying condition incurred at Mack Molding, which continued, unchanged and unstable, before and after the Pike incident. Although the Commissioner\u2019s findings do not indicate that the fusion surgery was specifically prescribed prior to the Pike incident, the opinions of three medical experts support the conclusion that it was the same underlying condition that claimant had prior to the Pike incident that led to the need for the spinal fusion, not the temporary back strain claimant experienced from the Pike injury-</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">\u00b6 12. Mack Molding argues that other facts in the record favor a finding of aggravation, but it is not our role to weigh the evidence in the record. Mack Molding was free to seek a new trial on the facts in the superior court and declined to do so. As we previously observed in <em>Kenney v. Rockingham School District, </em>in denying the employer\u2019s motion for reargument, \u201c[i]f the weight of the evidence seems to a defendant to preponderate in his favor, and the commissioner has decided against him, the defendant\u2019s remedy is by appeal to county court pursuant to 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 670.\u201d 123 Vt. at 348, 190 A.2d at 705. In this direct appeal limited to questions of law, we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by evidence, despite some evidence to the contrary, and therefore are not clearly <em>erroneous. </em>See <em>Stannard, </em>2003 VT 52, \u00b6 13 (refusing to find error despite some evidence that cut against trial court\u2019s findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\u00b6 13. Finally, Mack Molding argues that we should abandon aggravation-orrecurrenee analysis in Vermont, together with its flare-up cousin, in favor of the last-injurious-exposure rule to limit liability of a previous employer when a former employee is reinjured while working for a later employer. Mack Molding argues that the aggravation and recurrence standards yield inconsistent, unpredictable, and unfair results, citing more than thirty decisions by the Commissioner with divergent results that are not subject to review in this appeal. Mack Molding contends that the last-injurious-exposure rule is warranted in cases involving complex issues of causation and multiple employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">\u00b6 14. As an initial matter, it does not appear from the record provided that Mack Molding requested that the Commissioner apply the last-injurious-exposure rule in this case. Instead, Mack Molding submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law urging a finding of aggravation. We need not address the propriety of Mack Molding\u2019s request that this Court adopt a determinative rule of law where it declined to give the Commissioner the opportunity to consider the matter in the first instance. Even if raised below, the last-injurious-exposure rule would not apply, given the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\u00b6 15. We have previously recognized that the last-injurious-exposure rule may be appropriate <em>\u201conly </em>whei'e separate injuries all causally contribute to the total disability so that it becomes difficult or impossible to allocate liability among several potentially liable employers.\u201d <em>Pacher, </em>166 Vt. at 628 n.2, 699 A.2d at 47 n.2 (emphasis supplied). Although the evidence here may have been conflicting and complex, this is not a case where the Commissioner was unable to find what incident caused claimant\u2019s condition. Here it was determined from the medical evidence that the Pike lifting incident did not contribute to the disability that required the 2002 surgery. See 9 A. Larson et al., Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 153.02[7][a], at 153-18 (2004) (\u201cIt goes without saying that, before the last-injurious-exposure rule can be applied, there must have been <em>some </em>exposure of a kind <em>contributing to the condition.\u201d </em>(second emphasis supplied)).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>\u00b6 16. To the extent that Mack Molding wants to remove the element of causation in determining multiple employer liability \u2014 in the interest of avoiding litigation in cases involving complex and conflicting medical evidence \u2014 these are public policy concerns best brought to the attention of the Legislature, or possibly to the regulatory authority of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u00b6 17. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision ordering Mack Molding to adjust the claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
