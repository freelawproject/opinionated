Specially Assigned. Martina Kurrelmeyer appeals an order of the Chittenden Superior Court declaring void, as a matter of law, the revocable inter vivos trust she created under her husband\u2019s durable power of attorney prior to his death. Mr. Kurrelmeyer\u2019s surviving children claimed the power of attorney did not grant authority to create a trust and that transfer of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Kurrelmeyer\u2019s property to the trust constituted unauthorized self-dealing and a breach of Martina Kurrelmeyer\u2019s fiduciary duty as her husband\u2019s agent. We reverse the superior court\u2019s determination that the trust is void as a matter of law, and remand for further proceedings to determine whether Martina Kurrelmeyer\u2019s actions breached her fiduciary duty of loyalty as her husband\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b6 2. The undisputed facts are summarized as follows. In 1996, Louis Kurrelmeyer executed two durable general powers of attorney to appoint his wife, Martina Kurrelmeyer, and his daughter, Nancy Kurrelmeyer, as attorneys-in-fact. Louis Kurrelmeyer was competent at the time he executed the powers of attorney. In December of 2000, Martina, pursuant to her powers under the durable power of attorney, executed a document establishing the \u201cLouis H. Kurrelmeyer Living Trust,\u201d with herself and Nancy as co-trustees. Days after she created the trust, Martina transferred certain real estate owned by her husband, the \u201cClearwater\u201d property, to herself and Nancy as co-trustees of the trust. At the time of the creation of the living trust and the transfer of the Clearwater property, Louis Kurrelmeyer was no longer competent. Mr. Kurrelmeyer died testate a year later, and Martina was appointed executrix of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b6 3. Louis Kurrelmeyer\u2019s last will and testament, executed in 1980, contained a specific provision for the Clearwater property. Under the will, Martina would take a life estate in the property, with responsibility for taxes and upkeep, and upon her death the property would pass to Mr. Kurrelmeyer\u2019s surviving children as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. In contrast, the terms of the trust provide Martina additional rights with regard to the property. Under the terms of the trust, Martina may occupy the home as long as she wishes and the trust is permitted to pay the expenses on the property should she fail to do so. The trustees would be required, however, on Martina\u2019s unilateral request, to sell the home, with the sale proceeds to be used either to purchase another home for Martina or, alternatively, to be added to the trust principal. Additionally, the trust provides that all income from the trust property would be paid to Martina, as well as so much of the principal as the trustees deem necessary and proper for her support.. Upon Martina\u2019s death, the trust principal would be distributed to Louis\u2019s children, if they survived him, with any deceased child\u2019s share to be distributed to that child\u2019s descendants or held in trust until such descendants reached the age of twenty-five. The trust. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>requires that there be at least one other trustee serving so long as Martina is serving as a co-trustee, and the co-trustees must act by mutual agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b6 4. During the probate administration of Louis Kurrelmeyer\u2019s estate, his son, Louis Kurrelmeyer Jr., objected to the exclusion of the Clearwater property from the inventory completed by Martina Kurrelmeyer. Claiming that Martina exceeded her authority in creating the trust, Louis Jr. asked the probate court to set aside the trust and include the Clearwater property in the probate estate to be distributed in accordance with Mr. Kurrelmeyer\u2019s will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The probate court upheld the trust, and the children appealed to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b6 5. Martina Kurrelmeyer moved for summary judgment, arguing the creation of the trust and transfer of the Clearwater property to the trust were authorized under the broad authority granted to her by the durable power of attorney. The children moved for a judgment in their favor, arguing that the power of attorney did not authorize creation of a revocable trust, that the transfer of the Clearwater property to the trust was a breach of Martina\u2019s fiduciary duty because it constituted self-dealing, and that the transfer violated the gift-giving proscription of the power of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b6 6. The superior court reversed the probate court\u2019s order. Granting summary judgment for the children, the superior court concluded that the power of attorney did not authorize Martina to create a trust. The court found the power of attorney ambiguous on the trust issue, and narrowly construed the language to authorize only maintenance of, and additions to, trusts already existing when the power of attorney came into being. The superior court also opined that, because the appointment of Martina as attorney-in-fact did not authorize her to make a will on behalf of the principal, she was without authority to convey his property in trust in a manner that would \u201calter\u201d his existing will. Martina appealed, complaining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the superior court erred in applying a strict construction analysis rather than recognizing Mr. Kurrelmeyer\u2019s intention to make Martina his attorney-in-fact for general purposes, including trust creation, as is evident, she argues, from the plain language of the power of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b6 7. On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the trial court. <em>Wesco, Inc. v. Sorrell, </em>2004 VT 102, \u00b6 9, 177 Vt. 287, 865 A.2d 350. Summary judgment is appropriate where the undisputed facts demonstrate either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. V.R.C.P. 56(c)(3). Where the parties agree there are no contested issues of fact, the question of whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo. <em>Bacon v. Lascelles, </em>165 Vt. 214, 218, 678 A.2d 902, 905 (1996). Our review of questions of law is nondeferential and plenary. Wesco, <em>Inc., </em>2004 VT 102, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b6 8. We first address Martina\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the power of attorney did not authorize her to create a trust on Louis Kurrelmeyer\u2019s behalf. We disagree with the superior court\u2019s characterization of the power of attorney as ambiguous, and find that the express language of the power of attorney authorized the attorney-in-fact to create a trust. The trial court invoked a doctrine of strict construction, relied upon in some jurisdictions, to seemingly resolve any arguable ambiguity against the attorney-in-fact claiming delegation. See <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>492 A.2d 608, 611 (Md. 1985) (observing that \u201cone well settled rule is that powers of attorney are strictly construed as a general rule and [are] held to grant only those powers which are clearly delineated\u201d (internal quotations omitted) (alteration in original)). We are not persuaded that strict construction, rather than a construction to effect the principal\u2019s intent, is a preferred method of determining the scope of a power of attorney. See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 34 cmt. h (1958) (noting that while it is often stated that formal instruments denoting an agent\u2019s authority should be strictly construed, \u201c[t]here should be neither a \u2018strict\u2019 nor a \u2018liberal\u2019 interpretation, but a fair construction which carries out the intent as expressed\u201d). Determining the principal\u2019s intent is acknowledged as <em>the </em>primary objective, even in strict construction jurisdictions: \u201cAlthough our predecessors recognized this rule [of strict construction] over a century ago ... they were careful to note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the rule of strict construction \u2018cannot override the general and cardinal rule\u2019 that the court determine the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>King, </em>492 A.2d at 611 (citation omitted). Accordingly, we will not apply a rule of narrow construction to particular words and phrases used in the power of attorney, but will examine the express terms and the context of the instrument as a whole to give effect to the principal\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b6 9. This approach is consistent with our analysis in <em>Schall v. Gilbert, </em>169 Vt. 627, 741 A.2d 286 (1999) (mem.), in which we examined whether the scope of a power of attorney was limited, or \u201cspecial,\u201d as opposed to broad, or \u201cgeneral\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">A power of attorney is a written authorization used to evidence an agent\u2019s authority to act on behalf of another person. It is often characterized as general or special. The more specific a power of attorney is concerning performance of individual acts, the more the agent is restricted from executing acts beyond the specific authority granted. Further, the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 3 cmt. a (1958) states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">In determining whether an agent is a general agent or a special agent, the number of acts to be performed in accomplishing an authorized result, the number of people to be dealt with, and the length of time needed to accomplish the result are the important considerations. Continuity of service rather than the extent of discretion or responsibility is the hallmark of the general agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 630, 741 A.2d at 289 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\u00b6 10. To determine whether the power of attorney authorized Martina to create a trust, we look to Mr. Kurrelmeyer\u2019s \u201cwritten authorization,\u201d entitled \u201cDurable General Power of Attorney.\u201d As its title suggests, this power of attorney is indeed \u201cgeneral\u201d and quite broad. The power of attorney was to survive, and be unaffected by, the principal\u2019s subsequent disability or incompetence. It authorizes Martina, as attorney-in-fact, to act in the principal\u2019s name \u201cin any way which I myself could do, if I were personally present, with respect to the following matters to the extent that I am permitted by law to act through an agent.\u201d Among the delineated powers, the first subsection authorizes the agent \u201c[t]o add all of my assets deemed appropriate by my said attorney to any trust of which I am the Donor\u201d by transferring in trust a variety of types of property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>including stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and \u201cother assets or property of any kind\u201d owned by the principal. The subsection immediately following provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">In <em>addition, </em>I authorize my said attorney to: (i) <em>execute and deliver any assignments, stock powers, deeds or trust instruments-, </em>(ii) sign my name to any instrument pertaining to or required in connection with the transfer of my property; (iii) give full receipts and discharges; (iv) re-register the title to stock certificates, bonds, notes, bills and other securities; (v) change the name on bank, brokerage and commodity accounts; (vi) withdraw any or all funds standing in my name in any bank; (vii) endorse and deliver any checks, drafts, certificates of deposit, notes or other instruments for the payment of money payable or belonging to me; (viii) change life insurance beneficiaries ... (ix) elect lump sum or optional settlements of life insurance... and annuity proceeds and proceeds from a qualified plan or an individual retirement account; (x) convey any real estate, interest in real estate, any mortgages and notes or any beneficial interest in real estate which I may own or have any interest in; and (xi) record deeds of conveyance in the appropriate land records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">(emphasis supplied). The text continues, authorizing the attorney-in-fact to examine and obtain copies of the principal\u2019s will. The attorney is authorized to \u201cmake gifts to members of my family (other than himself or herself) whom my said attorney has reason to believe I would have wished to benefit, but my said attorney shall not give any more than $10,000.00 per year to any one donee.\u201d Among other powers, the attorney-in-fact is also granted unrestricted access to, and an unrestricted right to remove, the contents from \u201cany and all warehouses, safe deposit boxes, drawers, and vaults\u201d owned in the principal\u2019s name alone and in common with others. The attorney-in-fact is authorized to disclaim interests in property on behalf of the principal, to convey title to his motor vehicles, to \u201cconvey any and all real estate owned by [the principal] to any person or entity,\u201d and, finally, the attorney-in-fact is authorized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">[t]o do and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever necessary to be done in the premises, as fully to all intents and purposes as I might or could do if personally present, with full power of substitution and revocation, hereby ratify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ing and confirming all that my said attorney may do pursuant to this power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b6 11. We conclude that the express terms of the power of attorney unambiguously grant the attorney-in-fact the authority to create a trust and to add assets to a trust to accomplish estate planning objectives. The first subsection, empowering the attorney to add any and all assets to a trust of which he is the donor, does refer to a trust already in existence, but does not suggest lack of authority to create a new trust when considered together with the second subsection \u2014 granting the power \u201cto execute and deliver ... trust instruments\u201d expressly in <em>addition </em>to adding assets to existing trusts. The phrase \u201ctrust instrument\u201d is commonly understood to refer to the document that brings the trust into existence. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 437 (8th ed. 2004) (defining a \u201cdeclaration of trust\u201d in part as \u201cthe instrument that creates a trust,\u201d also termed \u201ctrust instrument\u201d). Just as a subsequent provision authorizes the attorney-in-fact to \u201cexecut[e] ... deeds\u201d and \u201ceasements,\u201d which we commonly read to include granting and conveying lands and creating rights of way, so too may the attorney-in-fact create a trust under the provision authorizing the attorney to \u201cexecute ... trust instruments.\u201d Where a power is broadly drawn to include the authority to transact all business on behalf of the principal and delineates a variety of general acts, each particular task within the grant of authority need not be spelled out in exacting detail. <em>Schall, </em>169 Vt. at 630, 741 A.2d at 289 (holding that authority to withdraw certificates of deposit at a particular bank need not be expressly delineated where power of attorney entrusted agent to make real estate decisions, enter contracts, and draw funds against principal\u2019s account). Given the express language granting the authority to execute trust instruments, particularly in the context of the breadth of the attorney\u2019s other express powers, including, ultimately, her authority to fully substitute herself for the principal to do all things \u201cwhatsoever necessary ... to all intents and purposes\u201d as the principal \u201cmight or could do if personally present,\u201d we find that the agent\u2019s authority under this power of attorney includes the authority to create a trust on the principal\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b6 12. Alternatively, the children argue that, even if the principal intended to authorize the attorney-in-fact to create a trust, the power to create a trust is personal to the settlor and nondelegable as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>a matter of law. We agree that certain acts may require personal performance as a matter of public policy, statutory law, or under the terms of an agreement. See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 17 cmt. b (\u201cDuties or privileges created by statute may be imposed or conferred upon a person to be performed or exercised personally only____The making of affidavits as to knowledge and the execution of wills are illustrations of acts commonly required by statute to be done personally.\u201d); see also 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 3504(b) (prohibiting the use of a power of attorney to authorize the agent to perform certain acts, such as making health care decisions or executing, amending, or revoking a will for the principal).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not agree, however, that delegation of authority to create a trust through a durable general power of attorney to serve the interests of the principal violates public policy as a matter of law, even when a trust\u2019s dispositive terms may serve a function similar to that of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b6 13. The use of a revocable living trust serves a number of legitimate purposes. Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 25 cmt. a (2003). For example, revocable trusts are widely used in estate planning and asset management as a means to avoid the costs and delays associated with probate administration, as a means to provide property management for settlors late in life by establishing trustees and successor trustees to assume continuing responsibility, and as a means to maintain privacy and flexibility in the management of assets beyond the life of the settlor. <em>Id., </em>see also <em>id. </em>ch. 6, introductory note (\u201c[W]ith its flexibility and its highly developed, prototypical, default body of ready-made fiduciary principles, the trust device is widely used in a broad variety of arrangements serving diverse purposes.\u201d). Revocable trusts allow the settlor to retain the ability to use the assets for support during lifetime, provide for ongoing asset management, and preserve the estate for the settlor\u2019s intended beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b6 14. The fact that the trust here was created by an agent does not affect its legitimacy. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11(5) (\u201cUnder some circumstances, an agent under a durable power of attorney or the legal representative of a property owner who is under disability may create a trust on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>behalf of the property owner.\u201d); see also <em>id. </em>cmt. f (noting that despite restrictions against making a will for an incompetent person, it is proper for a principal to authorize an agent to create or modify a revocable inter vivos trust \u201cto serve purposes that are financially advantageous to the estate, such as probate avoidance and managerial efficiency\u201d). The children fail to demonstrate any sufficiently countervailing evil to compel this Court to declare such powers of attorney contrary to public policy and void as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b6 15. We find unpersuasive and inapposite the cases cited by th\u00e9 children in support of their position that the power to create a trust is nondelegable. The courts in those cases found that the powers of attorney did not expressly authorize the agent to create a trust,which, as we hold above in Section I, is not the case with this power of attorney. See <em>Stafford v. Crane, </em>241 F. Supp. 2d 1239, 1246-47 (D. Kan. 2002) (holding that trust was void where durable power of attorney did not specifically authorize attorney-in-fact to create a trust), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>382 F.3d 1175, 1183-84 &amp; n.2 (10th Cir. 2004) (observing that \u201c[t]he general weight of authority suggests that the power to create, modify, or revoke a trust is personal and non-delegable to an attorney-in-fact unless expressly granted in the power-of-attorney\u201d and noting several states\u2019 codification of that rule); <em>Kotsch v. Kotsch, </em>608 So. 2d 879, 880 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992) (holding that power of attorney did not authorize creation of trust to dispose of principal\u2019s property); <em>In re Jameison, </em>2000 MT 190, \u00b6 21, 8 P.3d 83 (\u201cThe Power of Attorney does not specifically grant the authority to create a trust, reflect [the principal\u2019s] intent to create a trust, or even mention a trust.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b6 16. For the same reason that trusts can be beneficial to an estate, we are not persuaded on the current record that this trust is necessarily an invalid usurpation of the principal\u2019s last will and testament. The trial court was concerned that, by conveying Clearwater to the trust, Martina did \u201cindirect!y what she [could] not do directly,\u201d that is, alter the will by depriving the children of their expected inheritance of Clearwater\u2019s appreciation. When the principal expressly granted his attorney-in-fact the power to convey realty from his estate, he must have anticipated that the terms of his will might be so altered. It is not clear, then, why conveyance of Clearwater to a trust would be a per se impermissible alteration of the will, when the power of attorney expressly authorized Martina to convey any real estate outright to others. Therefore, these additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>arguments do not persuade us that the trust must be rendered void as a matter of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b6 17. The question of whether Martina\u2019s actions breached her fiduciary duties remains. Even though we conclude that Martina had authority from her principal to create a trust on his behalf, her authority to act under that power was not limitless. A fiduciary duty of loyalty is implied in every agency as a matter of law. See <em>John A. Westlund, Inc. v. O\u2019Bryan Constr. Co., </em>123 Vt. 301, 308, 187 A.2d 507, 512-13 (1963) (\u201cEvery agency is subject to the legal limitation that it cannot be used for the benefit of the agent himself, or of any person <em>other than the principal, </em>in the absence of an agreement that it may be so used.\u201d (emphasis supplied)). The attorney-in-fact was prohibited from making gifts to herself by the express language of the power of attorney and was also prohibited from using the agency for her own benefit or the benefit of others except as authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b6 18. The children complained below that Martina\u2019s conveyance of the Clearwater property to the trust provided no benefit to Louis Kurrelmeyer, served no apparent tax or estate planning purpose, and was prohibited by the gifting provision of the power of attorney as well as by Martina\u2019s fiduciary duty of loyalty to her principal. Martina argued, in response, that the trust and conveyance were justified by generally recognized and prudent tax and estate planning objectives, that the conveyance of Clearwater to the trust could not, as a matter of law, constitute a gift prohibited by the power of attorney, and that the co-trustee approval requirement was a safeguard against any self-dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u00b6 19. Concluding, erroneously, that creating any new trust was void as beyond the authority of the attorney-in-fact, the superior court did not reach the additional question of whether the trust and conveyance were valid, as claimed by Martina, or a breach of fiduciary duty as claimed by the children. The court recognized general proscriptions against self-dealing by attorneys-in-fact and trustees, but did not address the parties\u2019 particular factual or legal claims on this topic. Despite recitations in their cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties do not appear to agree upon facts material either to Martina\u2019s contention that the dispositive terms of the trust and the conveyance of the Clearwater property were justified as prudent estate planning or to the children\u2019s contentions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>that the terms of the trust and the transfer of property were unauthorized self-dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b6 20. Therefore, we remand the case to the superior court for further proceedings to consider whether there was a breach of a fiduciary duty on the part of Martina Kurrelmeyer, as agent, in light of all the relevant circumstances at the time the trust was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for farther proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> At the time of his death, Louis Kurrelmeyer had three surviving children \u2014 Louis Jr., Nancy, and Ellen. Nancy subsequently passed away, and Ellen became executrix of Nancy\u2019s estate. Additionally, the trust designates Ellen as Nancy\u2019s successor co-trustee. Because of this role, Ellen took no position in the probate court on the validity of the trust, but sought clarification of the title to the Clearwater property and questioned how the conveyance of the property affected Martina\u2019s homestead interest. For the sake of simplicity, and because counsel for Louis Jr., Ellen, and Nancy\u2019s Estate have represented the children\u2019s interests as aligned in this appeal, as well as in the appeal to the superior court, we refer to appellees collectively as \u201cthe children.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\"> Vermont\u2019s Powers of Attorney Act, 14 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3501-3516, was enacted subsequent to the execution of the relevant documents in this case. 2001, No. 135 (Adj.
