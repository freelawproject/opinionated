We shall hold that under the circumstances in this case it does not and reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Stacey Williams was beaten on November 10, 1993, by a group of six young men. Within a few hours, Williams died from his injuries. Following a preliminary investigation, the police arrested Anthony Bell. In a written statement to police, Bell implicated himself, Jacquin Vanlandingham, and Kevin Domonic Gray, the Petitioner, as participants in the beating. Vanlandingham was fatally shot two days after Williams\u2019 death,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Gray was arrested one day later. These three individuals were the only ones identified by name in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Bell\u2019s statement to police as those involved in the murder, although evidence adduced at trial suggested that as many as six persons participated in the attack on Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Bell and Gray were scheduled to be tried jointly in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Prior to trial, however, Gray moved to sever his trial from Bell\u2019s, or alternatively to exclude his confession from evidence. The trial court denied both motions but ordered the redaction of Gray and Vanlandingham\u2019s names from Bell\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">At trial, the State presented the testimony of Tracy Brumfield, Shay Yarberough, and Baltimore City Homicide Detective Homer Pennington. Brumfield testified that she saw Gray, Vanlandingham, and several others chase Williams down the street. Yarberough, the only witness to Williams\u2019 beating, testified that he saw Vanlandingham lift Williams over his head and drop him on the sidewalk. Yarberough also testified that Gray attempted the same maneuver, albeit less successfully, and, along with the other five members of the group, including Bell, repeatedly kicked Williams about the ribs, neck, and head.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Detective Pennington testified that his investigation led him to arrest and interview Bell. In the course of that interview, Bell formally confessed to participating in the beating of Williams, implicating both Gray and Vanlandingham in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The State was permitted to read Bell\u2019s confession into evidence over his objection, but, as indicated, <em>supra, </em>was concomitantly required to redact the names of Gray and Vanlandingham, and insert in their place, the words \u201cdeletion\u201d or \u201cdeleted.\u201d A copy of the redacted confession was admitted into evidence with blank white spaces indicating where the names of Gray and Vanlandingham had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Unlike Bell, Gray testified in his own defense, claiming that he was speaking with his girlfriend on a public telephone when the fray ensued. Chanel Brown, Gray\u2019s girlfriend, testified that he had called her from a telephone booth and, during that conversation, said that Vanlandingham was fighting. Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>witness Lamont Mathews testified that although he had witnessed Williams\u2019 beating, he placed Gray at a telephone booth \u201cup the street\u201d during the melee. The jury nonetheless convicted Gray of involuntary manslaughter, for which he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment with all but seven years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Gray appealed that judgment to the Court of Special Appeals, claiming that the introduction of Bell\u2019s redacted confession violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, and was contrary to the holding in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). The intermediate appellate court agreed and reversed Gray\u2019s conviction. <em>Gray v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 311, 667 A.2d 983 (1995). We granted the State\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In the trial of every criminal case, state or federal, a defendant has the right \u201cto be confronted with witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI; <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, 926 (1965)(Sixth Amendment made applicable to states through Fourteenth Amendment); <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 306, 577 A.2d 356, 359 (1990); <em>Harris v. State, </em>306 Md. 344, 361, 509 A.2d 120, 128 (1986). Implicit in this principle is the right to cross-examine those witnesses. <em>Pointer, </em>380 U.S. at 406-07, 85 S.Ct. at 1069-70, 13 L.Ed.2d at 928; <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 306, 577 A.2d at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In <em>Bruton v. United States, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s pretrial confession implicating another codefendant by name, violated that defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right, notwithstanding an instruction to the jury to disregard the confession in determining the nonconfessing defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bruton was tried and convicted along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>one Evans, who, during the preceding investigation, orally confessed to a postal inspector that he and Bruton perpetrated an armed postal robbery. The postal inspector subsequently testified to Evans\u2019 confession. The trial judge duly instructed the jury that the confession was competent evidence against Evans only and was not to be used in assessing Bruton\u2019s innocence or guilt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court nevertheless reversed Bruton\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In so doing, the Court repudiated its previous position that \u201c \u2018it is reasonably possible for the jury to follow\u2019 sufficiently clear instructions to disregard the confessor\u2019s extrajudicial statement that his codefendant participated with him committing the crime.\u201d <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 1622, 20 L.Ed.2d at 479 (quoting <em>Delli Paoli v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 232, 239, 77 S.Ct. 294, 299, 1 L.Ed.2d 278, 284 (1957)). The reason for the departure, articulated initially by the <em>Delli Paoli </em>dissent, was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201ctoo often such admonition against misuse [of a codefendant\u2019s confession] is intrinsically ineffective in that the effect of such a nonadmissible declaration cannot be wiped- from the brains of the jurors. The admonition therefore becomes a futile collection of words and fails of its purpose as a legal protection to defendants.... The Government should not have the windfall of the jury being influenced by evidence against a defendant which, as a matter of law, they should not consider but which they cannot put out of their minds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">352 U.S. at 247-48, 77 S.Ct. at 302, 1 L.Ed.2d at 288 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The Court acknowledged three arguments supporting the use of limiting instructions in this area, namely the probative value of the confession, judicial economy, and the integrity of the jury system itself, but categorically rejected the first two. While the confession may be the best evidence of the confessor\u2019s guilt, alternative ways exist to allow the State the benefit of the confession without infringing upon the nonconfessing defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 133-34, 88 S.Ct. at 1626, 20 L.Ed.2d at 483-84. The use of redactions is but one example. <em>Id. </em>at 134 n. 10, 88 S.Ct. at 1627 n. 10, 20 L.Ed.2d at 484 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Similarly, joint trials conserve state resources by avoiding the necessity of duplicate proceedings, reduce inconveniences to witnesses, and accelerate the judicial process. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 88 S.Ct. at 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d at 484. Nevertheless, fundamental constitutional rights, such as the right of confrontation, are seldom sacrificed upon the altar of judicial efficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 88 S.Ct. at 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Turning to the third argument in support of limiting instructions, the Court acknowledged that inadmissible evidence inevitably finds its way before the jury, but that reliance on the jury\u2019s ability to <em>perform its role is </em>justified under many circumstances. <em>Id., </em>at 135, 88 S.Ct. at 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d at 484. In those instances, \u201c[i]t is not unreasonable to conclude ... [that] the jury can and will follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions to disregard such information.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 135, 88 S.Ct. at 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d at 484-85. When, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201cthe powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant who stands side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial ... the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure [are] so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. at 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d at 485. The Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u201cdespite the concededly clear instructions to the jury to disregard Evans\u2019 inadmissible hearsay evidence inculpating [Bruton], in the context of a joint trial, we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for [Bruton\u2019s] constitutional right of cross examination.... The effect is the same as if there had been no instruction at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628, 20 L.Ed.2d at 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Nineteen years later in <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), the practice of omitting any references to a defendant from a statement being introduced against a confessing codefendant was challenged\u2014a practice initially suggested by the Court itself. <em>See, </em>Part II., <em>supra. </em>Clariss Marsh, Benjamin Williams and Kareem Martin were charged with assaulting Cynthia Knighton and murdering her son, Koran, and her aunt, Ollie Scott. Over Marsh\u2019s objection, Marsh and Williams were tried together.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, the state introduced a confession made by Williams shortly after his arrest. The confession had been redacted to omit all references to Marsh. In fact, on its face, the confession implicated no one other than Williams and Martin in the crimes. Williams did not testify. Nevertheless, Marsh was linked to the confession via her own testimony that she was in the vehicle on the way to the crime scene when, by Williams\u2019 admission, he and Martin discussed their plans to rob and kill the victims, although Marsh claims not to have heard the conversation. Marsh also testified to being in the house during the robbery, but could not explain why she did not attempt to flee or otherwise assist the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">During his closing remarks, the prosecutor cautioned the jury not to use Williams\u2019 confession as evidence against Marsh. Nevertheless, he linked Marsh to the confession by suggesting that if Marsh was in the car during Martin and Williams\u2019 conversation, she was, by implication, part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>criminal enterprise. Marsh was convicted of two counts of felony murder and one count of assault with intent to commit murder. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Marsh successfully appealed her conviction to the Unitecl States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 781 F.2d 1201 (1986). In reversing her conviction, that court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A19o\">\u201cSanctioning the admission of an extrajudicial statement in circumstances in which a substantial risk exists that the statement will be used against the defendant not only denies the Sixth Amendment Right to Confrontation, but raises serious due process concerns regarding the validity of the conviction and the fundamental fairness of the trial process. It is no answer to this unfairness to say that the evidence that set the stage was subject to cross-examination.... [T]he determination of whether there exists a substantial risk that the jury might have [improperly] considered [the confession] \u2018may require consideration of other evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtJ\">781 F.2d at 1212 (citations omitted). Assuming the existence of such a risk, the Sixth Circuit noted that the only direct evidence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> suggesting Marsh knew beforehand that the victims would be robbed and executed was Williams\u2019 account of his conversation with Martin just prior to the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 1210. In view of the lack of other evidence connecting Marsh to the activities of Williams and Martin, the prosecutor\u2019s linkage of Marsh to the confession proved \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d to her with respect to the critical element of intent, <em>id. </em>at 1213, thereby violating her Sixth Amendment confrontation right. Noting that other courts of appeals have declined to adopt the \u201cevidentiary linkage\u201d or \u201ccontextual implication\u201d approach to the <em>Bruton </em>problem, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 476 U.S. 1168, 106 S.Ct. 2888, 90 L.Ed.2d 976 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Marsh </em>rejected the Sixth Circuit\u2019s analysis and characterized the holding in <em>Bruton </em>as \u201ca narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>exception\u201d to the general principle that jurors follow instructions given them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Marsh, </em>481 U.S. at 206-07, 107 S.Ct. at 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d at 185. The Court premised its holding upon three basic assumptions. First, \u201cwhere the necessity of ... linkage [to other evidence] is involved, it is a less valid generalization that the jury will not likely obey the instruction to disregard the evidence.\u201d 481 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d at 186. Unlike specific testimony directly inculpating the defendant, as was the case in <em>Bruton, </em>inferential incrimination can be avoided by dissuading the jury from making the inference in the first instance. <em>Id., </em>at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Second, the practical effect of the \u201clinkage\u201d or \u201ccontextual approach\u201d to the <em>Bruton </em>question would place an impossible burden upon trial courts. If limited to <em>facially </em>incriminating confessions, <em>Bruton </em>compliance could be had by simple redaction. <em>Id. </em>at 208-09, 107 S.Ct. at 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d at 186 (citing <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 134 n. 10, 88 S.Ct. at 1627 n. 10, 20 L.Ed.2d at 484 n. 10). Conversely, an analysis requiring linkage requires both a pretrial and post-trial determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>whether, after viewing all the evidence introduced, the confession is so \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d that it should either be excluded in the first instance or the defendant granted a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 107 S.Ct. at 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d at 187. Such a result not only invites defense malfeasance, but consumes large quantities of time and guarantees nothing in the way of certainty. <em>Id., </em>at 209, 107 S.Ct. at 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Finally, although it might be suggested that the simple remedy to the <em>Bruton </em>problem is to forego joint trials when the confession of one defendant might conceivably incriminate the other, the efficacy of that remedy is questionable. <em>Id., </em>at 209-10, 107 S.Ct. at 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d at 187. Not only do joint trials serve an important function in our criminal justice system in terms of efficiency, they protect defendants from the unfair advantage that a later tried defendant has over his earlier-tried counterpart, and avoid the criticism associated with inconsistent verdicts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 210, 107 S.Ct. at 1708-09, 95 L.Ed.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In the end, the Court declined to extend <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>reach, concluding that \u201cthe calculus changes when confessions that do not name the defendant are at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 1709, 95 L.Ed.2d at 188. Having said that, however, the Court specifically reserved the issue of \u201cthe admissibility of a confession in which the defendant\u2019s name has been replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211 n. 5, 107 S.Ct. at 1709 n. 5, 95 L.Ed.2d at 188 n. 5. This, of course, is the issue presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">There exits a substantial split of authority on the proper approach to the question expressly left open in <em>Marsh. </em>Some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>courts subscribe to the \u201ccontextual\u201d or \u201cevidentiary linkage\u201d approach to the <em>Bruton </em>problem. Those jurisdictions principally rely upon the notion that when a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession tends to inculpate a defendant in light of other evidence presented, or to be presented, at trial, thereby creating a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the jury will improperly use the confession, the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right is denied. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Van Hemelryck, </em>945 F.2d 1493, 1502-03 (11th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Pendegraph, </em>791 F.2d 1462, 1465-66 (11th Cir.1986); <em>People v. Fletcher, </em>13 Cal.4th 451, 456, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 574, 917 P.2d 187, 189 (1996); <em>Smith v. United States, </em>561 A.2d 468, 474 (D.C.1989); <em>People v. Cruz, </em>121 Ill.2d 321, 330-31, 117 Ill.Dec. 907, 521 N.E.2d 18, 22-23 (1988); <em>People v. Khan, </em>200 A.D.2d 129, 136-37, 613 N.Y.S.2d 198, 203-04 (1994); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>71 N.C.App. 90, 92, 321 S.E.2d 510, 513 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Other jurisdictions, however, employ the \u201cfacial implication\u201d doctrine, holding that when the complaining defendant\u2019s name is replaced with a neutral pronoun, and the confession does not otherwise, by itself, inculpate that defendant, it is admissible against the confessing codefendant. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hoac, </em>990 F.2d 1099, 1105 (9th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>936 F.2d 698, 700 (2d Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>935 F.2d 822, 825-26 (7th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Donahue, </em>948 F.2d 438, 444 (8th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Vogt, </em>910 F.2d 1184, 1192, (4th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Espinoza-Seanez, </em>862 F.2d 526, 535 (5th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>749 F.2d 1329, 1334 (9th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Belle, </em>593 F.2d 487, 493 (3d Cir.1979); <em>Hodges v. Rose, </em>570 F.2d 643, 646-47 (6th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Dady, </em>536 F.2d 675, 677-78 (6th Cir.1976); <em>Harris v. State, </em>218 Ga.App. 472, 473, 462 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1995); <em>State v. Craney, </em>662 A.2d 899, 903 (Me.1995); <em>Commonwealth v. Sanford, </em>323 Pa.Super. 436, 439-40, 470 A.2d 998, 999-1000 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">At their extremes, neither approach is completely satisfactory. Evidentiary linkage, applied in its most liberal form, completely undermines the long held, and vitally necessary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>presumption that juries follow trial court instructions. The approach also has practical administrative difficulties and may harm defendants as much as it may protect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Similarly, while the facial implication doctrine has simplistic appeal, redacted confessions with \u201cneutral pronouns may still prove impossible to \u2018thrust out of mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v. Fletcher, </em>13 Cal.4th at 466, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d at 580, 917 P.2d at 195 (quoting <em>Marsh, </em>481 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1707-08, 95 L.Ed.2d at 186). The possibility certainly exists whereby notwithstanding the substitution of a defendant\u2019s name with a neutral pronoun, a jury could reach but one conclusion\u2014that the omission is, in fact, the nonconfessing codefendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although one might argue that is so only when linked with other evidence admitted at trial, the inferential step that the jury must take to reach that conclusion may be so small as to be no step at all. In those instances, the act of redaction becomes a mere formalistic exercise devoid of the Constitutional protections undergirding <em>Bruton, </em>and the confession\u2019s exclusion from evidence is warranted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Clark v. Maggio, </em>737 F.2d 471, 476 (5th Cir.1984)(redaction technique must be employed cautiously and carefully to avoid violating the spirit, if not the letter, of Bruton).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Despite the State\u2019s assertions to the contrary, it does not necessarily follow from <em>Bruton </em>or <em>Marsh </em>that a confession that does not implicate a nonconfessing codefendant by name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>automatically, and without further inquiry, passes Constitutional muster. We reject, in its most pristine form, the facial implication doctrine urged by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We think the better approach is that typified by the holding in <em>United States v. Pendegraph, supra, </em>where the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that \u201ca redacted confession may still violate the <em>Bruton </em>rule if the statement <em>compels </em>a directly inculpating inference\u201d between the redacted confession and the nonconfessing codefendant. 791 F.2d at 1465 (emphasis added) (where the word \u201cindividual\u201d was substituted for Pendegraph\u2019s name in his codefendant\u2019s confession, the jury could infer that Pendegraph was that \u201cindividual\u201d if only because there was no other possibility); <em>see also United States v. Washington, </em>952 F.2d 1402, 1407 (D.C.Cir.1991)(with proper limiting instruction, Confrontation Clause not violated by redacted statement that, when viewed with other evidence, does not create an inevitable association with the nonconfessing defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">As we see it, this approach accords with the rationale of <em>Bruton </em>as explained and limited by <em>Marsh. </em>The substantial risk to which <em>Bruton </em>speaks comes not from the incriminatory tendency of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession as to another defendant, but from the belief that in certain exceptional circumstances, a jury will not be able to resist the temptation to ignore the trial court\u2019s instructions to overlook what has been thrust into their line of sight. Indeed, jurors are strongly presumed to follow trial court instructions. <em>See </em>n. 6, <em>supra. </em>When however, the directly (and undeniably) inculpatory statements of a codefendant are given to the jury\u2019s consideration, notwithstanding a limiting instruction to the contrary, the presumption is overcome and a substantial risk therefore exists that the jury will use the confession as evidence against the nonconfessing defendant. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 136-37, 88 S.Ct. at 1628, 20 L.Ed.2d at 485. In other words, a <em>Bruton </em>violation occurs when jurors are compelled to do, as rational human beings, that which they have been instructed by the trial court they must not\u2014link a nonconfessing defendant to a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The compulsion to make the impermissible inference must be compelling, inevitable, and subject to little or no debate. Otherwise, the general and strong presumption that jurors follow their instructions is not overcome, and the requirements of <em>Bruton </em>are therefore satisfied. <em>See Marsh, </em>481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 1709, 95 L.Ed.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">To be sure, some courts have predicated their conclusions that a confession creates a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the jury will not heed trial court instructions and therefore is \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d to a defendant based upon the relative strength of the state\u2019s case. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Key, </em>725 F.2d 1123, 1126 (7th Cir.1984); <em>English v. United States, </em>620 F.2d 150, 152 (7th Cir.1980). That analysis, however, concerns whether the denial of a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights was harmless, <em>see, e.g., Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), not whether the denial of those rights occurred in the first place. We agree that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axg\">\u201c[t]he decision on how to <em>\u2018Brutonize </em>\u2019 a statement, if necessary, must ordinarily be made early in the trial, when the judge is not in an ideal position to assess the strength of the government\u2019s case. A judge can decide at the outset, however, whether a codefendant statement is likely to incriminate other defendants in such a way as to create a substantial <em>risk </em>that the jury will consider it in deciding on the guilt of those defendants. If the incriminating references ultimately adds little to the government\u2019s case, then their exclusion does no harm, and the confrontation rights of the defendants are preserved. We do not read <em>Bruton </em>as guaranteeing a right of confrontation only as against testimony that proves to be vital to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An4\"><em>Hodges v. Rose, supra, </em>570 F.2d at 647 n. 9. It was in this manner that the trial judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>ordered the redaction of Bell\u2019s confession, but otherwise allowed the State the benefit of its evidentiary value.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">As indicated in Part I., <em>supra, </em>the State substituted the words \u201cdeletion\u201d or \u201cdeleted\u201d, for the names of Gray and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Vanlandingham. Bell\u2019s redacted confession, read to the jury and introduced into evidence, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAH\">\u201cQuestion, what can you tell me about the beating of Stacey Williams that occurred on 10, November, 1993?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">Answer, an argument broke out between <em>deletion </em>and Stacey in the 500 block of Louden Avenue. Stacey got smacked and then ran into Wildwood Parkway. Me, <em>deleted, </em>and a few other guys ran after Stacey. We caught up to him on Wildwood Parkway. We beat Stacey up. After we beat Stacey up, we walked him back to Louden Avenue. I then walked over and used the phone, Stacey and the others walked down Louden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">Question, when Stacey was beaten on Wildwood Parkway, how was he beaten?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">Answer, hit, kicked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Question, who hit and kicked Stacey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">Answer, I hit Stacey.

It is evidence against Mr. Bell only, and, as I will instruct you later, you will consider the evidence against the defendants individually and reach a separate verdict as to each defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Taking its cue from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the intermediate appellate court relied heavily upon <em>Smith v. United States, </em>561 A.2d 468 (D.C.1989) wherein blank spaces were used in place of Smith\u2019s name in his co-defendant\u2019s inculpatory, but otherwise redacted, confession. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay6\">\u201cIn order to determine whether a substantial risk exists [that the jury will improperly use the confession against the non-confessing codefendant], \u2018the trial court must consider the degree of inference the jury must make to connect the defendant to the statement and the degree of risk that the jury will make that linkage despite a limiting instruction.\u2019 The trial court\u2019s assessment as to whether the redaction effectively avoids linkage with the defendant must be make in the context of other evidence admitted at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"><em>Smith, </em>561 A.2d at 474 (quoting <em>Foster v. United States, </em>548 A.2d 1370, 1379 (D.C.1988)). Applying that standard, the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201cmere deletion of [Gray and Vanlandingham\u2019s names]\u201d failed to eliminate from Bell\u2019s confession <em>Bruton </em>hazards because the jury \u201cdid not have to make a substantial inference that [Gray] was [one of] the person[s] neutrally referenced in the redacted statement.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>107 Md.App. at 327, 667 A.2d at 990. In other words, in light of other evidence presented at Gray\u2019s trial, \u201cthe jury could reasonably infer that it was appellant whose name had been \u2018deleted.\u2019 \u201d 107 Md.App. at 328, 667 A.2d at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">While we agree that the jury <em>could have </em>reasonably inferred that one of the deleted names belonged to Gray, that inference was not compelled. As both the trial court and the intermediate appellate court acknowledged, as many as six individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>participated in the attack on Williams. The Court of Special Appeals, however, pointed out that \u201conly three were positively identified\u2014Bell, appellant, and \u00cdVanlandingham]\u201d and concluded that \u201c[Grayj\u2019s role was clearly demonstrated by Bell\u2019s confession, rendering it facially incriminating[.]\u201d 107 Md.App. at 327, 667 A.2d at 990. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">As we have said, a <em>Bruton </em>violation occurs when a codefendant\u2019s confession, either facially, or by compelling and inevitable inference, inculpates a nonconfessing defendant. Under those circumstances, there <em>is </em>a substantial risk that the jury will not heed the trial court\u2019s instructions to disregard the confession as evidence against the nonconfessing defendant or defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">True, Shay Yarberough implicated the same individuals from the witness stand as did Bell\u2019s confession, but Yarberough also testified that at least three other individuals were involved in the fray, whom he could not (or would not) identify. Other than by inference, the jury had no way of knowing that Yarberough\u2019s testimony and Bell\u2019s confession paralleled, and the prosecution did not, in any way, suggest such a coincidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was that very inference that the trial court instructed the jury that they must not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">As we indicated, <em>supra, </em>that the jury could have reasonably connected Gray to Bell\u2019s confession is not sufficient to raise a <em>Bruton </em>challenge. Although the jury knew at the time of trial Vanlandingham was dead, the omitted references in Bell\u2019s confession could have been any one of at least four other individuals\u2014a fact emphasized by the States\u2019 Attorney no less than three times during her final summation. The jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>instructed not to use Bell\u2019s confession as evidence against Gray, and, in light of the strong presumption that the jury followed those instructions, Gray\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right was adequately protected. His unsupported speculation about what the jury might have done if they drew an impermissible inference is simply insufficient to warrant a reversal upon these facts. In short, \u201cthere does not exist [in the present case] the overwhelming probability of [the jury\u2019s inability to follow trial court instructions] that is the foundation of the <em>Bruton </em>[]\u25a0... Rule.\u201d <em>Marsh, </em>481 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY.
