She was initially hired as a Certified Respiratory Therapist, also known as a paramedic, based at the Towson Fire Station. Her duties as a paramedic involved responding to emergency calls and rendering aid at the scenes of accidents and other emergencies. Means filed the workers\u2019 compensation claim at issue in this case in February, 1994. She claimed that she \u201cwas diagnosed as suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of working a medic unit.\u201d Because Means\u2019s alleged PTSD is based on events occurring several years before the claim was filed, we turn now to a chronology of those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Means contends that the PTSD she allegedly suffered was caused by a particularly severe accident in 1987 involving a van carrying five teenagers. As the first medical personnel crew on the scene, she provided aid and declared the teenagers dead. A few days after this accident, Means responded to another emergency call, with equally serious injuries and fatalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Shortly after these incidents in March, 1987, Means was transferred, upon her request, to the Brooklandville Fire Station, a station with a reputation for receiving few emergency calls. After a year, Means was transferred to the Randallstown Fire Station where she remained until February, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Sometime prior to February, 1992, Means requested a demotion from paramedic to firefighter. In conjunction with the demotion to firefighter, she was transferred back to the Towson station. Although she had been demoted, she was on several occasions required to act as a paramedic at the Tow-son station. In 1992, Means was required to serve as the paramedic at a particularly gruesome motorcycle accident. The victim had not been wearing a helmet and his scalp had been torn away from his skull. After this accident, Means felt that she \u201cwoke up\u201d and remembered the particularly traumatic accidents in 1987 when she had previously worked out of the Towson station.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">After the motorcycle accident, Means frequently missed work and began seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist at the Psychological Services Section of the Baltimore County Police and Fire Departments. In her initial visit to the therapist on June 15, 1992, Means reported suffering from flashbacks of the van accident, headaches, crying spells, and difficulty concentrating. She reported that her return to the Towson station had \u201creally upset her and brought back painful memories.\u201d In clinical intake notes dated June 17, 1992, the therapist treating Means noted that her \u201csymptoms sound as though they could possibly be part of a post-traumatic reaction or disorder.\u201d The following notations appear at the conclusion of the clinical intake notes from Means\u2019s first meeting with the therapist:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">INITIAL DIAGNOSIS (DSM-III-R)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Axis I R/O Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</p>\n<p id=\"Auv\">Axis II Deferred</p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">Axis III None noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The therapist concluded that \u201c[fjurther evaluation is necessary to determine if client may be experiencing a post-traumatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>reaction of delayed onset.\u201d Means remained under the therapists\u2019 care at the County\u2019s Psychological Services Section until October, 1992. Means was subsequently evaluated in July and October, 1995, by Dr. Joseph M. Eisenberg. Dr. Eisenberg wrote in his evaluation of Means that it was his \u201copinion that the initial diagnosis in 1992 should have been Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, delayed onset.\u201d Means proffered that Dr. Eisenberg would testify that she suffered from PTSD caused by her employment as a paramedic.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Means filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for PTSD in February, 1994, seeking compensation for 110 hours of missed work. She identified February 1, 1992, as the date of disablement, the same date as her transfer back to the Towson station. On January 6, 1995, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission held a hearing on Means\u2019s claim and concluded that she had not suffered an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of her employment. Means filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-737.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The County filed a motion for summary judgment. The County presented two arguments: (1) that as a matter of law, Means failed to establish that she suffered from PTSD; and (2) that as a matter of law, PTSD may not form the basis of an occupational disease claim. The trial court granted the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the second ground. Means noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and we granted certiorari before consideration by that court. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">In Maryland, workers\u2019 compensation encompasses two categories of compensable events: accidental personal injury and occupational diseases. \u00a7\u00a7 9-501, 9-502; <em>Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 279, 465 A.2d 1141, 1146 (1983). Section 9-101(b) defines \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d as follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>(b) <em>Accidental personal </em>injury.\u2014\u201cAccidental personal injury\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-4\">(1) an accidental injuiy that arises out of and in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">(2) an injury caused by a willful or negligent act of a third person directed against a covered employee in the course of the employment of the covered employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">(3) a disease or infection that naturally results from an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">(i) an occupational disease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">(ii) frostbite or sunstroke caused by a weather condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">This Court has described accidental injuries as those that involve \u201cthe injury and destruction of tissue by the application of external force, such as a blow.\u201d <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 486, 6 A.2d 48, 53 (1939). Occupational disease is defined in \u00a7 9-101(g) of the Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">(g) <em>Occupational </em>disease.\u2014\u201cOccupational disease\u201d means a disease contracted by a covered employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">(1) as the result of and in the course of employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-12\">(2) that causes the covered employee to become temporarily or permanently, partially or totally incapacitated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">While the Act does not further define \u201coccupational disease,\u201d this Court has further delineated the term</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayn\">as some ailment, disorder, or illness which is the expectable result of working under conditions naturally inherent in the employment and inseparable therefrom, and is ordinarily slow and insidious in its approach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-14\"><em>Foble, </em>176 Md. at 486, 6 A.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">Not all diseases which meet this definition are compensable. Section 9-101(g) must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 9-502(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 9-502 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>(d) <em>Limitation on </em>liability.\u2014An employer and insurer are liable to provide compensation ... only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-4\">(1) the occupational disease that caused the death or disability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">(i) is due to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist and the covered employee was employed before the date of disablement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">(ii) has manifestations that are consistent with those known to result from exposure to a biological, chemical, or physical agent that is attributable to the type of employment in which the covered employee was employed before the date of disablement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The limitations imposed by \u00a7 9\u2014502(d) seek to ensure that only those diseases directly caused by the employment be compensable. <em>Davis v. Dyncorp, </em>336 Md. 226, 236, 647 A.2d 446, 451 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Occupational diseases have not always been compensable under the Act. The legislative history of the Act suggests that the General Assembly was reluctant to recognize occupational diseases as compensable under workers\u2019 compensation. <em>See Miller v. Western Electric Co., </em>310 Md. 173, 181, 528 A.2d 486, 490 (1987); <em>see generally </em>Thomas S. Cook, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation and Stress Claims: Remedial Intent and Restrictive Application, </em>62 Notre Dame L.Rev. 879, 889-91 (1987) (discussing state legislatures\u2019 early and continuing reluctance regarding occupational disease claims). In 1939, however, the General Assembly recognized occupational dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ease \u201cas a problem, like on-the-job accidental injury, that an industrial society had to address in a comprehensive fashion,\u201d and enacted Maryland\u2019s first occupational disease statute. <em>Miller, </em>310 Md. at 182, 528 A.2d at 491; <em>see </em>1939 Md.Laws ch. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Chapter 465 of the Acts of 1939 enumerated thirty-four diseases that were compensable under the Act as occupational diseases. The statute required employers to compensate only for those thirty-four specified diseases and only when caused by the process or occupation specified. For example, asbestosis was compensable if arising out of \u201c[a]ny process or occupation involving an exposure to or direct contact with asbestos dust.\u201d 1939 Md. Laws ch. 465, \u00a7 1, at 995. In 1951, the occupational disease statute was repealed and reenacted, 1951 Md. Laws ch. 289, \u00a7 1, at 752, replacing the schedule format with the more general definition of occupational disease that remains in effect today. With this statutory framework and history in mind, we now turn to examine the compensability of PTSD under Maryland\u2019s Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The compensability of work-related mental disabilities unaccompanied by physical illness has been a controversial topic in workers\u2019 compensation law over the past decade. Cook, <em>supra, </em>at 879. Workers\u2019 compensation claims based on mental injuries caused by mental stimuli have been coined \u201cmental-mental\u201d claims, in contrast to \u201cphysical-mental\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cmental-physical\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claims. <em>See </em>A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 42.20 (1996). Means makes a mental-mental claim\u2014she alleges that a mental stimulus (the memory of the traumatic accidents) caused a mental injury (PTSD). A ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>jority of the states have found mental-mental claims to be compensable under some circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">This Court has recognized mental-mental claims to be compensable in the context of accidental injury. <em>Belcher v. T. Rowe Price, </em>329 Md. 709, 621 A.2d 872 (1993). In <em>Belcher, </em>the employee, a secretary for T. Rowe Price Foundation, worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>on the top floor of an office building located next to a construction site. One morning a three-ton beam broke loose from its crane and crashed through the roof of T. Rowe Price\u2019s building, landing with a deafening noise only five feet from Belcher\u2019s desk. The power in the building went out, pipes and wires were ripped apart, and debris covered Belcher. Thereafter, Belcher experienced panic attacks, nightmares, and chest pains which were diagnosed as symptoms of PTSD. <em>Id. </em>at 713-14, 621 A.2d at 874-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">This Court held that Belcher was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for her injuries because they resulted from an accidental personal injury under the terms of the Act. We reasoned that when a mental injury is precipitated by an \u201cunexpected and unforeseen event that occurs suddenly or violently,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 740, 621 A.2d at 887 (quoting <em>Sparks v. Tulane Medical Ctr. Hosp. &amp; Clinic, </em>546 So.2d 138, 147 (La.1989)), a worker may recover for that mental injury if the injury is \u201ccapable of objective determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 621 A.2d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">One year later, this Court addressed the question of mental-mental claims in the context of occupational diseases. <em>Davis v. Dyncorp, </em>336 Md. 226, 647 A.2d 446 (1994). Davis was a computer operator employed by Dyncorp. Davis alleged that he was continually subjected to serious harassment by his coworkers. The sustained harassment, Davis contended, caused PTSD which prevented him from returning to work. <em>Id. </em>at 228, 647 A.2d at 447. In contrast to <em>Belcher, </em>Davis maintained that he was entitled to compensation because he suffered an occupational disease, not an accidental personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">This Court held that Davis\u2019s claim did not constitute an occupational disease under \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 (g) and 9-502(d)(l)(i) because the alleged disease was not \u201cdue to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist.\u201d \u00a7 9-502(d)(l)(i). We concluded that \u201cnothing peculiar to Davis\u2019s duties as a computer operator ... made him more susceptible to harassment than in any other kind of employment.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Md. at 237, 647 A.2d at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Because Davis\u2019s particular claim could not constitute an occupational disease under the Act, we did not reach the issue of whether, as a matter of law, gradually resulting, purely mental diseases could ever be compensable occupational diseases. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 647 A.2d at 452. In conclusion, however, we addressed the possibility that gradually resulting mental diseases may be compensable occupational diseases. Judge Chasanow, writing for the Court, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">[W]e are not willing to rule out the possibility that some gradually resulting, purely mental diseases could be compensable occupational diseases or that there may be circumstances where work-induced stress may result in a compensable occupational disease. Today, we merely hold that the mental disease resulting from the harassment encountered by Davis was not due to the nature of his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 238-39, 647 A.2d at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">This case requires us to resolve the issue that we did not reach in <em>Davis, i.e., </em>whether, as a matter of law, PTSD should be excluded from compensable occupational diseases. We reach this issue because, unlike the occupation of computer operator in <em>Davis, </em>the occupation of paramedic is \u201can employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist.\u201d \u00a7 9\u2014502(d)(l)(i). We hold today that PTSD may be compensable as an occupational disease under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act if the claimant can present sufficient evidence to meet the statutory requirements. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-101(g) (disease must be contracted as the result of and in the course of employment and the disease must cause the employee to become incapacitated); \u00a7 9-502(d)(l)(i) (disease must be due to nature of an employment in which the hazards of the occupational disease exist).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">In <em>Davis, </em>336 Md. at 237, 647 A.2d at 451, we posed the question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>[T]he question becomes whether mental disease caused by his job harassment may be reasonably characterized as due to the general character of Davis\u2019s employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">We conclude that Means\u2019s asserted PTSD may be reasonably characterized as due to the general character of her employment as a paramedic.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unlike the computer operator in <em>Davis </em>who divided his time between programming computers and reading manuals, Means\u2019s employment as a paramedic exposed her to events that could potentially cause PTSD.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We conclude that PTSD may be compatible with the general character of occupational disease. We have consistently described occupational disease as \u201csome ailment, disorder, or illness which is the expectable result of working under conditions naturally inherent in the employment and inseparable therefrom, and is ordinarily slow and insidious in its approach.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 486, 6 A.2d 48, 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>(1939); <em>see also Davis, </em>336 Md. at 233, 647 A.2d at 449; <em>Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 280, 465 A.2d 1141, 1146 (1983). In the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), a condition may only be diagnosed as PTSD after the symptoms have persisted for over one month. American Psychiatric Association, Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV 211 (1994). Although the outbreak of symptoms may be experienced a few days to a few weeks after the trauma, symptoms may also be delayed. <em>See </em>H. Kaplan et al., Synopsis of Psychiatry 610 (7th ed. 1994). Based on these criteria, PTSD can be slow and insidious.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Although the structure and history of the occupational disease statutes reflect an intent by the legislature to treat occupational disease differently from accidental injury in some respects, in light of our holding in <em>Belcher </em>we see no sound reason to treat them differently in this regard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Miller, </em>we noted one basis for treating occupational disease and accidental injury differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">The problems of showing disability and causation simply appear less formidable in the [accidental injury] context. The injury, at least to the lay eye, is relatively easy to see and evaluate, and its connection to the employment is more readily apparent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\"><em>Miller, </em>310 Md. at 185, 528 A.2d at 492. This quotation echoes the criticisms of those who oppose compensation for workers who suffer from PTSD arising out of their employment. This Court has addressed PTSD in other contexts, and we have concluded that expert testimony concerning PTSD is \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>evidentiarily reliable as an opinion by an orthopedist who has been engaged only to testify ascribing a plaintiffs subjective complaints of low back pain to soft tissue injury resulting from an automobile accident.\u201d <em>State v. Allewalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 99, 517 A.2d 741, 746 (1986); <em>see also Hutton v. State, </em>339 Md. 480, 491-93, 663 A.2d 1289, 1294-95 (1995); <em>Acuna v. State, </em>332 Md. 65, 629 A.2d 1233 (1993). Workers who suffer back pain or soft tissue injury as a result of accidents or diseases arising in the course of employment are not denied compensation due to the difficulty of verification. Judge Orth, writing for the Court in <em>Belcher, </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\">We have come to appreciate that a mind may be injured as well as a body maimed. A person\u2019s psychic trauma does not vary depending upon the type of legal action in which the harm is scrutinized.... The inability to work and the loss of earning power are the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-5\"><em>Belcher, </em>329 Md. at 738, 621 A.2d at 886. Other states that maintain a distinction between accidental injury and occupational disease in their workers\u2019 compensation statute similarly have held mental disorders to be compensable as occupational diseases. <em>E.g., City of Aurora v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>710 P.2d 1122, 1123 (Colo.Ct.App.1985); <em>Martinez v. University of California, </em>93 N.M. 455, 601 P.2d 425, 426 (1979); <em>Pulley v. City of Durham, </em>121 N.C.App. 688, 468 S.E.2d 506, 510 (1996); <em>James v. State Accident Ins. Fund, </em>290 Or. 343, 624 P.2d 565, 568 (1981); <em>Gatlin v. City of Knoxville, </em>822 S.W.2d 587, 590 (Tenn.1991); <em>see O\u2019Loughlin v. Circle A. Constr., </em>112 Idaho 1048, 739 P.2d 347, 353 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We stress that we do not today hold that Means\u2019s alleged PTSD is necessarily compensable as an occupational disease. We hold only that if the claimant can successfully prove that PTSD meets the statutory requirements, PTSD is not as a matter of law excluded from compensable occupational diseases and that the non-physical nature of Means\u2019s claim does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>not <em>per se </em>exclude her from coverage under the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Means must prove that she contracted PTSD \u201cas the result of and in the course of employment.\u201d \u00a7 9-101(g). Furthermore, she must prove that the mental illness she suffers is due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>nature of a paramedic\u2019s job and that employment as a paramedic entails the hazard of developing PTSD. \u00a7 9-502(d)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.

The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s diagnostic guidelines for PTSD define the required traumatic event as one in which both of the following criteria are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">(1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">(2) the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">American Psychiatric Association, Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV 209 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-10\">. In its brief to this Court, the County contends that Means\u2019s alleged PTSD was caused by her transfer to the Towson Fire Station after her demotion to firefighter. The County argues that transfers <em>are not due </em>to the general character of employment as a paramedic or firefighter. Means, on the other hand, contends that the 1987 accidents caused her PTSD and that the transfer to Towson only caused her to \u2018\u2018wake up\u201d to her feelings about those incidents. We do not need to resolve this dispute because we do not decide whether Means\u2019s injury is compensable, only that it is not precluded as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\">. In the context of disease, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines insidious as \u201cdeveloping so gradually as to be well established before becoming apparent.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1169 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">Dr. Joseph Eisenberg, Means\u2019s expert witness, states in his evaluation of Means that her \"relatively high level of functioning prior to June, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>1992, is to her credit but is also a reflection of the <em>insidious nature and onset </em>of the traumatic stress and reaction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">. Whether mental-mental claims should be excluded under the Act is a matter best addressed by the General Assembly. <em>See, e.g., </em>Alaska Stat. \u00a7 23.30.395(17) (1996) (statute amended following court decision in <em>Fox v. Alascom, </em>718 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1986)); W.Va.Code \u00a7 23-4-lf (1996) (statute amended following court decision in <em>Breeden v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commissioner, </em>168 W.Va. 573, 285 S.E.2d 398 (1981)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b824-4\">. We do not address today whether occupational disease based on mental illness shall be governed by special standards distinct from those applied in cases of physical disease. This issue has been neither briefed nor argued before this Court. We point out, however, that there are various tests, standards, and conditions for compensability among the many states that compensate mental-mental claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">There are essentially four different standards that courts apply to determine which mental injuries will be compensable. <em>Cf. </em>Larson, <em>supra </em>note 3, \u00a7 42.25. Some states treat mental injuries no differently than physical injuries or physical diseases and allow compensation as long as the mental injury arises out of the employment. <em>See, e.g., City of Aurora v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>710 P.2d 1122, 1124 (Colo.Ct.App.1985) (addressing occupational disease); <em>Hansen v. Von Duprin, Inc., </em>507 N.E.2d 573, 576 (Ind.1987); <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14, 389 N.E.2d 83 (1979); <em>Martinez v. University of California, </em>93 N.M. 455, 601 P.2d 425 (1979) (occupational disease).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Other states apply an objective test; that is, a mental injury is compensable if the average worker would have been harmed by the stressful conditions in the workplace. <em>E.g., State v. Cephas, </em>637 A.2d 20, 27 (Del.1994); <em>Sturgis v. District of Columbia Dept. of Employment Servs., </em>629 A.2d 547, 551 (D.C.1993); <em>Goyden v. State Judiciary, </em>256 N.J.Super. 438, 607 A.2d 651, 655 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>128 N.J. 54, 607 A.2d 622 (1992); <em>Wilson v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., </em>542 Pa. 614, 669 A.2d 338, 344 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The third test requires that the claimant prove that the injurious mental stimulus was greater than the usual day-to-day stress experienced in the workplace. <em>E.g., </em>Alaska Stat. \u00a7 23.30.395(17) (1996); Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A, \u00a7 201(3) (1995); Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.802 (1995); R.I.Gen.Laws \u00a7 28-34-2 (1996); <em>Owens v. National Health Labs., 8 </em>Ark.App. 92, 648 S.W.2d 829, 831 (1983); <em>Dunlavey v. Economy Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>526 N.W.2d 845, 853 (Iowa 1995); <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eskridge, </em>604 So.2d 1071, 1073-74 (Miss.1991); <em>Wilson, </em>669 A.2d at 344 (applying both the objective test and the abnormal working condition test); <em>Bedini v. Frost, </em>678 A.2d 893, 894 (Vt.1996); <em>Consolidated Freightways v. Drake, </em>678 P.2d 874, 878 (Wyo.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Finally, some states allow recovery for purely mental injuries only when induced by a traumatic event, shock, or fright in the workplace. <em>E.g., </em>La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 23:1021 (1996); N.M.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52-1-24 (1996); Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 35-1-45.1 (1996); <em>Pathfinder Co. v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>62 Ill.2d 556, 343 N.E.2d 913, 917 (1976); <em>Wolfe v. Sibley, Lindsay, &amp; Curr Co., </em>36 N.Y.2d 505, 509-10, 369 N.Y.S.2d 637, 641-42, 330 N.E.2d 603, 606 (1975); <em>Gatlin v. City of Knoxville, 822 </em>S.W.2d 587, 590 (Tenn.1991); <em>Hercules, Inc. v. Gunther, </em>13 Va.App. 357, 412 S.E.2d 185, 189 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
