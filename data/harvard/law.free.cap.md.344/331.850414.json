More particularly, we address whether, and, if so, under what circumstances, an alibi witness\u2019s pretrial silence is relevant to the impeachment of that witness\u2019s testimony at trial. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City permitted the cross-examination and, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We granted the writ of certiorari at the petitioner\u2019s request and, for the reasons that follow, we too will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Because, rather than the sufficiency of the evidence, the issue in this case pertains to an evidentiary ruling at trial, it is sufficient to recount that the petitioner, who had been identified by the victim as the person who attempted to rob him, was apprehended by the police after a short chase. He was arrested and charged with the attempted robbery of Earl Spain, a State correctional officer. Discovered in his possession was a plastic toy gun, which the victim identified as the weapon used in the attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Consistent with his not guilty plea, the petitioner denied attempting to rob the victim. To substantiate that defense, he called Mr. Kabacca Bey as an alibi witness. According to Mr. Bey, the petitioner was either within his sight or in his presence during the entire time when the victim claimed to have been accosted by the petitioner. More particularly, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>testified to seeing the victim and petitioner engage in conversation on two separate occasions. According to Mr. Bey\u2019s testimony, after each occasion, the victim left the area only to return later. While the victim was away from the area, Mr. Bey testified that he and the petitioner talked together. When the victim returned on the second occasion, the police were with him and the petitioner and other men on the corner ran away, as did Mr. Bey.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">During the cross-examination of Mr. Bey, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">Q [By the prosecutor] You came to court one other day besides this day, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">A Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">Q What day was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">A Tuesday, the 22nd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">Q Did you ever try to speak to anyone in the State\u2019s attorney\u2019s office or the police about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">Q You just wanted to come in and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">A Oh you mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">Q About this case, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">A After, after came here or prior to coming in? No, I told his flane\u00e9, say, you know, that she can tell him that he can, you know, use me as a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">Q But after you came to court, you still didn\u2019t try to talk to the police or State\u2019s attorney\u2019s office\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">MR. ROGERS [Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-18\">Q Did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-19\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-20\">A Why? I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-21\">Q To say this, this couldn\u2019t have happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-22\">A I still don\u2019t understand the question. I don\u2019t know why I would have to go to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-23\">Q Let\u2019s just answer the question. Did you try to talk to the police when you came to court on Tuesday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>A I don\u2019t understand the procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">Q Did you talk to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">A No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">Q Did you make any effort to talk to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">Q Did you try to talk to the State\u2019s attorney\u2019s office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">A No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The State had previously established that Mr. Bey knew the petitioner, the circumstances under which they met and the length of time they had known each other. In addition, the State brought out that Mr. Bey was aware of the petitioner\u2019s arrest and the reason for that arrest. It had shown also when Mr. Bey acquired his knowledge. Finally, the State\u2019s cross-examination revealed that the sources of Mr. Bey\u2019s information were the petitioner\u2019s flane\u00e9 and the man who was with the petitioner on the day of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Absent legislative directive, a citizen ordinarily is not legally obligated to volunteer exculpatory information to law enforcement authorities. <em>See, e.g., State v. Silva, </em>131 N.J. 438, 621 A.2d 17, 21 (1993) (citing <em>State v. Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 523 A.2d 451, 465 (1987)); <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>11 Mass. App.Ct. 288, 416 N.E.2d 218, 224 (1981) <em>cert. denied, </em>383 Mass. 891 (Mass.1981); <em>People v. Brown, </em>62 A.D.2d 715, 405 N.Y.S.2d 691, 695 (N.Y.App.Div.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>48 N.Y.2d 921, 425 N.Y.S.2d 54, 401 N.E.2d 177 (1979); <em>People v. Dawson, </em>50 N.Y.2d 811, 428 N.Y.S.2d 914, 918-19, 406 N.E.2d 771, 775 (1980); <em>United States v. New York Tel. Co., </em>434 U.S. 159, 175-76 n. 24, 98 S.Ct. 364, 373-74 n. 24, 54 L.Ed.2d 376, 385 n. 24 (1977). Therefore, \u201can assumption that it is natural for a defense alibi witness to tell his or her story to the police is not always warranted.\u201d <em>People v. Fuqua, </em>146 Mich.App. 250, 379 N.W.2d 442, 445 (1985) <em>See also Bryant, </em>523 A.2d at 466. This does not mean, however, as some courts have held, that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>alibi witness\u2019s pretrial silence may never be the basis for the impeachment of his or her trial testimony. <em>See e.g. United States v. Young, </em>463 F.2d 934, 938 (D.C.Cir.1972) (\u201c[N]o inference can be drawn from the fact that a witness did not go to the police when he learns they have made an arrest of a defendant for a crime committed at a time for which he could provide alibi testimony.\u201d); <em>Whiteside v. Bordenkircher, </em>435 F.Supp. 68, 71 (1977). Indeed, whether, and under what circumstances, \u201cprior silence is so inconsistent with ... present statements that impeachment by reference to such silence is probative,\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 239, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 2132, 65 L.Ed.2d 86, 93 (1980), are matters left to each jurisdiction to determine as a part of its Rules of Evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The majority of the courts that have considered the issue, while acknowledging that alibi witnesses are not legally bound to report exculpatory evidence to law enforcement authorities, conclude that there is \u201cno sound reason flatly [to] prohibit this type of cross-examination of a defense witness in all criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921-22, 406 N.E.2d at 778. <em>See also People v. Ratliff, </em>189 Cal.App.3d 696, 701, 234 Cal.Rptr. 502 (1987). In fact, some of those courts hold that such impeachment is always appropriate. <em>See e.g., Peterson v. State, </em>166 Ga.App. 719, 305 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1983) (the witness\u2019s failure to inform the authorities of facts which would have tended to absolve his roommate of any criminal wrongdoing was a proper subject for impeachment by the State during cross-examination.); <em>People v. Outlaw, </em>75 Ill.App.3d 626, 31 Ill.Dec. 339, 353, 394 N.E.2d 541, 555 (1979) (\u201c[A] prosecutor [is permitted] to inquire of witnesses as to whether they had told the same story previously in order to determine whether the testimony was recently fabricated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Other courts, indeed, the majority, view the question as whether pretrial silence is relevant to the credibility of the alibi witness\u2019s trial testimony. These courts recognize-that pretrial silence may be relevant to the credibility of exculpatory testimony given at trial, but only if \u201cthe natural impulse of a person possessing exculpatory information would be to come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>forward at the earliest possible moment in order to forestall the mistaken prosecution.... \u201d <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 919, 406 N.E.2d at 775. In that event, they point out, the witness\u2019s pretrial silence \u201cis a form of conduct that may be analogized to a prior inconsistent statement by the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921-22, 406 N.E.2d at 778 (\u201cthe witness\u2019 prior failure to come forward [is admissible] insofar as it casts doubt upon the witness\u2019 in-court statements by reason of its apparent inconsistency\u201d); <em>People v. Van Zile, </em>48 Ill.App.3d 972, 6 Ill.Dec. 747, 752, 363 N.E.2d 429, 434 (1977) (where it would be reasonable for an alibi witness to disclose the exculpatory evidence to the authorities, the inference raised by the witness\u2019s silence is inconsistent with that witness\u2019s testimony); <em>Brown, </em>416 N.E.2d at 224 (\u201c[T]he failure of a witness to offer the information when it would have been natural to do so might well cast doubt on the veracity of the witness\u2019 trial testimony ... [and] is akin to a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 176, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 2136, 45 L.Ed.2d 99, 104 (1975) (\u201c[A]s a preliminary matter ... the court must be persuaded that the statements are indeed inconsistent.... If the government fails to establish a threshold inconsistency between silence at the police station and later exculpatory testimony at the trial, proof of silence lacks any significant probative value and must therefore be excluded.\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Carr, </em>584 F.2d 612, 618 (2nd Cir.1978)(citing <em>U.S. v. Rice, </em>550 F.2d 1364, 1373-74 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 954, 98 S.Ct. 479, 54 L.Ed.2d 312 (1977)); <em>U.S. v. Standard Oil Co., </em>316 F.2d 884 (7th Cir.1963); <em>Silva, </em>621 A.2d at 21 (\u201c[W]hen a court finds that \u2018silence may reasonably be viewed as inconsistent with [the witness\u2019s] testimony ... \u2019 the Rules of Evidence allow cross-examination on the prior inconsistency.\u201d) (Quoting <em>State v. Marshall, </em>260 N.J.Super. 591, 617 A.2d 302, 305 (1992)). Such statements are relevant and, hence, admissible to impeach the witness\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Critical to the relevance determination, <em>i.e., </em>whether the witness\u2019s pretrial silence is inconsistent with his or her trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>testimony exculpating the defendant, is that the natural response of the witness be to come forward, at the earliest possible time, with any exculpatory information regarding the defendant, he or she may have and relate it to the police or the prosecution. Whether, in the given case or situation, such a natural tendency exists is a matter of proof. <em>Brown, </em>416 N.E.2d at 225. The party seeking to impeach the witness has the burden of proof in that regard. <em>Id. </em>Initially this burden can be met by laying a proper foundation, <em>i.e., </em>producing evidence from which it could be concluded that the witness\u2019s pretrial silence is inconsistent with the witness\u2019s pretrial possession of information exculpatory of the defendant. The threshold fact to be established, by way of foundation, is that the natural response of the witness, assuming the witness was in possession of exculpatory evidence, would have been to disclose that information to the proper authorities. From that fact, the inconsistency between his or her pretrial silence and his or her trial testimony may be inferred. <em>Silva, </em>621 A.2d at 22. If that burden is not satisfied \u201cproof of silence lacks any significant probative value and must therefore be excluded.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 176, 95 S.Ct. at 2136, 45 L.Ed.2d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The trial court is charged with making the determination as to whether, under the circumstances of a particular case, an alibi witness\u2019s failure to report exculpatory evidence is relevant, <em>see Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 206, 670 A.2d 398, 413 (1995); <em>Ratliff, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at 702, 234 Cal.Rptr. 502; <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921-22, 406 N.E.2d at 778, and, thus, constitutes grounds for impeachment. <em>State v. Ghere, </em>201 Conn. 289, 513 A.2d 1226, 1234 (1986); <em>Brown, </em>416 N.E.2d at 224-25; <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921-22, 406 N.E.2d at 778. Consequently, determining whether the required foundation has been laid is committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion, which will not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 669, 612 A.2d 258, 278 (1992) (citing <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 401-02, 478 A.2d 1143, 1150 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985)). This means that the court must be persuaded that the witness\u2019s pretrial silence with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the exculpatory testimony and his or her trial testimony are, indeed, inconsistent. That determination is a preliminary one that must be made prior to any inquiry being pursued with regard to the witness\u2019s pretrial silence. <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 176, 95 S.Ct. at 2136, 45 L.Ed.2d at 104. It is preferable that the determination be reflected in an express finding; however, because judges are presumed to know and, properly to have applied, the law, <em>Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 273, 619 A.2d 105, 110 (1993), where the required foundation is itself independently admissible, it may be implicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The determination of the ultimate issue, the credibility of the alibi witness and, in particular, the legitimacy of the alibi he or she provides, is entrusted to the trier of fact, in this case, the jury. <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921-22, 406 N.E.2d at 778; <em>People v. Thomas, </em>191 A.D.2d 600, 595 N.Y.S.2d 72, 73 (1993). Of course, the jury is not bound to accept the trial court\u2019s preliminary determination. That preliminary determination merely explains why, <em>i.e., </em>because it is relevant, the State is permitted to cross-examine the alibi witness regarding his or her pretrial silence. The significance of the witness\u2019s pretrial silence is another matter which must be determined by the jury. <em>State v. Brown, </em>16 Utah 2d 57, 395 P.2d 727, 729 (1964)(\u201c[W]hen a person claims to have ... exculpatory information and remains silent when it would be natural to expect that persons of normal sensibilities and concern for others would speak, that fact may be shown as having a bearing on the credibility of the witness and upon the existence or nonexistence of the facts the witness later comes forward to assert.\u201d). Thus, the trial court, on request, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 4-325(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> must instruct the jury that the alibi witness is not obligated, by law, to report exculpatory evidence he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>may possess to law enforcement authorities and that the jury must determine, based upon the attendant facts and circumstances presented by both the prosecution and the defense, whether the alibi witness\u2019s testimony is credible. <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921-22, 406 N.E.2d at 778; <em>Thomas, </em>595 N.Y.S.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The foundation prescribed by the cases requiring a preliminary determination of relevance consists of evidence that the witness: (1) had a relationship with the defendant sufficient to motivate the witness to act to exonerate the defendant; (2) was aware of the nature of the charges pending against the defendant; (3) had knowledge that he or she was in possession of exculpatory information; and (4) had knowledge of the procedural means by which to make such information available to law enforcement authorities. <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921 n. 4, 406 N.E.2d at 777 n. 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also People v. Kelly, </em>209 A.D.2d 439, 618 N.Y.S.2d 821, 822 (1994); <em>Silva, </em>621 A.2d at 20; <em>Ratliff, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at 696, 234 Cal.Rptr. 502; <em>Bryant, </em>523 A.2d at 466; <em>People v. Watson, </em>94 Ill.App.3d 550, 50 Ill.Dec. 21, 27, 418 N.E.2d 1015, 1021 (1981); <em>People v. McMath, </em>104 Ill.App.2d 302, 244 N.E.2d 330, 336 (1968), <em>aff'd </em>45 Ill.2d 33, 256 N.E.2d 835 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 846, 91 S.Ct. 92, 27 L.Ed.2d 83 (1970); <em>Fuqua, </em>379 N.W.2d at 445. In <em>Brown, </em>416 N.E.2d at 224, the court added to the list of foundational requirements, whether the witness maintained silence at the request of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s counsel or both. <em>See, </em>to the same effect, <em>Commonwealth v. Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 487 N.E.2d 481, 487 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Of the foundational requirements the courts have prescribed, only one of them, the nature of the relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>between the witness and the defendant, directly informs the inquiry whether the natural response of a witness in possession of exculpatory information would be to come forward and disclose that information to the police or the prosecution. If they do so at all, the others inform that inquiry only indirectly. What they do directly is explain why, in a particular case, the witness did, or could, not disclose the exculpatory evidence pretrial. Assuming possession of the requisite information, a close friend, relative, or the like, of the defendant could be expected to act to exonerate the defendant and, so, could be expected to inform the police or the prosecution immediately of any exculpatory evidence he or she possessed. <em>Silva, </em>621 A.2d at 22. It is the relationship of the alibi witness to the defendant that is determinative of that witness\u2019s natural tendency so to respond. Indeed, the cases espousing the majority view recognize that the natural tendency of an alibi witness to report exculpatory information to law enforcement authorities can be inferred from the nature of the relationship between the witness and the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 21 (\u201c[W]hen an alibi witness has a close relationship with the accused, as with the mother/son relationship ... or the brother/sister relationship ... a jury can infer that the alibi witness\u2019 natural conduct would be to report the alibi to the authorities.\u201d); <em>Ghere, </em>513 A.2d at 1235 (\u201c[A] witness in many instances naturally may be expected to convey such information, especially if the witness is friendly with the accused....\u201d); <em>Brown, </em>416 N.E.2d at 224 (\u201c[Tjhere are many situations, however, where the natural response of a person in possession of exculpatory information would be to come forward in order to avoid a mistaken prosecution of a relative or a friend.\u201d); <em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921, 406 N.E.2d at 777 (\u201c[T]he inferences which may be drawn from [a defendant\u2019s] silence may be highly prejudicial. The same cannot always be said for an ordinary witness who may have no personal stake in remaining silent and who, indeed, may very well have a personal interest in speaking up in order to aid the defendant. It is this interest in speaking up which, in a given case, may render the witness\u2019 failure to do so of probative worth when used to impeach his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>testimony.\u201d). The nature of the relationship, including its closeness, may also be dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">An alibi witness\u2019s knowledge of the defendant\u2019s predicament, of the procedure for reporting exculpatory information to the proper authorities, or any other reasons that a witness may be unable to disclose the exculpatory evidence pretrial is not reflective of a natural tendency, on the part of that witness, to act to exonerate the defendant; it simply explains his or her inability to act in compliance with that tendency. The relationship between the alibi witness and the defendant, on the other hand, has an independent relevance. Not only does it directly inform the inquiry whether the witness\u2019s natural response would be to report the alibi to the authorities, but it is also relevant to whether that witness is biased in favor of the defendant. Consequently, whether this factor supports the court\u2019s allowance of the cross-examination is reviewable, even when the court has made no explicit finding with respect to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Requiring a foundation broader than the relationship between the witness and the defendant, to include knowledge of the defendant\u2019s predicament and the means by which to report such information, as well as reasons why, in this particular case, the witness did not disclose the alibi, presents quite a different situation. Under that approach, the relevance of the witness\u2019s pretrial silence depends upon the trial court\u2019s preliminary factual finding as to each of the foundational elements. This is so because the majority view proceeds on the premise that, simply because, under certain circumstances, pretrial silence may be inconsistent with a witness\u2019s possession of exculpatory evidence, it does not follow that it always will be. The question of pretrial relevance is a matter to be determined on a case-by-case basis. As pointed out in <em>Brown,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjT\">There may be ... situations ... where it would not be natural for the witness to offer exculpatory evidence to law enforcement officials. In these circumstances, the witness\u2019s failure to speak is perfectly consistent with his trial testimony. Some individuals, for example, may believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>disclosure of their information to the police would be futile. Indeed, the prosecutor conceded in the present case that the disclosure of the witness\u2019s information would not have led to the defendant\u2019s release. In other situations, the witness may not be aware of the charges against the defendant with sufficient detail to know that he possesses important exculpatory information. Finally, some individuals may have been implicitly told by the defendant\u2019s lawyer not to discuss the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">416 N.E.2d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The relevance of the witness\u2019s pretrial silence is a function of the foundation required to be laid and each component of that foundation involves a factual determination. As noted, only the relationship between the defendant and the alibi witness has independent relevance and, thus, is independently admissible without regard to any tendency it may have to establish the natural impulse of the alibi witness to have disclosed the exculpatory evidence to the authorities. The other \u201cfoundational\u201d requirements initially have relevance only with regard to whether the witness\u2019s pretrial silence constitutes an inconsistency with the witness\u2019s trial testimony and, thus, are only conditionally admissible. They are not relevant to any issue before the court until, and unless, the trial court decides that the witness\u2019s pretrial silence is inconsistent with his in-court testimony and permits the State to cross-examine the witness as to that silence. Once that determination is made, the witness\u2019s credibility on that point is at issue. Knowledge of whether, when, how and to whom exculpatory evidence, possessed by the witness was reported bears on that issue, as well as on the witness\u2019s general credibility, the ultimate determination of both of which is entrusted to the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Thus, in a jury trial, requiring the State to lay a foundation consisting of the witness\u2019s relationship to the defendant, the nature and extent of that witness\u2019s knowledge, including his or her familiarity with the means by which to report exculpatory information to the authorities, where the defendant lodges an objection, a hearing outside the hearing of the jury will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>required. The hearing will permit the trial court to make the required findings of fact on each of the \u201cfoundational\u201d requirements, before the witness\u2019s pretrial silence can be proven. Thereafter, evidence concerning each of those factors is independently admissible. To determine what exculpatory information the witness has, when he or she acquired it, whether he or she is familiar with the means by which to report it, and whether non-disclosure was the result of a request by the defendant or counsel, in the absence of direct evidence, necessarily will require an assessment of the credibility of the witness. <em>See Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921, 406 N.E.2d at 777 (\u201c[T]he information elicited during this type of questioning might well aid the trier of fact in its effort to determine whether the testimony of a defense witness is an accurate reflection of the truth or is, instead, a \u2018recent fabrication.\u2019 \u201d). That ordinarily is a matter for the jury to decide. <em>But see Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 590, 671 A.2d 974, 980 (1996); <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 98-99, 613 A.2d 379, 380-81 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We agree with those cases that hold that an alibi witness\u2019s \u2022 pretrial silence may be relevant to that witness\u2019s credibility. Moreover, we believe that the relevance of that witness\u2019s pretrial silence must be established as a matter of foundation prior to the proponent of the impeachment evidence being allowed to inquire into it. It is enough of a foundation, however, we believe, if the proponent of the impeachment evidence establishes a relationship between the witness and the defendant, or circumstances, such as to permit the trial court to conclude that it would have been a natural impulse on the part of the witness to have come forward with the exculpatory evidence. The latter requirement recognizes that whether it would be natural for a witness with a particular relationship to the defendant to come forward may also depend upon the circumstances existing at the time. The extent of the witness\u2019s knowledge, the timing of its acquisition, etc. are matters, we hold, of defense or explanation, offerable by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>defense, for the purpose of allowing the trier of fact, fully and accurately to evaluate the witness\u2019s testimony. Not only does such evidence not directly relate to the natural impulse of the witness to come forward with exculpatory evidence, but it is not evidence readily available to the prosecution. Since it is more readily available to the defense, it- is more appropriately offered by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We hold that, before the prosecution may cross examine an alibi witness regarding his or her pretrial silence, it must lay a foundation. The foundation consists of establishing the existence of a relationship between the witness and the defendant, or circumstances, such that it would be the natural response of the witness to act to exonerate the defendant, a relationship and/or circumstances of such a nature that, if the witness possessed evidence exculpating the defendant, he or she would disclose it immediately to law enforcement authorities. This is sufficient to give rise to an apparent inconsistency between the witness\u2019 pretrial silence and his or her testimony at trial. <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 176, 95 S.Ct. at 2136, 45 L.Ed.2d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In addition to the fact of pretrial disclosure, those factors which, under the majority view, are characterized as foundational prerequisites, are the \u201cattendant facts and circumstances\u201d, on the basis of which the credibility of the alibi witness\u2019s testimony is to be evaluated. Whether, and when, a witness acquired knowledge making it possible for that witness to provide law enforcement authorities with exculpatory evidence, and his or her awareness of the procedure or means of doing so, do not tend to prove a natural tendency to report exculpatory information and, thus, do not give rise to an impeachable inconsistency; only the relationship between the witness and the defendant gives rise to such an inference. Instead, those matters tend to explain why the witness did not, in the particular case at issue, disclose the exculpatory information. Indeed, that is their only relevance. Consequently, the proponent of the alibi evidence is best situated to present the reasons why, although it would have been natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>to do so, the alibi witness failed to disclose to the authorities information he or she possessed which tended to exculpate the defendant. Such evidence is more logically and appropriately presented on redirect examination, to rehabilitate the alibi witness. To place that burden on the State would be both onerous and illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As we see it, the State may inquire into the alibi witness\u2019s pretrial silence once it has established that the relationship between the witness and the defendant is such that the witness would have a natural tendency to disclose the exculpatory evidence he or she possessed to the proper authorities. Based on that inquiry, , the jury could infer that the witness\u2019s pretrial silence is inconsistent with his or her trial testimony. The defense would then be free to attempt to negate the inconsistency by explaining his or her silence. As the court in <em>State v. Archer, </em>32 N.M. 319, 255 P. 396, 400 (1927) opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">It is well understood that, if the witness, when he has an opportunity to speak, and where it would be natural to speak ... fails to make an important disclosure which he afterwards makes on the stand, it is a circumstance which, although susceptible of explanation, if unexplained, tends-to impair his credibility, and it is error to refuse cross-examination of the witness to develop such facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Thus, we review the judgment of the circuit court to determine whether the record reflects a relationship between Mr. Bey and the petitioner that would support a conclusion that it would have been natural for Mr. Bey to have contacted the police and, therefore, that his failure to do so constitutes a prior inconsistent statement. In this case, the trial court\u2019s finding is implicit. As previously noted, it will not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Oken, </em>327 Md. at 669, 612 A.2d at 278 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The petitioner contends, that \u201c[t]he record does not reflect any reason why Mr. Bey would naturally feel obligated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>to testify on Petitioner\u2019s behalf.\u201d He directs our attention to several cases in which the alibi witnesses were either close friends or relatives of the defendant. <em>See Ratliff, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at 700, 234 Cal.Rptr. 502 (defendant\u2019s sister and close family friends); <em>Egerton, </em>487 N.E.2d at 486 (defendant\u2019s mother and a close friend); <em>Young, </em>463 F.2d at 937 (someone with whom the defendant had worked and socialized).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">There is no prescribed or bright line by which the closeness of the relationship between a defendant and his or her alibi witness must be assessed. While the cases cited by the petitioner all involved alibi witnesses who were close friends or relatives of the defendant, they do not exclude other, less intimate relationships. All that is required is that the relationship be such that it would motivate the witness to come forward in an effort to exculpate the defendant. <em>People v. Figueroa, </em>80 A.D.2d 520, 436 N.Y.S.2d 1, 2-3 (1981) (court excluded proof of silence, reasoning that because the alibi witness was a neighbor, with whom the defendant had had little contact, \u201cthere was [no] connection between the witness and defendant as to provide a basis for an argument of existence of a natural impulse to come forward\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Mr. Bey testified, on cross-examination, regarding the nature of his relationship with the petitioner, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">I met him a few times within a week. First time was like, like the Friday before this incident supposed [sic] to have taken place.... I\u2019ve seen him but we never\u2014I\u2019ve seen him, you know, from a distance.... Well actually he spoke to me because he stopped the cars for me. I was trying to get across the street and I had my crutches and the cars just didn\u2019t seem like they would stop, the ones that was [sic] coming around the corner and he say [sic], man, you need some help, and he came out and he stopped the cars for me.... Well, we actually\u2014Well, we met that time when he was stopping the cars but we actually met when we was [sic] talking about that time and different things and he offered to buy me a beer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA_P\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>He also acknowledged telling the petitioner\u2019s fianc\u00e9, when speaking to her regarding the petitioner\u2019s arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">If there was anything that I could do, you know, to help in the matter, then I was willing to do that because he did it for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and Steve,' the petitioner\u2019s companion on the day of his arrest, divulged to Mr. Bey the details of the petitioner\u2019s arrest. Considered together, the court\u2019s implicit finding that it would have been natural for Mr. Bey to disclose, to the authorities, information he possessed, which could exonerate the petitioner, is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>are analogous to those considered in <em>McMath, supra, </em>244 N.E.2d 330. The alibi witness in that case was a gas station attendant. He was acquainted with the defendant as a result of the defendant frequently being at the gas station. On the night of the robbery with which the defendant was charged, the victim went to the gas station and had the defendant\u2019s alibi witness place a call to the police, reporting the crime. Although the witness spoke to the police and witnessed the defendant being arrested, he did not tell the police that the defendant had been at the gas station at the time that the victim was being robbed. The trial court permitted the gas station attendant to be cross-examined regarding his pretrial silence. The Illinois intermediate appellate court affirmed, opining,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">Sutton knew that there had been a robbery and had even placed the call to the police as soon as he had learned of it. When the police arrived, he had discussed the robbery with them and knew that they were investigating it.... It was a fair argument on behalf of the State that a man who knew the defendant well ... would have mentioned something to the police when given the opportunity to speak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">244 N.E.2d at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">We reach the same conclusion on the facts before us. Given Mr. Bey\u2019s testimony describing his relationship to the defendant, and the attendant circumstances, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting him to be cross-examined as to his pretrial silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The petitioner also contends that the State failed to prove, as it was required to do as a foundational prerequisite to cross-examining Mr. Bey concerning his pretrial silence, that Mr. Bey was aware of the nature and seriousness of the charges against the petitioner<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or that he was aware of the procedural means to disclose exculpatory information to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. Inasmuch as we do not view these matters as foundational,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but rather as explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tory of why the witness did not disclose the exculpatory information pretrial, and so, are matters addressed to the jury to assist it in evaluating the alibi witness\u2019s credibility, there was no error. The trial court simply was not required to resolve those issues, whether disputed or not. And since no exceptions were taken to the jury instructions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we presume that the jury was adequately instructed and complied with the instructions it was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONER.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">RAKER, J., concurs with opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">ELDRIDGE, J., dissents with opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-6\">.

To be sure, the witness testified that he did not understand the procedure for disclosure of exculpatory evidence to the police.

State, </em>325 Md. 552, 578-80, 602 A.2d 677, 689-90 (1992); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 646-61, 350 A.2d 665, 670-79 (1976). I do not believe there was any reasonable possibility that evidence of Mr. Bey\u2019s failure to come forward to the police contributed to the jury\u2019s decision to find Petitioner guilty. We must credit jurors with a modicum of common sense. It is unlikely that jurors would conclude that Mr. Bey lacked credibility simply because he did not go to the police or the State\u2019s Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>with exculpatory evidence. <em>See </em>Dissenting op. at 354. This testimony had little, if any, bearing on the witness\u2019s credibility. The witness provided a plausible explanation for his failure to come forward to the authorities. The eyewitness, Mr. Spain, testified to his extensive opportunity to observe Petitioner at the time of the crime, and he identified Petitioner on the street immediately prior to and at the time of the arrest. The police officer testified to Petitioner\u2019s flight. There was no reasonable possibility that this evidence contributed to the guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Whether the failure of an alibi witness to go to the authorities with exculpatory evidence has any probative value has been the subject of many appellate opinions. <em>See </em>Annot., <em>Impeachment of Defense Witness in Criminal Case by Showing Witness\u2019 Prior Silence or Failure or Refusal to Testify, </em>20 A.L.R.4th 245 (1983). I agree with the observation of the Court of Special Appeals that there are some people who would shout from the rooftops in an effort to exculpate a friend or a relative whom they believe has been wrongfully accused. <em>Williams v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 711, 719, 639 A.2d 180, 184 (1994). As Judge Eldridge notes, however, some would not do so. Dissenting op. at 354. Other appellate courts have also recognized that many citizens might not go to the authorities out of mistrust or fear, or because they feel their efforts would be futile, or because they were instructed not to come forward by the defendant\u2019s attorney. <em>See, e.g., People v. Dawson, </em>50 N.Y.2d 311, 428 N.Y.S.2d 914, 920-22, 406 N.E.2d 771, 777-78 (1980). This conflict does not mean, however, that an alibi witness\u2019s pre-trial silence may never be the basis for impeachment. <em>See State v. Silva, </em>131 N.J. 438, 621 A.2d 17, 22 (1993) (agreeing with <em>Dawson </em>court that although witness\u2019s silence may have low probative value, no sound reason exists to flatly prohibit this type of cross-examination). The difficulty is in fashioning an appropriate test.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">I cannot subscribe to the evidentiary test crafted by the majority, nor can I find that the test is satisfied by the record in this case. Indeed, under any test, the evidence was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>relevant. The alibi witness hardly knew Petitioner. In fact, when asked how long he had known Petitioner, Mr. Bey testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Well, actually I don\u2019t really know him. I seen him a few times. Within a week I seen him about three or four times. First time is when he helped me across the street and every other time I seen him in passing, so I don\u2019t know him well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL2\">I agree with Judge Eldridge when he observes that this is hardly the type of relationship warranting the finding of a \u201cnatural impulse.\u201d Dissenting op. at 355-356. Applying the <em>Dawson </em>test, or the majority\u2019s test, the cross-examination should not have been permitted. In addition to the lack of a sufficient relationship between the witness and Petitioner, the witness lacked the knowledge of the \u201creporting\u201d procedure. Moreover, the witness disclosed the information to Petitioner\u2019s fiancee, with an offer to testify at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I do not disagree that the nature of the relationship between a defendant and an alibi witness is a key factor in determining whether the witness would have been motivated to contact the authorities to disclose exculpatory evidence. I believe, however, that the additional foundational requirements set forth by the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>People v. Dawson, </em>50 N.Y.2d 311, 428 N.Y.S.2d 914, 921 n. 4, 921-23, 406 N.E.2d 771, 777 n. 4, 778-79 (1980), constitute a better test than that adopted by the majority today. <em>See also State v.

In <em>Dawson, </em>the Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">In most cases, the District Attorney may lay a \u201cproper foundation\u201d for this type of cross-examination by first demonstrating that the witness was aware of the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>charges pending against the defendant, had reason to recognize that he possessed exculpatory information, had a reasonable motive for acting to exonerate the defendant and, finally, was familiar with the means to make such information available to law enforcement authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><em>Dawson, </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921 n. 4, 406 N.E.2d at 777 n. 4. The <em>Dawson </em>test takes into account the notion that there may be explanations about why a witness would not go to the police with exculpatory evidence. The test created by the majority is far too limited. I believe the <em>Dawson </em>test will better assist the trier of fact in determining whether the testimony of the alibi witness \u201cis an accurate reflection of the truth or is, instead, a \u2018recent fabrication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>428 N.Y.S.2d at 921, 406 N.E.2d at 777.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">. The record reflects the following facts.

The majority reasons that the \u201cnatural impulse\u201d of an alibi witness would be to tell the police or state\u2019s attorney office prior to testifying that he or she has information exonerating the defendant, and failure to do so reflects negatively on the witness\u2019s credibility. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In my view, in large areas of society today, the average citizen\u2019s natural impulse may well be to have as little to do with the law enforcement authorities as possible. Consequently, in a criminal case, an alibi witness\u2019s credibility ordinarily should not be impugned solely because the witness did not previously contact the police or prosecutor. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s holding today improperly burdens the defendant by placing the responsibility on the defense to explain a witness\u2019s prior failure to contact law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">I fully agree with the principle of evidence law that there are circumstances whereby prior silence may amount to an inconsistent statement and thus may be used to impeach the testimony of the witness. I seriously doubt, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>such circumstances usually include the earlier failure of an alibi witness, in a criminal prosecution, to have contacted law enforcement authorities and given information about the defendant. In the majority of criminal cases, this failure is sufficiently ambiguous that it lacks significant probative value regarding the credibility of an alibi witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In these times, with the vast majority of serious criminal cases involving street crimes, crimes of violence, and drug-related crimes, I question the proposition that there is a natural tendency, by most of the average defendant\u2019s acquaintances, to go forward to the police or the prosecutor with exculpatory information. Whether this is because many people are suspicious of government, or is due to a perceived governmental failure to stem the amount of violent and drug-related crime, or is due to abusive or arrogant conduct by a minority of law enforcement officers, or results from a combination of these or other factors, I do not know. Nonetheless, many persons want to have as little to do with the police as possible. That this may be unfortunate does not make it any less of a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The majority adopts the assumption expressed in the leading case of <em>People v. Dawson, </em>50 N.Y.2d 311, 318, 428 N.Y.S.2d 914, 918-19, 406 N.E.2d 771, 775 (1980), where the Court of Appeals of New York stated that \u201cthere exists a wide variety of situations in which the natural impulse of a person possessing exculpatory information would be to come forward at the earliest moment in order to forestall the mistaken prosecution of a friend or loved one.\u201d In <em>Dawson, </em>the impeached alibi witness was the defendant\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The New York Court of Appeals, holding that the impeachment of the mother based on her silence prior to trial was appropriate, implicitly recognized that the mother/child relationship is a unique one, involving perhaps the most protective and strong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>est bond between individuals. Thus, the Court assumed that, as a result of this bond, a mother would feel compelled to tell law enforcement authorities of information that would exonerate her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The theory applied in the <em>Dawson </em>case seems to contemplate a perfect society where, as to every mother/child relationship, a protective impulse exists that would cause a mother to give police and prosecutors information to exonerate her child prior to trial. We do not live in a perfect society, however, as indicated by daily news stories that document the breakdown in family relationships, including mother/child relationships. Moreover, even with respect to strong mother/child relationships, I am dubious about drawing the inference that exculpatory information, if true, would almost always be relayed to the police or to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Moreover, even assuming that we should follow the decision in the <em>Dawson </em>case, I would not extend the principle of that case to relationships not as close as the relationship between mother/child. The instant case illustrates the fallacy of extending the principle announced in <em>Dawson, </em>under the guise that a \u201cnatural impulse\u201d exists, to include relationships that are not among the closest of familial or personal relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The defendant\u2019s alibi witness, Mr. Bey, seems to have been, at best, an acquaintance or casual friend of the defendant; there is no indication that he was a relative of the defendant or an extremely close friend. Indeed, from the majority\u2019s opinion all that can be discerned about the relationship between Mr. Bey and the defendant is that they knew one another for a certain length of time. This is hardly the type of relationship warranting the finding of a \u201cnatural impulse.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Cf. People v. Ratliff, </em>189 Cal.App.3d 696, 234 Cal.Rptr. 502 (1987) (defendant\u2019s sister and friend); <em>State v. Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 523 A.2d 451 (1987) (defendant\u2019s mother, stepfather, and friend); <em>State v. Miller, </em>259 Kan. <em>478, 912 </em>P.2d 722 (1996) (girlfriend and relatives of defendant as alibi witnesses); Com. <em>v. Brown, </em>11 Mass.App.Ct. 288, 416 N.E.2d 218 (1981) (defendant\u2019s step-sister and friend); <em>People v.

Walloe, </em>472 Pa. 473, 372 A.2d 788 (1977) (defendant\u2019s sisters).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The majority holds that this nebulous relationship between the defendant and Mr. Bey is all that the prosecution must prove in establishing the foundation for asking why Mr. Bey did not go to the police or to the state\u2019s attorney office with his information. This is so despite the majority\u2019s initial assertion (Opinion at 340) that, in addition to showing that the witness has a relationship with the defendant, a proper foundation requires evidence that the witness knew that the defendant has been charged with the crime, knew that the information he or she possesses is exculpatory, and knew the procedures for submitting information to the authorities. Although the majority refers to all four factors as \u201cfoundational requirements,\u201d it ultimately concludes (Opinion at 344-345, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cMoreover, we believe that the relevance of that pretrial witness\u2019s silence must be established as a matter of foundation prior to the proponent of the impeachment evidence being allowed to inquire into it. It is enough of a foundation, however, we believe, if the proponent of the impeach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ment evidence establishes a relationship between the witness and the defendant, or circumstances, such as to permit the trial court to conclude that it would have been a natural impulse on the part of the witness to have come forward with the exculpatory evidence. <em>The extent of the witness\u2019s knowledge, the timing of its acquisition, etc. are matters, we hold, of defense or explanation, offerable by the defense</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Thus, the majority ultimately places the burden on the defense for explaining how any relationship between the alibi witnesses and the defendant does not warrant an inference of non-credibility from inaction. Once the prosecutor has established that the alibi witness knows the defendant, even tangentially, the prosecution is then free to impeach the witness because the witness did not initially search out the police or the state\u2019s attorney. The majority suggests that the witness may be rehabilitated by redirect examination, such as having the witness explain that he or she did not know how to contact the police or the state\u2019s attorney office. The majority creates an unfair presumption in favor of the state by requiring only that the prosecutor show that there is a relationship between the defendant and the witness, and, as illustrated today, only that this relationship is that of a mere acquaintance.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In contrast, other jurisdictions following the \u201cnatural impulse\u201d theory invoked by the majority do require that the foundational criteria be met before proceeding with the question of whether the alibi witness conveyed his or her information to law enforcement authorities prior to testifying. <em>See People v. Dawson, supra, </em>50 N.Y.2d at 321 n. 4, 428 N.Y.S.2d at 921 n. 4, 406 N.E.2d at 777 n. 4 (the prosecution must establish that \u201cwitness was aware of the ... charges ..., recognize[d] that he possessed exculpatory information, had a reasonable motive for acting to exonerate the defendant and., was familiar with the means to make such information available to law enforcement authorities\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., People v. Ratliff, supra </em>189 Cal.App.3d at 701, 234 Cal.Rptr. at 504-505; <em>State v. Bryant, supra, </em>202 Conn, at 705, 523 A.2d at 466; <em>State v. Silva, supra, </em>131 N.J. at 447-448, 621 A.2d at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The testimony from the trial transcript cited by the majority indicates that not only was the alibi witness in the present case lacking knowledge as to the procedural means to inform the authorities of his information but was prevented from explaining that lack of knowledge. The colloquy between the state\u2019s attorney and Mr. Bey, cited by the majority, suggests that Mr. Bey was unaware of the procedure necessary to go to the police. More importantly, the very foundation that is required to be established in most jurisdictions, that the witness knew of the procedure by which to inform law enforcement authorities, was undermined when the prosecution prevented Mr. Bey from explaining his lack of awareness and proceeded to allow the witness only to answer with a yes/no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In my view, the trial court erred by permitting the prosecutor to impeach the alibi witness by the testimony that the witness did not \u201ctry to talk to the police or the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.\u201d Under the circumstances, this had no bearing on the witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">. Although, the defendant also called his father and aunt as alibi witnesses, the Court of Appeals of New York held that the defendant did not preserve the issue of whether these witnesses\u2019 prior silence could be used to impeach their trial testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">. The majority's own recitation of the facts of the instant case counters its assumption that most alibi witnesses would go to the police at some point to convey their exculpatory information. As the majority states (Opinion at 334), \"when the victim returned on the second occasion [to the area where the crime occurred], the police were with him and the petitioner and other men on the corner ran away, <em>as did Mr. Bey.\" </em>If Mr. Bey ran from the police at the time of the incident between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>victim and the defendant, why should it be assumed that he would ever feel compelled to go to the police?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
