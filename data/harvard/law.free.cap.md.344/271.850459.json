A group comprised of local landowners, environmental organizations and citizens\u2019 groups challenged the Department\u2019s decision by filing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County an action for judicial review under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1995 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The circuit court dismissed the action on the ground that none of the plaintiffs had standing to seek review of the Department\u2019s decision. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Sugarloaf v. Dept. of Environment, </em>103 Md.App. 269, 653 A.2d 506 (1995). We issued a writ of certiorari to determine whether the two courts below correctly interpreted and applied Maryland law regarding standing to maintain actions for judicial review of adjudicatory administrative decisions. Since we shall hold that both courts below erred with respect to standing, we shall also determine whether the administrative deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sion should be upheld on the merits in light of the judicial review criteria set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10-222(h)(3) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) owned a tract of land, containing over 1,000 acres, in the Dickerson area of Montgomery County, Maryland. Two generating stations operated by PEPCO and auxiliary structures were on the tract. In 1987, PEPCO and Montgomery County entered into a transaction whereby the County purchased a 35-acre portion of the PEPCO tract to build a Resource Recovery Facility which would incinerate solid waste and would produce energy for sale to PEPCO. The facility was to be designed and constructed jointly by Montgomery County and the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Among the several plaintiffs who opposed the construction of this facility were the Buchanans, owners of approximately 234 acres of land immediately adjacent to the PEPCO tract. About two hundred of the Buchanans\u2019 acres are devoted to farming, while the remaining acreage constitute woodland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Buchanans\u2019 property is located approximately 2,000 feet from the facility, and is separated from the PEPCO property by a narrow road.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In 1988 Montgomery County and the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority filed an application with the Department for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>permit, the first permit in the PSD permit process required by the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401 <em>et seq., </em>the Maryland Air Quality Control statutes, Code (1982, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Title 2 of the Environment Article, and implemented by the Air Management Administration of the Maryland Department of the Environment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The present case had its genesis in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sugarloaf v. Waste Disposal, </em>323 Md. 641, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991) <em>(Sugarloaf </em>I), where some of the present plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to a \u201ccontested case\u201d administrative hearing on the application by the County and the Authority for the PSD approval permit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In rejecting this argument, we held that, although a full contested case hearing was available upon an application for a construction permit, it was not available at the PSD approval stage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court did not, however, determine whether any of the plaintiffs would have standing to seek judicial review of a Department decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>to issue a construction permit. <em>Sugarloaf I, supra, </em>323 Md. at 650-651 n. 6, 594 A.2d at 1119 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sugarloaf I, </em>the Secretary of the Department delegated authority to the Office of Administrative Hearings, under Code (1984, 1995 Repl-Vol.), \u00a7 10-207 of the State Government Article, to hold a contested case hearing on the issue of whether a permit to construct should be issued to the applicants. The Secretary later expanded this authority to include consideration of whether a .refuse disposal permit should be issued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Secretary also requested that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) \u201center<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tain arguments on the issue of standing and make findings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, Administrative Law Judge Suzanne S. Wagner conducted a 15-day hearing on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">After the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ submitted an opinion containing extensive findings and conclusions as well as a proposed order. The ALJ concluded: (1) the construction and refuse disposal permit applications conformed to applicable federal and state law, and the permits should be issued; (2) all of the plaintiffs lacked standing either under the Maryland Environmental Standing Act, Code (1974, 1989 RepLVol., 1995 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 1-501 through 1-508 of the Natural Resources Article, or under Maryland common law principles of standing embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10-222(a) of the State Government Article, to bring an action challenging the Department\u2019s decision to issue the permits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Department adopted, without modification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s findings, conclusions, and proposed decision, and issued the two permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The plaintiffs then brought the present action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking judicial review of the final administrative decision. The circuit court, in a brief order, dismissed the action on the ground that all of the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek judicial review of the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, agreeing that the plaintiffs lacked standing, affirmed. <em>Sugarloaf v. Dept. of Environment, supra, </em>103 Md.App. 269, 653 A.2d 506. In its opinion, the Court of Special Appeals indicated that the standing issue in the present case concerned the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to bring a judicial review action in the circuit court and not their standing to be parties at the administrative hearing. The intermediate appellate court thus stated (103 Md.App. at 277, 653 A.2d at 510):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cTo have standing under common law principles to challenge a final order or decision of an administrative agency entered in a contested case, a person must show two things\u2014that he was a party to the administrative proceeding and that he is \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by the agency\u2019s order or decision. <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, supra, </em>327 Md. 596, 612 A.2d 241 (1992); <em>Bailey v. Dep\u2019t. of Public Safety, </em>333 Md. 397, 635 A.2d 432 (1994). There is no question here that appellants were parties to the administrative proceeding; with the county\u2019s acquiescence, they were permitted to participate in the proceeding, and they did participate by giving evidence and presenting argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The only question is whether any of them were \u2018aggrieved,\u2019 in the legal sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The Court of Special Appeals also pointed out that, in determining whether the plaintiffs were \u201caggrieved\u201d by the final administrative decision and thus had standing to bring a judicial review action, a court may look to the evidence adduced at the administrative hearing as well as the pleadings and any evidence submitted to the circuit court. The Court of Special Appeals, however, went further and held that, in determining whether plaintiffs had standing to bring a judicial review action, the findings and conclusions of the ALJ regarding standing could be accepted if supported by substantial evidence. The intermediate appellate court stated (103 Md. App. at 279, 653 A.2d at 511):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cWhere ... the issue of standing has been litigated at the administrative level and findings based on substantial evidence have been made, the court need not relitigate that issue <em>de novo.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The Court of Special Appeals reviewed some of the evidence concerning the emission of \u201ctoxic and potentially harmful\u201d substances from the facility, and a \u201cstudy carried out for Montgomery County ... showing that more of these emissions will likely fall on [plaintiffs\u2019] properties than on properties much farther from the site.\u201d 103 Md.App. at 280, 653 A.2d at 511. The appellate court next pointed to the ALJ\u2019s findings discounting certain evidence that the emissions \u201c \u2018may have unacceptable levels of ... arsenic, mercury, dioxins, and PCB\u2019s,\u2019 \u201d and the ALJ\u2019s findings that the emissions would be \u201cinsignificant or well within acceptable limits established by national health and environmental agencies.\u201d 103 Md.App. at 281, 653 A.2d at 512. The Court of Special Appeals then concluded <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201cAs we have indicated, where the issue of standing has been fully litigated by the agency, parties do not achieve the status of aggrieved persons <em>gratis, </em>or based on bare allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>tions, or solely on evidence they have produced. A court is entitled to credit the agency\u2019s findings if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support them. Here, there was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision on the standing issue, and we granted the petition. During oral argument the respondents took the position that, if this Court were to conclude that the decisions below concerning standing were erroneous, then this Court could decide the merits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The petitioners, in their rebuttal argument, stated that they were \u201cready\u201d to have the case decided on the merits but that they would like to brief the merits first.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Subsequently, this Court issued an order directing the parties to file supplemental briefs as to whether the Department\u2019s decision \u201cshould be affirmed, reversed, modified, or the case remanded to the agency for further proceedings, in light of the judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>criteria set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act....\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Both sides have filed extensive supplemental briefs, with additional record extracts, on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The decisions below appear to reflect some confusion between standing to be a party at the administrative level and standing to maintain a judicial review action in the circuit court, as well as confusion over the appropriate roles of an administrative agency and a reviewing court with regard to each type of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The cases in this Court, and the language of the Administrative Procedure Act itself, \u00a7 10\u2014222(a)(1) of the State Government Article, recognize a distinction between standing to be a party to an administrative proceeding and standing to bring an action in court for judicial review of an administrative decision. Thus, a person may properly be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>party at an agency hearing under Maryland\u2019s \u201crelatively lenient standards\u201d for administrative standing but may not have standing in court to challenge an adverse agency decision. <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l v. Smith, </em>333 Md. 3, 11, 633 A.2d 855, 859 (1993). <em>See Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 611-614, 612 A.2d 241, 248-250 (1992) (organization was a party at the administrative proceeding but lacked standing to maintain a judicial review action.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The requirements for administrative standing under Maryland law are not very strict. Absent a statute or a reasonable regulation specifying criteria for administrative standing, one may become a party to an administrative proceeding rather easily. In holding that a particular individual was properly a party at an administrative hearing, Judge J. Dudley Digges for the Court in <em>Morris v. Howard Res. &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>278 Md. 417, 423, 365 A.2d 34, 37 (1976), explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cHe was present at the hearing before the Board, testified as a witness and made statements or arguments as to why the amendments to the zoning regulations should not be approved. This is far greater participation than that previously determined sufficient to establish one as a party before an administrative agency. <em>See, e.g., Baxter v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 111, 113, 235 A.2d 536 (1967) (per curiam) (submitting name in writing as a protestant); <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 143, 230 A.2d 289, 293-94 (1967) (testifying before agency); <em>Hertelendy v. Montgomery Cty., </em>245 Md. 554, 567, 226 A.2d 672, 680 (1967) (submitting into evidence letter of protest); <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 184, 213 A.2d 487, 489 (1965) (identifying self on agency record as a party to proceedings); <em>Brashears v. Lindenbaum, </em>189 Md. 619, 628, 56 A.2d 844, 849 (1948) (same). Bearing in mind that the format for proceedings before administrative agencies is intentionally designed to be informal so as to encourage citizen participation, we think that absent a reasonable agency or other regulation providing for a more formal method of becoming a party, anyone clearly identifying himself to the agency for the record as having an interest in the outcome of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>matter being considered by that agency, thereby becomes a party to the proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">More recently, Judge McAuliffe for the Court in <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l v. Smith, supra, </em>333 Md. at 10, 633 A.2d at 859, summarized Maryland law relating to status as a party in administrative proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\"><em>\u201cMorris </em>and other cases of this Court indicate that the threshold for establishing oneself as a party before an administrative agency is indeed low. Although we have said that one\u2019s presence at the hearing and testimony in favor of an asserted position is sufficient, <em>id., </em>we have also said that personal appearance and testimony at the hearing are not required. <em>Hertelendy v. Montgomery Cty., </em>245 Md. 554, 567, 226 A.2d 672 (1967); <em>Largo Civic Ass\u2019n v. Pr. Geo\u2019s Co., </em>21 Md.App. 76, 81, 318 A.2d 834 (1974). In fact, it has been held to be sufficient that the hearing examiner considered the appellant to be a party, <em>Northampton Corp. v. Pr. George\u2019s Co., </em>21 Md.App. 625, 633-34, 321 A.2d 204, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>273 Md. 93, 327 A.2d 774 (1974), or that the appellant\u2019s name was submitted to the Board of Appeals as one who would be aggrieved by an adverse decision. <em>Wright v. McCubbin, </em>260 Md. 11, 14, 271 A.2d 365 (1970). <em>See also Baxter v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 111, 113, 235 A.2d 536 (1967) (submitting name in writing as a protestant is sufficient); <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 143, 230 A.2d 289 (1967) (testifying before agency is sufficient); <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 184, 213 A.2d 487 (1965) (identifying self on agency record as a party is sufficient).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"><em>See Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, supra, </em>327 Md. at 611-612, 612 A.2d at 248-249.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">For a person or entity to maintain an action under the Administrative Procedure Act for judicial review of an administrative decision, the person or entity \u201cmust both be a \u2018party\u2019 to the administrative proceedings and be \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by the final decision of the agency.\u201d <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, supra, </em>327 Md. at 611, 612 A.2d at 248. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>222(a)(1) of the State Government Article; <em>Bailey v. Dep\u2019t. of Public Safety, </em>333 Md. 397, 405, 635 A.2d 432, 436 (1994); <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l v. Smith, supra, </em>333 Md. at 11, 633 A.2d at 859 (\u201cEstablishing the [plaintiffs] status as a party to the proceedings before the Board of Appeals completes only half of the required analysis; the [plaintiff] must also be aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision in order to have standing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">While the term \u201caggrieved\u201d is not defined in the Administrative Procedure Act, we have held that the statutory requirement that a party be \u201c\u2018aggrieved\u2019 mirrors general common law standing principles applicable to judicial review of administrative decisions.\u201d <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, supra, </em>327 Md. at 611 n. 9, 612 A.2d at 248-249 n. 9; <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 143-146, 230 A.2d 289, 294-295 (1967). Accordingly, in order to be \u201caggrieved\u201d for purposes of judicial review, a person ordinarily must have an interest \u201c \u2018such that he is personally and specifically affected in a way different from ... the public generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, supra, </em>327 Md. at 611 n. 9, 612 A.2d at 248-249 n. 9, quoting <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., supra, </em>247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d at 294. <em>See Maryland-Nat\u2019l v. Smith, supra, </em>333 Md. at 11, 633 A.2d at 859; <em>Abramson v. Montgomery County, </em>328 Md. 721, 733, 616 A.2d 894, 900 (1992); <em>DuBay v.

If there were a statutory provision or a regulation setting forth criteria for administrative standing, the Secretary\u2019s request would have been appropriate. Under such circumstances, the ALJ could properly make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>findings and conclusions concerning administrative standing. No party in the instant case, however, has called to our attention any statute or regulation prescribing criteria for administrative standing in a case like this, and we are not aware of any such statute or regulation. Consequently, under the decisions of this Court discussed above, the plaintiffs were appropriately accorded standing as parties to the administrative hearing. There was no proper issue of administrative standing to be resolved by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The ALJ, however, did in fact render findings and conclusions with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 standing, holding that the plaintiffs would not be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the issuance of the permits and that, therefore, they did not \u201chave standing to challenge the administrative decisions.\u201d The ALJ purported to apply the case law dealing with standing in court to maintain a judicial review action. If the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 standing were intended to relate to administrative standing, the ALJ clearly applied an erroneous standard. Moreover, as pointed out previously, the plaintiffs were in fact properly accorded administrative standing. The plaintiffs\u2019 status at the administrative hearing was simply a non-issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">If, on the other hand, the ALJ was rendering findings and conclusions on the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to maintain a judicial review action, which appears more likely and which was the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the ALJ\u2019s opinion, then the ALJ went beyond her proper role. In addition, the Court of Special Appeals erred in according any deference to the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions concerning judicial standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Under basic principles of administrative law, as well as the separation of powers requirement set forth in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it is not the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>function of an administrative official or agency in the executive branch of government to decide whether a plaintiff or potential plaintiff has standing to maintain an action in court. The purpose of the \u201cContested Cases\u201d subtitle of the Administrative Procedure Act is \u201cto resolve disputes in administrative prceedings,\u201d Code (1984, 1995 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-201(1) of the State Government Article, and <em>not </em>to resolve disputes in judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The General Assembly may, of course, enact legislation affecting a person\u2019s standing to bring a type of action in court or prescribing criteria for standing to bring such an action. <em>See, e.g., State Administrative Bd. v. Election Bd. of Balt., </em>342 Md. 586, 596-597, 679 A.2d 96, 101 (1996); <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, supra, </em>327 Md. at 614-623, 612 A.2d at 250-255; <em>Boulden v.

Nevertheless, with respect to the allocation of functions between administrative agencies and the judiciary, the determination of whether a person has standing to maintain an action in court is exclusively a judicial function. <em>See, generally, Attorney General v.

Montgomery Co., supra, </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A.2d 289. The <em>Bryniarski </em>opinion pointed out that, when \u201c[a] person whose property is far removed from the subject property\u201d faces a challenge in court to his standing, and therefore attempts to establish in court that he is aggrieved by an administrative zoning decision, he may rely on \u201cevidence\u201d before the agency, as well as evidence before the court, to show \u201cthat his personal or property rights are specially and adversely affected by the [administrative] action.\u201d 247 Md. at 145, 230 A.2d at 295. The opinion in <em>Bryniarski </em>did not suggest that it would be appropriate for the administrative agency to render findings and conclusions with regard to standing in court, or that a reviewing court should give any deference to administrative findings and conclusions when deciding whether the plaintiff was entitled to maintain an action for judicial review. Instead, <em>Bryniarski </em>clearly viewed the resolution of the standing dispute to be exclusively a judicial function. Thus, the Court in <em>Bryniarski </em>referred to the standing issue as having been \u201cdetermined <em>by the courts </em>on a case by case basis,\u201d and, in commenting on a prior case, <em>Bryniarski </em>referred to findings of the <em>\u201ctrial court </em>... on conflicting evidence, that the protestant was a person aggrieved.\u201d 247 Md. at 144-145, 230 A.2d at 294-295, emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The other cases in this Court have also treated the question of standing to maintain a judicial review action as a matter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>be resolved exclusively by the courts. Thus, in <em>Town of Somerset v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>245 Md. 52, 63, 225 A.2d 294, 301 (1966), Judge Oppenheimer for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u201cWhen the issue of the standing of an appellant to [seek judicial review] is raised in the court in which review of the administrative action is asked, we have approved the practice of trial judges in permitting testimony on the point to be taken before them, <em>see e.g., Chatham Corp. v.

The question is not one of taking additional testimony on the merits of the substantive issues decided by the Board [compare <em>Suburban Properties, Inc. v. Mayor and Council of Rockville, </em>241 Md. 1, 5-6, 215 A.2d 200 (1965) and cases therein cited], but of determining whether the appellants have the requisite standing to have those issues reviewed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><em>See, e.g., Maryland-Nat\u2019l v.

While recognizing that there was evidence showing that more toxic substances from the incinerator would likely fall on the plaintiffs\u2019 properties than on properties much farther from the incinerator, the Court of Special Appeals relied on administrative findings \u201cthat the probable emissions from the [incinerator] would be insignificant or well within acceptable limits established by national health and environmental agencies.\u201d <em>Sugarloaf v. Dept. of Environment, supra, </em>103 Md.App. at 281, 653 A.2d at 511-512. The Court of Special Appeals pointed out that the ALJ discounted conclusions from the Department of Natural Resources that \u201cunacceptable levels of ... arsenic, mercury, dioxins, and PCBs\u201d may fall on nearby farm ponds. 103 Md.App. at 281, 653 A.2d at 512. Because, in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 view, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s findings that the plaintiffs would not suffer \u201cactual ... harm\u201d and that emissions falling on their properties would be insignificant or \u201cwithin acceptable limits,\u201d 103 Md.App. at 280-281, 653 A.2d at 511-512, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the ALJ\u2019s views regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of standing should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Presumably, if the ALJ had found that the emissions from the incinerator would have been harmful to nearby property owners, or if the level of emissions were found to have been \u201cunacceptable,\u201d the permits would not have been issued. Thus, under the analysis by the Court of Special Appeals, the issue of whether any of the plaintiffs were sufficiently affected to have standing, and the issue of whether the permits should have been granted, became identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Moreover, the applicants and the Department take the same approach before this Court, arguing that, since the level of emissions upon any of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties were found to have been \u201cacceptable\u201d under government air quality standards, none of the plaintiffs was sufficiently \u201charmed\u201d to have standing to challenge in court the issuance of the permits. During oral argument before this Court, counsel for the applicants and the Department frankly acknowledged that, in their view, the standing issue and the merits were the same.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In cases involving challenges to administrative land use decisions, there is a distinction between standing in court to obtain review of the governmental action and the merits of the challenger\u2019s position. Thus, in <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., supra, </em>247 Md. at 145-146, 230 A.2d at 295, involving the administrative grant of a special exception permitting the construction and operation of an apartment hotel, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">\u201cThe status of a person to [obtain judicial review] as a \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 is to be distinguished from the result on the merits of the case itself.... If, on the merits, the board acted properly in approving the application, the protesting property owner is not damaged <em>in law, </em>however much he may be damaged <em>in fact. </em>His damage is then <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>Because the result on the merits might be adverse, however, does not mean that the protes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tant would not have status to challenge the board\u2019s action.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Court in <em>Bryniarski </em>went on to hold that evidence indicating that there would be an increase in traffic in the area because of the apartment hotel was sufficient to give landowners, who were \u201ccontiguous or close in proximity\u201d to the proposed hotel, standing to challenge in court the grant of a special exception. Such persons would have standing even if it were ultimately determined that the increase in traffic was not so great as to require denial of the special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Similarly, with respect to a facility discharging toxins into the air pursuant to a permit, a nearby property owner may be subject to greater emissions than the public generally but, nevertheless, the amount falling upon the nearby property owner might be within \u201cacceptable\u201d limits. The impact upon a nearby property owner may well be different from the impact upon the general public but may not amount to legally cognizable harm. Therefore, standing to challenge governmental action, and the merits of the challenge, are separate and distinct issues. <em>See, e.g., Assn. of Data Processing Service Org. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184, 188 (1970) (whether there has been an invasion of one\u2019s \u201c \u2018legal interest\u2019 ... goes to the merits. The question of standing is different. It concerns ... the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question \u201d); <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 99, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947, 961 (1968) (\u201cThe fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a ... court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated\u201d); <em>Town of Somerset v. Board, supra, </em>245 Md. at 63, 225 A.2d at 301 (distinguishing between \u201cthe merits of the substantive issues decided by the Board\u201d and whether \u201cthe appellants have the requisite standing to have those issues reviewed\u201d); Stein, Mitchell <em>&amp; </em>Mezines, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 50.01, at 50-3 (5th ed. 1996) (\u201cQuestions of standing focus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>not on the merits of the case but on what parties have the right to seek judicial review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">If a plaintiffs standing in court to challenge the issuance of a government permit allowing particular activity on the permittee\u2019s land were dependent upon the plaintiffs establishing that he or she would suffer legally cognizable harm, the result would be that numerous permits, issued after adjudicatory hearings, would be immune from judicial review. Furthermore, as illustrated by the present case, plaintiffs in judicial review actions would be faced with an unreasonable hurdle. The Court of Special Appeals did seem to require in the present case, as a pre-requisite for the denial of standing, that the record contain substantial evidence supporting the administrative findings and conclusions that the emission levels from the incinerator would be within acceptable limits under governmental standards. But, in the instant case, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument on the merits is not that particular findings by the ALJ were unsupported by substantial evidence. Instead, as discussed in Part III of this opinion, <em>infra, </em>the plaintiffs contend that the ALJ committed numerous errors of law by excluding relevant issues and evidence, by misconstruing the applicable governmental air quality standards, and by ignoring certain evidence. According to the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, if the ALJ had not erroneously excluded certain issues and evidence, the ALJ would have found that the levels of toxic substances falling on nearby property owners were not acceptable, and thus the nearby property owners would have suffered legally cognizable harm. Similarly, under the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, if the ALJ had applied correct governmental standards, she would have found that the amount of pollutants emitted from the incinerator and falling on nearby property owners was unacceptable. If the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions on the merits are valid, they may have suffered legally cognizable harm. But they were precluded from making these arguments in the courts below on the ground that, under the ALJ\u2019s decision, they would not suffer legally cognizable harm. Under the approach taken by the Court of Special Appeals and the respondents, an administrative agency can, by erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>excluding issues and evidence or by misconstruing the law, conclude that none of the challengers to the issuance of a permit would be harmed in a legally significant manner, and such finding, if supported by sufficient evidence at the hearing, would deprive any challengers of standing to maintain a judicial review action. The challengers would lack standing even though, if the challengers\u2019 arguments on the merits are sound, they might suffer such legally cognizable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Consequently, we reject the argument that the plaintiffs lack standing because, in the respondents\u2019 view, the likely fallout of toxic substances upon their properties will be acceptable under government air quality standards. Under Maryland law, this is an erroneous test for standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It is a settled principle of Maryland law that, \u201c \u201cwhere there exists a party having standing to bring an action ... we shall not ordinarily inquire as to whether another party on the same side also has standing.\u2019 \u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Crown Development Corp., </em>328 Md. 303, 317, 614 A.2d 553, 559-560 (1992), quoting <em>Board v. Haberlin, </em>320 Md. 399, 404, 578 A.2d 215, 217 (1990). <em>See, e.g., County Council v. Md.

We need not, however, explore that issue in the present case. Under the above-cited decisions, the Buchanans were adjacent or nearby property owners who were prima facie aggrieved. Their farm was adjacent to the PEPCO tract of land which encircled the incinerator and which contained the generating stations utilizing the energy produced by the incinerator. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Buchanans\u2019 farm was only 2,000 feet from the incinerator itself. If the Buchanans\u2019 farm would not be considered adjoining or sufficiently nearby because of the size of the tract on which the joint PEPCO-Montgomery County operation was to take place, then no property owner would be presumptively aggrieved. In our view, the Buchanans were adjoining or nearby property owners, and, therefore, they were prima facie aggrieved. Since the respondents failed in the circuit court to \u201ccom[e] forward with evidence to establish that [they were] not, in fact, aggrieved,\u201d <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., supra, </em>247 Md. at 145, 230 A.2d at 294, the Buchanans had standing to maintain this action for judicial review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Moreover, as indicated earlier, the evidence adduced at the administrative hearing demonstrated that much higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>levels of toxic substances would fall on the Buchanans\u2019 farm and on other nearby property owners than would fall on properties farther away from the site. This would ordinarily be expected in any case involving a permit for activity causing toxic emissions into the air. Thus, as acknowledged in the applicants\u2019 brief in this Court, there was expert testimony that property four miles from the incinerator would be less impacted than nearby property \u201cthat will be most impacted by the\u201d incinerator. (Brief of the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority and Montgomery County at 27). The applicants also acknowledged \u201cthat the ambient impact analysis by [applicants\u2019] expert shows different geographic areas experience different levels of impact\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 21), and that persons in close proximity to the incinerator, such as the Buchanans, will be exposed to higher levels of pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">As to the level of toxins on soil, vegetation and water, one expert stated that \u201cthe peak concentration point is predicted to occur\u201d within four or five kilometers from the incinerator, while another expert put this distance as within three miles. The applicants\u2019 expert witness Dr. Jones had conducted a toxic risk assessment on the Buchanans\u2019 farm pond, and testified that one \u201cwould anticipate the highest deposition and runoff [of mercury and dioxide] into the [Buchanans\u2019] pond.\u201d With respect to mercury contamination of fish taken from the pond, Dr. Jones stated that the \u201chazard index ... based on the emissions rates from ... this facility was approximately ... 20% of the allowable hazard index,\u201d and Dr. Jones characterized this as \u201cacceptable\u201d under federal air quality standards. With regard to dioxins, he stated that \u201cthe calculated risk for dioxins due to fish consumption of the pond was two and a half chances in a million\u201d which he viewed as an \u201cacceptable\u201d risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">As previously discussed, however, the fact that the level of pollutants from the incinerator falling on-nearby property may be \u201cacceptable\u201d under governmental air quality standards, thereby justifying the issuance of the permits, is not the test for a plaintiffs standing to seek judicial review. Instead, the test is whether the plaintiff is affected in a way different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the public generally. The administrative record in this case, without contradiction, shows that nearby property owners such as the Buchanans would be affected in a way different from the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Turning to the merits, the plaintiffs contend that the ALJ committed numerous errors of law in the course of the extensive administrative hearing and in her proposed decision which was adopted by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The plaintiffs initially contend that the ALJ, in a prehearing memorandum order filed on December 24, 1991, concerning the issues to be considered at the adjudicatory hearing, erroneously excluded from consideration any \u201cair quality issues addressed in the PSD approval stage\u201d even though these same \u201cair quality matters ... [were] at the heart of whether an air quality Permit to Construct should be issued.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief at 17). The plaintiffs advance the same argument with regard to the refuse disposal permit. <em>(Id. </em>at 40-45). The only such allegedly excluded issue which is identified and discussed in the plaintiffs\u2019 briefs, however, concerned \u201cthe best available control technology for toxic air emissions\u201d or \u201cT-BACT\u201d as it is referred to by the parties. The plaintiffs assert that \u201cALJ Wagner clearly erred in concluding that T-BACT ... issues were part of the PSD ' regulatory program and therefore must be excluded\u201d from the adjudicatory hearing on the permit to construct and the refuse disposal permit. <em>(Id. </em>at 45).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The applicants respond by arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that under the broad listing of issues which the ALJ agreed to consider, and at the hearing itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the plaintiffs \u201chad the opportunity to present evidence ... in relation to every applicable air regulatory standard.\u201d (Applicants\u2019 supplemental brief at 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">If the ALJ had actually excluded issues and evidence relevant to the construction and the refuse disposal permit applications on the ground that such issues had been resolved in the earlier PSD permit proceeding, then we would agree with the plaintiffs that the ALJ would have committed a prejudicial error requiring a reversal of the administrative decision. As discussed previously, this Court in <em>Sugarloaf I </em>held that, under the statutory and regulatory air quality scheme, the permit to construct stage is the more appropriate time at which to. hold a contested case hearing. <em>Sugarloaf I, supra, </em>323 Md. at 659, 594 A.2d at 1124. In support of this conclusion, we explained as follows (323 Md. at 658, 594 A.2d at 1123):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cThe PSD approval, however, is simply a preliminary finding that the incinerator will not significantly harm the air quality in the Sugarloaf Mountain area generally. Although such approval is required in order to construct and operate the incinerator, the PSD approval itself does not authorize the construction or operation of the facility. . As noted previously, Montgomery County and the Northeast Authority must engage in a permit application approval process at each of these stages also. Approval of the PSD permit has no immediate effect on any individual property rights, nor does it grant to the County the authority to begin constructing the proposed facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201cConversely, the granting of a permit to construct would more immediately affect the individuals living around the proposed facility whose property might be harmed by the incinerator. The construction permit would create an immediate right in the County to begin building the facility. Clearly at this stage in the process, where actual harm may occur, a contested case hearing is more appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Because the PSD permit approval was \u201csimply a preliminary finding,\u201d and because the PSD hearing was not a trial type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>hearing, we specifically held in <em>Sugarloaf I </em>that \u201cthe determinations made at the non-trial type hearing at the PSD stage would not be preclusive under principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel.\u201d 323 Md. at 658-659 n. 13, 594 A.2d at 1123-1124 n. 13. Consequently, the resolution of an issue at the PSD stage would not preclude consideration of that same issue at a later administrative hearing on the construction permit or refuse disposal permit applications if the issue was pertinent to those permit applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The plaintiffs correctly assert that, in her memorandum order of December 24, 1991, the ALJ did state that \u201cnone of the PSD Approval determinations is subject to review in this proceeding.\u201d In a later pre-hearing proceeding, on February 10, 1992, the ALJ reiterated that \u201cthe issues involving ... PSD ... are all stricken from consideration at [the] hearing\u201d and that \u201cI will not entertain any evidence on those.\u201d These statements by the ALJ were inconsistent with <em>Sugarloaf I </em>and were erroneous to the extent that any PSD approval determinations concerned issues which were also pertinent to the applications for a construction permit or a refuse disposal permit. The ALJ did not in her December 24th memorandum order, or in any later statements, otherwise identify these PSD \u201cdeterminations,\u201d and nothing in the parties\u2019 briefs or record extracts has enabled us to identify them. No portion of the transcript of the 15-day hearing, involving the exclusion of offered evidence, has been called to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">As indicated earlier, the only issue which is identified and discussed in the plaintiffs\u2019 briefs as having been allegedly excluded because it was resolved at the PSD stage related to TBACT. Neither side disputes that consideration of T-BACT is relevant at both the PSD approval stage and the permit to construct stage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, pursuant to COMAR 26.11.15.05, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201c[a] person may not construct, reconstruct, operate, or cause to be constructed, reconstructed, or operated any new installation or new source that will discharge a toxic air pollutant to the atmosphere without installing and operating T-BACT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">An examination of the record reveals, however, that the ALJ did not exclude T-BACT issues. To the contrary, in her findings, conclusions and proposed decision, the ALJ specifically listed the following as having been issues at the hearing: 2.e. \u201cWill [the facility] comply with COMAR 26.11.15.06. regarding unreasonable endangerment?\u201d and 2.f. Will the pollution control equipment required for the [facility] adequately capture the volatized mercury, dioxin and related chemicals in order to avoid unreasonable endangerment?\u201d These issues are directly relevant to a determination of whether the facility will be using T-BACT, as defined in COMAR 26.11.15.01.B(3). Moreover, the record reveals that the plaintiffs presented evidence concerning the T-BACT standard for mercury. For example, the plaintiffs introduced evidence regarding experimental work being performed in Germany and California on the use of carbon injection to control mercury. The ALJ recognized this evidence, but found that \u201c[such technology] is not yet required for compliance with COMAR 26.11.15.05 [related to T-BACT].\u201d Consequently, the ALJ concluded that, \u201calthough [the plaintiffs] raised a number of issues regarding the proposed [facility\u2019s] compliance with [COMAR 26.11.15], they presented no evidence to demonstrate the facility will not be using T-BACT.\u201d Accordingly, the record does not support the contention that the ALJ excluded the issue of T-BACT from consideration at the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Although the ALJ may have made erroneous statements in her pre-hearing memorandum and order of December 24, 1991, and at the pre-hearing proceeding on February 10, 1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they were actually precluded at the adjudicatory hearing from raising an issue or presenting evidence pertinent to the construction and refuse disposal permits on the ground that the issues had earlier been resolved at the preliminary PSD stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The plaintiffs maintain that the ALJ \u201cmisconstrued the legal significance of uncontroverted evidence in the record of pollution from the ... incinerator that will cause harm to wildlife and humans.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief at 30). Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the ALJ ignored Department of Natural Resources (DNR) findings and expert opinions that emissions of toxic PCBs, arsenic and mercury will cause unsafe conditions in farm ponds and to fish within those ponds. For support, the plaintiffs rely primarily on a DNR Risk Assessment<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> indicating that toxic emissions of these pollutants will exceed the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) criteria for pond water. The plaintiffs claim that, taken together, the presence of these pollutants in the environment would constitute both air pollution and a nuisance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, the ALJ did not \u201cignore\u201d this evidence. Rather, the ALJ was persuaded that arsenic emissions would be captured in a pollution control device which would keep the level of arsenic at acceptable levels. Moreover, the ALJ acknowledged that the risk assessment produced by the applicants did not calculate the risk for PCBs, but the ALJ accepted the opinion of the applicants\u2019 expert that \u201cthe risk from dioxin was most representative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the most significant risk.\u201d Accordingly, she determined that a risk analysis for PCBs was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The ALJ did, however, discuss at length the impact of mercury in farm ponds and upon fish within those ponds. Studies performed by the applicants\u2019 experts persuaded her that the level of mercury in fish and pond water would be substantially <em>below </em>EPA and federal Food and Drug Administration standards. In addition, the testimony of a Department environmental specialist convinced the ALJ that the mercury level in fish and other aquatic species would not increase if the facility was built. Consequently, the ALJ adopted the position that \u201crisks to human health and aquatic organisms through mercury deposition in ponds are minimal and acceptable.\u201d Furthermore, the ALJ discussed evidence presented in the form of carcinogenic risk assessments by both the plaintiffs and the applicants, and she concluded that, under EPA standards, the overall level of risk to the environment from the facility was \u201cinsignificant.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The ALJ did not \u201cignore\u201d evidence that pollution from the incinerator will harm wildlife and humans. Instead, she considered such evidence, along with conflicting evidence, and made findings and conclusions. It is not the function of a reviewing court independently to weigh the conflicting evidence. <em>See MVA v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 280-285, 666 A.2d 511, 515-518 (1995), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The plaintiffs assert that the ALJ improperly determined that the level of dioxide emissions from the facility would comply with New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under COMAR 26.11.06.12, as provided for in 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>C.F.R. 60 (1992).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief at 37). Under 40 C.F.R. 60.53a(b), the standard for dioxide emissions is set at \u201c30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter.\u201d According to the plaintiffs, the ALJ erred in finding this standard to be equivalent to a .46 toxicity equivalent (TEQ) and, as a result, concluding that the .42 TEQ offered by the applicants met the standard under 40 C.F.R. 60.53a(b). The plaintiffs maintain that the ALJ, in using the two figures as equivalents, \u201carbitrarily redefined the law to the benefit of the Applicants.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief at 37-39).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The record indicates that the ALJ did not \u201carbitrarily\u201d arrive at .46 TEQ as an equivalent measure of compliance with NSPS. Rather, the ALJ cited the preamble to the Federal Register, in which the EPA explained that there are several methods by which the 30 nanograms can be measured, one of which is by toxicity equivalents (TEQs). <em>See </em>56 Fed.Reg. 5504. Applying a method of calculation developed in 1987, the EPA explained that the 30 nanograms corresponded to a TEQ of approximately .46. Because the applicants calculated the level of dioxide emissions as .42 TEQ using the 1987 scheme, the ALJ appropriately applied the corresponding 1987 .46 TEQ limit to determine whether the dioxide level calculated by the applicants complied with NSPS. Accordingly, the ALJ did not commit an error of law by using .42 TEQ to determine whether the dioxide level conformed with NSPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the ALJ issued the permits without first considering whether the applicants had satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>relevant provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 <em>et. seq. </em>(1994), relating to solid waste incinerator ash. In particular, the plaintiffs argue that the federal statute requires 1) the testing of the incinerator ash and, if the test discloses that the ash is hazardous, 2) the designation of an appropriate landfill in which to store the hazardous ash.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In 1994, the United States Supreme Court held that ash generated from a resource recovery facility was subject to the hazardous waste provisions contained in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. <em>City of Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, </em>511 U.S. 328, 114 S.Ct. 1588, 128 L.Ed.2d 302 (1994).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, the ALJ erred in finding the federal statute inapplicable to the incinerator ash generated from the facility in question. Nevertheless, the ALJ was also persuaded by the applicants\u2019 argument that, \u201cif it is determined the ash must be tested for toxicity and does, in fact, test toxic, [the Applicants] will dispose of such ash at the GSX Services Landfill.\u201d Thus, as an alternate ground for decision concerning this issue, the applicants satisfied the ALJ that they had considered the possibility that the ash might test hazardous and would deal with the situation accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On a related issue, the plaintiffs contend that the refuse disposal permit was incomplete because it lacked necessary disposal sites for the non-hazardous and possibly hazard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ous ash discharged from the facility. They maintain that the permit application required \u201cmaterial changes\u201d which could only be implemented through submission to the Secretary of the Environment and amendments to Montgomery County\u2019s solid waste plan.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> According to the plaintiffs, the ALJ failed to consider these issues at the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the refuse disposal permit was issued improperly. At the beginning of her findings, conclusions, and proposed decision, the ALJ listed the following as an issue to be resolved: \u201cHas the site [which] applicants intend to use for disposal of the incinerator ash and noncombustibles been fully analyzed or licensed in accordance with COMAR 26.04.07.25.B(11).\u201d The ALJ recognized that, under COMAR 26.04.07.25B(11), an applicant for a refuse disposal permit must identify a proposed site for the ash. She then pointed out that the applicants designated \u201cOak Landfill\u201d in their permit application as their proposed site. As discussed above, the ALJ also accepted the applicants\u2019 representation that, in the event that the ash tested hazardous in the future, the applicants had designated an alternative landfill in which to store the ash.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In addition, the ALJ devoted eight pages of her proposed decision to a discussion of the applicants\u2019 compliance with the Montgomery County Solid Waste Plan. She first noted that, under COMAR 26.04.07.25G, the following two conditions must be met before a refuse waste disposal permit can be issued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u201c(1) A statement from the appropriate local governmental agency concerning the consistency of the proposed facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>with the approved county comprehensive solid waste management plan ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">(2) Proof that the facility is consistent with the approved county comprehensive solid waste management plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The ALJ then determined that the applicants had met both of these requirements. The first requirement was satisfied by a letter attached to the application for the refuse disposal permit and signed by the Director of the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The letter stated that the facility was \u201cpart of the Montgomery Solid Waste Management Plan.\u201d While refusing to review in this proceeding the County\u2019s Solid Waste Plan itself,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the ALJ did permit the parties to present evidence as to whether the facility complied with the plan. After a detailed review of evidence presented at the hearing by the parties on this issue, the ALJ concluded that \u201cthe weight of the evidence supports the finding that the Facility described in the Refuse Disposal Permit Application is consistent with the County\u2019s approved comprehensive solid waste management plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The refuse disposal permit was neither incomplete nor improper on the grounds asserted by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The plaintiffs further challenge the issuance of the permits on the ground that the incinerator would not be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>compliance with the more demanding air quality standards for ozone non-attainment areas under the 1990 Amendments to the federal Clean Air Act, Title I, Part D, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7502, 7508 (1994).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief at 24). The applicants, on the other hand, maintain that the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments are not applicable to the facility at issue. (Applicants\u2019 supplemental brief at 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">It is undisputed that issuance of the permits in this case was not in compliance with the pertinent air quality standards under the 1990 Amendments to the federal Clean Air Act. It follows that if the permits were subject to the requirements specified in \u00a7\u00a7 7502 and 7503 of the 1990 Clean Air Act, the Department erred in issuing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We conclude, however, that the terms of the Clean Air Act, coupled with interpretive guidance from the EPA, indicate that the permits in question are not subject to the more rigid standards demanded under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 7409(a) of the Clean Air Act, the EPA is directed to establish national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for certain air pollutants which threaten the health and welfare of the Nation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(a)(1). Congress delegated to the states the responsibility of implementing these standards through State Implementation Plans, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a). In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to include more rigorous air quality standards which states were required to incorporate into their existing plans. At issue in this case are new source review standards, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tained in \u00a7\u00a7 7502 and 7503, which govern sources contained in ozone non-attainment areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The plaintiffs argue that, pursuant to \u00a7 7401\u2019s \u201cEffective Date of 1990 Amendment\u201d provision, \u00a7\u00a7 7502 and 7503 became effective on November 15, 1990, the date on which they were enacted. That provision provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided, the amendments made by this Act ... shall be effective on the date of enactment of this Act [November 15,1990].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The new standards, however, did not1 immediately apply to all permits issued after November 15, 1990. Under \u00a7 7511, states were required to submit their revised plans to the EPA by November 12, 1992. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511. For those states which had not incorporated the new plan provisions by November 15, 1992, however, the \u201cexisting\u201d plans would be effective and continue to govern all permit applications submitted prior to November 15,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">This interpretation is consistent with that of the EPA in two guidance memoranda issued by John S. Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In his first memorandum, dated March 11, 1991, the Director explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">\u201c[T]he 1990 Amendments require States to submit to EPA new NSR permit program rules for ozone nonattainment areas by November 15, 1992.... The EPA interprets this as an expression of congressional intent not to mandate that states adhere to the more stringent ... NSR requirements in nonattainment areas during the time provided for state implementation (SIP) development. Thus, for NSR permitting purposes in nonattainment areas, the new NSR re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>quirements in Title I are not in effect until the States, as required by the Act, adopt NSR permit program rules to implement the Title I provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Mr. Seitz further interpreted Title I of the 1990 Amendments in his September 3,1992 memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">\u201cTitle I of the 1990 CAAA requires that States with nonattainment ares or areas in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region (NOTR) submit to EPA, by specified deadlines, augmented new source permit rules which meet the amended requirement of Part D of Title I of the Act.... For ozone, the 1990 CAAA require that States submit [plans] meeting the amended Part D NSR requirements by November 15, 1992. Where States do not submit the Part D NSR [plans] by the applicable statutory deadline ... sources that have submitted complete permit applications ... by the submittal deadline may receive final permits under existing State NSR rules. In this situation, such sources will be considered by EPA to be in compliance with the Act without meeting the amended Part D NSR provisions of the 1990 CAAA [provided they meet certain requirements].... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The EPA is the federal agency responsible for implementing the provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. As such, its interpretation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act is entitled to deference if it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843-844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694, 702-704 (1984). Consistent with 1990 Clean Air Act provisions and EPA guidance, before the 1990 Amendments take effect in Maryland, the State of Maryland must, at the very least, incorporate the new regulations into its existing plan.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Our holding is consistent with that of other courts which have decided this identical issue. <em>See, e.g., In the Matter of Crown/Vista Energy Project, </em>279 N.J.Super. 74, 652 A.2d 212 (App.Div.), <em>cert. denied, </em>140 N.J. 277, 658 A.2d 301 (1995). In that case, an air pollution control permit was issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to the operator of a coal-fueled power plant for the sale of electricity. On February 28, 1992, the operator submitted an application for the permit, which the Department issued to him on October 1, 1993. A group of citizens and individuals sought review of the Department\u2019s decision on the ground that the permit was not in compliance with \u00a7 7511a of the 1990 Clean Air Act in that it did not meet the new emission standards required under that section. Analyzing the statutory scheme underlying the Clean Air Act, and citing the EPA memoranda for support, the New Jersey Court rejected the petitioners\u2019 claim that the permit, issued <em>after </em>the date of enactment of the 1990 Amendments, was subject to the more stringent emissions requirements. 652 A.2d at 216-217.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The same position was adopted by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in <em>Citizens for a Better Environment v. Wilson, </em>775 F.Supp. 1291, 1299 (N.D.Cal.1991). On this issue, the court in <em>Wilson </em>concluded that (775 F.Supp. at 1299):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201c... Congress intended to hold agencies to [regulations contained] in existing [plans], pending formal [plan] revision. Such an interpretation best reconciles and harmonizes the purposes of the Clean Air Act and the provisions of the 1990 Amendments. It is most consistent with the overall purpose of achieving healthy air as expediously as practicable and the statutory scheme of retaining the enforceability of existing [plans] until replaced____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In the case at bar, the applicants submitted their permit applications sometime in 1990. On November 6, 1991, the EPA designated Montgomery County as a serious ozone non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>attainment area. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 81.321. Maryland did not, however, incorporate the new plan regulations pertaining to ozone non-attainment areas until April 26, 1993. <em>See </em>COMAR 26.11.17. Accordingly, at the time that the applicants submitted their permit applications, Maryland had not yet incorporated the new regulations into its plan. Thus, the 1990 Amendments are not applicable to the permits at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">According to the plaintiffs, the ALJ erred in finding that \u201cpollutant levels in water, fish, and food ... cannot be considered when determining compliance with MDE\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable endangerment under 26.11.15.06.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief at 46). The record indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">As previously discussed in Part III B of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>the ALJ devoted several pages of her findings, conclusions and proposed decision to a consideration of the risks to \u201cwater fish and food\u201d from incinerator pollutants. In particular, the ALJ considered two comprehensive risk assessments which both examined the various toxins likely to accumulate in local farm ponds and measured the resulting harm from consumption of fish within those ponds. The risk assessments also estimated the level of harm through the consumption of milk and beef from live-stock raised on local farms and from vegetables grown on those farms. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the ALJ \u201cignored food chain routes of exposure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>air toxins released from the incinerator\u201d is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We find no merit in the plaintiffs\u2019 final argument that \u201c[t]he ALJ\u2019s determination that pre-hearing discovery was not permitted denied [plaintiffs] due process of law as required by the United States and Maryland Constitutions.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief at 46). There is no provision in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act which provides for discovery at the pre-hearing stage. Furthermore, under COMAR 26.01.02.21A, which governs the Department of the Environment contested case proceedings, \u201c[discovery may be taken only in accordance with the stipulation of the parties.\u201d Parties may, however, \u201crequest governmental documents under the Maryland Public Information Act, State Government Article, \u00a7 10-611 et. seq.\u201d COMAR 26.01.02.21B. There was no stipulation in this case providing for discovery. Consequently, the ALJ properly determined that, absent such stipulation, she was not authorized to require the extensive discovery requested by the plaintiffs. Moreover, pursuant to COMAR 26.01.02.21B, the plaintiffs requested certain documents under the Maryland Public Information Act which they received without delay. Finally, the plaintiffs do not dispute the respondents\u2019 representations that the plaintiffs were furnished with several documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The plaintiffs do not argue that the ALJ or the Department relied upon any document which was not previously shown to the plaintiffs, or with regard to which there was no opportunity for rebuttal. <em>Cf. Rogers v. Radio Shack, </em>271 Md. 126, 129, 314 A.2d 113, 115 (1974) (\u201cWe agree with Rogers that under the circumstances here, with no opportunity for cross-examination or rebuttal, fundamental fairness would preclude reliance upon the report by an administrative agency\u201d). The plaintiffs have cited no case in the Supreme Court or in this Court, and we are unaware of any such case, holding that due process mandates pre-hearing discovery in an administrative proceeding. <em>See, Replacement Rent-A-Car v.

In arguing that the Buchanans were not \"nearby\u201d property owners and thus not presumptively aggrieved, the applicants rely upon <em>Wilkinson v.

Neither case supports the applicants\u2019 argument. Both <em>DuBay </em>and <em>Wilkinson </em>involved challenges to zoning reclassifications. In <em>DuBay </em>the protestants lived \"at least 1500 feet in a straight line from the rezoned property\u201d (240 Md. at 183, 213 A.2d at 489), and in <em>Wilkinson </em>the protestants \u201ccould see the reclassified property from [their] home\u201d (242 Md. at 234, 218 A.2d at 505). In both cases, upon evidence adduced in the circuit court, it was decided that the protestants were not aggrieved. The basis for both decisions, however, was not that the protestants were not \u201cnearby\u201d property owners. Instead, in each case the Court relied on the fact that the protestants\u2019 property was separated from the rezoned property by the Baltimore Beltway. The Court in <em>Wilkinson </em>thus stated (242 Md. at 235, 218 A.2d at 506):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\"The [protestants'] property is on the opposite side of the Beltway, and, in <em>DuBay, </em>we pointed out ..., the Beltway 'if not a complete shield against the apartments to be constructed, will serve as an adequate barrier.\u2019 It is true that, in that case, the property was 1500 feet from the rezoned property, and it was not shown that Dubay could see the reclassified property from his home, <em>but it was the existence of the broad, heavily traveled intervening Beltway which was the determining factor.\" </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In the case at bar, unlike <em>DuBay </em>and <em>Wilkinson, </em>no evidence was presented to the circuit court rebutting the Buchanans\u2019 prima facie standing.
