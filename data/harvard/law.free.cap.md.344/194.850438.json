We shall hold that the court abused its discretion in this case when it awarded restitution without first considering the age and circumstances of the child and in ordering restitution without providing Petitioner\u2019s mother a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On October 25, 1993, the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore County filed a juvenile petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, sitting as a juvenile court, alleging that Petitioner, Don Me., committed a delinquent act by performing acts that if committed by an adult would constitute the crime of theft. The parties submitted an agreed statement of facts and on December 17, 1993, at an adjudicatory hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the master found that Petitioner had committed the theft of an automobile as alleged in the petition. The master found that Petitioner was delinquent and recommended that he be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services for placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The petition filed in the juvenile court alleging that Petitioner committed a delinquent act arose out of the theft of an automobile belonging to Wayne Komar (Komar). On October 25, 1993, a police officer responded to an automobile accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>that occurred when Petitioner, a fifteen year-old, lost control and damaged the stolen car he was driving. Mr. Komar was reimbursed by his insurance carrier, GEICO, in the amount of $8366.25, the value of the car less the $200.00 deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The master held a disposition hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in juvenile court on the same day as the adjudicatory hearing. He determined that Petitioner was delinquent and recommended that he be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services for an appropriate residential placement. Petitioner was represented by the Public Defender; his mother was not represented by counsel. No one disputed that Petitioner\u2019s conduct caused the damage to Komar\u2019s vehicle. Petitioner and his mother agreed to pay restitution to Komar in the amount of $200.00, the amount of Komar\u2019s insurance deductible. Noting that GEICO had paid over $8000.00 to their insured, the master inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">MASTER: What about that Mrs. Me. [Mother]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, your honor, I have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adp\">MASTER: That\u2019s $4800.00 to your client and his mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aus\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I have not been advised by the State that GEICO was seeking that restitution in ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APE\">MASTER: The State never notifies them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If they wish to be a party, then we would request a restitution hearing to have them be present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The master set the restitution hearing for January 19,1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that hearing, neither the Petitioner, his mother, nor a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>GEICO representative was present. The record reflects that due to inclement weather conditions, travel was difficult on that day. In addition, the State\u2019s Attorney was uncertain whether he had notified GEICO of the hearing. Nonetheless, he advised the master that he \u201cwas going to ... dismiss the action as far as GEICO\u201d was concerned. In response, the master stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">MASTER: Okay. Well, how about if I just assess $5000.00 there and let\u2019s see where the chips go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, your honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">MASTER: Yes ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No one from GEICO is here. MASTER: I don\u2019t really care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Following counsel\u2019s protest that GEICO was not present, the master concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">Then I\u2019ll extend the hearing.... I\u2019m not paying more money. I don\u2019t think you people understand\u2014.... You see? The parents and the children are going to start paying the insurance carriers at least up to the statutory limit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIX\">The master ordered the State to notify GEICO, and continued the restitution hearing to February 16,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">At the final restitution hearing on February 16, 1994, a GEICO representative appeared and indicated that GEICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>had paid $8,366.25 to Komar as a result of the damage caused by Petitioner to Komar\u2019s automobile. Petitioner contended that GEICO\u2019s restitution claim was not properly before the court because the State\u2019s Attorney had dismissed it. The master rejected this argument and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[I]t just seems to me to be patently unfair that people like [Petitioner] go out and steal these cars and total them, and my insurance rates along with all these other drivers in here are going up because the carrier is paying out all this money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The master denied the Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the restitution proceeding. The following colloquy then took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">MASTER: How much did you pay out ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">GEICO: $8366.25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">MASTER: Wow. Well, let\u2019s see here. $200.00 to the victim. That\u2019s Mr. Komar. That would leave $4800.00 that you and your mother owe GEICO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">[PETITIONER]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">The master then addressed Petitioner\u2019s mother.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">MASTER: What\u2019s your position with that ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADz\">[MOTHER]: I cannot afford it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">MASTER: Ma\u2019am, that may be. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ve got to pay it out at one time. I\u2019m sure that GEICO would be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">[MOTHER]: I\u2019m on a fixed income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">MASTER: Well, ma\u2019am, that may be, but they\u2019re entitled to their money the same as if somebody\u2019s broke into your house and stole your property, you\u2019d want the victim\u2014that person to pay you for what you had lost. They\u2019re the same thing. They\u2019re the victim in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">[MOTHER]: I wouldn\u2019t charge that much money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">MASTER: Well ma\u2019am, maybe you wouldn\u2019t, but the $4800.00 we\u2019re talking about is less than they paid out. I mean, they\u2019re going to have to, in essence, they can\u2019t get any other monies from Juvenile Court (inaudible) a restitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tion. Whether they can get that money some other way is really not my problem. That\u2019s their problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The master concluded that Petitioner and his mother should pay $4,800.00 as restitution to GEICO. Petitioner\u2019s exceptions, filed in the circuit court, were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>In re Don Mc., </em>106 Md.App. 299, 664 A.2d 439 (1995). We granted certiorari to examine the authority of the juvenile court to order restitution under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Petitioner contends that the master erred by continuing the restitution hearing after the State had dismissed the action against GEICO. Petitioner asserts that because the State\u2019s Attorney determines whether to file a petition for restitution, the State, not the court, controls the fate of a restitution claim. Alternatively, Petitioner contends that the juvenile court abused its discretion in ordering restitution without ascertaining Petitioner\u2019s ability to pay and by ignoring the remarks by Petitioner\u2019s mother regarding her inability to pay. We do not reach Petitioner\u2019s first argument because we agree with his second, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the issue of whether the juvenile court erred in awarding restitution without first considering Petitioner\u2019s ability to pay, or by ignoring his mother\u2019s concerns, was not preserved for review. <em>In re Don Mc., </em>106 Md.App. at 308, 664 A.2d at 443. We agree that this issue was not raised below. Ordinarily, this Court will not decide an issue unless it has been raised in or decided by the trial court, but this Court may address such an issue if it determines that deciding the issue would be useful \u201cto guide the trial court. Maryland Rule 8-131. We shall exercise our discretion in this case and address the issue raised by Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The standard of review is whether the master abused his discretion in recommending restitution against Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and his mother. The term \u201cdiscretion\u201d means the absence of a hard and fast rule. <em>Langnes v. Green, </em>282 U.S. 531, 544, 51 S.Ct. 243, 248, 75 L.Ed. 520 (1931). Judicial discretion has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Judicial discretion is a composite of many things, among which are conclusions drawn from objective criteria; it means a sound judgment exercised with regard to what is right under the circumstances and without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously. Where the decision or order of the trial court is a matter of discretion it will not be disturbed on review except on a clear showing of abuse of discretion, that is, discretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\"><em>State ex rel. Carroll v. Junker, </em>79 Wash.2d 12, 482 P.2d 775, 784 (1971). When a court must exercise discretion, the failure to do so is error. <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 108, 532 A.2d 1066, 1077-78 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Maryland law confers upon a juvenile court broad discretion to order restitution. The juvenile court may order restitution against the child, the parent or both. Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 808(a), formerly \u00a7 3-829(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">(1) The juvenile court may enter a judgment of restitution against the parent of a child, the child, or both in any case in which the court finds a child has committed a delinquent act and during or as a result of the commission of that delinquent act has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">(i) Stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, unlawfully obtained, or substantially decreased the value of the property of another ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\"><em>% * </em>He &amp; # ;{:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">(2) The juvenile court may order the parent of a child, a child, or both to make restitution to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">(i) The victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(ii) Any governmental entity, including the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(iii) A third party payor, including an insurer, that has made payment to the victim to compensate the victim for a property loss under paragraph (l)(i) of this subsection----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The Juvenile Causes Act mandates that before a court may order a child to pay restitution, the court must first consider the age and circumstance of the child. Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 808(b); <em>In re Gloria T., </em>78 Md.App. 28, 35, 532 A.2d 1095, 1098 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 718, 537 A.2d 272 (1988). Before the court may order the parent to make restitution, the court must first afford the parent an opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence. Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 808(e); <em>In re Jose S., </em>304 Md. 396, 402, 499 A.2d 936, 938-39 (1985) (parent must have full and fair opportunity to participate); <em>In re James B., </em>54 Md.App. 270, 279, 458 A.2d 847, 853 (1983). Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 808(b) and 808(e), provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">(b). <em>Restitution to wronged person </em>personally.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO1\">Considering the age and circumstances of a child, the juvenile court may order the child to make restitution to the wronged person personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">ifc &gt;}; sj* H* &amp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">(e) <em>Judgment against </em>parent.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">A judgment of restitution against a parent may not be entered unless the parent has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence in the parent\u2019s behalf. A hearing under this section may be held as part of an adjudicatory or disposition hearing for the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">The plain language of the statute clearly requires that the court must first consider the age and circumstances of the child. The ability of the child to pay is a relevant factor for the court to consider when assessing the circumstances of the child. <em>Cf. </em>S. Jacobs <em>&amp; </em>C. Moore, <em>Successful Restitution as a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Predictor of Juvenile Recidivism, </em>45 Juv. <em>&amp; </em>Fam.Ct.J. 3 (1994) (because the proportion of restitution paid is an important predictor of recidivism, the offender\u2019s ability to pay must be taken into account in ordering restitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">This interpretation of the statutory language \u201cage and circumstances of a child\u201d is reflected in our discussion of the rehabilitative purpose of restitution in <em>Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981). Judge Digges, writing for the Court, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">It has been said that \u201ca court\u2019s concern that the victim be fully compensated should not overshadow its primary duty to promote the rehabilitation of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Fuqua, </em>267 Pa.Super. 504, 407 A.2d 24, 26 (1979); <em>see </em>Best &amp; Birzon, <em>Conditions of Probation: An Analysis, </em>51 Geo.L.J. 809, 827 (1963). Should the court choose to impose restitution, this fundamental objective of promoting rehabilitation comes to the fore and the court in ordering such a condition ordinarily should not exceed the defendant\u2019s ability to comply. This is so because if the amount fixed exceeds the defendant\u2019s resources, the rehabilitative purpose of the sentence is frustrated.... Consequently, most courts which have considered the issue have determined that it is improper for a trial court to order restitution without basing that judgment on a reasoned inquiry into the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 306, 429 A.2d at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The court clearly abused its discretion in this case when it awarded restitution in the amount of $4800.00. The court did not consider the age or circumstances of the child, or the ability of the child or the child\u2019s parent to pay the restitution before ordering the parties to pay $4800.00. The record indicates that the master predetermined that the appropriate award was the statutory maximum, and he arrived at this conclusion without any consideration of the age and circumstances of the child. Furthermore, having predetermined that GEICO should receive the full statutory limit, the master can hardly be said to have given Petitioner\u2019s mother a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>meaningful opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence on her behalf. Before a court may impose restitution on a child or the child\u2019s parent, the court must comply with the statutory requirements. The failure to do so is an abuse of discretion and constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
