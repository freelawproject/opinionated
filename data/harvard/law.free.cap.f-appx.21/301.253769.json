James, an Ohio resident proceeding pro se, appeals a district court order dismissing his civil rights complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">The complaint alleges that on January 2, 1996, James entered a plea agreement to plead guilty to drug abuse, a fourth degree felony. The plea agreement provided that James would be granted \u201cTreatment in Lieu of Conviction\u201d under Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2951.041. That statute provides that if the defendant successfully completes the treatment program, \u201cthe Court shall dismiss the charges against the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">The complaint further alleges that James began treatment during January 1996 and completed the treatment program during August 1996. In August, the treatment counselor reported that James had completed the treatment program, and the counselor completed a case closure/summary indicating that James\u2019s treatment program was closed on August 1, 1996 for the reason that he had met the goals of treatment and no additional services were needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">However, the complaint alleges that during September 1996, defendant Probation Officer Melissa Shade told the treatment counselor that James had tested positive for alcohol and that he should begin treatment again. When James reported to the treatment program for additional treatment, the complaint alleges, Shade instructed the treatment counselor not to allow James to restart the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">During January 1997, Shade filed a probation violation report alleging that James had failed to complete the treatment program. The complaint alleges that Shade falsely testified during the probation revo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>cation hearing that James had not successfully completed the drug treatment program. The complaint further alleges that the defendants committed a number of acts violating James\u2019s constitutional rights in connection with the probation revocation proceedings. The result was that James was convicted for drug abuse and sentenced to a term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The matter was referred to a magistrate judge for screening of the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that the complaint be dismissed because it attacks James\u2019s conviction for drug abuse, which conviction has not been vacated or otherwise set aside. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Despite James\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in an order entered November 28, 2000. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Upon de novo review, <em>see Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000); <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997), we conclude that the district court properly dismissed James\u2019s complaint for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge as adopted by the district court in its order filed November 27, 2000 and entered November 28, 2000</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order should be affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
