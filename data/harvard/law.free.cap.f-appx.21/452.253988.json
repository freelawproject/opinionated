Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed.

Baker did not object, and the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Baker\u2019s complaint with prejudice. Baker appealed, but we now dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Baker\u2019s brief fails to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9), which requires that an appellant\u2019s brief contain \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them\u201d along with \u201ccitations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Although Baker\u2019s claims were dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity, her brief merely provides a narrative of her medical problems and factual allegations. The brief does not suggest any reasons why the district court should not have dismissed her claims. At no point does Baker\u2019s brief refer to the district court judgment, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, or the issue of sovereign immunity. Although we construe pro se filings such as Baker\u2019s liberally, pro se litigants must still comply with Rule 28(a)(9) and provide legal argument and authority. <em>See Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). Failure to provide such argument and authority will result in dismissal of the appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 545-46. Because we cannot discern any argument in Baker\u2019s brief to suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the district court erred, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
