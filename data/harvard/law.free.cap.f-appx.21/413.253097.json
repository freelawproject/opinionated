Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). On October 12, 1990, a jury convicted Draheim of two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct, and Draheim was sentenced to forty to eighty years imprisonment. Draheim argues that the state of Michigan failed to turn over a tip sheet that contained statements made by the complainant to a law enforcement officer concerning the circumstances of her rape which differed from her in-court testimony. After careful consideration of the issue presented on appeal, we adopt the district court\u2019s opinion and AFFIRM the denial of Draheim\u2019s petition for habeas corpus for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
