The district court concluded that Omega had no right to reimbursement payments from the state of Florida, and that the payments were improperly included in Omega\u2019s bankruptcy estate. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We review de novo the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Parker v. Cmty. First Bank (In re Bakersfield Westar Ambulance, Inc.), </em>123 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir.1997). We review for abuse of discretion the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting the motion for reconsideration. <em>Arrow Elecs., Inc. v. Justus (In re Kaypro), </em>218 F.3d 1070, 1073 (9th Cir.2000). We review de novo the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law, and for clear error the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Pizza of Hawaii, Inc. v. Shakey\u2019s, Inc. (In re Pizza of Hawaii, Inc.), </em>761 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">According to Florida law, reimbursement payments \u201cshall be issued to the person responsible for conducting site rehabilitation listed on the Certification Affidavit.\u201d Fla. Admin. Code r. 62-773.700(8)(b) (2001). The Person Responsible for conducting site rehabilitation is defined as \u201cthe person designated by the site owner or operator on the reimbursement application.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 376.301(29) (2001); <em>see </em>Fla. Admin. Code r. 62-773.200(14). Here, the Certification Affidavits at issue designated only either appellee Gerard Blohorn or appellee Palm Environmental Funding Corporation as the Person Responsible. Consequently, Omega had no right to the reimbursement payments, and only Blohorn and Palm had rights to receive the reimbursement payments from Florida. The district court properly reversed the bankruptcy court. The reimbursement payments should not be part of Omega\u2019s bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Palm\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement issues on appeal is granted. Both Omega and Palm have briefed the issue of post-petition payments in this court, and agree that the party which prevails on the issue of reimbursement payments will also prevail on the issue of post-petition payments. We conclude that the district court\u2019s order implicitly reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order regarding the post-petition payments to Palm, and we affirm the district court. <em>See Federal Ins. Co. v. Scarsella Bros., Inc., </em>931 F.2d 599, 601 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
