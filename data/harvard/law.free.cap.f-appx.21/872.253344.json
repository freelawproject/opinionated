R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted \"without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">On August 16, 2000, a federal grand jury indicted defendant Eduardo Garcia-Gonzales on a charge of possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On October 31, 2000, he entered into a plea agreement with the government which specified a maximum statutory penalty of life imprisonment or a fine of $4,000,000.00, or both, a mandatory special assessment of $100.00, and a term of supervised release of not less than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-15\">In his petition to enter a guilty plea, Mr. Garcia-Gonzales indicated his understanding, through counsel, that a plea in this case could lead to his surrender of a number of constitutional rights. Under the section titled \u201cWaiver of Right to Appeal and Bring Collateral Challenge,\u201d the plea agreement stated that in exchange for certain concessions made by the United States, Garcia-Gonzales</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA8\">knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to appeal or collaterally challenge: (a) ... any issue or challenge before the district court concerning the circumstances leading up to his arrest on July 18, 2000, and agrees not to file any motions to suppress addressing the car stop or the subsequent search of his vehicle [or] (b) ... [his] sentence ..., provided the sentence is within or below the applicable guideline range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">R., Vol. 1, Doc. 21, at 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-17\">At his plea hearing before the district court on February 12, 2001, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-18\">THE COURT: Do you understand, Mr. Gonzalez [sic], that by agreeing to enter a plea of guilty, pursuant to this plea agreement, you\u2019re waiving your right to appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-20\">THE COURT: And have you discussed that with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-21\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-22\">THE COURT: And you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Aplee. Supp.App. at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">After reviewing the pre-sentence report, and over several of the defendant\u2019s sentencing objections, the district court imposed a sentence of 235 months, a five-year term of supervised release and a special assessment of $100.00. Mr. Garcia-Gonzales now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">In a response to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal based on the issue of waiver, Mr. Garcia-Gonzales\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved for leave to withdraw.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That brief does not point us to anything in the record arguably supportive of Mr. Garcia-Gonzales\u2019s appeal. Mr. Garcia-Gonzales has filed a response in which he argues only that the government\u2019s indictment \u201cfailed to invoke federal jurisdiction\u201d by \u201cfailing] to include any mention or designation\u201d of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution or the effect on interstate commerce of the illegal activity in any of the charging documents. Aplt. Closing Br. at 2. For the reasons set out below, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">We have held many times that, subject to certain public policy constraints, \u201c \u2018[a] defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of the statutory right to appeal his sentence is generally enforceable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Black, </em>201 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Atterberry, </em>144 F.3d 1299, 1300 (10th Cir.1998)) (further quotation omitted). To the extent Mr. Garcia-Gonzales now argues that he waived his right to appeal either involuntarily or without knowledge, a question we review de novo, we must disagree. Nothing in the record indicates that Mr. Garcia-Gonzales\u2019s decision to enter into the plea was other than knowing and voluntary. He was informed on a number of occasions of the maximum statutory penalties and other potentially negative ramifications of his plea, in addition to those parts of the bargain which would benefit him by avoiding trial. Knowing these things, Mr. Garcia-Gonzales accepted the conditions of the agreement, including its waiver of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">In addition to the record, we have read defendant\u2019s briefs on appeal and we find nothing that persuades us to change our view that Mr. Garcia-Gonzales was fully aware of the charges against him. Moreover, we find nothing in his briefs or the record to convince us to strike the plea agreement and waiver of appeal in the interest of public policy. To the extent that Mr. Garcia-Gonzales\u2019s arguments raise issues concerning the jurisdiction of the federal courts to hear his case under the drug trafficking laws in Title 21, we find these arguments to be without merit and the appeal, on the whole, to be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Therefore, the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The appeal is DISMISSED. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-23\">. The agreement specifically noted Mr. Garcia-Gonzales\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal an upward departure of the sentencing guidelines or retroactive application of changes in the law of this circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\">. <em>Anders </em>holds that if counsel finds a case to be wholly frivolous after conscientious examination, he may so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744. Counsel must also submit to the court a brief referring to anything in the record arguably supportive of the appeal. The brief is then served upon the client, who may then raise any point he chooses, and this court thereafter undertakes a complete examination of all proceedings and decides whether the appeal is, in fact, frivolous. If it so finds, it may grant counsel's request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
