Having determined that Gonzalez\u2019s six prior armed robbery convictions were \u201cnot related\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), the district court classified Gonzalez as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, giving him a total offense level of 29 with a criminal history category of VI and putting him in a guideline range of 151 to 188 months imprisonment. Gonzalez was sentenced to 151 months imprisonment followed by a three-year term of supervised release, a $2,500 fine, and a $100 special assessment. Gonzalez appeals his sentence on the ground that the district court erred in determining that his prior convictions were \u201cnot related\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">In May 1992, Gonzalez committed six armed robberies in Chicago, Illinois. On May 1, Gonzalez robbed an Always Open store of $70 using a firearm, which he later claimed to be a \u201cstarter pistol.\u201d On May 3, he robbed another Always Open store, displaying the starter pistol and taking $200; later that day, he robbed a North Hen Food store, displaying the starter pistol and taking an unspecified amount of money from the cash register. On May 5, he robbed a Tastee Donuts store, displaying the starter pistol and again taking an unspecified amount of money out of the cash register. On May 13, he robbed a White Hen Food store, displaying the starter pistol and taking $59; later that day, he robbed another Always Open store, displaying the starter pistol and taking $120 and 1,500 instant lottery tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">Gonzalez was convicted of armed robbery in Cook County Circuit Court and sentenced to a term of fourteen years imprisonment for each offense. He served his sentences concurrently and was paroled in November 1998. In August 1999, Gonzalez was arrested for receiving and concealing stolen property. He was convicted and sentenced to ninety-three days custody. On November 3, 1999, Gonzalez was released from custody, and on November 10, 1999, he committed the present offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">Gonzalez claims that all six robberies were part of a drug-induced crime spree that occurred over a two-week period. Gonzalez claims that he used the same starter pistol in each of the robberies and that all of the robberies occurred at convenience stores in a small, discrete section of Chicago. On appeal, Gonzalez argues that his six prior armed robberies \u201cwere part of a single common scheme or plan,\u201d as contemplated by Application Note 3 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, and therefore should have been treated as one prior felony conviction. Had the district court so found, Gonzalez argues, he would not have fit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>definition of a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, he would have had a total offense level of 21 with a criminal history category of IV, putting him in a guideline range of 51 to 71 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5f\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In <em>United States v. Irons, </em>196 F.3d 634 (6th Cir.1999), we held that the meaning of the phrase \u201csingle common scheme or plan\u201d is a legal issue to be reviewed de novo, while the district court\u2019s factual determination of whether prior offenses are related by virtue of being part of a single common scheme or plan is reviewed for clear error. <em>See id. </em>at 638 (citing <em>United States v. Cowart, </em>90 F.3d 154, 159 (6th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. McAdams, </em>25 F.3d 370, 372 (6th Cir.1994)). The Supreme Court recently clarified our standard of review in <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001), holding that the reviewing court not only must accept findings of fact unless clearly erroneous, but also must give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts. <em>See id., </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. at 1279 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)). Furthermore, the defendant bears the burden of proving that the prior convictions at issue were part of a single common scheme or plan. <em>See Irons, </em>196 F.3d at 638 (citing <em>Cowart, </em>90 F.3d at 159).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (1998). As a career offender, a defendant is subject to a radically enhanced sentence. Here, there is no question that the first and second prongs of \u00a7 4B1.1 are met; the sole issue is whether, under the third prong, Gonzalez\u2019s prior violent felonies may be deemed to have resulted in two prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.1 provides that the phrase \u201ctwo prior felony convictions\u201d is defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, comment, (n. 1). The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2, in turn, refers the reader to \u00a7 4A1.2, which states, \u201cPrior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately. Prior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). The commentary to \u00a7 4A1.2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-13\">Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i <em>e., </em>the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Otherwise, prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that (A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">Here, Gonzalez concedes that his six prior armed robberies did not result from offenses that \u201coccurred on the same occasion\u201d as contemplated by subsection (A) and were never \u201cconsolidated for trial or sentencing\u201d as contemplated by subsection (C). Rather, Gonzalez relies entirely on subsection (B) to Application Note 3 of the commentary to \u00a7 4A1.2, arguing that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>determination of whether he properly was sentenced as a career offender depends on whether his six prior armed robberies were actually \u201cpart of a single common scheme or plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We addressed this very issue in <em>Cowart, </em>where the defendant had been convicted of robbing three different banks in Texas-one on March 30, 1983, another on July 5, 1983, and the third on August 17, 1983. <em>See Cowart, </em>90 F.3d at 154. These crimes shared a similar <em>modus operandi: </em>On each occasion, Cowart drove up to the bank\u2019s drive-through facility, presented a note to the tellers demanding money, and displayed a fake bomb. Cowart was tried separately for each of these offenses but was sentenced simultaneously following guilty pleas. Cowart argued that because he used the same basic <em>modus operandi, </em>the crimes were part of a \u201csingle common scheme or plan.\u201d Noting that the guidelines do not define the expression, \u201ccommon scheme or plan,\u201d we rejected Co-wart\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">It is beyond question that the simple sharing of a modus operandi cannot alone convert three separate bank robberies on three different dates of three different banks into one offense by virtue of their being a single common scheme or plan. Indeed, the majority of circuits that have addressed the question would not even take the similarity into account. The defendant offers no other justification, other than the similarity of the crimes, for why the three crimes should be treated as related.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 159, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We revisited the issue of relatedness in <em>Irons, </em>where the defendant\u2019s prior convictions involved his violation of a temporary protection order, which had been issued for his ex-girlfriend. <em>See Irons, </em>196 F.3d at 634. Irons violated the order on June 19, 1996, and less than two weeks later, he was arrested again for breaking and entering his ex-girlfriend\u2019s residence, petty theft, and criminal damaging <em>See id. </em>at 638. Irons argued that the offenses were part of a \u201csingle common scheme or plan\u201d because they (1) had a common victim, (2) had a similar purpose of harassment of that victim, (3) occurred within a short time period at the same geographic location, and (4) were both investigated by the same township police department. <em>See id. </em>The district court held that Irons\u2019s two prior offenses were not \u201crelated\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4A1.2, and we affirmed. We characterized Irons\u2019s argument as being that the offenses were related because they were part of the same \u201ccrime spree.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The <em>Irons </em>Court went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">In deciding whether prior offenses are part of a \u201csingle common scheme or plan,\u201d... we find that \u201c \u2018scheme\u2019 and \u2018plan\u2019 are words of intention, implying that [offenses] have been jointly planned, or at least that ... the commission of one would entail the commission of the other as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">[P]rior convictions are not \u201crelated\u201d merely because they are part of a crime spree. As the court in <em>United States v. Gelzer, </em>50 F.3d 1133, 1143 (2d Cir.1995) stated, \u2018We are not persuaded that the Commission intended criminal behavior prompted by the same root causes of criminal deviance, even a spree of such crimes, to constitute a \u2018single common scheme or plan\u2019 as contemplated by \u00a7 4A1.2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">Although defendant\u2019s purpose to harass his former girlfriend may have been similar, courts have consistently held that crimes are not \u201crelated\u201d merely because each was committed with the same purpose or common goal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 638-39 (citations omitted). <em>Irons </em>further noted that simply because the defendant\u2019s prior convictions involved the same victim did not make the crimes \u201crelated.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Here, Gonzalez advances the following in support of his argument that his prior convictions were \u201crelated\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4A1.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s six armed robberies were all of a piece. His drug addiction led inexorably to the robbery scheme, which merely involved the systematic robbery of business establishments at which cash was readily available. In this sense, the commission of each individual robbery necessarily entailed each other robbery. This basic fact was reflected by the willingness of local authorities to concede that the sentences for all six of the robberies, which were simultaneously imposed, should all be served concurrently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\"><em>Cowart </em>and <em>Irons </em>make clear, however, that Gonzalez\u2019s \u201ccrime spree\u201d of robbing convenience stores in May 1983 did not constitute a \u201csingle common scheme or plan.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Brown, </em>209 F.3d 1020, 1024 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that prior convictions are not \u201crelated\u201d simply because the crimes used the same modus operandi, were part of a crime spree, or were motivated by the need to support a drug habit); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.1999) (same); <em>United States v. Keller, </em>58 F.3d 884, 894-95 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that two armed robberies four days apart were not \u201crelated\u201d). Gonzalez also asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buford </em>somehow limits <em>Cowart </em>and <em>Irons, </em>changing the landscape of our analysis of \u201crelatedness\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2. He points to nothing in <em>Buford, </em>however, that calls our earlier rulings into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
