(Kone) negligently failed to maintain an elevator in which she was riding, thus causing her injuries when the elevator moved suddenly and threw her to the ground. At the close <em>of </em>Ms. Brown\u2019s case, the district court granted Kone judgment as a matter of law on the ground that Ms. Brown had failed to make out a submissible case on the issues of negligence and proximate cause. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-27\">Kone is not an insurer of those who ride in the elevators which it has undertaken to maintain; there must be a showing that there was some negligent failure to maintain on Kone\u2019s part before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>an injured rider may recover from Kone. <em>See Minden v. Otis Elevator Company, </em>793 S.W.2d 461, 463 (Mo.Ct.App.1990). Here, it is uncontroverted that Kone had no notice before the accident in which Ms. Brown was injured that the relevant elevator had ever experienced a difficulty with moving suddenly, nor is there any evidence that Kone had failed in any way in its maintenance responsibilities. Thus, we discern no evidence of negligence on Kone\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Ms. Brown argues that because the elevator in which she was riding had experienced other difficulties before the accident that caused her injury, and because Kone had notice of that fact, it was error to grant Kone\u2019s motion for judgment. We think that this argument is without merit. Generalized difficulties are not enough to put Kone on notice of the particular difficulty that caused Ms. Brown\u2019s injury. There was no evidence, moreover, that Kone failed in any way properly to respond to reports that the elevator was malfunctioning. Furthermore, without evidence of what caused the elevator to move suddenly resulting in Ms. Brown\u2019s injury, no reasonable person could conclude that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, Kone would have discovered the problem. Finally, because there is no evidence that Kone should have discovered and repaired the problem, Ms. Brown\u2019s case failed on the element of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-28\">.
