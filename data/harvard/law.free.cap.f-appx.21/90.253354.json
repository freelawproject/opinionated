In addition to his \u00a7 1983 action, Hemmings alleged coercion, threats, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 1982 Victim and Witness Protection Act, the International Child Abduction Act and the Missing Child Act. Hemmings alleged the Whiting defendants conspired to illegally confine and mistreat him. The district court granted defendants\u2019 summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">On appeal, Hemmings primarily argues the district court erred in dismissing some defendants; that the district court judge was biased against him; and the district court erred in finding defendants were protected by qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">We review both grants of summary judgment and grants of motions for dismissal <em>de novo. Beatie v. City of New York, </em>123 F.3d 707, 710 (2d Cir.1997); <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. Bybyk, </em>81 F.3d 1193, 1197 (2d Cir.1996). Our review of the record reveals no bias on the part of the district court. We affirm primarily for the reasons given in the district court\u2019s thorough opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">We have examined the remainder of Hemmings\u2019 claims and we find them without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
