R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">This is the third sentencing-related appeal in this case. Defendant Dedrick Shawn Caldwell was convicted by a jury of one count of unlawful possession with intent to distribute and distribution of more than five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Prior to trial, the government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, alleging that defendant had a prior felony drug conviction that would enhance his statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">In addition to this enhancement of the statutory sentence resulting from the prior felony drug conviction, defendant was also subject to an enhanced guideline sentence as a career offender. The district court found that he had at least two prior violent or drug-related felony convictions. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (2000) (USSG). Defendant does not contest his status as a career offender in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-17\">The district court, relying on an Application Note to the career offender guideline then in place, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, App. note 2 (1994), sentenced defendant to a term of 262 months in prison. In defendant\u2019s first appeal in this case, we (1) affirmed his conviction; (2) rejected his contention that the district court erred by refusing to depart downward from the career offender guideline; and (3) acting on a cross-appeal filed by the government, vacated defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for recalculation of the guideline amount. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>Nos. 95-1003, 95-1023, 1996 WL 185749 (10th Cir. Apr. 17, 1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>On remand for resentencing, the district court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a downward departure from the career offender guideline. It departed to a guideline range of 140 to 175 months based on an offense level of 28 \u2014 the applicable offense level without the career offender enhancement \u2014 and a criminal history category of VI. Based on the departure, the district court sentenced defendant to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government appealed this sentence, and we again remanded with instructions to the district court to resentence defendant within a guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>219 F.3d 1186 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Before defendant could be resentenced, however, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Consequently, defendant filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking to correct his sentence in fight of <em>Apprendi. </em>Defendant argued that <em>Apprendi </em>required the jury to be instructed upon and to find two elements that affected the length of his sentence: (1) the quantity of the controlled substance involved in the offense; and (2) the fact of his prior convictions leading to the statutory enhancement and career offender status. Since the jury had not been required to find the drug quantity applicable to his offense, defendant contended that he could only receive a statutory maximum sentence of twenty years under the catch-all provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (enhanced to thirty years based on his prior felony drug conviction, <em>see id.). </em>He further argued that since the jury had not found that he had the requisite prior felony convictions, he was not subject to the career offender enhancement or the maximum sentence enhancement to thirty years pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The government conceded that because the jury had not found the drug quantity, defendant could only be sentenced under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) to a maximum statutory term of thirty years. It contended, however, that <em>Apprendi </em>had not overruled the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that the fact of a prior conviction is not an element of the offense that must be pled in the indictment and found by the jury. Therefore, it rejected the remainder of defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The district court agreed with the government\u2019s position. It calculated defendant\u2019s guideline sentence as follows. Because <em>Apprendi </em>required that the maximum statutory sentence be adjusted to thirty years, the offense statutory maximum for purposes of the career offender guideline was now \u201c25 years or more\u201d rather than \u201clife.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. Therefore, defendant\u2019s offense level under the career offender guideline was 34, and his Criminal History category was VI. <em>See id. </em>This created a guideline range of 262 to 327 months. The district court sentenced defendant at the lower end of this range, to 262 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">In this appeal, defendant contends that <em>Apprendi </em>also required that the jury be allowed to determine whether he had a prior felony drug conviction that raised the applicable offense statutory maximum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) from twenty years to thirty years, and thus, whether his offense level under the career offender guideline should have been 32 rather than 34. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. Defendant concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as well as by prior circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Villalva, </em>232 F.3d 1329, 1332 (10th Cir.2000). He states he has raised his <em>Apprendi </em>argument in order to preserve it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>for further review in the event that the Supreme Court overrules <em>AlmendarezTorres. </em>Since we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and prior panel decisions concerning this issue, however, we cannot grant anticipatory relief and must affirm defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 587 (10th Cir.2000), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1635, 149 L.Ed.2d 495 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is AFFIRMED. E. Richard Toray\u2019s motion to withdraw as defendant\u2019s counsel is GRANTED. The clerk of court is directed to find and appoint replacement counsel pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A within ten days of the entry of this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b841-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-14\">. The district court had applied a guideline range of 262 to 327 months' imprisonment based on a career offender level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI. We remanded for resentencing within a guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment based on a career offender offense level of 37, the correct offense level in view of the enhanced statutory' sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
