See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-23\">Rebecca B. Shumaker appeals from the district court\u2019s order finding for Shumaker\u2019s former employer in her action alleging that she was terminated in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Rehabilitation Act. In accordance with the jury\u2019s finding, the court entered judgment against Shumaker. On appeal, Shumaker raises two issues. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">First, Shumaker alleges that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding what she must prove to prevail in her claim under the Rehabilitation Act. We find that the court\u2019s instruction was accurate and did not mislead or confuse the jury. <em>See Hardin v. Ski Venture, Inc., </em>50 F.3d 1291, 1293-94 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard for jury instruction); <em>Jones v. American Postal Workers Union, </em>192 F.3d 417, 429 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that there is no violation of federal anti-handicap law where an employee is discharged for misconduct, even if misconduct is related to disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Second, Shumaker objects to the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings related to Sammie Heflin\u2019s testimony. We do not find that the court abused its discretion in limiting the use of leading questions on Heflin\u2019s direct testimony. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 611; <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard of review for evidentiary rulings generally). Neither do we find that the court abused its discretion in denying Shumaker\u2019s motions to strike portions of Heflin\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Gravely, </em>840 F.2d 1156, 1163 (4th Cir.1988) (noting that trial courts are \u201cvested with broad discretion to control the mode of interrogation and presentation of evidence to insure that witnesses are treated fairly and the search for truth is not impaired by presentation of extraneous, prejudicial or confusing material\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
