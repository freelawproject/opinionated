The three men previously appealed their convictions and sentences, and this Court issued an opinion affirming their convictions in part, reversing in part and remanding for resentencing. <em>United States v. Frega, </em>179 F.3d 793 (9th Cir.1999). They now appeal their sentences again, claiming that the district court committed a variety of errors at their resentencing. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">1. United States v. Malkus</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Malkus contends that the district court erred when it declined to address his \u201cmotion for reconsideration of his earlier motion to vacate\u201d at the resentencing hearing, arguing that his mail fraud conviction was the result of flawed jury instructions. This very issue was raised by Malkus and decided by this Court in the earlier consolidated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The law of the case doctrine generally precludes a district court from reconsidering an issue that has already been decided by the same court, or a higher court in the identical case. <em>United States v. Hughes Aircraft Co. </em>243 F.3d 1181 (9th Cir.2001). Although certain exceptions to the doctrine apply, <em>United States v. Scrivner, </em>189 F.3d 825, 827 (9th Cir.1999), Malkus has not asserted any here.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Malkus also contends that the court erroneously denied him a downward departures based on aberrant behavior and for post-conviction rehabilitation under <em>United States v. Green, </em>152 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir.1998). The record indicates that the district court explicitly considered Malkus\u2019 request to downwardly depart in light of <em>Green, </em>but nonetheless exercised its discretion not to depart on that basis. And, although the district court did not specifically address Malkus\u2019 request for consideration of departure based on aberrant behavior, under such circumstances, \u201cwe will assume that the district court knows and applies the law correctly, realizes that it does have the authority to depart, but concludes that it would be inappropriate to do so.... \u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Garcia, </em>927 F.2d 489, 491 (9th Cir.1991). We do not have the authority to review the district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart from the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>133 F.3d 1208, 1214 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm Malkus\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">2. United States v. Frega</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Like Malkus, Frega claims that the district court erroneously denied him a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines range. Specifically, Frega contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a downward departure based on prosecutorial misconduct despite the fact that he had a pending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion asserting the same issue. Frega argues that the district court was required to rule on the \u00a7 2255 motion before resentencing him. Frega, however, offers no authority in support of his position, and we decline to create such a requirement. Accordingly, the district court properly proceeded to resentence Frega while simultaneously allowing him to continue to pursue his \u00a7 2255 motion. We therefore affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">3. United States v. Adams</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">Adams asserts two sentencing errors on appeal. First, he contends that the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines because it erroneously believed \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d constituted grounds for a <em>departure </em>from the guidelines rather than an <em>adjustment. See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1 (1998). Although Adams correctly notes that the district court erroneously referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>to acceptance of responsibility as grounds for \u201cdeparture,\u201d a review of the entire record establishes that this characterization was merely a slip of the tongue. The district court was aware of the requirements of \u00a7 3E1.1 and properly denied Adams an adjustment under this section after making a factual determination that he had not accepted responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Second, Adams argues that the district court erred by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.7 instead of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 in determining his offense level. A sentencing court must determine which sentencing guideline to apply \u201cbased upon the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2, cmt. n. 1. Adams was convicted of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1346. Section 1346 pertains to fraud involving deprivation of another\u2019s intangible right to honest services. Guideline \u00a7 2C1.7 applies to frauds involving \u201cdeprivation of another\u2019s intangible right to honest services.\u201d Thus, Adams\u2019 offense conduct corresponds to \u00a7 2C1.7 and the district court properly applied that guideline section in determining Adams\u2019 sentence. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court properly resentenced James Malkus, Patrick Frega and Dennis Adams upon remand from their prior appeal to this Court. Accordingly, we affirm their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b581-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
