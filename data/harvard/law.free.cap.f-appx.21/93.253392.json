Haynesworth was sentenced to a 105-month prison term for each count, to run concurrently. Haynesworth\u2019s sole issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). Haynes-worth must present a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawing his guilty plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(e); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Based on the factors set forth in <em>Moore, </em>we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Haynesworth\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
