R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b801-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">Robert Earl Fort, an Oregon State prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as procedurally defaulted and without merit. Because Fort\u2019s petition cannot succeed on the merits, we need not address the question of procedural default. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-23\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, we may only disturb a state court\u2019s determination of law if it \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.) (defining \u201cunreasonable application\u201d as involving situations where the state court has committed clear error), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-24\">Fort first contends that the prosecutor knew that he was innocent and withheld evidence. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the Oregon Circuit Court denied Fort\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct on the merits. Because Fort failed to rebut the state court\u2019s factual findings by clear and convincing evidence, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1), its decision was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>clearly erroneous and the district court properly denied Fort relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Fort also contends that he pleaded guilty because his attorney conspired with the prosecution and did not properly investigate his case. To establish ineffective assistance, Fort must show that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to satisfy the prejudice prong of the test, \u201cthe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Fort did not satisfy that burden because he confessed to the crime and offers no evidence that he would have elected a trial if the court had assigned him a different attorney. Because Fort has not established that the Washington courts\u2019 rejection of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims was clearly erroneous, the district court properly denied his petition. <em>See Van Tran, </em>212 F.3d at 1149, 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
