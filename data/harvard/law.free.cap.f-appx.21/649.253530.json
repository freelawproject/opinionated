He brought this action alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101-12213 (2001) (the Act), and the Washington Law Against Discrimination, wash, rev. codes \u00a7 49.60 (West 2001). The district court granted summary judgment on the ground, among others, that Roeber has failed to produce facts raising a triable issue that he was disabled within the meaning of the Act. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">The Act defines a \u201cdisability\u201d as \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2) (2001). \u201cSubstantially limits\u201d means \u201c[u]nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform\u201d or \u201c[significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the ... average person .\u201d <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 480, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">The district court did not err in finding insufficient evidence of disability. Roeber\u2019s evidence consisted of his affidavit describing migraine attacks, which Roeber could treat with medication. The affidavit also described bouts of depression brought on by migraines; although these were \u201cessentially incapacitating\u201d while they lasted, Roeber \u201cminimize[d] the[ir] effects ... as [he] want[ed] to believe that [he was] liv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ing a normal life.\u201d The record is devoid of clinical findings. Indeed, the medical records, while reflecting frequent visits to physicians, do not show any complaints about medical problems interfering with any life activity. They show occasional complaints about headaches with medication giving good relief, and occasional consultations with a nurse practitioner but no complaints about depression. <em>Cf. McAlindin v. County of San Diego, </em>192 F.3d 1226, 1235 (9th Cir.1999), <em>amended by </em>201 F.3d 1211 (2000) (examining record below that included evaluations by several doctors documented medical impairments).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Finally, throughout the period, Roeber received positive performance evaluations from Dowty. These evaluations refute not only his disability claim but his claim of being regarded as disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b680-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
