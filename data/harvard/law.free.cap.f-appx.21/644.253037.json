Flores argues that the district judge clearly erred in finding that he was competent to stand trial. We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-21\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b675-22\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case we repeat them here only where necessary to explain our decision. A defendant is competent to stand trial if he \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding ... [and] a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Oklahoma, </em>517 U.S. 348, 354, 116 S.Ct. 1373, 134 L.Ed.2d 498 (1996) (citation omitted). We review for clear error a district judge\u2019s determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>a defendant is competent to stand trial. <em>See United States v. Chischilly, </em>30 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The district judge\u2019s finding that Flores was competent to stand trial is fully supported by the record. Two professionals examined Flores before his trial, and both of these individuals determined that he was competent. Dr. Glazzard and his staff observed Flores for three weeks, and both Dr. Pollack and Dr. Glazzard came to similar conclusions. Each doctor determined that Flores had significant mental problems, but that he was capable of understanding the nature of the trial process and the charges against him. Each doctor also determined that working with Flores might be difficult or require patience, but that, ultimately, he was capable of assisting in his own defense. Finally, Flores never challenged any aspect of either psychological assessment, and both reports were admitted into evidence without controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Flores\u2019s suggestion that his obstreperous behavior during trial alone should have indicated that he was mentally incompetent lacks merit. It is true that many of Flores\u2019s decisions during the course of the proceedings were self-defeating, and that his behavior was at times uncontrolled. Nonetheless, Flores\u2019s behavior alone cannot render the district court\u2019s competency determination clearly erroneous in the face of the two psychological reports. No one factor is determinative in deciding the ultimate issue of competence. <em>People of the Territory of Guam v. Taitano, </em>849 F.2d 431, 432 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that a defendant\u2019s refusal \u201cto cooperate with his lawyer does not automatically render [him] incompetent to stand trial\u201d). Flores\u2019s behavior was simply evidence that the district judge had to weigh along with everything else, and does not overcome the effect of the two determinations of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">We also reject Flores\u2019s assertion that the opinions of Dr. Pollack and Dr. Glazzard were invalid because they did not have his full medical history, or know that he had previously been adjudicated incompetent. By the time of Flores\u2019s trial on the immigration charges, his previous adjudication of incompetency was over ten years old. Competency evaluations must focus on a defendant\u2019s <em>present </em>ability to stand trial. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a) (stating that a court must hold a competency hearing if there is reason to believe that the defendant may <em>presently </em>be suffering from a mental illness rendering him incapable to stand trial) (emphasis added); <em>Cooper, </em>517 U.S. at 354 (stating that a defendant is competent if he \u201chas sufficient <em>present </em>ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding ... \u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also, Massie v. Woodford, </em>244 F.3d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that in determining whether next-friend standing is available, evidence of a prisoner\u2019s past history of mental illness does not overcome valid evidence of current competence).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Moreover, as a factual matter, we do not believe that Flores\u2019s past medical history and adjudication of incompetence would have materially affected Dr. Pollack\u2019s or Dr. Glazzard\u2019s opinions or the district court\u2019s ultimate determination that Flores could stand trial. First, although Flores was found incompetent in 1988, he was rehabilitated and six months later determined to be capable of standing trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Also, the reports of Pollard and Glazzard are quite consistent with the findings of the Atascadero staff, despite the fact that they were not familiar with Flores\u2019s entire history. And although Dr. Stewart was asked to determine whether Flores\u2019s mental illnesses could affect his sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>rather than his ability to stand trial, he had Flores\u2019s full medical history at his disposal and did not reach a conclusion different from Dr. Pollack or Dr. Glazzard.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">It is also significant that neither Dr. Pollard nor Dr. Glazzard ever indicated that they lacked sufficient information to form an opinion as to Flores\u2019s competency. Each doctor based his opinion on personal observation of and interaction with Flores. Given that competency depends on a defendant\u2019s ability to understand the legal process and assist his attorney, personal observation may be one of the best tools in making a competency determination. Finally, it was Flores\u2019s refusal to sign a medical release that prevented his medical history from being made available in a more timely fashion. For these reasons, the fact that Dr. Pollack and Dr. Glazzard were unaware of Flores\u2019s previous adjudication of incompetence does not render their opinions invalid, or in any way cast doubt on the solidity of the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because Flores has not explicitly argued that the evidence against him was insufficient or that he was entitled to a fourth attorney, we decline to address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
