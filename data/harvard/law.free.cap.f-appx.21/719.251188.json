The IJ found Malinsky deportable as an aggravated felon under section 241 (a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (current version at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)), and ineligible to apply for relief from deportation under former INA section 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994). We deny the petition because we agree that Malinsky was convicted of \u201can offense involving fraud or deceit\u201d with over $10,000 of loss to victims under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA erred, however, in finding Malinsky ineligible to apply for section 212(c) relief. We thus stay the mandate for 90 days to allow him to seek such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules apply because the deportation proceedings were initiated before April 1, 1997 and a final order of deportation was filed after October 30, 1996. <em>See, e.g., Alberto-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 906, 908 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000). Under IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G), \u201cthere shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed [an aggravated felony].\u201d Accordingly, if the BIA correctly concluded that Malinsky was convicted of an aggravated felony, then we lack jurisdiction to review the deportation decision. <em>Park v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 1018, 1021 (9th Cir.2001). Nevertheless, we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he jurisdictional question and the merits collapse into one.\u201d <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">IIRIRA\u2019s amended definitions of \u201caggravated felony\u201d apply regardless of the date of conviction, if, as in this case, the BIA\u2019s decision was rendered after IIRIRA\u2019s date of enactment. IIRIRA \u00a7 321(c); <em>Valderrama-Fonseca v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 853, 856 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">&gt; We agree with the BIA that Malinsky\u2019s mail fraud conviction was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of section 1101 (a) (43)(M)(i), with a loss to victims of over $10,000. The underlying criminal judgment ordered Malinsky to pay restitution of $120,490. The plain language of the statute reads \u201closs to victim <em>or victims.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(A)(i) (emphasis added). Even if the fraudulent scheme only took $285 from each victim, the total loss to all of Malinsky\u2019s victims easily exceeded $10,000. Each count of the information was a separate use of the mails, a jurisdictional necessity to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the federal offense of mail fraud. Although each count was a separate letter mailed to a different person, the information did not purport to limit the number of victims. Malinsky was thus convicted of a single scheme to defraud that consisted of a total victim loss of at least $120,490. Just as in <em>Alberto-Gonzalez, </em>where the \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d for purposes of section 1101(a)(43)(G) was determined by the actual sentence imposed and not by the minimum or maximum potential sentence, the amount of \u201closs to victim or victims\u201d was determined by the actual loss to all the victims of the fraudulent scheme as set forth in the criminal judgment. <em>See </em>215 F.3d at 909. <em>Cf. Chowdhury v. INS, </em>249 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.2001) (suggesting that, for mail fraud, the amount of restitution in the criminal judgment may be used to determine the \u201closs to victim or victims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Nevertheless, the BIA erred in finding Malinsky statutorily ineligible for section 212(c) relief. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); <em>Magana-Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 612-13 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we stay the mandate for 90 days to allow Malinsky an opportunity to seek section 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">PETITION FOR RELIEF DENIED; MANDATE STAYED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b750-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this Circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-14\">. Because Malinsky is an aggravated felon under section 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), we need not decide whether he is also an aggravated felon for committing a \"theft offense\" under section 1101(a)(43)(G) or \"attempted theft\" under section 1101(a)(43)(U).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
