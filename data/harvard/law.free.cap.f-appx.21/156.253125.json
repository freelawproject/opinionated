Parker appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in finding that Parker\u2019s possession of the firearm facilitated or potentially facilitated another felony offense, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">Parker was arrested after he sold heroin to an informant under surveillance. In a search of his apartment, authorities found more heroin and a firearm. Parker gave a statement in which he said he knew that, as a convicted felon, he could not possess a firearm, but that he needed the gun for protection. The government also produced evidence at the sentencing hearing that Parker had sold heroin from his home on occasion. In sentencing Parker, the district court determined that he had possessed the firearm in connection with drug trafficking, another felony, and that the sentence enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">The government has the burden of showing facts necessary to establish the applicability of an enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) by a preponderance of the evidence, and the district court\u2019s fact findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001). This court has held that the terms \u201cused\u201d and \u201cin connection with,\u201d as used in subsection (b)(5), are analogous to the terms \u201cused\u201d and \u201cin relation to\u201d in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West 2000). <em>Id. </em>(extending holding in <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (4th Cir.1996) to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)). A firearm may be used in connection with another felony if it \u201cfacilitates or has a tendency to facilitate the felony offense.\u201d <em>Garnett, </em>243 F.3d at 829 (citing <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 237, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">Parker argues that there was no evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that his firearm facilitated or potentially facilitated his drug offense. However, the district court found that Parker\u2019s drug of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>fense was facilitated by his possession of the firearm in that he kept it to protect himself and his drugs. Parker\u2019s statement that he needed the gun for protection provides factual support for the district court\u2019s finding. Thus, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. White, </em>875 F.2d 427, 433 (4th Cir.1989) (recognizing that weapons, such as firearms, are tools of the drug trade).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
