The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Northbrook, and Century Park appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-27\">When part of one of Century Park\u2019s buildings suffered damage due to sinking of a slab, a claim was made against North-brook. The latter denied the claim on the basis of the earth movement exclusion in the policy. Century Park asserts that the exclusion is ambiguous and that coverage should therefore follow. <em>See AIU Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>v. Superior Court, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 822, 799 P.2d 1253, 1264, 274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 831 (1990). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">When the plain language of an insurance contract is \u201cclear and explicit, it governs.\u201d <em>Bank of the W. v. Superior Court, </em>2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264, 833 P.2d 545, 552, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 545 (1992). That is the case here because it is pellucid that the unqualified phrase \u201cany earth movement\u201d includes all types of movement, both sudden and sluggish movement, and both natural and artificial movement. <em>Cf. Sabella v. Wisler, </em>59 Cal.2d 21, 31, 377 P.2d 889, 895, 27 Cal.Rptr. 689, 695 (1963); <em>Murray v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>219 Cal.App.3d 58, 63-64, 268 Cal.Rptr. 33, 36 (1990). The additional \u201csuch as\u201d language does not serve to limit that. Of course, we recognize that when a policy provision \u201cis capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable,\u201d it will be deemed ambiguous. <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>18 Cal.4th 857, 868, 959 P.2d 265, 272, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 114 (1998) (quotation marks omitted). However, that certainly does not mean that a provision is ambiguous simply because a court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> somewhere, has deemed it so. <em>See Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Baker, </em>22 F.3d 880, 889 (9th Cir.1994); <em>ACL Techs., Inc. v. Northbrook Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>17 Cal.App.4th 1773, 1787 n. 39, 22 Cal.Rptr.2d 206, 214 n. 39 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">.
