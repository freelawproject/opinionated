Although Choy-Alvarez claimed no actual knowledge of the contents of the messages, he conceded to constructive knowledge of the contents by admitting that \u201cexplosions, [or] car bombs\u201d would happen shortly after their delivery and acknowledged that it was reasonable to conclude that he had been delivering instructions to carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
