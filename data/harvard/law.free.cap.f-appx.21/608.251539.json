We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">The BIA conducted a de novo review of Flores\u2019 claims. Accordingly, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that Flores failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding. <em>Id. </em>The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This standard is extremely deferential, and we are required to uphold the BIA\u2019s denial unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Id. </em>at n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">Initially, the IJ determined that Flores was not credible, a finding she did not challenge on appeal to the BIA. We thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>lack jurisdiction over challenges to that adverse credibility determination. <em>Rashtabadi v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1567 (9th Cir.1994). Similarly, we lack jurisdiction over challenges to the adequacy of the representation Flores received during proceedings before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Flores contends that her life was threatened in 1991 by FMLN guerrillas on account of her political opinion because she participated in ARENA activities when she was 15 years-old. Assuming past persecution, Flores is entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Leiva-Montalvo v. INS, </em>173 F.3d 749, 751 (9th Cir.1999); 8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(1)(i). The government can rebut this presumption by demonstrating that an alien\u2019s home country conditions have changed such that the fear of future persecution is not objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>The State Department\u2019s 1994-95 country profile indicates that 1992 Peace Accords ended the civil war in El Salvador and that \u201call [asylum] claims from Salvadoran applicants should be reviewed in light of the sweeping changes which have taken place in that country since then.\u201d Although violence was high, \u201c[t]here were no confirmed cases of politically motivated killings, but investigations in a number of cases remains open.\u201d The FMLN now participates in the government as an opposition party. Moreover, Flores admitted that she could be targeted for a reason other that her political opinion. We agree with the BIA that the government successfully rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Additionally, \u201c[w]hen determining whether a fear is \u2018well-founded,\u2019 a court may consider evidence that a person could safely move elsewhere in their home-country.\u201d Cor<em>don-Garcia, </em>204 F.3d at 991 (citation omitted). Thus, even crediting the 1996 declaration from the municipal may- or, Flores failed to explain sufficiently why internal relocation within El Salvador is not realistic. The State Department indicted that \u201c[flreedom of movement throughout El Salvador is permitted by the government, and there are no restrictions on citizens\u2019 changing their places of residence or work .... For those applicants alleging threats and harassment by recidivist guerrillas, the option of internal relocation is available in most eases.\u201d Moreover, Flores\u2019 mother, uncle, and three brothers have continued to live in El Salvador without incident. <em>Cf. Rodriguez-Rivera v. U.S. Dept. IN, </em>848 F.2d 998, 1006 (9th Cir.1988) (reasoning that petitioner\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution was undercut by fact that family remained unmolested in El Salvador).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">We conclude that no reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude that Flores possessed a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Because Flores cannot satisfy the requirements for a discretionary grant of asylum, she cannot satisfy the more rigorous standards for withholding of deportation. <em>See Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 394 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-14\">.
