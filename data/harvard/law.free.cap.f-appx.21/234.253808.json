We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Thurston v. Louisa Cnty. Public Sch., </em>No. CA-01-84-3 (W.D.Va. filed Aug. 27, 2001; entered Aug. 28, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">In No. 01-2157, Thurston appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his claims as to Defendant Collins for failure to state a claim, but allowing the action to proceed as to the Defendant United Parcel Service (No. 01-2157). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order here appealed is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. We dismiss this appeal as interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
