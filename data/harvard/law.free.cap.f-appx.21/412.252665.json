Risser, appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment to Defendant, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., regarding Petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate or modify an arbitrator\u2019s award brought pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9 <em>&amp; </em>10, for failure to comply with the service of process provisions of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">On April 26, 1999, Petitioner filed a motion to vacate and/or modify the January 25, 1999 arbitration award issued by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (\u201cNASD\u201d) which ruled primarily in favor of Respondent on Petitioner\u2019s claim. (J.A. at 5, 8.) In the caption of Petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate, he listed the as the \u201cappellee\u201d in this action \u201cMERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE FENNER &amp; SMITH, INC. World Financial Center, North Tower, New York, N.Y. 10281.\u201d Petitioner hand-delivered a copy of a notice and copy of his motion to vacate, without cover letter or specific addressee, to Respondent\u2019s Columbus, Ohio branch office. Petitioner did not attempt any other form of service; nor did Petitioner move for leave to attempt any other service.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Respondent moved for summary judgment on May 14, 1999, on the basis of Petitioner\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the service of process requirements of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12. The district court granted Respondent\u2019s motion on August 3, 2000, and dismissed Petitioner\u2019s motion. Petitioner now timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">After careful review and consideration of both parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and relevant case law, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting Respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Because no jurisprudential purpose would be served by the issuance of a separate opinion on appeal, we AFFIRM for the reasons set forth in United States District Judge George C. Smith\u2019s August 3, 2000 order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
