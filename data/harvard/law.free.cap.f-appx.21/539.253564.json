Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the district court\u2019s dismissal was proper. Although Nelson\u2019s supporting documents show he had exhausted administrative remedies with defendant Ricky McCarrell at the time of the district court\u2019s ruling, Nelson fails to show he had exhausted them with the remaining defendants. <em>See Graves v. Norris, </em>218 F.3d 884, 885 (8th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Nelson\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-15\"> The Honorable Stephen M.
