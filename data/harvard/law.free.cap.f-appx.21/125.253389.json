Brown seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. <em>See Brown v. Apfel, </em>No. CA-98-907-1 (M.D.N.C. Jan. 31, 2000). Recently, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), 416.920(c), subpart P, appendix 1, section 12.05(C) was revised. 65 Fed.Reg. 50,746, 50,772, 50,776, 50,780 (Aug. 21, 2000). This revision pertains to the central issue in Brown\u2019s case\u2014 whether she had another physical or mental impairment under \u00a7 12.05(C). The Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision to deny benefits rested on the finding that Brown could still perform her past work as a housekeeper. This finding is no longer dispositive in light of the revised regulation. Because the revised regulation was not available to the ALJ when she denied Brown\u2019s claim, we remand this case to the district court with instructions to remand it to the ALJ for reconsideration in fight of the revised regulation. In doing so, we express no opinion as to the merits of Brown\u2019s claim. We grant the motion to substitute Jerry L. Williams, Jr., as counsel for Brown. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
