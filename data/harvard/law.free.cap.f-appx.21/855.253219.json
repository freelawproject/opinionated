R.App. P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">Randolph Bowden Scott, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. Mr. Scott pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, a status offense criminalized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court sentenced Mr. Scott to fifteen years of imprisonment. Mr. Scott\u2019s conviction became final on February 24, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-21\">To qualify for a COA, a defendant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Mr. Scott may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions raised deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Mr. Scott has made no such showing, and his request for a COA is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b885-23\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). <em>See United States v. Fillman, </em>162 F.3d 1055, 1056 (10th Cir.1998). Under \u00a7 2244(d)(1), a one-year period of limitation exists for filing habeas corpus petitions. <em>See Hoggro </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>v.. Boone, </em>150 F.3d 1223, 1225 (10th Cir.1998). For prisoners like Mr. Scott, whose conviction became final before April 24, 1996, the one-year statute of limitations begins on April 24, 1996. <em>See id. </em>at 1225-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The district court first determined that Mr. Scott\u2019s petition, filed December 4, 2000, was untimely. The district court correctly determined that Mr. Scott\u2019s petition was due April 23, 1997, absent tolling of the limitation period. Equitable tolling is appropriate only in exceptional circumstances, and an inmate should diligently pursue his claims in order to avail himself of tolling. <em>See Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). Because Mr. Scott had from February 24, 1992, until April 23, 1997 to file his petition and provides no explanation for his delay, we conclude that Mr. Scott has not been diligent in pursuing his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Mr. Scott also seeks equitable tolling based on his contention that he is actually innocent of the crime because the gun in question belonged to his father. Mr. Scott may raise this claim on collateral review \u201cin the absence of showing of cause for the procedural fault,\u201d if he can demonstrate that \u201ca constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). To establish actual innocence, Mr. Scott must demonstrate that, \u201cin light of all the evidence,\u201d \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327-328, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">We agree with the district court that Mr. Scott has failed even to raise colorable allegations of factual innocence as to the underlying grounds. Mr. Scott does not dispute that he possessed the firearm. <em>See </em>Rec. doc. 9 (plea bargain filed Dec. 30, 1991, at p. 7) (\u201cI had in my possession a shotgun shipped in interstate commerce .... \u201d). Mr. Scott\u2019s refutation of ownership of the firearm does not preclude the conviction for illegal possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>United States v. Hishaw, </em>235 F.3d 565, 571 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Mr. Scott also seeks to avoid \u00a7 2244(d)(1)\u2019s time bar by invoking the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) exception for newly recognized constitutional rights by relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>requires that facts \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction,\u201d used to enhance the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum, must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Here, the only factor used to enhance Mr. Scott\u2019s sentence was his prior convictions. As such, we agree with the district court that Mr. Scott\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument is unsupported.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Mr. Scott\u2019s reliance on <em>Castillo </em>is also misplaced. In <em>Castillo, </em>the Court held, in part, that \u201cuse of a machine gun\u201d constitutes an offense element because it has not traditionally been used as a sentencing factor. 530 U.S. at 126-27, 120 S.Ct. 2090. As noted above, Mr. Scott\u2019s conviction was enhanced based solely upon his prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>victions. Mr. Scott cannot demonstrate that his arguments based on <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Castillo </em>provide a basis for revisiting his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Scott\u2019s motion for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. The district court dismissed Mr. Scott\u2019s petition as untimely without reaching a conclusion about whether <em>Apprendi </em>applies retroactively to collateral attacks. Because we too conclude that <em>Apprendi </em>is factually inapplicable to Mr. Scott's conviction and sentence, we similarly need not decide this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
