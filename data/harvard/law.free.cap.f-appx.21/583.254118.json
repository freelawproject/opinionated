INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 887 (9th Cir.2001). Credibility determinations, factual findings, and the determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000). Under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, \u201cunless the evidence presented compels a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary result,\u201d this court is \u201crequired to uphold the IJ\u2019s f\u00ednding[s].\u201d <em>Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 911 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The IJ first found that Lin\u2019s demeanor supported a negative credibility finding. The IJ observed that Lin appeared \u201cflustered and red in the face\u201d during key points in his testimony-when testifying about (1) his alleged midnight flight from the hospital, the timing of his appeal letter, and his subsequent flight to Jiangsu province, and (2) his alleged return to Changle City in 1997 and the arrest warrant. That testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>central to Lin\u2019s asylum claim, and it was materially inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Lin has failed to adequately explain the inconsistencies in his testimony. Although \u201cminor inconsistencies or misrepresentations of unimportant facts cannot constitute the basis for an adverse credibility finding,\u201d <em>Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1382 (9th Cir.1990), the discrepancies here go to the heart of Lin\u2019s asylum claim. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the Id\u2019s negative credibility finding. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir.1997) (concluding that where \u201cthe discrepancies relate to the basis for [the petitioner\u2019s] alleged fear of persecution,\u201d they \u201cinvolve[ ] the heart of the asylum claim and support the negative credibility finding\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We reject Lin\u2019s argument that the IJ erred by not giving sufficient weight to his documentary evidence. The IJ gave \u201cspecific, cogent reason[s] for rejecting it, and th[ose] reason[s] ... bear a legitimate nexus to that rejection.\u201d <em>Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1165 (9th Cir.2000). We also reject Lin\u2019s argument that the IJ\u2019s negative credibility finding was erroneously based on his failure to corroborate his testimony. Although the IJ noted that Lin did not provide certain corroboration for his testimony, an expectation of corroborative evidence is warranted \u201cwhere the IJ has reason to question the applicant\u2019s credibility,\u201d <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000), as the IJ did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Because Lin has failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he has necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Al-Harbi, </em>242 F.3d at 888-89 (describing the more stringent standard for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Finally, we are not persuaded by Lin\u2019s argument that the BIA erred by failing to make findings and consider evidence in connection with his Torture Convention claim. We recognize that a claim for relief under the Convention is analytically separate from a claim under the INA. <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.2001). Lin failed to make any specific argument before the BIA, however, with respect to his Torture Convention claim. Because Lin\u2019s Torture Convention claim is based on the same testimony as his INA claim, and he has not \u201cpresented] evidence establishing substantial grounds for believing that he ... would be in danger of being subjected to torture\u201d in China, <em>id. </em>at 1284 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the IJ and BIA properly rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-20\">.
