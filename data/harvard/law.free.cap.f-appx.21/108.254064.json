Paz-Zamora\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but contends on Paz-Zamora\u2019s behalf that the district court erred in sentencing Paz-Zamora to ninety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>months\u2019 imprisonment, which was within the guidelines range of seventy-seven to ninety-six months. Paz-Zamora was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">As Paz-Zamora presents no challenge to the calculation of the guidelines range but merely contends his sentence was too high within the correct range, we find he is not entitled to appellate review on his claim. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1150-51 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). In addition, we have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Paz-Zamora\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
