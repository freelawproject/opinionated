Idris, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) denying her application for asylum and withholding of deportation. The Board concluded that Idris failed to present credible evidence to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground that would make her eligible for asylum relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999); 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001). The Board\u2019s decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (West 1999). We find that the Board correctly applied the law and did not abuse its discretion in rendering its decision here. Therefore, we deny a petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>Idris v. United States Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>BIA No. A74-638-974 (B.I.A. Feb. 28, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
