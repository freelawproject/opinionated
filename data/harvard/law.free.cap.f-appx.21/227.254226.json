Sharafeldin filed an amended complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001). He alleged hostile work environment harassment and constructive discharge arising from his employment as a chaplain at the Maryland Correctional Training Center. Sharafeldin sought leave to file a second amended complaint alleging a failure-to-hire claim. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of this motion and the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-21\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and joint appendix and the district court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Sharafeldin v. State of Maryland, </em>No. CA-99-2940-H (D. Md. June 14, 2000; Feb. 13, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
