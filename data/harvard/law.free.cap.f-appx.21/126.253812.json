Because McAbee has failed to establish the materiality of the proffered new evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">McAbee, a former mechanic and heavy equipment operator, applied for social security disability insurance benefits on December 27, 1995. In his claim for benefits, McAbee stated that he had been unable to work since September 27, 1994, as a result of debilitating headaches and pain in his right arm, shoulder, and neck. McAbee\u2019s initial application for disability insurance benefits and his request for reconsideration were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">McAbee thereafter made a timely request for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). At the hearing, McAbee testified that he suffered from \u201carm pain most constantly,\u201d and from headaches almost daily. He described his headaches as typically \u201cjust a dull ache\u201d that intensified when he became active. McAbee also testified that he could take out the trash, mow the grass, and occasionally pull weeds, but that he was incapable of fishing, driving long distances, or performing any tasks that required him to lie on his back, reach over his head, or stand for eight hours a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">The medical records from McAbee\u2019s treating and examining physicians corroborate McAbee\u2019s account of pain in his right arm, shoulder, and neck. The medical records reflect that McAbee made at least 25 visits to treating physicians for such pain from November 1993 through the date of the ALJ hearing in August 1997. In the course of these visits, doctors determined that McAbee suffered from an 8-12% impairment of his upper right extremity, but were unable to diagnose the cause of his arm, shoulder, and neck pain. By 1995, the doctors reported that McAbee had reached maximum improvement and consistently recommended that McAbee either return to work, subject to certain restrictions, or enter vocational rehabilitation to prepare him for another line of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The medical records provide less support for McAbee\u2019s account of debilitating headaches. McAbee testified at the hearing that he had suffered from headaches since 1992 or 1993, but the medical records reflect that McAbee did not complain of headaches until February 1996. According to the medical records, this February 1996 visit is the only time that McAbee complained of headaches in the four years prior to the hearing before the ALJ, and, moreover, McAbee did not visit a doctor again until January 1997, almost one full year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">A consulting medical examiner, Dr. Schwartz, evaluated McAbee in April 1997 and determined that McAbee remained capable of sitting, standing, walking, stooping, crouching, kneeling, and crawling. The consulting examiner also concluded that McAbee was limited to lifting or carrying 20-25 pounds and could not engage in repetitive pushing or pulling. Dr. Schwartz noted McAbee\u2019s complaints of upper extremity pain and weakness; he did not note any complaint of headaches by McAbee.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">A vocational expert, after considering McAbee\u2019s medical records, testimony, educational level, and work experience, testified at the hearing regarding other jobs existing in the regional economy that McAbee remained capable of performing. This expert stated that pain in McAbee\u2019s right arm, shoulder, and neck would not prevent him from performing the duties of a packer, cashier/clerk, and security person, and that thousands of these jobs existed within South Carolina. The expert also testified, however, that if McAbee had the headaches he described, they \u201cwould be debilitating in nature\u201d and would cause problems of absenteeism, lack of concentration, and inability to complete tasks in a timely fashion. The ALJ agreed at the hearing to allow McAbee twenty days to produce additional medical evidence. McAbee subsequently submitted, and the ALJ considered, additional evidence consisting of a psychological evaluation and x-ray evaluations showing \u201cminimal degenerative changes in[McAbee\u2019s] right wrist and right shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The ALJ issued his opinion on December 16, 1997. He found that McAbee\u2019s right arm, shoulder, and neck pain, although \u201csevere,\u201d did not prevent McAbee from performing \u201clight duty\u201d or \u201csedentary\u201d work. In addition, the ALJ found that McAbee\u2019s headaches were not \u201cmedically determinable \u2018severe\u2019 impairments.\u201d The ALJ found that McAbee\u2019s failure to \u201creceive [ ] or even seek treatment for his headaches\u201d weighed against a finding that McAbee\u2019s headaches were a \u201csevere\u201d impairment. The ALJ concluded that McAbee therefore was not qualified for disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">McAbee filed a request for review with the Appeals Council. The Appeals Council denied the request on March 9, 1999, and adopted the ALJ\u2019s decision as the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">McAbee then filed for judicial review in the district court, which referred the case to a magistrate judge. At the hearing before the magistrate judge, McAbee identified new evidence that he argued warranted remand to the Secretary for consideration. The new evidence consisted of a signed statement, dated March 27, 1999, from Dr. Larry Bowman, an orthopaedic specialist who had treated McAbee from April 1995 through January 1999, and a \u201crediscovered\u201d Hepatitis C diagnosis. McAbee argued that this \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d constituted the necessary medical support for his headache claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Dr. Bowman\u2019s statement, drafted primarily by McAbee\u2019s lawyer with blanks that had been filled in by Bowman, reported that McAbee \u201chas had debilitating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>headaches\u201d and that \u201c[w]hile the exact mechanism that causes these headaches has not been identified,\u201d McAbee was suffering from \u201cchrome myofascial pain.\u201d Dr. Bowman added, in his own handwriting, that McAbee\u2019s Hepatitis C condition \u201climits most medications that have any effect on improving symptoms.\u201d McAbee was first diagnosed with Hepatitis C after donating blood in 1990, but McAbee did not ask the ALJ to consider this evidence as a cause of McAbee\u2019s condition, and McAbee \u201crediscovered\u201d that he was suffering from the condition only after tests conducted in 1998 revealed high enzyme levels. Thus, the \u201crediscovered\u201d Hepatitis C diagnosis was new evidence insofar as the condition was, after 1998, purported to cause headaches or limit available treatment for head-aches.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation in which he recommended remand based on the new evidence. The district court rejected the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and instead held that McAbee had failed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for his failure to present his evidence at an earlier stage of the proceedings. The court found that McAbee possessed both the factual basis for Dr. Bowman\u2019s 1999 statement and the new documentation of McAbee\u2019s Hepatitis C condition prior to the Appeals Council\u2019s ruling on March 9, 1999, and therefore should have submitted the evidence to the Appeals Council for consideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">McAbee concedes that there was insufficient evidence at the hearing before the ALJ to support a determination of disability. The sole issue on appeal is therefore whether McAbee\u2019s \u201cnew evidence,\u201d consisting of Dr. Bowman\u2019s 1999 statement and the Hepatitis C diagnosis, warrants a remand to the Secretary for a new hearing. A reviewing court can remand only if the claimant establishes that the new evidence \u201cis material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Evidence is material \u201cif there is a reasonable possibility that the new evidence would have changed the outcome.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Secretary, </em>953 F.2d 93, 96 (4th Cir.1991) (en banc) (citation omitted); <em>accord Borders v. Heckler, 777 </em>F.2d 954, 955-56 (4th Cir.1985). McAbee\u2019s new evidence therefore must constitute objective medical evidence of a condition that \u201ccould reasonably produce the pain or other symptoms alleged.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A) (1994)., In addition, McAbee must establish that this evidence, when considered in conjunction with all evidence, \u201cwould lead to a conclusion that the individual is under a disability\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act. <em>Id. </em>Put another way, McAbee\u2019s new evidence must not only provide an objective medical basis for the headaches, but must also be sufficient, in light of the record, to alter the ALJ\u2019s determination as to \u201cthe effect of pain on a claimant\u2019s ability to function.\u201d <em>Foster v. Heckler, </em>780 F.2d 1125, 1128 (4th Cir.1986) (citing <em>Myers v. Califano, </em>611 F.2d 980 (4th Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Even assuming that the evidence as to the effect of Hepatitis C combined with Dr. Bowman\u2019s 1999 new diagnosis of \u201cchronic myofascial pain\u201d reasonably could be understood to identify a source of debilitating, untreatable headaches, McAbee\u2019s evidence does not sup-port a finding of \u201cdisability\u201d in light of the other evidence properly considered by the ALJ. Dr. Bowman\u2019s 1999 statement as to \u201cchronic myofascial pain\u201d failed to place his diagnosis as to McAbee\u2019s \u201cdebilitating headaches\u201d in the relevant time period, which includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>only the time period prior to the ALJ hearing, <em>i.e., </em>1992 or 1993 through August, 1997. Even more significantly, Dr. Bowman\u2019s conclusory statement does not suffice to outweigh the reports he and other physicians dictated contemporaneously with their treatment of McAbee during the relevant time period. <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 590 (4th Cir.1996) (stating that a physician\u2019s opinion should be accorded \u201csignificantly less weight\u201d if it \u201cis not supported by the clinical evidence or if it is inconsistent with other substantial evidence\u201d); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2) (2001) (providing that all evidence is weighed when a medical opinion \u201cis inconsistent with other evidence or is inherently inconsistent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Dr. Bowman\u2019s 1999 statement reports that McAbee suffers from \u201cdebilitating headaches\u201d that \u201ceven prevent light exertion.\u201d These statements are inconsistent with those contained in his prior reports, in which Dr. Bowman makes only one passing reference to a \u201chead-ache,\u201d states that McAbee has reached maximum improvement, and recommends that McAbee \u201cattempt [to] return to full duty ... with a splint\u201d or \u201cconsider vocational rehabilitation.\u201d Dr. Bowman\u2019s 1999 statement is also contradicted by medical reports from McAbee\u2019s other treating and examining physicians, who concluded, as Dr. Bowman had in his prior reports, that McAbee was capable of returning either to his present job or to another line of work. <em>See Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1458 (4th Cir.1990) (crediting statements by two physicians recommending that the claimant return to work). These earlier medical reports are inconsistent with Dr. Bowman\u2019s assertion in 1999 that McAbee was then suffering from \u201cdebilitating headaches\u201d that presented such a substantial barrier to employment that McAbee was \u201cdisabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">McAbee\u2019s Hepatitis C conclusion also does not suggest that Me Abee suffered from debilitating headaches constituting a \u201cdisability.\u201d First, there is <em>no </em>evidence that McAbee\u2019s Hepatitis C was ever considered in treatment decisions during the relevant time period. Therefore, the limiting effect of Hepatitis C on available remedies could not have contributed to the headaches or to the inability to control them.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Moreover, McAbee\u2019s own testimony at the hearing, which must be considered in conjunction with any new evidence, virtually forecloses finding that McAbee suffered debilitating headaches that constituted a \u201cdisability.\u201d Although McAbee described headaches that were sporadically painful, he also testified at the hearing that his headaches, in fact, were often \u201cjust a dull ache\u201d and that he remained capable of participating in various activities inconsistent with a \u201csevere\u201d disability. <em>Mickles v. Shalala, </em>29 F.3d 918, 921 (4th Cir.1994) (rejecting claimant\u2019s subjective reports of pain where she was able to perform various household chores incompatible with \u201cdisability\u201d under the Act). McAbee did not explain why, when he made numerous visits to treating and examining physicians during the relevant time period, he did not seek treatment for headaches until 1996, at least three years after their alleged onset. Nor does he explain why the records document that even in 1996 he complained only once of a \u201cheadache\u201d and that this was his sole complaint of a headache prior to the ALJ hearing. <em>Id. </em>(affirming denial of benefits where claimant sought treatment only through \u201cone trip to the emergency room for her tension headaches\u201d). For these reasons, McAbee\u2019s new evidence does not begin to demonstrate that the ALJ, equipped with such evidence, would have reached a different conclusion with respect to the effect of such pain on McAbee\u2019s residual functioning capacity. <em>See Foster </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>v. Heckler, </em>780 F.2d 1125, 1130 (4th Cir.1986) (citation omitted). Because we therefore hold that McAbee has failed to show that his \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d is material, we need not reach the issue of whether McAbee established \u201cgood cause\u201d for his failure to present the evidence to the Appeals Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment denying remand to the Secretary of Health and Human Services is</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
