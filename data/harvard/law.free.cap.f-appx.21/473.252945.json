Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Oscar Perales, a federal prisoner, appeals the denial of his Freedom of Information Act request. Because the information sought by Mr. Perales does not exist and would not be subject to a FOIA request if it did, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, Mr. Perales sent a request to the Drug Enforcement Administration for \u201crecords which would give Perales the date and time when the \u2018implementing regulation\u2019 for Title 21, U.S.C. \u00a7 841, was published in the Federal Register, and a copy of the implementing regulation^] \u2018basis and purpose statement.\u2019 \u201d The DEA denied the request, and Mr. Perales appealed to the Office of Information and Privacy for the Department of Justice, which also denied the request. The Department said that the DEA had no relevant records and that there are no implementing regulations for \u00a7 841. Mr. Perales then unsuccessfully sought judicial review of this decision in federal court. The district court concluded that Mr. Perales proceeded under the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d that \u00a7 841 was a rule promulgated by an agency rather than a federal statute and dismissed the action as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">We review dismissals under \u00a7 1915A <em>de novo </em>and will affirm only when it appears beyond doubt that no set of facts supports the plaintiffs claim. <em>Wynn v. Southward, </em>251 F.3d 588, 591-92 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Zimmerman v. Tribble, </em>226 F.3d 568, 571 (7th Cir.2000). The FOIA embraces \u201ca general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 360-61, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Paragraph (1) of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a) requires federal agencies to publish in the Federal Register \u201csubstantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law,\u201d and the Administrative Procedure Act requires these rules to contain a statement of their basis and purpose. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(1)(D), 553(c); <em>see United States Dep\u2019t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. For Freedom of the Press, </em>489 U.S. 749, 754, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989). The FOIA also requires agencies to make records available on request, but it excepts from this requirement those records already made available under \u00a7 552(a)(1) through publication in the Federal Register. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Here, Mr. Perales sought information that he could find in the Federal Register if it existed (which it does not). Although the DEA bore the burden of demonstrating that it adequately searched for the requested information, Mr. Perales needed to be able to show \u201cthat the agency might have discovered a responsive document had the agency conducted a reasonable search.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>56 F.3d 832, 841 (7th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Maynard v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, </em>986 F.2d 547, 560 (1st Cir.1993)). Mr. Perales\u2019s complaint demonstrates that he could not make this showing, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>because \u00a7 552(a)(3) of the FOIA does not cover material already made available through publication in the Federal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Perhaps Mr. Perales had something else in mind when he wrote to the DEA, but the FOIA requires a request that \u201creasonably describes\u201d the record sought. <em>See, e.g., Tax Analysts v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>117 F.3d 607, 610 (D.C.Cir.1997) (\u201cA request reasonably describes records if the agency is able to determine precisely what records are being requested.\u201d (internal quotation and citation omitted)). Mr. Perales\u2019s request, however, described only material that would be available in the public domain. He described nothing properly covered by a FOIA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
