Purdy worked as a locomotive engineer for Burlington Northern Railroad. In 1989, Purdy was involved in a train accident that severed the legs of a coworker. The next year, the Railway terminated Purdy\u2019s employment because of insubordination. Purdy has been disabled since then because of post-traumatic stress disorder. In 1993, Purdy started using the service mark, \u201cBNSF,\u201d an abbreviation for \u201cBringing Now Safety First,\u201d to promote railroad safety, and established Internet websites using the mark. He formed Minnesota and North Dakota corporations named BNSF Corp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>In 1994, Burlington Northern Railroad merged with Sante Fe Railway and created a Delaware corporation, BNSF Corp. The combined railways began using the abbreviation \u201cBNSF\u201d across the country. After the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the merger in 1995, the corporation changed its name to Burlington Northern Sante Fe Corporation and began using the logo \u201cBNSF\u201d on corporate communications, advertising, promotions, and the sides of its locomotives. In 1996, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Purdy use of the service mark \u201cBNSF.\u201d In 1998, a federal court in Texas ordered the service mark void ab initio and ordered the patent office to cancel the registration. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Purdy then brought this action in federal court to determine his rights to the service mark \u201cBNSF\u201d under common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> granted partial summary judgment in the Railway\u2019s favor, finding the Railway had made the first bona fide use of the mark. While Purdy\u2019s use of the mark in interstate and intrastate commerce was sporadic, de minimis, and not directed at a relevant purchasing public, the Railway had deliberately and continuously used the mark \u201cBNSF\u201d in association with the Railway\u2019s operation in the ordinary course of business. Besides the service mark issue, several Railway employees had intervened to challenge Purdy\u2019s publication of their social security numbers and salaries on his website after the information was erroneously sent to Purdy\u2019s site by a Railway budgeting employee. The district court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining Purdy from publishing the social security numbers and the salary information if attached to the employees\u2019 names. The court then transferred the ownership of Purdy\u2019s Internet domain names to the Railway and permanently enjoined Purdy from using the \u201cBNSF\u201d mark in any website address or manner that would cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">On appeal, Purdy asserts he has proper rights to use the service mark and the injunction violates his rights to free speech under the First Amendment. Having carefully reviewed the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, we conclude the district court properly decided the case. Because an extended opinion would serve no useful purpose, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s orders. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-5\"> The Honorable Donovan W. Frank, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
