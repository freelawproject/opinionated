The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed substantially for the reasons stated by the district court in its Memorandum Opinion filed September 21, 2000. Appellee provided a sworn statement from appellant\u2019s prescribing physician that the alleged inadequacy of appellee\u2019s product warning had no effect on his decision to prescribe the drug at issue to appellant. Under D.C. law, in the absence of any evidence calling the prescribing physician\u2019s credibility into question, this statement is sufficient to demonstrate that appellant could not prove that the alleged inadequate warning was a proximate cause of appellant\u2019s injuries. <em>Mampe v. Ayerst Labs., </em>548 A.2d 798, 802 (D.C.1988). Because \u201cthe chain of causation was broken,\u201d summary judgment for appellee was appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-19\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
