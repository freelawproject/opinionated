Reaves appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action alleging various constitutional violations in the condemnation and demolition of two houses by the City of Mullins, South Carolina. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Reeves\u2019 notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

However, Reeves\u2019 notice of appeal was not filed with the district court until June 18, 2001. Because Appellant failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\"> To the extent Reeves mailed his notice of appeal to the district court for filing on June 15, 2001, because he is not incarcerated, he does not benefit from <em>Houston v.
