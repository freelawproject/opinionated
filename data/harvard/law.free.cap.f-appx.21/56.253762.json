Elfvin, <em>Judge, </em>denying his September 25, 2000 motion to vacate the August 25, 2000 final judgment (\u201cAugust Judgment\u201d) that dismissed his complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against defendant prison officials for confiscation of legal papers. The district court construed Poblah\u2019s motion as one pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and denied the motion on the ground that it showed no ground for vacatur of the August Judgment. Finding no basis for reversal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-20\">Poblah\u2019s brief argues the merits of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint in August 2000. However, Poblah failed to file a notice of appeal from the August 25 entry of judgment within the 30 days allowed, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a), and his Rule 60(b) motion to vacate the August Judgment, filed 31 days after the entry of judgment, did not extend his time to appeal from that judgment, <em>see generally </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) (appeal deadline is extended by a Rule 60(b) motion only if the motion is filed no later than 10 days after entry of judgment); <em>Jones v. UNUM Life Insurance Co. of America, </em>223 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir.2000). As no timely appeal was taken from the August Judgment of dismissal, and an appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion calls up for review only the denial of the motion, not the merits of the underlying judgment, <em>see, e.g., Browder v. Director, Department of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978), we lack jurisdiction to consider Poblah\u2019s challenge to the judgment itself, <em>see id. </em>at 264 (time limit for filing a notice of appeal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d). In sum, the merits of the August Judgment are not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-21\">The denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is reviewable only for abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>See, e.g., Sampson v. Radio Corporation of America, </em>434 F.2d 315, 317 (2d Cir.1970). Poblah has not called to our attention any basis for finding that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We note also that if Poblah\u2019s challenges to the underlying judgment were properly before us, we would reject them for lack of merit for the reasons stated by the district court in its Memorandum and Order dated August 23, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We have considered all of Poblah\u2019s contentions that are properly before us and have found them to be without merit. The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
