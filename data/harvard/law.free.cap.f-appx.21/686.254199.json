Hymes appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of her <em>Bivens </em>action alleging violation of her constitutional rights stemming from her arrest and detention for failing to comply with a grand jury subpoena to provide handwriting exemplars. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s decisions on absolute immunity, <em>Fry v. Melaragno, </em>939 F.2d 832, 835 (9th Cir.1991), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Because Hymes failed to allege facts sufficient to show that Magistrate Judge Fenton acted in clear absence of all jurisdiction or performed non-judicial acts, the district court did not err by determining that he was entitled to absolute judicial immunity. <em>See Ashelman v. Pope, </em>793 F.2d 1072, 1075-76 (9th Cir.1986) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Because the arresting officers were executing a valid court order, the district court did not err by determining that defendants were entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity for the actions mandated by that order. <em>See Coverdell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., </em>834 F.2d 758, 764-65 (9th Cir.1987). With respect to the claims that the officers acted improperly regarding the manner in which they executed the warrant, no facts sufficient to state a claim of a constitutional violation are alleged and dismissal was proper on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by not entering default. <em>See Aldabe v. Aldabe, </em>616 F.2d 1089, 1092-93 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">Hymes\u2019 conclusory statements are insufficient to establish that District Court Judge Holland should have recuse himself. <em>See Taylor v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., </em>993 F.2d 710, 712-13 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
