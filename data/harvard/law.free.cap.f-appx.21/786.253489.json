We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial. <em>Tidwell v. Apfel, </em>161 F.3d 599, 601 (9th Cir.1998). We must uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and if it is free from legal error. <em>Id. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-22\">Because Mejias could engage in other types of substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mejias was not disabled under the Social Security Act. <em>See Macri v. Chater, </em>93 F.3d 540, 544 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-23\">Mejias\u2019 contention that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) improperly disregarded some testimony and did not attach enough weight to other testimony is without merit. Because all of the examining doctors provided conclusions similar to the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mejias could perform light work, and because Dr. De Silva\u2019s past relevant work finding was consistent with the ALJ\u2019s decision, the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>Meanel v. Apfel, </em>172 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Mejias\u2019 contention that the ALJ was biased lacks merit because he failed to show a conflict of interest or some other specific reason for disqualification that would overcome the presumption that ALJs are unbiased. <em>See Verduzco v. Apfel, </em>188 F.3d 1087, 1089 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Because the ALJ provided specific reasons to support his adverse credibility finding, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s disbelief of Mejias\u2019 subjective complaints of disability. <em>Flaten v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1464 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b816-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
