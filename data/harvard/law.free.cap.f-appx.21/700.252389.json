Tempesta appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment on his claims of retaliation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and interference with contract against Motorola, Inc. (\u201cMotorola\u201d), Sheila Jones and Timothy Jones. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Tempesta\u2019s claims of improper retaliation pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, and the Arizona Civil Rights Act, Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 41-1461-1466, \u00a7\u00a7 41-1481-1485. All of these related claims must be examined under the Supreme Court\u2019s three-step burden-shifting analysis articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under this approach, Tempesta must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 802. If he succeeds, the burden then shifts to Motorola to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged actions. <em>Id. </em>Then, in order to prevail, Tempesta must show that the reason advanced by Motorola is a pretext for a discriminatory motive. <em>Id. </em>at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The district court <em>determined </em>that Tempesta had created a genuine issue of material fact as to the elements of a prima facie case; that Motorola had offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory justification for the elimination of Tempesta\u2019s job; and that Tempesta had failed to create a triable issue of fact as to pretext. Thus, the district court reasoned, entry of summary judgment was appropriate on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">The salient question for this appeal is whether Tempesta has tendered sufficient evidence of pretext to avoid summary judgment. To create a triable issue, at the pretext stage, Tempesta must present either some direct evidence of discriminatory motive or \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d indirect evidence of pretext. <em>Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1221-22 (9th Cir.1998). Tempesta concedes that there is little, if any, direct evidence of discriminatory motive; thus we must analyze the inferences to be drawn from the circumstantial evidence. To withstand summary judgment, plaintiffs must do more than make a prima facie case based on a bare minimum of circumstantial evidence giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 890 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">To sustain his claim of inference based on circumstantial evidence, Tempesta argues that Motorola\u2019s explanation of its decision to eliminate one of the billing clerk positions is not credible. To be sure, if an employer\u2019s proffered explanation of his employment action is determined to be baseless, it may be sufficiently indicative of intentional discrimination to allow the case to be presented to a jury. <em>See Tex. Dep\u2019t. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). However, if the record persuasively reveals \u201csome other, nondiseriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision,\u201d or \u201cthe plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred,\u201d then the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>sence of a completely satisfactory explanation as to the basis of the employment actions is not enough to raise a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to avoid summary judgment. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In this case, Motorola presented uncontradicted evidence that there had been a significant decrease in the data entry workload, justifying a reduction in force. Given that, Motorola chose to retain the employee with the most seniority and to offer Tempesta reassignment to another department. Tempesta rejoins that the data indicating a decrease did not measure the tasks which he was performing. Motorola concedes that the primary chart upon which it relies did not include a measurement of some of the functions that Tempesta was performing, but contends that the critical point is that there had been a substantial reduction in the overall workload of the department due to the paperless requisitioning system that Motorola had purchased from Texas Instruments, as supported by the uncontroverted testimony of Motorola manager Larry McLaughlin. This is sufficient to establish a credible basis for Motorola\u2019s conclusion that an overall downturn in some of the data processing requirements justified a reduction in force without having to justify a specific decrease in demand for the specific type of data processing Tempesta was performing. <em>Cf. Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., </em>113 F.3d 912, 918 (9th Cir.1996). Once a reduction in force decision was made, implementing it on the basis of seniority was entirely appropriate. Decisions regarding job elimination that are made on the basis of seniority, rather than according to which employee has experienced the greatest decline in his or her workload, are presumptively lawful. <em>See Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters v. U.S., </em>431 U.S. 324, 352, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (Title VII); <em>Cook v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., </em>771 F.2d 635, 644 (2d Cir.1985) (ADEA).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Tempesta claims that there are other indicia of discrimination but, for the reasons cited by the district court, none of these are sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Thus, because the record persuasively reveals \u201csome other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision,\u201d and \u201cthe plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred,\u201d <em>see Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148, the district court correctly concluded that Tempesta had failed to meet his burden to establish pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Tempesta\u2019s breach of contract claims. First, Motorola\u2019s policy manual, which contained Policy No. 1260 requiring \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to relocate a long-term displaced employee, also included a clear and unambiguous statement disclaiming the creation of contractual obligations. Second, even assuming that Motorola was contractually obligated to follow its policies, Policy No. 1260 was not applicable to Tempesta\u2019s situation because Tempesta was not \u201cinvoluntarily separated\u201d when his job was eliminated; rather he was transferred. Third, the undisputed evidence establishes that Motorola did make reasonable efforts to reassign Tempesta.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Tempesta\u2019s claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In order to sustain a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>relief for this tort, the plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s acts were \u201cso outrageous in character and so extreme in degree, as to ... be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Mintz v. Bell Atl. Sys. Leasing Int'l, Inc., </em>183 Ariz. 550, 905 P.2d 559, 563 (Ariz.Ct.App.1995), citing <em>Cluff v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>10 Ariz.App. 560, 460 P.2d 666, 668 (Ariz.Ct.App.1969). Only when \u201creasonable minds could differ\u201d in interpreting the conduct should the matter proceed to trial. <em>Mintz, </em>905 P.2d at 563. Here, the district court properly found that reasonable minds could not find any \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201coutrageous\u201d misconduct by Motorola as those terms have been construed under Arizona law. <em>See, e.g., Wallace v. Casa Grande Union High Sch. Dist. No. 82 Bd. of Governors, </em>184 Ariz. 419, 909 P.2d 486, 495 (Ariz.Ct.App.1995) (employer did not engage in outrageous conduct as a matter of law even though the employer allegedly refused to renew the employee\u2019s administrative contract, offered her a teaching position she did not want, changed her job duties, lowered her salary, and told her that \u201cnobody likes you\u201d); <em>Nelson v. Phoenix Resort Corp., </em>181 Ariz. 188, 888 P.2d 1375, 1386-87 (Ariz.Ct.App.1994) (affirming summary judgment for employer because terminating employee at 3:00 a.m. in the presence of armed security guards and media personnel was not \u201coutrageous\u201d conduct). Accordingly, Tempesta\u2019s retaliation claims do not support the \u201coutrage\u201d element of the emotional distress tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Tempesta\u2019s claims of intentional interference with contract claims. The district court correctly determined that there was insufficient evidence that Jones caused Motorola to eliminate Tempesta\u2019s position. <em>Wagenseller v. Scottsdale Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>147 Ariz. 370, 710 P.2d 1025, 1041 (Ariz.1985) (noting requirement of intentional and improper interference causing a breach or termination of the relationship to find liability for intentional interference with contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
