The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 200 months\u2019 imprisonment and four years\u2019 supervised release. Triplett\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Triplett has filed a \u201cMotion to Withdraw, With Prejudice, the Impending Direct Appeal,\u201d in which he argues his plea was coerced, he did not know the nature of the charge or that the sentence he received could be imposed, he did not receive the sentence concessions contemplated by his plea agreement, and his counsel was ineffective. We do not believe that Triplett actually wishes to forego his right to appeal, and thus we will liberally construe his motion as a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-25\">Any complaints Triplett has about his counsel\u2019s performance should be presented in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>see United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998), and he cannot claim on appeal that his guilty plea was involuntary after declining to move to withdraw his plea in the District Court, <em>cf. United States v. Bond, </em>135 F.3d 1247, 1249 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (holding that this court need not address guilty-plea claim which defendant withdrew at sentencing hearing), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>524 U.S. 961, 118 S.Ct. 2388, 141 L.Ed.2d 753 (1998). Triplett was adequately advised of the nature of the charge and the sentence he could receive, and his sentence did not violate his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-17\">. The Honorable Robert T. Dawson, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
