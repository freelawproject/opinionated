R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The ease is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Appellant Andrew Lee Ferguson, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On October 2, 2000, Mr. Ferguson filed a \u00a7 1983 complaint claiming Defendants violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. Mr. Ferguson\u2019s complaint arose out of his \u201cjailhouse lawyering\u201d activities. On November 17, 2000, Mr. Ferguson amended his original complaint. The district court dismissed the amended complaint on December 28, 2000. On appeal, Mr. Ferguson challenged the district court\u2019s decision on three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Mr. Ferguson first disputes the district court\u2019s finding that he had no legally protected interest to represent others. The district court correctly held that the First Amendment is not implicated by Mr. Ferguson\u2019s alleged \u201cjailhouse lawyering\u201d activities. Prisoners \u201cdo not have a protected interest in providing legal representation to other inmates.\u201d <em>Smith v. Maschner, </em>899 F.2d 940, 950 (10th Cir.1990). Mr. Ferguson\u2019s reliance on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Murphy v. Shaw, </em>195 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir.1999), is unfounded; the Supreme Court recently reversed that decision. <em>Shaw v. Murphy, </em>532 U.S. 223, 121 S.Ct. 1475, 149 L.Ed.2d 420 (2001) (holding that prisoners have no First Amendment right to represent others).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Mr. Ferguson next argues that Defendants\u2019 retaliation against him for filing grievances constitutes a deprivation of his constitutional rights. The district court did not address this issue in its ruling. It is true that the Supreme Court in <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), held that a prisoner does not have a protected due process interest in administrative segregation proceedings unless the punishment is atypical of what is expected while in confinement. However, the Court specifically held that prisoners retain \u201cother protection from arbitrary state action even within the expected conditions of confinement,\u201d such as First Amendment retaliation claims. <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 487 n. 11 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">Appellant\u2019s complaint states that after filing grievances regarding alleged harassment, Defendants \u201cplaced plaintiff in involuntary administrative segregation by alleging plaintiff violated policy without substantiating the violation. This was done in an attempt to cover up harassment and retaliation.\u201d Plaintiffs Complaint, Rec., Vol. 1, Doc. 7 at 2-C and D. \u201c \u2018[I]t is well established that an act in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally .protected right is actionable under ... Section 1983 even if the act, when taken for a different reason, would have been proper.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>899 F.2d at 948 (10th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>1990) (citation omitted). A liberal reading of the complaint indicates that Mr. Ferguson sufficiently pled that the administrative proceeding was a retaliatory act for filing grievances in violation of Mr. Ferguson\u2019s First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Mr. Ferguson\u2019s final issue for review is whether his due process rights were violated during the proceedings culminating in Mr. Ferguson\u2019s placement in administrative segregation. The district court correctly dismissed this claim. Mr. Ferguson\u2019s involuntary placement into segregated confinement does \u201cnot present the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 486. Therefore, Mr. Ferguson\u2019s third issue on appeal fails.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">We REMAND this case to the District Court for consideration of Mr. Ferguson\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim for filing grievances. In all other respects, we AFFIRM the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\">. Mr. Ferguson's complaint surpasses the low threshold required to avoid disposition through Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). However, in order to proceed, it is essential that Mr. Ferguson prove specific facts showing retaliation resulting from the exercise of his First Amendment right to file grievances. Conclusoiy allegations of constitutional retaliation are simply insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-21\">. We also deny Mr. Ferguson's \"Motion to File Exhibits\u201d as moot. All of the requested exhibits pertain to his allegation that the Defendants violated his due process rights while placing him in involuntary administrative segregation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
