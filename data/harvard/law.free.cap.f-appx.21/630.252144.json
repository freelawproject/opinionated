We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. Price v. United States Navy, </em>39 F.3d 1011, 1021 (9th Cir.1994). We also review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether attorney\u2019s fees are proper under a contract or under state law. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Midwest Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>36 F.3d 785, 799 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">This suit arises out of a contract entered into in connection with the sale by Fissell to Century 21 of an on-going business, Western Relocation Management, Inc. ('Western\u201d). Fissell contends the district court erred in finding that Century 21 did not breach the contract when it decreased Western\u2019s pretax income for 1995 and 1996 to reflect imputed interest on amounts that had been converted for classification purposes from money owed on line of credit to paid-in capital. Fissell urges us to treat this finding as a conclusion of law and apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. Even if we were to apply this less deferential standard, the district court must be affirmed. Western was a standalone entity for accounting purposes. The imputed interest deduction was consistent with Western\u2019s history of utilizing an interest-accumulating line of credit from its parent company. The district court therefore did not err in holding that the imputed interest deduction did not constitute a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-16\">Fissell further argues that pretax income for 1995 and 1996 should be adjusted upward to reflect the earnings Western could have realized on funds that were transferred as \u201cnon-interest-bearing advances to parent.\u201d However, the district court expressly found that the \u201ccalculation of imputed interest expense for 1995 and 1996 incorporated the 'advances\u2019 \u201d by treating them as reductions to the outstanding loan balance. Fissell fails to show that this factual finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The remainder of Fissell\u2019s earnout claims, taken in aggregate, do not concern sufficient monetary amounts to exceed the cumulative threshold, and therefore we need not address them. Under the contract, \u201c[i]f it is determined at the end of the Total Earnout Period that the amount in the Holdback Account is a negative number, then Purchaser shall not pay Seller anything and Seller shall not pay Purchaser anything.\u201d Because the cumulative threshold was not met, Fissell was not entitled to an earnout payment for 1992 through 1996. Century 21 tendered checks to Fissell for the 1992 and 1993 earnout payments, rather than depositing these amounts into the Holdback Account. Fissell, however, refused these payments and declined to cash the checks. Century 21\u2019s attempted payments, which were never accepted, do not constitute a waiver of the Holdback provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">With respect to Fissell\u2019s contention that the final balance sheet should be adjusted to reflect $216,799.70 in uncashed checks that were eventually taken back into Western\u2019s income, the contract does not address adjustments to the final balance sheet. Fissell testified at trial that he had no recollection of any agreement regarding such adjustments. The fact that, in order to resolve a dispute with Fissell, Century 21 made one adjustment to the final balance sheet does not obligate Century 21 to make further adjustments. Under the contract, Fissell was responsible for preparing the final balance sheet. Fissell\u2019s expert testified that the choice to include the uncashed checks as liability on the final balance sheet was an \u201caccounting error\u201d and characterized Fissell\u2019s accountants\u2019 failure to investigate these uncashed checks at the time the final balance sheet was prepared as \u201cincomprehensible.\u201d Century 21\u2019s refusal to adjust the final balance sheet to correct an error by Fissell\u2019s accountants does not constitute a breach of contract. The district court\u2019s grant of Rule 52(c) judgment in favor of Century 21 is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The district court\u2019s award of fees and costs is affirmed as well. The contract provides that, in disputes arising under it, \u201cthe successful, prevailing or non-defaulting party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees ... and other costs incurred.\u201d The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Century 21 on Fissell\u2019s claim for an accounting and judgment as a matter of law in favor of Century 21 on Fissell\u2019s remaining claims. Century 21 is the prevailing party under both the contract and California law. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1717(b)(1) (defining \u201cparty prevailing on the contract\u201d as \u201cthe party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
