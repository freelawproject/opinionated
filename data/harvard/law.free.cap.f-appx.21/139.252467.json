This court affirmed all of Riley\u2019s and Rucker\u2019s convictions and sentences but remanded to the district court to determine whether their sentences for Count 1 were imposed in accordance with <em>United States v. Rhynes, </em>196 F.3d 207 (4th Cir.1999), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>218 F.3d 310 (4th Cir.) (en banc), and <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1222, 120 S.Ct. 2234, 2235, 147 L.Ed.2d 263 (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Riley, </em>No. 99-4079, 99-4101, 2000 WL 620310 (4th Cir. May 15, 2000) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 882, 121 S.Ct. 196, 148 L.Ed.2d 137 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">On remand in the instant case, the district court found that for Count 1 the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>only was instructed as to whether Riley and Rucker conspired to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine. Thus, there was no <em>Rhynes </em>error as the jury could only have found them guilty for dealing in crack. Accordingly, the district court again sentenced Riley and Rucker to life sentences for Count 1. On appeal from their resentencing, Appellants raise several issues. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Riley and Rucker both allege that their convictions and sentences for Count 1 have been rendered invalid in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and related cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This claim fails, however, because Appellants were sentenced within the statutory maximum for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute fifty or more grams of crack. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), 846 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In the instant case, Appellants were indicted for fifty or more grams of crack and the jury was instructed that they must find that amount of crack as an element of the offense. Thus, Riley and Rucker have suffered no harm in light of <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Richardson, </em>233 F.3d 223, 231 (4th Cir.2000) (holding no <em>Apprendi </em>error where both indictment and jury charge cite to specific drug amounts), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Mar. 19, 2001) (No. 00-9234).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Riley and Rucker also disagree with the district court\u2019s application of certain sentencing enhancements, again alleging they are invalid in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>This court has rejected such claims. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-200 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not affect a judge\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion within a statutory range so long as a defendant\u2019s sentence is not set beyond the maximum term specified in the substantive statute), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001); <em>United States v. Obi </em>239 F.3d 662, 667 (4th Cir.2001) (sentencing court does not violate <em>Apprendi </em>when it makes factual findings that result in increased punishment under the Sentencing Guidelines), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. May 8, 2001) (No. 00-9833).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">Next, Riley and Rucker allege that their other drug distribution convictions are also invalidated by <em>Apprendi. </em>Because these arguments are beyond the scope of our remand, we decline to address them in this appeal. <em>See Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. Columbia Outdoor Adver., Inc., </em>974 F.2d 502, 505-06 (4th Cir.1992) (noting that those issues not previously raised in the first appeal will be considered waived and thus cannot be raised in a subsequent appeal); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>186 F.3d 836, 838 (7th Cir.1999) (applying the doctrine in a criminal appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">Finally, Rucker alleges that the district court erred by denying her motion at the resentencing hearing to appoint counsel to assist her in any subsequent motion filed under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001). We do not find that the district court erred in denying the motion as there is no right to habeas counsel, <em>see Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987), and Rucker has failed to show that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d require that she be appointed counsel. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3006A(a)(2) (West 2000); Rule 8(c) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s resentencing of Riley and Rucker for Count 1 of the superceding indictment. We grant Riley\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief but find no meritorious issues raised therein. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-12\">. In <em>Rhynes, </em>the defendants were charged with conspiracy to distribute or possess with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana. 196 F.3d at 214. The district court instructed the jury that it could return a guilty verdict if it found a defendant had conspired to distribute any of those controlled substances. <em>Id. </em>at 237. Because the jury returned a general verdict, this court held that the verdict was ambiguous and that the district court was prohibited \"from imposing a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum for the least-punished object on which the conspiracy conviction could have been based.\u201d Id. at 238-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">.
