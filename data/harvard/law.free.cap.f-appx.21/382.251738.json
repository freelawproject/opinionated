Burnette was arrested on August 19, 1994 after selling crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was subsequently indicted for unlawfully possessing a firearm on two separate occasions, possessing crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense. The jury found Burnette guilty on all counts. He was subsequently sentenced by the district court to 387 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised released. Burnette appeals, challenging both his conviction and sentence on numerous grounds. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">A. Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">On the evening of June 29, 1994, police officers were investigating a complaint about drug dealing near the intersection of Baskin and Halcomb streets in Memphis. The officers observed at least three men engaging in what appeared to be drug transactions. When the officers approached these men and identified themselves as police officers, the men fled. Two of the men ran south and one ran north.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Lieutenant Lawrence Johnson, who was in radio contact with the other police officers, was driving a police van when he saw a man running north from the intersection of Baskin and Halcomb streets. Johnson exited his vehicle and chased the man. While pursuing the suspect, Johnson identified himself as a police officer and told the man to stop. The man turned and fired gunshots at Johnson. Johnson returned the gunfire, but the man escaped. Soon thereafter, near the scene of the gunfire exchange, police officers recovered a recently discharged handgun that was covered with blood. Johnson later identified Burnette as the man who fired the gunshots at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">On the same night, Darnell Ousley, a guard at the Shelby County Correctional Center who lived near the intersection of Baskin and Halcomb streets, saw a man running through his yard. Ousley recognized the man as someone who had been incarcerated at the Shelby County Correctional Center. Ousley later identified Burnette as the man he saw running through his yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">On July 12, 1994, two Memphis police officers saw Burnette sitting on the porch of a vacant house near the intersection of Baskin and Halcomb streets. Burnette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>fled as the officers approached, firing gunshots at them as he retreated.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On August 19, 1994, an undercover police officer purchased crack cocaine from Burnette. Following the transaction, another police officer approached Burnette and attempted to arrest him. Burnette fled into a nearby apartment building. After chasing Burnette into one of the apartments, the police officer found him in the bathroom next to a toilet that was in the process of being flushed. The officer found marked money in Burnette\u2019s front right pants pocket and an unloaded firearm in his front left pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">B. Procedural background</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Burnette was indicted on the following four counts: (1) possession of a firearm on June 29, 1994, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), (2) possession of a firearm on August 19, 1994, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), (3) possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine on August 19, 1994, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and (4) carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense on August 19, 1994, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Burnette\u2019s original trial commenced on July 15, 1996 and concluded on July 19, 1996. After the jury found him guilty on all four counts, the district court sentenced him to 387 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release. Burnette filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On April 13, 1999, a prior panel of this court reversed Burnette\u2019s conviction based on the panel\u2019s conclusion that the district court erred in admitting the police officers\u2019 testimony that Burnette had fired gunshots at them during the incident on July 12, 1994. <em>United States v. Burnette, </em>No. 97-5467, 1999 WL 238652 (6th Cir. Apr.13, 1999) (unpublished table decision). The case was thus remanded for a new trial. Retrial commenced on August 2, 1999 and concluded on the following day. The jury again found Burnette guilty on all four counts. He was given the same sentence of 387 months in prison, but his term of supervised release was shortened to three years. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">A. The district court did not commit plain error by allowing the government to introduce evidence of Burnette\u2019s July 12, 1994 flight to show consciousness of guilt</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Burnette argues that the district court erred by admitting evidence that, on July 12, 1994, police officers saw him sitting on the porch of a vacant house, that he waved at the officers, and then fled in order to avoid arrest. He argues that this evidence of uncharged misconduct is not admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 404(b) provides that evidence of other acts is \u201cnot admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith____\u201d Such evidence, however, may be admissible for other purposes, including proof of \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Because Burnette did not object to the introduction of this evidence at trial, we review its admission under the plain error standard set forth in Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This court has described the plain error analysis as consisting of four inquiries: (1) whether an error actually occurred in the district court, (2) the obviousness of that error, (3) whether the error affected substantial rights, and (4) whether the compromise of substantial rights seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>United States v. Thomas, </em>11 F.3d 620, 629-30 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Our inquiry begins with an examination of whether the district court erred in determining that the evidence was admissible for a legitimate purpose. Evidence of other acts is probative of a material issue other than character if (1) the evidence is offered for a legitimate purpose, (2) the purpose for which the evidence is offered is material or \u201cin issue,\u201d and (3) the evidence is probative with regard to the purpose for which it is offered. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>27 F.3d 1186, 1190-93 (6th Cir.1994) (finding that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior drug sales was probative of his intent to distribute cocaine on the date charged).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The government argues that the evidence was admissible because Burnette\u2019s flight showed consciousness of guilt. Evidence of flight has been held admissible as an admission of guilt by conduct. <em>United States v. Dillon, </em>870 F.2d 1125, 1126 (6th Cir.1989). The evidence was thus offered for a legitimate purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">We must next determine whether the purpose for which the evidence was offered was material or \u201cin issue.\u201d Clearly, the question of whether Burnette was guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm on June 29, 1994, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), was \u201cin issue\u201d at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Because the proffered evidence was offered for a legitimate purpose that was \u201cin issue\u201d at trial, we must finally determine whether the evidence was probative with regard to the purpose for which it was offered. \u201c[T]he probative value of flight evidence \u2018depends upon the degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (1) from the defendant\u2019s behavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.\u201d \u2019 <em>Dillon, </em>870 F.2d at 1127 (citation omitted). \u201cAll four inferences must be reasonably] supported] by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cFor flight evidence to be admissible, the timing of the flight must itself indicate the sudden onset or the sudden <em>increase </em>of fear in the defendant\u2019s mind that he or she will face apprehension for, accusation of, or conviction of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1128 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In the present case, these four inferences can reasonably be drawn. First, Burnette ran from the porch of a vacant house when police officers approached him. One could reasonably infer that his running constituted flight. Second, Burnette\u2019s flight suggests a sudden increase of fear that he was facing apprehension for a prior offense. We can also reasonably infer that the consciousness of guilt concerned the crime that had occurred two weeks earlier because the vacant house was in the same neighborhood as the prior incident. Finally, from his flight, it can reasonably be inferred that Burnette was actually guilty of the crime committed on June 29,1994. We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in holding the evidence admissible for a legitimate purpose. Moreover, because the danger of unfair prejudice was minimal, we also conclude that the balancing required by Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence does not weigh in Burnette\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Even if we were to hold that the district court erred in admitting the evidence of Burnette\u2019s flight, that decision did not constitute plain error. The alleged error is not obvious, there was overwhelming evidence of Burnette\u2019s guilt, and the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings were not adverse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ly affected. <em>Thomas, </em>11 F.3d at 629-630. For all of the above reasons, we hold that the district court did not commit plain error in allowing the government to introduce evidence of Burnette\u2019s July 12, 1994 flight to show consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">B. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on Count 4</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Burnette claims that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he physically transported a firearm during the course of his drug trafficking offense or that it was immediately available for use during the crime. We review claims of insufficiency of the evidence by asking \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Ables, </em>167 F.3d 1021, 1032 (6th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in the original)). Furthermore, \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to sustain a conviction----\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Count 4 charged Burnette with carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense on August 19, 1994, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides that \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... carries a firearm ... shall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.... \u201d In order to prove a violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1), the government must show that (1) the defendant carried a firearm, and (2) the firearm was carried in relation to a drug trafficking crime. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">A defendant can be found to be \u201ccarrying\u201d a firearm for purposes of \u00a7 924(c)(1) only if the government proves that the defendant physically transported the firearm and that the firearm was immediately available for use. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>127 F.3d 510, 514 (6th Cir.1997). In order to show that the firearm was carried \u201cin relation to\u201d a drug trafficking offense, \u201cthe Government must prove that the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the crime and that its presence or involvement was not the result of coincidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Riascos-Suarez, </em>73 F.3d 616, 623 (6th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2058-59, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Burnette maintains that the government failed to prove that (1) a firearm was in his possession at the time the drug trafficking offense was committed, and (2) the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the crime. We find this argument unpersuasive in light of the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">First, the government introduced sufficient evidence at trial to establish that Burnette was carrying a firearm when he sold crack cocaine on the night of August 19, 1994. The arresting police officer testified that, after pursuing Burnette into a nearby apartment building, Burnette was found with a firearm in his front left pants pocket. Finding the firearm on Burnette\u2019s person after a brief chase from the scene of the drug transaction strongly indicates that he had the firearm concealed within his clothing during the drug transaction. When a firearm is hidden in a person\u2019s clothing, it is \u201cimmediately available for use-on the defendant or within his or her reach.\u201d <em>Wright v. United States, 182 </em>F.3d 458, 463 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201c[A]n offender \u2018carries\u2019 a firearm when he \u2018keeps a gun hidden in his clothing throughout a drug transaction.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>516 U.S. 137, 146, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995)). As Burnette acknowledges, the fact that the firearm was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>unloaded \u201cdoes not insulate [him] from the reach of section 924(c).\u201d <em>United, States v. Moore, </em>91-5720, 1992 WL 44865 *3-4 (6th Cir. March 4, 1992) (unpublished table decision). A rational trier of fact could, therefore, have found that Burnette carried a firearm when he sold crack cocaine on the night of August 19,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Second, the government introduced sufficient evidence that the firearm \u201cfurthered the purpose or effect of the crime\u201d Burnette committed on August 19, 1994 \u201cand that its presence or involvement was not the result of coincidence.\u201d This court has held that \u201cthe government is not required to show that the defendant displayed or brandished the firearm. Even if a firearm remains hidden throughout a crime, its concealed presence may have been in relation to the crime if it facilitated the crime by emboldening the defendant, giving him security and confidence to undertake the criminal act.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>915 F.2d 219, 224 (6th Cir.1990). As a result, a rational trier of fact could have found that the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the drug trafficking crime Burnette committed on the night of August 19, 1994. We therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find Burnette guilty on Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">C. The district court did not commit plain error in instructing the jury concerning the elements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Burnette claims that the district court\u2019s jury instruction regarding Count 4 was improper for two reasons. First, he maintains that the district court\u2019s definition of \u201ccarry\u201d only addressed one of the two elements the government had to prove in order to establish that Burnette \u201ccarried\u201d a firearm during a drug trafficking offense. Second, Burnette argues that the district court\u2019s instruction as to the meaning of \u201cin relation to\u201d did not adequately set forth the government\u2019s burden of proving that the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the underlying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Burnette failed to object to this jury instruction at trial. We will therefore not disturb the verdict based on the instruction unless we conclude that the instruction constituted plain error. <em>United States v. Sanderson, </em>966 F.2d 184, 187 (6th Cir.1992). \u201cPlain error requires a finding that, taken as a whole, the jury instructions were so clearly erroneous as to likely produce a grave miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Piccolo, </em>723 F.2d 1234, 1241 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">In order for the defendant to be found guilty of this offense, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt four separate elements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">First, that the defendant committed a drug trafficking crime, as charged in Count 3 of the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">Second, that the defendant carried the firearm described in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">Third, that the defendant knowingly carried the firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">And fourth, ladies and gentlemen, that the defendant carried the firearm during and in relation to the drug trafficking crime charged in Count 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-15\">You are instructed that the crime of possession with the intent to distribute crack cocaine is a drug trafficking crime within the meaning of this particular law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">The term carry, as I have used that term, and as it is used in the statute, or law, means to transport or cause the transportation of a firearm from one place to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-17\">The term, \u201cduring a drug trafficking crime,[\u201d] as I have used that term, and as the statute uses the term, means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>while a drug trafficking crime is being committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">Should you find that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant carried a firearm during the drug trafficking crime alleged in Count 3, you must then resolve the question of whether the government has also proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm was carried by the defendant in relation to that drug trafficking crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">The term in relation to a drug trafficking crime means having to do with. In order for this phrase, in relation, to be satisfied it must be proved that there existed a relationship between the firearm and the drug trafficking crime charged in Count 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">The government is not required to prove that the defendant actually fired the weapon charged in Count 4, or in any other count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">As noted above, this court has held that a defendant can be found to be \u201ccarrying\u201d a firearm only if the defendant physically transported the firearm and the firearm was immediately available for use. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>127 F.3d 510, 514 (6th Cir.1997). The district court instructed the jury that \u201ccarrying\u201d \u201cmeans to transport or cause the transportation of a firearm <em>from one </em>place to another.\u201d Although the district court did not instruct the jury that, in order to find that Burnette was \u201ccarrying\u201d the firearm, it had to be \u201cimmediately available for use,\u201d we conclude that this omission does not constitute plain error under the facts of this case. A finding that Burnette was transporting the firearm from one place to another on foot would necessarily imply that the firearm was on his person and, therefore, was \u201cimmediately available <em>for </em>use.\u201d A properly instructed jury could therefore have found that Burnette \u201ccarried\u201d a firearm for purposes of \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\u201c[I]n order to show that a firearm has been used or carried \u2018in relation to\u2019 a drug trafficking offense, the Government must prove that the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the crime and that its presence or involvement was not the result of coincidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Riascos-Suarez, </em>73 F.3d 616, 623 (6th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2058-59, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)). The district court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he term in relation to a drug trafficking crime means having to do with. In order for this phrase, in relation, to be satisfied it must be proved that there existed a relationship between the firearm and the drug trafficking crime....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Although the district court failed to instruct the jury that it could find that Burnette was carrying a firearm \u201cin relation to\u201d a drug trafficking offense only if the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the underlying crime, no plain error occurred. A finding that Burnette was carrying a firearm \u201chaving to do with\u201d a drug trafficking offense would, given the facts of this case, necessarily imply that the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the underlying crime. Indeed, given the risks of selling illegal drugs, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where carrying a firearm under the circumstances before us would not further the purpose or effect of a drug transaction. A properly instructed jury could therefore have found that the firearm Burnette was carrying furthered the purpose or effect of the underlying drug trafficking crime and that its presence or involvement was not the result of coincidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">For all of the above reasons, and in light of the overwhelming evidence of Burnette\u2019s guilt, we conclude that the jury instruction was not \u201cso clearly erroneous as to likely produce a grave miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Piccolo, </em>723 F.2d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>D. The law-of-the-case doctrine bars consideration of whether the district court committed plain error by admitting into evidence two allegedly suggestive photo spreads</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Burnette claims that the photo spreads introduced by the government at trial were impermissibly suggestive because the photograph of him was the only one that showed an individual with a gheri curl hair style. Although he did not object to the introduction of this evidence at his 1999 retrial, he did file a motion to suppress the photo spreads during his first trial. This motion was denied by the district court, and Burnette did not raise the issue in his prior appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u201cThe law-of-the-case doctrine bars challenges to a decision made at a previous stage of the litigation which could have been challenged in a prior appeal, but were not.\u201d <em>United States v. Adesida, </em>129 F.3d 846, 850 (6th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). \u201cAlthough the doctrine of law of the ease is not an inexorable command, and courts must use common sense in applying it, the power of this court to reach a result inconsistent with a prior decision reached in the same case is to be exercised very sparingly, and only under extraordinary conditions.\u201d <em>Craft v. United States, </em>233 F.3d 358, 363-64 (6th Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 23, 150 L.Ed.2d 804 (2001). Because Burnette has not claimed that any such \u201cextraordinary conditions\u201d apply in this case, we conclude that the law-of-the-case doctrine bars Burnette\u2019s challenge to the admission of the photo spreads into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">E. The district court did not commit plain error in sentencing Burnette as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Burnette claims that the district court applied the armed career criminal sentencing enhancement of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.4 even though he does not have the requisite three previous convictions for a violent crime. Section 924(e)(1) provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cIn the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony ..., such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years.... \u201d A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.4 applies in the case of a defendant subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and sets the offense level at 34 \u201cif the defendant used or possessed the firearm ... in connection with a ... controlled substance offense....\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">Burnette concedes that he has two prior convictions that qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1). He argues, however, that his 1992 conviction for attempted aggravated burglary does not qualify as a predicate felony because the crime was not \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion,\u201d did not involve \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d against a person, and did not \u201cinvolve conduct that presented] a serious potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>risk of physical injury to another.\u201d In support of his argument, Burnette describes the specific conduct for which he was convicted in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Where, as in this case, a defendant fails to object to a sentencing enhancement prior to his appeal, his sentence will not be disturbed unless the enhancement is found to constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998). \u201c[T]he determination whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction involves a \u2018violent felony\u2019 ... is to be decided ... .by reference to the statute under which it was obtained.\u201d <em>United States v. Lane, </em>909 F.2d 895, 901 (6th Cir.1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We must therefore look to the statute applicable to Burnette\u2019s conviction, and not to his actual conduct during the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In <em>United States v. Bureau, </em>52 F.3d 584, 593 (6th Cir.1995), this court held that \u201cthe crime of attempting to commit the felony of burglary under Tennessee law involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another and falls within the \u2018otherwise clause\u2019 of \u00a7 924(e).\u201d Burnette\u2019s conviction for attempted aggravated burglary thus qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Based on the above analysis, we conclude that Burnette had been convicted of three \u201cviolent felonies\u201d prior to his indictment on the charges in the present case. The district court, therefore, did not commit plain error in sentencing Burnette as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">F. <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable to the present case</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Burnette contends that the district court erred by not requiring that the enhancements to his sentence be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt as elements of the offense charged. He bases his challenge on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which was decided a year after his second trial. The Supreme Court established in <em>Apprendi </em>that <em>\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (emphasis added). As a result, <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that Congress may treat the prior conviction of a crime as a sentencing factor to be determined by the court. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Gatewood, </em>230 F.3d 186, 192 (6th Cir.2000) (noting that <em>\u2018Almendarez-Torres </em>remains the law\u201d). In the present case, Burnette\u2019s sentence was enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act because of his prior convictions. Burnette is therefore not entitled to relief under <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Moreover, <em>Apprendi </em>only applies to those situations where a factual determination made under a lesser standard of proof than the reasonable doubt standard \u201cincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Although \u00a7 924(e) does not specify a maximum term of imprisonment, it has been construed to authorize a life sentence. <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994); <em>U.S. v. Caldwell, No. </em>97-5252, 2000 WL 331950 at <em>*8 </em>n. 3 (6th Cir. Mar 23, 2000) (unpublished table decision) (\u201cThe ACCA raises the penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon from a maximum of ten (10) years in prison to a mandatory minimum of fifteen (15) years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and a maximum of life in prison without parole if the defendant has \u2018three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u2019 \u201d) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 .924(e)), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 867, 121 S.Ct. 162, 148 L.Ed.2d 109 (2000); <em>see also United States v. Mack, </em>229 F.3d 226, 234 n. 12 (3d Cir.2000) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable to sentences imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) because the statutory maximum is life imprisonment), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 2015, 149 L.Ed.2d 1016 (2001). For these reasons, <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">G. The district court did not commit plain error in applying United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Burnette asserts that the district court\u2019s imposition of the specific-offense-characteristic enhancement listed in United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) to determine his adjusted offense level constitutes impermissible \u201cdouble counting.\u201d Because Burnette did not object to the presentence report or to his sentencing by the district court, his sentence will not be disturbed unless the enhancement is found to constitute plain error. <em>United States v. Fountain, 2 </em>F.3d 656, 669-70 (6th Cir.1993) (\u201cAbsent \u2018plain error,\u2019 this court will not address claims of alleged misapplication of the guidelines unless the defendant first raised the claim before the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides that a base offense level may be increased by four levels if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.... \u201d The district court increased the base offense level for Count 1 by four levels pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The resulting adjusted offense level was 31. After deciding that Counts 2 and 3 should be grouped together pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3D.1.2(c), the district court also increased the base offense level for the combined Counts 2 and 3 by four levels pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The resulting adjusted offense level was 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">These enhancements, however, did not affect Burnette\u2019s sentence. United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.4 applies in the case of a defendant subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and sets the offense level at 34 \u201cif the defendant used or possessed the firearm ... in connection with a ... controlled substance offense.... \u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). Because this enhancement applies to Burnette, his base offense level was 34 without any consideration of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Thus, even if the district court had not applied the challenged enhancements, Burnette still would have been sentenced to 262-327 months in prison for Counts 1 to 3, plus an additional 60 months for Count 4. We therefore conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in applying United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), because Burnette\u2019s substantial rights were not adversely affected. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>11 F.3d 620, 629-30 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">H. The district court did not commit plain error by failing to disclose the revised presentence report to Burnette at least 35 days before the sentencing hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Finally, Burnette claims that the district court violated Rule 32(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to furnish him with a copy of the revised presentence report at least 35 days before the sentencing hearing. Rule 32(b)(6)(A) requires that the presentence report be furnished to the defendant \u201c[n]ot less than 35 days before the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>hearing-unless the defendant waives this minimum period.... \u201d In the present case, the record indicates that the revised presentence report was prepared on August 31, 1999, eight days before the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The original presentence report in this case, however, was prepared in September of 1996, approximately three years before Burnette\u2019s sentencing hearing. Although the report was revised on August 31, 1999, the revised report did not include any new sentencing calculations or any new information that would adversely impact Burnette\u2019s sentence. Furthermore, because counsel for the defendant did not object to the timing of the revised report or ask that the sentencing hearing be continued, Burnette waived any objections he might have had pursuant to Rule 32(b). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>80 F.3d 436, 438 (10th Cir.1996) (concurring with the three United States Courts of Appeals that had already held that a defendant waives the minimum period by participating in the sentencing hearing without objection). For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error by failing to disclose the revised presentence report to Burnette at least 35 days before the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
