We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Alvarenga-Martinez contends that there was insufficient evidence that his prior Nevada conviction for sale of a controlled substance was an aggravated felony for purposes of the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Because Alvarenga-Martinez did not object to the district court\u2019s use of his prior conviction to apply the enhancement, we review for plain error. <em>See United, States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 892-93 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The government here concedes, and we concur, that the district court plainly erred in applying the enhancement where the prior conviction does not facially qualify as an aggravated felony. <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, this case is remanded to the district court for further development of the record and resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Finally, Alvarenga-Martinez\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b707-39\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-11\">. Because we are remanding for resentencing, we need not direct the district court to correct the judgment to exclude reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
