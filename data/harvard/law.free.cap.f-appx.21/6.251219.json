It is</p>\n<p id=\"b36-22\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment be affirmed substantially for the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum and dismissal order. The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). Gates had no duty to respond to Hoch\u2019s offer; therefore, Gates\u2019 silence and inaction did not create a contract. <em>See Klingensmith, Inc. v. District of Columbia, </em>370 A.2d 1341, 1343 (D.C.1977). Furthermore, on appeal, Hoch has not suggested any facts that, if added to his complaint, would adequately allege the existence of a contract. <em>Cf. Davis v. District of Columbia, </em>158 F.3d 1342, 1349 (D.C.Cir.1998) (affirmance of <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) appropriate if plaintiff does not make clear on appeal he can add facts to complaint entitling him to relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-23\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
