Specifically, Avalos-Barriga challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims regarding (1) ineffective assistance of counsel at various stages of the proceeding and (2) denial of counsel of his choice. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">The only issue this court will consider is the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. The other claims were not included in the district court\u2019s certificate of appealability (COA), and Avalos-Barriga did not follow the proper procedures to broaden that COA. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3), a court of appeals has jurisdiction to hear only issues that have been certified in a GOA. Under Circuit Rule 22-1(d), a party must file a motion to broaden a COA within thirty-five days of the district court\u2019s grant of the COA. Rule 22-1 was in effect when the district court granted the COA as to one issue, but Avalos-Barriga did not follow its procedures. Therefore, we may not consider the claims not included in the original COA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Avalos-Barriga did not prove that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance at trial. In assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, this circuit follows the two-prong test of <em>Strickland v. Washington: </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A defendant must show deficient performance by counsel that resulted in prejudice. The record establishes that Avalos-Barriga can prove neither prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Trial counsel\u2019s decisions during trial were reasonable, given his trial strategy and the evidence presented by the Government.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s decision not to try to introduce certain documents prepared by Mexican judges was reasonable. It is unlikely that the documents would have been admitted on their merits because they con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>tained inadmissable hearsay, and their impeachment value was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Trial counsel\u2019s strategy concerning how to challenge the Government\u2019s case was also not deficient. His failure to object to the Government\u2019s opening argument was reasonable. There was nothing egregious about the Government referring to Avalos-Barriga as the \u201ckingpin\u201d or \u201cleader\u201d of the drug ring, and lawyers often choose not to object during opening argument. Counsel\u2019s method of impeachment was reasonable as well. He attempted to discredit the Government\u2019s key witnesses by questioning them about the money and benefits they and their families received in exchange for testifying. His choice in his closing argument to concede Avalos-Barriga\u2019s supervision of two individuals was also reasonable because of the amount of evidence linking him to those individuals. There is nothing objectively unreasonable about any of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Last, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the jury instructions was not unreasonable. The language \u201ctogether with\u201d is not so different from \u201cin concert with\u201d as to make the instructions noticeably incorrect. The instructions regarding the unanimity requirement and the number of people involved appeared consistent with the statutory elements. The jury instructions for the criminal enterprise charge came from the Ninth Circuit pattern jury instructions, which both attorneys agreed to use. Relying on that pattern instruction was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Even assuming there was some deficient conduct, no prejudice resulted. The Government offered ample evidence of guilt, including testimony by witnesses who were former members of the drug ring, numerous wire-tapped telephone conversations, and other seizures of drugs linked to Avalos-Barriga. The jury would almost certainly have found guilt even without any deficient conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Because Avalos-Barriga has failed to show that his attorney\u2019s actions were unreasonable and that they resulted in prejudice, we agree with the district court that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.
