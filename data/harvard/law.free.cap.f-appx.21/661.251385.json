We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Resnick v. </em>Hayes, 213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Dismissal was proper because Aintablian\u2019s complaint failed to allege a deprivation of a constitutionally protected right. <em>See Toussaint v. McCarthy, </em>801 F.2d 1080, 1094-95 (9th Cir.1986) (inmates have no constitutional right to participate in prison work programs). To the extent that Aintablian is speculating that he may be denied parole on the basis of the information in his prison file, this does not state a cognizable claim under section 1983. <em>See Butterfield v. Bail, </em>120 F.3d 1023, 1024-25 (9th Cir.1997). Because amendment could not cure the defects, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Aintablian a second opportunity to amend his complaint. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
