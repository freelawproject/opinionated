In this appeal, Bullock argues the Government\u2019s failure to dismiss Count Two of his indictment, authorizing criminal forfeiture of two automobiles,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> constitutes a breach of his plea agreement that entitles him to withdraw his plea. For the following reasons, we remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Because Bullock failed to raise this error before the district court at sentencing, he must demonstrate plain error in order to prevail on appeal. <em>United States v. Fant, </em>974 F.2d 559, 562 (4th Cir.1992). Specifically, Bullock must show the breach was \u201c \u2018so obvious and substantial that failure to notice and correct it affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1997) <em>(quoting Fant, </em>974 F.2d at 565). However, on appeal, the Government concedes at least \u201ctechnical error\u201d in failing to move for dismissal of Count Two. Because the Government\u2019s failure to fulfill its obligations under a plea agreement affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings, we find Bullock has demonstrated plain error. <em>See McQueen, </em>108 F.3d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">Although we recognize the breach of Bullock\u2019s plea agreement, the parties disagree as to the proper remedy for that breach. Bullock contends he is entitled to rescission of the plea agreement in its entirety, rather than specific performance as the Government contends. Accordingly, we remand to the district court for a determination as to the proper remedy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>500 F.2d 375, 378 (4th Cir.1974). Furthermore, while we grant Bullock\u2019s motion to file a supplemental pro se brief and have considered his claims, we find them meritless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\">. We note one of those automobiles, a 1994 Infiniti J 30, was the subject of a 1998 administrative forfeiture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\">. As for Bullock\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we conclude that his claims are not conclusively established in the record on appeal. Such claims should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\">. To the extent Bullock contends <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), renders 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001) unconstitutional, we find that claim unavailing. <em>See United States v. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d 1215, 1218-19 (10th Cir.2001). Furthermore, we note both that the indictment charges Bullock with conspiring to distribute at least one kilogram of heroin, and that he received a 240 month sentence, indicating his sentence does not implicate <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
