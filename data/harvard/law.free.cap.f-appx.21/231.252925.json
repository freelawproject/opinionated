Boone petitions for review of the decision and order of the Benefits Review Board affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s finding that he did not establish good cause to change authorized neurologists and that he was not entitled to a continuing award of benefits under the Longshore &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001). Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and without reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Boone v. Newport News Shipbuilding, </em>No. BRB-00-0683 (B.R.B. Apr. 4, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
