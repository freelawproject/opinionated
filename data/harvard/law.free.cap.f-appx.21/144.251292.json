He appeals the denial of his motion to suppress. We have carefully examined the parties\u2019 arguments, as well as the transcript of the hearing on Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress, and we have found no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court which was explained from the bench. (J.A. at 113-29). We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
