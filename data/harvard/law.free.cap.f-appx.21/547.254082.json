The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Scott has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-22\">We have carefully considered each of the issues raised on appeal-regarding Scott\u2019s speedy-trial rights under the Sixth Amendment and the Speedy Trial Act, his Fifth Amendment right to be free from excessive pre-indictment delay, the alleged variance between the indictment and the jury instructions, the District Court\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ceipt of hearsay evidence, and his duplicity challenge to the indictment-and we find each argument to be without merit. Additionally, having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have not found any nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">.
