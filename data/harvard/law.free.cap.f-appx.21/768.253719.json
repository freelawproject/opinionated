We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We review de novo, <em>United States v. Lopez-Pastrana, </em>244 F.3d 1025, 1027 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-17\">Bates contends that the district court erred in computing his criminal history category. He argues that three of his six prior misdemeanor offenses should not have been used to calculate his criminal history category. Bates\u2019 contention is unavailing. Even if the district court did err, any error was harmless because Bates would have received the same sentence. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>109 F.3d 1413, 1422-23 (9th Cir.1997). We therefore decline to address the merits of Bates\u2019 contention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-20\">. In his reply brief, Bates summarily asks us to \"review many of the [other] misdemeanor convictions\" used to calculate his criminal history category. He also argues that we should remand for resentencing because \"the record is silent with regards to which specific misdemeanor convictions\u201d were used to calculate his criminal history category. We decline to do either because arguments raised for the first time in the reply brief are waived. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>230 F.3d 1168, 1172 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
