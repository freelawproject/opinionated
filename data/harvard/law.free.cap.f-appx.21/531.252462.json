Meredith, an African American woman, appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary judgment in her discrimination action against her former employer, Barnes-Jewish West County Hospital (BJW), under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1994). Having conducted a de novo review, <em>see Whitley v. Peer Review Sys., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1053, 1055 (8th Cir.2000), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>We conclude that (1) even if Meredith established a prima facie case of race discrimination (which we question), she did not rebut BJW\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for her probation and termination, <em>see LaCroix v. Sears, Roebuck, &amp; Co., </em>240 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that conclusory statements alone are insufficient to withstand properly supported summary judgment motion); (2) she failed to link the allegedly harassing conduct to her race, <em>see Willis v. Henderson, </em>262 F.3d 801, 808 (8th Cir.2001) (listing elements of hostile-work-environment claim under Title VII); <em>Spriggs v. Diamond Auto Glass, </em>242 F.3d 179, 183-84 (4th Cir.2001) (listing elements of \u00a7 1981 hostile-work-environment suit); and (3) she did not show that BJW knew of her discrimination charge against her former employer, <em>see Cross v. Cleaver, </em>142 F.3d 1059, 1071 (8th Cir.1998) (noting that retaliation claim under Title VII or \u00a7 1981 requires plaintiff to establish causal connection between protected activity and adverse employment action).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">.
