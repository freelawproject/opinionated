We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">1. The district court did not err in instructing the jury on the intimidation element of the robbery charges because, taken as a whole, the instructions were neither misleading nor inadequate. <em>United States v. Spillone, </em>879 F.2d 514, 525 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 878, 111 S.Ct. 210, 112 L.Ed.2d 170 (1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">2. The two counts of robbery were properly joined under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a) due to the similar nature of the alleged crimes. <em>United States v. Friedman, </em>445 F.2d 1076, 1082 (9th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 958, 92 S.Ct. 326, 30 L.Ed.2d 275 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-18\">3. The district court\u2019s refusal to sever the counts was not error as Valenzuela failed to demonstrate any manifest prejudice resulting from the combined trial. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>820 F.2d 1065, 1070 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-19\">4. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs, videotape and other documents. <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>88 F.3d 812, 818 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 986, 117 S.Ct. 443, 136 L.Ed.2d 339 (1996). This evidence was relevant and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-20\">5. The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence of the arrest, investigation and charge of a third party in one of the robberies for which Valenzuela was convicted. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>937 F.2d 1397, 1400 (9th Cir.1991). There was no substantial evidence connecting the third party with the actual commission of the offense. <em>Walters v. McCormick, </em>122 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1060, 118 S.Ct. 1389, 140 L.Ed.2d 648 (1998). Moreover, Valenzuela was still permitted to impeach eyewitness testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ny with the witnesses\u2019 prior misidentification of a third party, and Valenzuela was not precluded from calling witnesses in an effort to establish that the crime was committed by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-14\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-21\">. Even though it does comport with Ninth Circuit law and is not reversible error, we do not approve or endorse the factor language used in the intimidation instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
