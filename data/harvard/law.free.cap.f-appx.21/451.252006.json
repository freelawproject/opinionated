The district court dismissed King\u2019s complaint, and King appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">King is a pro se litigant, and we construe pro se filings liberally. <em>Whitford v. Boglino, </em>63 F.3d 527, 535 n. 10 (7th Cir.1995). However, even pro se litigants are required to include legal argument and some supporting authority in their briefs. <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Mathis v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>133 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.1998) (per curiam); <em>United States ex rel. Verdone v. Circuit Court, </em>73 F.3d 669, 673 (7th Cir.1995) (per curiam). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A) requires the appellant\u2019s brief to contain the appellant\u2019s \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d King\u2019s brief does not set forth a comprehensible argument nor does it cite to authorities or the record, or propose a basis for concluding that the district court erred in dismissing her case. Because her brief fails to meet the basic requirements outlined in Rule 28(a)(9)(A), King\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
