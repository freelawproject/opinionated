He contends there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. We have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b624-23\">This case turns on whether Ortega was \u201cunaware of [his] ineligibility for admission and ... could not have discovered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ineligibility by exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d <em>See Senica v. INS, </em>16 F.3d 1013, 1014 (9th Cir.1994) (applying \u00a7 1182(k)). Ortega denied having any knowledge of the fraud carried out by his family. Moreover, the INS admitted that it had no evidence that Ortega knew of the fraud. The BIA, however, denied the requested relief based on alleged misstatements made by Ortega to the INS in 1987, when he stated that there were eleven children in his family: \u201cAida, Cecilia, Soledad, Evelyn, Edilberto, Ernesto, Priscilla, Carlos, Venus, Frank (himself) and Bernardino.\u201d In fact, Ortega has an older brother, Jose, and Bernardino is Ortega\u2019s nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The IJ concluded that these misrepresentations to the INS investigator, \u201calbeit collateral to the exact issue presented today regarding respondent\u2019s knowledge of his sister\u2019s illegally procured naturalization as a United States citizen casts serious doubt on respondent\u2019s credibility.\u201d The BIA affirmed, finding \u201cno reason to doubt the credibility finding of the Immigration Judge.\u201d The BIA reasoned that Ortega \u201cmisrepresented facts surrounding the situation at the time\u201d and that \u201ctaking the report as true, the respondent knew that the [INS] was questioning the basis for his family\u2019s entries into the United States, and he attempted to mislead the questioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In this circuit, the BIA \u201cmust have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>See Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir.2000). We cannot conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision satisfies this requirement. First, there is no indication that Ortega was informed of the nature of the investigation that would have put him on notice to question the legality of his sister\u2019s immigration status. Second, the information that Ortega gave was accurate. Ortega named the \u201celeven children in his family,\u201d not his \u201cbrothers and sisters.\u201d He did not include Jose, because, as he explained to the IJ, he has no memory of Jose and does not know where he lives. Ortega did include Bernardino because \u201cmost of the time he stays with us.\u201d Third, even if Ortega\u2019s statement was inaccurate, it amounts to no more than a minor inconsistency in the record that is insufficient to support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1167 (9th Cir.2000). Finally, the BIA\u2019s justification for an adverse credibility determination \u201cmust be substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1166. Here, the BIA\u2019s reasoning is nothing more than conjecture, unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Salaam, </em>229 F.3d at 1238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand to permit the Attorney General to exercise his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b624-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b624-14\"> The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) govern judicial review of Rahman's petition because deportation proceedings were pending against him prior to IIRIRA's effective date. <em>See Alfaro-Reyes v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 916, 920 (9th Cir.2000) (citing IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)). Those rules provide, with exceptions not applicable here, that review shall proceed under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. <em>See Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1160 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b625-10\">WALLACE,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Ortega has the burden to prove his eligibility for relief under section 212(k). Thus, he must demonstrate he did not know and could not have known in the exercise of reasonable diligence of his sister\u2019s fraud scheme which was the basis of his and his family\u2019s admissibility into this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">As with most fraud scams, there is no direct evidence of knowledge. But the IJ and Board found circumstantial evidence Ortega knew. The question is whether we are compelled to find otherwise. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">At the time of his illegal entry, he was 23 years old. He testified he did not know of the fraud. The IJ disbelieved him. That is evidence of the contrary: he did know of the fraud. Could the IJ and Board do so?</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>He was found to have misled a government agent about the names of his siblings. He denies he ever had the conversation. The IJ found he lied: he did have the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The IJ found this deceptiveness showed his knowledge of the nature of the immigration effort and that, at least after the conversation, he logically would have discussed it with his family. But Ortega lied about the conversation even happening. This led the IJ to find that Ortega either knew of his sister\u2019s fraud or could reasonably have been expected to investigate further. The Board agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Perhaps I might have seen it differently had I been the IJ or the Board, but I do not feel compelled to come to the opposite determination. Therefore, I would deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
