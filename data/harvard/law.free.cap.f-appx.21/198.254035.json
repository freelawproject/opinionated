Dixon filed this petition for a writ of mandamus seeking an order directing the district court to act on his habeas corpus petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001) on October 29, 1999. Shortly thereafter, on September 26, 2001, the district court entered an order dismissing Dixon\u2019s habeas petition. Because the district court has disposed of Dixon\u2019s petition and closed the case on its docket, Dixon\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus is moot. Accordingly, although we grant Dixon\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
