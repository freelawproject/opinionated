Bryson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001) and denying his motion to alter or amend. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. This was Bryson\u2019s second \u00a7 2254 petition, and he did not obtain permission from this Court to file the petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001). Further, the record belies Bryson\u2019s claim that his first petition was not decided on the merits. Finally, Bryson cannot now challenge the decision in the prior \u00a7 2254 petition. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
