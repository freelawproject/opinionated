Glinsey appeals the district court\u2019s adverse grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>summary judgment in Glinsey\u2019s action against prison employees under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The district court dismissed the action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) after Glinsey was unable to rebut the employees\u2019 showing of his failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Glinsey contends the court abused its discretion in failing earlier to screen his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A to determine whether he had exhausted his administrative remedies. Glinsey seeks, among other things, a refund of his filing fee. On careful review of the record, and based on the plain language of the statutes at issue, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal and reject Glinse/s arguments. Nevertheless, we modify the dismissal to be without prejudice to Glinsey\u2019s right to refile his complaint after he exhausts his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
