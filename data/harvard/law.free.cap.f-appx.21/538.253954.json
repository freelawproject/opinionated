One of the Harts\u2019 limited partners, Norman McChristian, brought suit to remove the Harts as general partners. Relief was granted and McChristian, along with Jerry Patton, the appointed receiver of Vinewood Communications, proceeded to take possession of the partnership\u2019s assets. The Harts resisted and were arrested by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-21\">The Harts filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claiming that the seizure of the partnership assets and the arrest were wrongful. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted defendant Patton\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim against Patton. Subsequently, the District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of defendant McChristian, dismissed the action, and issued an extensive memorandum opinion outlining its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-22\">The Harts appeal the grant of summary judgment as to McChristian and the grant of dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) as to Patton. After de novo review of the record, <em>see Hott v. Hennepin County, Minn., </em>260 F.3d 901, 904 (8th Cir.2001), we conclude that the grant of summary judgment for McChristian was proper for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s memorandum opinion. Similarly, after de novo review, <em>see Casino Resource Corp. v. Harrah\u2019s Entertain</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>ment, Inc., </em>243 F.3d 435, 437 (8th Cir.2001), we conclude that the grant of Patton\u2019s motion to dismiss was proper, again for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s order. We affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-15\">.
