The immigration judge ordered Badoh removed from the United States to Cameroon and denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>her application for asylum and for relief under the Convention Against Torture. Badoh\u2019s notice of appeal to the Board was untimely filed, and the Board dismissed the appeal as untimely. Badoh moved to reconsider the Board\u2019s decision; the Board denied the motion. Badoh appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">This court reviews the ruling on a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a) (2001). Nothing Badoh argues convinces us that the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion. Therefore, we affirm the Board\u2019s ruling. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
