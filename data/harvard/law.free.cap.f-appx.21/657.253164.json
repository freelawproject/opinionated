G. NELSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b687-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-25\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm on all but one issue. That issue, which involves a sentence enhancement based upon the district court\u2019s finding that Highsmith was in constructive possession of a firearm, is addressed in a published opinion. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>As to the sufficiency of the evidence, we conclude that the evidence presented more than sufficed to support a finding by any rational trier of fact that Highsmith aided and abetted Hurd\u2019s distribution or his intended distribution of drugs and that Highsmith had constructive possession of the drugs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As for the numerous alleged errors to which Highsmith points, we agree that two rulings of the district court were error, but conclude that the errors were harmless. The court allowed a question by the prosecutor that assumed a fact \u2014 that Highsmith had gone to someone\u2019s house with John Hurd \u2014 not in evidence. The court allowed another, regarding Highsmith\u2019s supposed interest in cutting out Hurd as a middleman, for which there was insufficient evidence at the time the question was asked as well. The overwhelming nature of the evidence against Highsmith renders these minor errors harmless. The other statements and questions by the prosecutor of which Highsmith complains were properly addressed by the district court during trial. The district court thus did not err, much less abuse its discretion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it denied Highsmith\u2019s motion for a mistrial based upon prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The district court also did not err by admitting the evidence of drug-related activity about which Highsmith complains he received no Rule 404(b) notice. The drug-related activity in question occurred during the time period listed in the indictment \u2014 it was part of the charges against Highsmith. Thus, it was not an \u201cother crime, wrong, or act\u201d covered by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) and the notice requirements of that rule did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by allowing the Government to call Dwana Lake and to impeach a portion of her testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Government does not appear to have called Lake for the primary purpose of impeaching her. Much of Lake\u2019s testimony appears to have been important to the Government\u2019s case, quite apart from the portion that was subsequently impeached. In addition, the form of impeachment used by the Government \u2014 live testimony \u2014 was permissible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">We do not reach the merits of Highsmith\u2019s claim under the Jencks Act because Highsmith did not move for production of Agent Williams\u2019 notes after the Agent\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Highsmith also did not raise his claims of vouching before the district court. Accordingly, we review those claims for plain error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that to the extent vouching occurred, any error was not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">The district court did not clearly err<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when it found that Highsmith was in constructive possession of fourteen ounces of drugs and calculated his base offense level accordingly. This factual finding was more than adequately supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>evidence, which included testimony that Highsmith regularly dealt drugs from the room in which the drugs were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">AFFIRMED on all but one issue which is addressed in a separate opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-5\">. <em>See United States v.
