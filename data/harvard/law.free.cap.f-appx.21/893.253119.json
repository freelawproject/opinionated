Kollmorgen Corporation opposes. Yaskawa moves to file a reply brief, with reply brief attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">The controlling question of law is whether a patentee who settles an earlier infringement case after a Markman ruling is precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating claim construction issues determined in the prior case. The district court concluded that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply because \u201ca consensual settlement between the parties does not constitute a \u2018final judgment.\u2019 \u201d However, other jurisdictions have reached different conclusions on facts that the district court acknowledged \u201cbear a striking similarity to the case at bar.\u201d In <em>TM Patents, L.P. and TM Creditors, L.L.C. v. IBM Corp., </em>72 F.Supp.2d 370, 377 (S.D.N.Y.1999), the district court held that Markman rulings on claim construction in a prior case \u201cwere sufficiently \u2018final\u2019 to permit application of collateral estoppel \u2014 even though the matter to which they were necessary was never reduced to a final judgment after verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">In certifying its. order for interlocutory appeal, the district court determined that (1) the order involves a controlling question of law; (2) there is substantial ground for difference of opinion on the question, and; (3) the immediate determination of the question by this court will materially advance the ultimate termination of this action. <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), (c)(1). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">(1) The petition is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">(2) The motion for leave to file a reply brief is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
