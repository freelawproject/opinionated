Daniels, <em>Judge, </em>convicting him of reentering the United States without the permission of the United States Attorney General, after having been deported following conviction of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and sentencing him principally to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he contends that a sentence longer than two years was improper under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not allege his prior conviction of an aggravated felony, and such a conviction was neither admitted by him nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He concedes that \u201cthe sole issue presented on this appeal\u201d is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Latorre Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 264 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2013, 149 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2001), ruling that such a sentence is nonetheless permissible in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and that <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres; </em>however, Ovalle pursues this appeal in order to preserve the issue for review in the Supreme Court. (Letter from Ovalle\u2019s counsel dated July 2, 2001.) We conclude that the appeal lacks merit for the reasons stated in <em>Latorre Benavides.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">We have considered all of Ovalle\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
