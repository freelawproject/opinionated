Nordvik (\u201cNordvik\u201d) appeals from a January 26, 2001 judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Eugene H. Nickerson, <em>Judge) </em>convicting him, upon his plea of guilty, of conspiring to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and sentencing him principally to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the two counts, to run concurrently. On appeal, Nordvik challenges only his sentence, arguing that the District Court erred in declining to depart downward from the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines range, pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.0, on the basis of his \u201cextraordinary acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>972 F.2d 489, 492 (2d Cir.1992) (noting that \u201cextraordinary acceptance of responsibility\u201d may, in appropriate cases, provide basis of departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">\u201cA sentencing court\u2019s decision not to grant a downward departure is an exercise of discretion not ordinarily reviewable on appeal unless the district court committed an error of law or was unaware of the power to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Felipe, </em>148 F.3d 101, 113 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 907, 119 S.Ct. 246, 142 L.Ed.2d 202 (1998). \u201c[W]e may not review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>merits of a court\u2019s decision not to downwardly depart, or probe the sufficiency of its consideration, so long as the sentence imposed is not otherwise a violation of law or a misapplication of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Campo, </em>140 F.3d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Contrary to Nordvik\u2019s assertions, there is no indication in the record that the District Court was unaware of its power to depart. Indeed, the court heard from both parties on the \u00a7 5K2.0 matter before expressly denying the departure motion on its merits. In addition, the District Court did not rely on improper evidence in making its determination. A sentencing court\u2019s discretion \u201cis \u2018largely unlimited either as to the kind of information [the court] may consider, or the source from which it may come.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Carmona, </em>873 F.2d 569, 574 (2d Cir.1989) (quoting <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972)); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d). \u201cAny information or circumstance shedding light on the defendant\u2019s background, history and behavior may properly be factored into the sentencing determination.\u201d <em>Carmona, </em>873 F.2d at 574. The evidence tending to show that Nordvik continued to participate in criminal activities was certainly relevant to the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
