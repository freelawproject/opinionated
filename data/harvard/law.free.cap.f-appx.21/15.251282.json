O\u2019Connor, on brief, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-17\">Mary P. Harrington, Kathleen M. O\u2019Hagan and Ronan, Segal <em>&amp; </em>Harrington, on brief, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b46-18\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b46-19\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b46-20\">After a thorough review of the record and of the parties\u2019 submissions, we affirm. To the extent appellant claims that those who decided to fire her were improperly motivated by her religion, her claim fails. She does not allege that anyone with firing authority knew she was a fundamentalist Christian; indeed, she admits her statement regarding her beliefs was stripped of any religious connotation before being repeated to others in the workplace. Moreover, animosity of one who lacks decision-making authority cannot support a Title VII claim, even if that animosity is religiously-motivated. <em>Conto </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>v. Concord Hosp., Inc., </em>265 F.3d 79, n. 4 (1st Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">To the extent appellant attempts to make out a claim for religious discrimination based on a hostile work environment, she fails. <em>See Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading, Inc., </em>158 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.1998) (acknowledging claim for religious discrimination based on hostile work environment). In order to state such a claim, O\u2019Connor must allege the harassment based on her religious beliefs was \u201csevere or pervasive,\u201d <em>O\u2019Rourke v. City of Providence, </em>235 F.3d 713, 728 (1st Cir.2001). She wholly fails to make such an allegation; and her charge of a single incident of religious harassment does not rise to the necessary level. \u201cBy its nature, a hostile work environment often means that there are a series of events which mount over time to create such a poisonous atmosphere as to violate the law. In the leading Supreme Court cases, the evidence of harassment covered a period of years.\u201d <em>Id . </em>at 727 (citing <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 782, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998); <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 20-23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993); <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 59-60, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986)). To the extent she claims she was \u201costracized\u201d by other employees, her claim fails because (once again) any reference to her religion was omitted during discussions among employees. Thus, she has failed to allege that the other employees even knew she was a fundamentalist Christian; lacking such knowledge, any harassment or ostracism could not have been motivated by her co-workers\u2019 animosity toward her religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Because O\u2019Connor did not include her additional allegations of age and sex discrimination in her administrative charge, the court cannot consider any instances of age or sex discrimination in determining whether the alleged harassment was severe or pervasive; and to the extent O\u2019Connor attempts to make distinct claims based on age or sex discrimination, the attempt fails. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f); <em>Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., </em>99 F.3d 456, 464 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The appellee\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\"><em>Affirmed. </em>1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
