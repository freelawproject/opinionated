The United States has not consented to be sued on a claim such as that asserted by plaintiff. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-23\">We have considered all of plaintiff\u2019s arguments in support of subject matter jurisdiction and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
