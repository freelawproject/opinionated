Brock based her claims on several incidents in which Pepsi disciplined her or did not promote her. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-16\">Brock argues that the district court\u2019s decision must be overturned because that court applied the wrong standard regarding Brock\u2019s burden of proof on her discrimination and retaliation claims. In particular, Brock argues that the district court wrongly required circumstantial pretext evidence to be \u201csubstantial\u201d as mandated by us in <em>Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir.1998), instead of requiring such evidence to be \u201csufficient\u201d as mandated subsequently by the Supreme Court in <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). We do not have to reach the issue whether <em>Reeves </em>set a new standard for circumstantial pretext evidence because in any event, Brock\u2019s evidence is not \u201csufficient\u201d to show that Pepsi\u2019s reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">Regarding Brock\u2019s discrimination claims, we agree with the district court that Brock has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning Pepsi\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory reasons for disciplining and not promoting her. <em>See Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). That Brock slapped a co-employee on company grounds was a valid reason for Pepsi\u2019s failure to promote Brock in 1996. It is irrelevant whether or not Brock was disciplined for this incident. Similarly, that Brock lied on her applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tion was a valid reason for Pepsi to suspend Brock for ten days in 1998. Brock\u2019s contention that this suspension was \u201charsh\u201d is speculative and does not raise a genuine issue of material fact. The suspension was in turn a valid reason for Pepsi\u2019s failure to promote Brock in 1998. Brock argues that this reason was pretextual because the suspension occurred after Pepsi\u2019s failure to place Brock on the 1997 promotion slate had already made Brock ineligible for promotion. However, Brock threatened to \u201cgo postal\u201d in 1996. This was a valid reason not to put her on the promotion slate in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Regarding Brock\u2019s retaliation claims, we again agree with the district court that Brock has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning Pepsi\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory reasons for disciplining and not promoting her. <em>See Cohen v. Meyer, Inc., </em>686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir.1982). The retaliation claims based on the 1998 suspension and the 1998 non-promotion fail for the same reasons as the discrimination claims based on these incidents. Moreover, Brock\u2019s absences in 1998 and 1999 in excess of what was allowed under Pepsi\u2019s attendance policy were valid reasons to discipline her for these absences. The discipline was in turn a valid reason for Pepsi\u2019s failure to promote Brock in 1999. Various unpleasantries adduced by Brock in support of her retaliation claims, ranging from an unsigned Christmas card and dirty looks by a non-supervisory managerial employee to a deactivated (but later reactivated) key card and a delayed gift certificate, are trivial in nature. They do not call into question Pepsi\u2019s otherwise valid reasons for disciplining and not promoting Brock.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Finally, regarding Brock\u2019s claims for intentional infliction' of emotional distress, we also agree with the district court that by Brock\u2019s own logic, these claims do not survive the failure of her discrimination and retaliation claims based on the same incidents. We add that none of the complained of behavior rises to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct required to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>See Molko v. Holy Spirit Ass\u2019n, </em>46 Cal.3d 1092, 252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46, 76 (1988). At best, Brock has made \u201c[a] simple pleading of [discriminatory or retaliatory] personnel management activity,\u201d which in California \u201cis insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d <em>Janken v. GM Hughes Elec., </em>46 Cal.App.4th 55, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 741, 756 (Ct.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-18\">.
