Weber, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b278-24\">Luis Carlos Guerrero appeals pro se from a district court judgment that dismissed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. His appeal has been referred to a panel of this court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-25\">Guerrero was convicted of possessing and distributing cocaine, violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 and 963. He was sentenced to 175 years of imprisonment. Our court affirmed this sentence on direct appeal, rejecting an argument that defense counsel had a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-26\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Guerrero alleged: 1) that his attorneys did not investigate his case or provide effective assistance at trial; 2) that the government withheld exculpatory evidence; 3) that his sentences should have run concurrently; 4) that he was denied the effective assistance of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>counsel; 5) that the government kidnapped him before he was indicted; and 6) that his attorneys failed to advise him of a plea offer. The district court dismissed the case on March 4, 1999, and Guerrero\u2019s motion to reconsider that judgment was denied. Our court subsequently issued a certificate of appealability, which was limited to Guerrero\u2019s claim that his attorney had not advised him of a plea offer from the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In response to this claim, the government submitted the affidavit of one of Guerrero\u2019s attorneys, which indicated that counsel had no recoEection of an offer from the government, that he no longer had the files from the case, and that it was his practice to advise his chents of all plea offers, even ones that were unreasonable or likely to be rejected. On the other hand Guerrero\u2019s claim is supported by his wife\u2019s affidavit, who stated that she confronted one of his attorneys after trial and asked why Guerrero had not been offered a deal Eke aE of the other defendants. She averred that counsel stated \u201cthat a deal was offered, but he didn\u2019t Eke it\u201d and \u201cthat he knew my husband would not have taken the deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The district court dismissed Guerrero\u2019s claim because our court had rejected his conflict of interest claim on direct appeal. <em>See generally DuPont v. United States, </em>76 F.3d 108, 110 (6th Cir.1996). We conclude, however, that Guerrero\u2019s current claim involves a different ground for reEef than that which was considered on appeal. Moreover, a hearing may be appropriate, as the record does not conclusively show that he is not entitled to relief. <em>See Arredondo v. United States, </em>178 F.3d 778, 782 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Blaylock, </em>20 F.3d 1458, 1465 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The government now argues that the district court could have dismissed Guerrero\u2019s claim based on the laches doctrine. However, Guerrero\u2019s current action was timely filed and there is a strong presumption that laches does not apply if the limitations period has not expired. <em>See Patton v. Bearden, </em>8 F.3d 343, 348 (6th Cir.1993). In addition, appEcation of the laches doctrine involves factual issues that should be considered in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated insofar as it dismissed Guerrero\u2019s claim that his attorney faEed to advise him of a plea offer and the case is remanded for further proceedings on that claim. The judgment is otherwise affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
