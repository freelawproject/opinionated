Carter\u2019s 1999 complaint alleged that the Board promised him advancement from substitute clerk to a permanent position, Operator II Step E, but instead placed him in a lower, Clerk I Step A, position, while promoting less experienced white female substitute clerks to higher levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-23\">After de novo review, we conclude that judgment for the Board was proper as to both sex and race because Carter did not make a prima facie case of disparate treatment by showing the individuals with whom he sought to compare himself performed comparable jobs, <em>see Harvey v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em>38 F.3d 968, 971-73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>(8th Cir.1994), or were similarly situated, <em>see Taylor v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>251 F.3d 735, 738, 740 (8th Cir.2001); nor did Carter demonstrate that he applied for and was denied the positions they obtained, <em>see Dotson v. Delta Consol. Indus., Inc., </em>251 F.3d 780, 781 (8th Cir.2001). As to his replacement, Carter did not show the Board\u2019s reasons for placing her at a higher step level\u2014her greater experience and skills, and her higher private-sector salary\u2014were pretextual. <em>See Harvey, </em>38 F.3d at 969, 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Carter\u2019s motion \u201cto combine complaints\u201d (to amend his complaint to add a retaliation claim), because it did so without prejudice to his ability to renew the motion. <em>See Ryan v. Sargent, </em>969 F.2d 638, 641 (8th Cir.1992) (disposition of motion to amend is within sound discretion of district court). To the extent Carter challenges any other rulings of the district court, his arguments are without merit. We do not consider claims Carter attempts to raise for the first time on appeal. <em>See Tarsney v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>225 F.3d 929, 939 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-15\">.
