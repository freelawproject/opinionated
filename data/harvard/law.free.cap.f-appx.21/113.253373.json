We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">District courts have jurisdiction over appeals from final orders entered by bankruptcy courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (West Supp.2001). The courts of appeals, in turn, have jurisdiction to hear appeals from \u201cfinal decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees entered under\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a). 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(d) (West 1993). \u201cA final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">An order denying confirmation of a proposed Chapter 13 plan, without also dismissing the underlying petition or proceeding, is not final for purposes of appeal. <em>Lewis v. United States, Farmers Home Admin., </em>992 F.2d 767, 772-73 (8th Cir. 1993); <em>In re Szekely, </em>936 F.2d 897, 899 (7th Cir.1991); <em>In re Simons, </em>908 F.2d 643, 644-45 (10th Cir.1990). Because the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying confirmation and continuing the case was not a final order under \u00a7 158(a), the district court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a). Moreover, because the courts of appeals have jurisdiction over appeals from final orders entered under \u00a7 158(a), and the district court order herein appealed was not a final order entered under \u00a7 158(a), this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(d); <em>Lewis, </em>992 F.2d at 773; <em>Szekely, </em>936 F.2d at 899; <em>Simons, </em>908 F.2d at 644-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
