The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to Target, concluding that even if the plaintiffs established a prima facie case of discrimination, Target showed a nondiscriminatory basis for the disciplinary action taken against each plaintiff, and each plaintiff failed to present any evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact on the issues of pretext or intentional race discrimination. Likewise, the district court granted summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 hostile work environment claims because they did not show that Target\u2019s actions were based on the plaintiffs\u2019 race rather than their misconduct or deficient performance, or that Target\u2019s conduct created an abusive working environment. On appeal, the plaintiffs contend they raised a genuine issue of material fact on the pretext issue and the district court improperly rejected their hostile work environment claims. Having carefully reviewed the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the controlling law, we conclude the district court properly granted summary judgment to Target. Because we have nothing to add to the district court\u2019s thorough, 29-page memorandum opinion and order, we affirm without additional discussion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> The Honorable Ann D. Montgomery, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
