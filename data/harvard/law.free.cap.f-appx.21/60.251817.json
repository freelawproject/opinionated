Neither the complaint nor the amended complaint alleged that plaintiff himself had suffered or was about to suffer injury in fact, which was necessary for plaintiff to have standing to challenge the regulation in question, <em>see, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Plaintiff\u2019s contention that he may maintain the present action in the absence of actual or imminent injury in fact to himself <em>(see </em>plaintiffs Affirmation of Opposing the Defendant\u2019s Motion To Dismiss the Complain[t], dated August 15, 2000, \u00b6 2(j) (because no demand is made for money damages, \u201cthe Plaintiff is not necessary [to] stay [sic ] any injury in this action\u201d)) is erroneous. <em>See generally Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130; <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); <em>Lee v. Board of Governors, </em>118 F.3d 905, 910 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-20\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
