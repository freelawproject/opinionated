We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1994), as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act \u00a7 309(c)(4), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">Petitioners contend that the BIA denied them due process of law by refusing to address the IJ\u2019s denial of their application for political asylum. Petitioners failed to raise this issue before the BIA. They therefore failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906 (9th Cir.1987). Because procedural defects must be raised first before the BIA, Petitioners cannot now obtain review simply by alleging that such error violates due process. <em>Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 908 (9th Cir.1987) (\u201c\u2018due process\u2019 is not a talismanic term which guarantees review in this court of procedural errors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">Although Petitioners do not challenge the application of the stop-time rule in their ease, an argument that is foreclosed by <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001), they did receive their Order to Show Cause two days before the seven-year continuous physical presence requirement was met. Therefore, we do not consider Petitioners\u2019 eligibility, if any, for relief under the class action pending in the district court in accordance with <em>Barahona-Gomez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number><em>v. Reno, </em>167 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir.1999), <em>supplemental opinion, </em>236 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2001). Our resolution of this case does not affect any interim or permanent relief awarded to members of the class certified in <em>Barahona-Gomez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b811-20\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
