Larsen received medical treatment from Mayo Clinic, a subsidiary of Mayo Foundation, in 1996. More than two years later, in 1998, Larsen and her spouse filed a diversity action in Minnesota against Mayo Foundation, alleging the 1996 treatment was negligent and caused Larsen further health problems. Because Minnesota\u2019s two-year statute of limitations had expired before the Larsens\u2019 lawsuit was properly filed, the district court granted Mayo Foundation\u2019s motion for summary judgment and we affirmed. <em>Larsen v.. Mayo Med. Ctr., 218 </em>F.3d 863, 865 (8th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1036, 121 S.Ct. 625, 148 L.Ed.2d 534 (2000). Effective August 1, 1999, the Minnesota legislature amended the medical malpractice statute of limitations, extending it from two years to four for \u201cactions commenced on or after that date.\u201d Act of Mar. 23, 1999, ch. 23, sec. 3, 1999 Minn. Laws 128, 130 (application of sec. 2 of the Act) (sec. 2 codified at Minn.Stat. \u00a7 541.076 (2000)). The Larsens then refiled their lawsuit in November 1999, contending the amended statute of limitations should be applied retroactively and allow their lawsuit to proceed. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> again granted summary judgment for Mayo Foundation, holding the principle of res judicata precluded the Larsens from litigating the statute of limitations issue. The Larsens appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Larsen, </em>218 F.3d at 866. Additionally, we apply Minnesota law on the substantive questions of res judicata and the statute of limitations because these issues are controlled by state law in diversity actions. <em>See Hillary v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>123 F.3d 1041, 1043 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">Res judicata precludes a later lawsuit when the same issue has already been adjudicated to a final judgment on the merits in a case involving the same parties. <em>Wilson v. Comm\u2019r of Revenue, </em>619 N.W.2d 194, 198 (Minn.2000) (elements of res judicata). The Larsens contend res judicata does not bar their second lawsuit because the dismissal of the first case was not a judgment on the merits. Minnesota law clearly states that dismissing a case because the statute of limitations has run is a judgment on the merits and bars a later lawsuit about a substantially similar claim, even if brought under a different statute of limitations. <em>Nitz v. Nitz, </em>456 N.W.2d 450, 452-53 (Minn.Ct.App.1990); <em>Sautter v. Interstate Power Co., </em>567 N.W.2d 755, 759 (Minn.Ct.App.1997). The district court correctly applied this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">The Larsens also contend their case should be allowed under an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d exception to res judicata. The district court noted the Minnesota Supreme Court has held \u201cres judicata is a \u2018flexible doctrine\u2019 that need not always be applied if it would be contrary to the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Larsen v. Mayo Found., </em>No. 99-1726, slip op. at 6 (D.Minn. Aug. 23, 2000) (citing <em>R.W. v.. T.F., </em>528 N.W.2d 869, 872 n. 3 (Minn.1995); <em>Johnson v. Consol. Freightways, Inc., </em>420 N.W.2d 608, 613-14 (Minn.1988); <em>AFSCME Council 96 v. Arrowhead Reg\u2019l Corr. Bd., </em>356 N.W.2d 295, 299 (Minn.1984)); <em>see also </em>Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02(e) (authorizing relief from judgments and orders no longer equitable). The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>court then analyzed Minnesota law and concluded that contrary to the unusual factual and legal circumstances of the Minnesota cases applying the exception, the Larsens\u2019 \u201ccase involves a simple and straightforward failure to bring the first action within the applicable statute of limitations____ [A] change in the applicable statute of limitations is a common, not an extraordinary, circumstance.\u201d <em>Larsen, </em>No. 99-1726, slip op. at 7 (citing <em>Simington v. Minnesota Veterans Home, </em>464 N.W.2d 529, 531 (Minn.Ct.App.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We conclude the interests of justice do not require the Larsens\u2019 second lawsuit to proceed, even in light of the amended statute of limitations. In Minnesota, the statute of limitations in place at the time of injury governs the lawsuit, with two primary exceptions. First, if the legislature clearly intends for the revised statute of limitations to be retroactive, a plaintiff may file her otherwise time-barred claim under the new statute of limitations. <em>Sarafolean v. Kauffman, </em>547 N.W.2d 417, 419-20 (Minn.Ct.App.1996) (\u201cwindow provision\u201d signals clear intent). The Minnesota Court of Appeals has held the Minnesota legislature did not clearly intend to make the new statute retroactive, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has granted review to consider this issue in <em>Morton v. Dyste, </em>627 N.W.2d 734, 737 (Minn.Ct.App.2001), <em>pet. for rev. granted, </em>(Aug. 15, 2001) (No. C4-00-002046) and <em>Gomon v. Northland Family Physicians, Ltd., </em>625 N.W.2d 496, 502 (Minn.Ct.App.2001), <em>pet. for rev. granted, </em>(July 24, 2001) (No. C8-00-001465). In <em>Morton </em>and <em>Gomon, </em>however, the plaintiffs filed their lawsuits for the first time under the amended statute of limitations. The Larsens\u2019 question of whether a plaintiff whose case was previously filed and dismissed as untimely can refile is not before the Minnesota Supreme Court and we have found no Minnesota cases authorizing a lawsuit to proceed under these circumstances. As for the second exception, if the statute of limitations is extended while a plaintiffs original claim is still timely, the revised statute of limitations governs the claim, in effect \u201cgrandfathering in\u201d the plaintiffs claim under the new statute of limitations. <em>Donovan v. Duluth St. Ry. Co., </em>150 Minn. 364, 185 N.W. 388, 388-89 (1921); <em>Klimmek v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 487, </em>299 N.W.2d 501, 502 (Minn.1980). The Minnesota legislature amended the statute of limitations effective August 1,1999-more than one full year after the statute of limitations governing the Larsens\u2019 claim expired-and so the amendment does not extend the original statute of limitations for the Larsens.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The Larsens\u2019 lawsuit presents for a second time the same claim between the same parties, which has already been adjudicated to a final judgment on the merits. Res judicata bars the lawsuit absent an exceptional circumstance, and there is no exceptional circumstance in this case. We thus affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The Honorable John R.
