The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> granted Goodner\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars specifying Goodner\u2019s affirmative harboring acts, but the Government mistakenly failed to comply with the court\u2019s order. To remedy this error, the district court partially granted Goodner\u2019s motion in limine to prevent the admission of evidence not disclosed before the deadline set for the bill of particulars. Arguing it had not been disclosed before the deadline, Goodner unsuccessfully sought to exclude testimony of Goodner\u2019s admission she had been hiding Zimmer. Goodner was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment. Goodner now appeals. Having reviewed the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">We reject Goodner\u2019s contention the district court abused its discretion by admitting Goodner\u2019s admission she had been hiding Zimmer. <em>See United States v. Jiminez-Perez, </em>238 F.3d 970, 974 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review). The contested statement provided evidence of Goodner\u2019s intent to hide Zimmer, not evidence of an affirmative act of harboring, thus the district court correctly found the contested evidence had not been requested in the motion for the bill of particulars and was not prohibited by the court\u2019s remedial order. In addition, we reject Goodner\u2019s contention the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, we conclude the evidence was sufficient to permit a jury reasonably to find Goodner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Erdman, </em>953 F.2d 387, 389-91 (8th Cir.1992). The record shows Goodner spoke with a United States Marshal regarding Zimmer\u2019s fugitive status, provided Zimmer with money, her camper, and a motorcycle while officials were actively searching for him, and admitted she purposefully aided Zimmer in hiding from officials. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">Finding no reversible error, we affirm Goodner\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-13\"> The Honorable John R. Tunheim, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
