Villeza recruited five individuals with accounts at the Bank of America, four of which were named in the indictment. Although his direct involvement resulted in a $25,035 loss, the district court attributed more than a $120,000 loss to him based on his participation in the larger scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-27\">Mere knowledge of the illegal acts of others is not enough to create responsibility. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.3, comt. n. 2(c)(6) (2000). We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>held that employees who work in an interdependent scheme may, under certain conditions, be responsible for the illegal acts of each other. <em>United States v. Blitz, </em>151 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir.1998). However, unlike the swindlers in <em>Blitz, </em>Villeza was paid purely on a commission and worked independently from the other participants. Here, the district court erred in attributing others\u2019 illegal acts to Villeza in assessing loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Although the denial of the minor role adjustment request may have been proper, the present findings do not provide us with a sufficient basis to review the decision. Thus, we also remand for the entry of findings concerning the denial of a downward adjustment for minor role. <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 474 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b611-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
