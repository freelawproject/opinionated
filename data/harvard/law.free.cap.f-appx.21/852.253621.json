R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Terry Lynn Payne, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>requests a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. For the reasons stated below, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">An Oklahoma jury convicted Mr. Payne of twelve counts of \u2018first-degree rape\u2019 and eleven counts of \u2018rape by instrumentation.\u2019 The charges arose from Mr. Payne\u2019s interactions, on at least twelve different occasions, with a single victim. The Oklahoma trial court sentenced Mr. Payne to twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, or forty years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the twelve first-degree rape convictions and eight or ten years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the eleven rape by instrumentation convictions. The trial court ordered the sentences served consecutively, thereby producing a sentence totaling 502 years. The trial court also fined Mr. Payne $120,000. Mr. Payne unsuccessfully sought relief on direct appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Mr. Payne next petitioned the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma for habeas relief. Mr. Payne contended, as he had on direct appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, that: 1) the Double Jeopardy Clause bars Oklahoma from punishing Mr. Payne for both first-degree rape and rape by instrumentation, <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. V; 2) Oklahoma produced insufficient evidence for a jury to properly convict Mr. Payne of first-degree rape, thereby violating the Due Process Clause, <em>see </em>U.S. Const, amend XIV; and 3) the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishment! ]\u201d bars Oklahoma from imposing a 502 year sentence for the conduct of which the jury convicted Mr. Payne, <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Noting AEDPA\u2019s \u201ccontrary to, or ... unreasonable application of\u2019 and \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts\u201d standards of review, the district court denied relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (2). The district court first noted that <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), governs application of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 696, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993) (\u201cIn both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts, this Court has concluded that where the two offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot survive the \u2018same-elements\u2019 test, the double jeopardy bar applies.\u201d). <em>Blockburger </em>bars punishment, imposed for a single course of conduct, for two offenses unless each offense contains an element not contained by the other offense. <em>See Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. 180. Here, the jury convicted Mr. Payne of first-degree rape and of rape by instrumentation. First-degree rape, as charged against Mr. Payne, requires \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d where \u201csexual intercourse\u201d is defined as \u201cthe actual contact of the sexual organs of a man and a woman, and an actual penetration into the body of the latter.\u201d Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1111(A)(1); Oklahoma Uniform Jury Instruction\u2014Criminal 480 (1981). Thus, first-degree rape requires proof of penetration by the penis. Rape by instrumentation, on the other hand, occurs when \u201cany inanimate object or any part of the body, not amounting to sexual intercourse!,] is used in the carnal knowledge of another person without his or her consent!,] and penetration of the anus or vagina occurs to that person.\u201d Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1111.1. Thus, rape by instrumen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>tation requires proof of penetration by something other than a male sexual organ. Since first-degree rape and rape by instrumentation each include an element not included in the other (penetration by a penis and penetration by something other than a penis), the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals reasonably rejected Mr. Payne\u2019s argument that conviction and sentence for both offenses violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Cf. Rhoden v. Rowland, </em>10 F.3d 1457, 1461-62 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]t is well settled that a single transaction can give rise to distinctive offenses under separate statutes without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The district court next observed that Mr. Payne\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim required demonstration that the prosecution offered no evidence from which the jury could have properly concluded that Mr. Payne committed first-degree rape. As noted above, in Oklahoma, first-degree rape requires, among other elements, \u201cthe actual contact of the sexual organs of a man and a woman, and an actual penetration into the body of the latter.\u201d Oklahoma Uniform Jury Instruction \u2014 Criminal 480 (1981) (defining \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1111(A)(1)). Here, Mr. Payne contested proof of penetration. The district court noted, however, that the prosecution introduced the victim\u2019s testimony; the victim, a child, testified that Mr. Payne would \u201cstick his private in mine.\u201d Rec. vol. II, at 336 (testimony of the victim, K.N.H.). Thus the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals reasonably rejected Mr. Payne\u2019s argument that the prosecution introduced insufficient evidence to sustain Mr. Payne\u2019s conviction for first-degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Finally, the district court recognized that Eighth Amendment analysis \u201cfocuses on the sentence imposed for each specific crime, not the cumulative sentence for multiple crimes.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. Hargett, </em>200 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 &amp; n. 5 (10th Cir.1999); <em>see also United States v. Schell, </em>692 F.2d 672, 675 (10th Cir.1982). Since Mr. Payne admitted that none of his individual sentences exceeded the statutory maximum, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals reasonably rejected Mr. Payne\u2019s argument that the 502 year sentence violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition upon \u201ccruel and unusual punishment[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Mr. Payne now seeks a COA only in regard to his first and second claims; Mr. Payne no longer presses the Eighth Amendment claim. Pursuant to <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) <em>(per curiam), </em>we liberally construe Mr. Payne\u2019s remaining allegations. To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Payne must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Mr. Payne may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he raises are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Having reviewed Mr. Payne\u2019s request for a COA, his appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the appellate record, we conclude that Mr. Payne has failed to make the required showing for a COA. Accordingly, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s June 12, 2001 order, we DENY Mr. Payne\u2019s motion for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b882-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
