We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-27\">Moore was employed as a police officer with the city of Sedalia, Missouri from March 28, 1994 until February 1999, at which time he was discharged for cause. During his tenure with the police department Moore served on the executive board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>of the Mid-Missouri Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). While serving on the board Moore assisted in the preparation of a letter accusing Sadalia\u2019s Police Chief, Theodore Litschauer, of incompetence, and a lack of honesty and integrity. Moore showed the letter to various members of the FOP, including some who were employed as officers in the Sedalia Police Department. Moore then sent the letter to Irl Tessendorf, Sedalia\u2019s City Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">City officials investigated Moore\u2019s allegations and determined they were false and unsupported by any credible evidence. Moore was suspended pending an informal disciplinary hearing. At the informal hearing, officials concluded that Moore\u2019s conduct in circulating the letter was sufficient cause for dismissal. Moore appealed the decision to the Police Personnel Board claiming the letter constituted protected speech under the First Amendment. The Board upheld his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Moore filed this action under \u00a7 1983, alleging violation of his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. Moore named as defendants the city of Sedalia, various members of city government, including the City Administrator, Chief of Police, and Mayor, as well as the members of the Police Personnel Board. The defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that Moore\u2019s claims were barred by claim preclusion, issue preclusion, and qualified immunity. The district court granted summary judgment on the basis of claim preclusion and issue preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1237 (8th Cir.1997). We will affirm the grant of summary judgment if the record \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). When considering the facts, and the inferences to be drawn from them, we do so in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Dulany, </em>132 F.3d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">On appeal, Moore challenges only the district court\u2019s dismissal of his freedom of association claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moore claims he was terminated because of his membership with the FOP. Our review of the record, however, fails to disclose any evidence supporting Moore\u2019s freedom of association claim. Rather, the record demonstrates that Moore was terminated as a result of the false and unsupported allegations made against Chief Litschauer. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-17\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">. Moore's notice of appeal identifies the sole issue on appeal as \"Did the Honorable Scott O. Wright adequately address and dispose of Count II, right to freedom of association, of plaintiff's complaint in his Order dated April 21, 2000?\u201d Appendix of Appellant at 265-67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-11\">. We recognize that our analysis differs from that of the district court, but we may affirm the district court's summary judgment decision on any basis supported by the record. See <em>Duffy v. Wolle, </em>123 F.3d 1026, 1035 n. 5 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
