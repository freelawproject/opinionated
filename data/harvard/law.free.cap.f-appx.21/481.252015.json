Smith\u2019s employment with the Kenosha County House of Corrections, Smith brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Smith, who is African-American, alleged that the defendants conspired to detain and question him without probable cause and, thereafter, to terminate him on the basis of his race. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on each of the counts in Smith\u2019s Amended Complaint. On appeal, Smith argues that he presented sufficient circumstantial evidence for a rational jury to find that he was discharged because of his race. We disagree, as we have found no such evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">Smith applied for employment as a correctional officer at the Kenosha County House of Corrections in July 1998. A search committee invited Smith to an interview, and during the meeting he disclosed that he had been convicted of disorderly conduct and felonious sexual assault, but that the assault charge had been reduced to a misdemeanor. He also admitted that he had been arrested but not convicted for false imprisonment, larceny, possession of drugs, and unlawful use of a weapon. A Kenosha County district attorney recommended Smith\u2019s employment, and. County Personnel Director Brooke P. Koons concurred with the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Smith began working as a probationary correctional officer in late August 1998, and at the time Smith was hired, the Kenosha County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Department had no input into the personnel decisions of the house of corrections. However, the sheriffs department assumed control of the correctional facility on January 1, 1999, and Sheriff Larry T. Zarletti immediately made known his misgivings about Smith\u2019s fitness to serve as a prison guard. One reason for Zarletti\u2019s amdety was his discovery that Smith had formerly worked at a U-Haul facility in the area, for informants had made the sheriffs department aware that the facility had a history of employing undesirables such as gang members and drug dealers. Thereafter, Zarletti met with his assistants and asked them to determine whether Smith may have been involved in such illegal activity. After conducting an investigation, Zarletti\u2019s assistants determined that Smith was reputed to be a former high-ranking gang member, who had been involved with narcotics trafficking on repeated occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Based on this information, Zarletti asked Koons to terminate Smith. Koons originally declined to do so unless Zarletti acquired additional evidence, and so Zarletti ordered Lt. Richard A. Heyden and Lt. Harvey V. Hedden to conduct a more extensive investigation into Smith\u2019s background and criminal history. A woman named Lynda Kutzke told Hedden that Smith was a notorious cocaine dealer, who had sold drugs repeatedly between 1994 and late 1997. The lieutenants thereafter met with Smith and questioned him about his past. Smith denied that he was presently a gang member or cocaine dealer, but he did admit that he was a former member of the Vice Lords street gang and had sold cocaine many times during the 1990s. Hedden relayed this information to Zarletti, and Zarletti ordered Smith to turn in his badge. Zarletti met with Koons and advised him of Smith\u2019s record. Smith was terminated February 19, 1999, pursuant to Zarletti\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">On appeal, Smith argues that a rational jury could find that he was discharged because he is African-American. Because Smith has failed to present direct evidence of discrimination, we apply the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See Texas Dep\u2019t of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Initially, Smith is required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the defendants treated similarly-situated employees outside his class more favorably. <em>See Logan v. Kautex Textron N. Am., </em>259 F.3d 635, 639 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Foster v. Arthur Andersen, L.L.P., </em>168 F.3d 1029, 1035 (7th Cir.1999). The burden then shifts to the defendants to proffer a race-neutral reason for their decision. At this point, the inference of discrimination disappears, and the burden returns to Smith, who must create more than a \u201cweak issue of fact\u201d that each and every proffered reason is a pretextual cover for discrimination. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Our focus at this juncture is on \u201cthe strength of the plaintiffs prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148-49, 120 S.Ct. 2097.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">First, we first turn to the fourth element of the prima facie case. Smith has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>shown that his position was subsequently filled by a non-minority applicant. Therefore, Smith must demonstrate that he was treated differently from a similarly-situated non-minority employee. Smith must identify someone whose misconduct was substantially the same as his own. Smith argues that he was treated differently than Edward Hartnell and Sonnie Kason. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 25-26, 28-29; Appellant\u2019s Reply at 1-2.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Before identifying a similarly-situated employee, we must determine why the defendants terminated Smith. There is no genuine dispute that the defendants felt that a reputed drug dealer such as Smith, who had extensive ties to street gangs, could disrupt the correctional facility\u2019s atmosphere, regardless of whether the disruption could be traced to gang membership that was ongoing, recently lapsed, or wholly past. Koons testified that he shared his concerns with Zarletti that some inmates who recognized Smith might not respect his authority, given that they were \u201csomewhat familiar with his background.\u201d (Tr. at 135.) Hedden also advised Zarletti that in his opinion it is extremely unlikely that a former high-ranking gang member could ever completely disentangle himself from the gang. Based upon this information, which validated his initial belief that persons connected to street gangs should not serve as prison guards, Zarletti again made it known that he opposed Smith\u2019s employment. <em>(Id. </em>at 156, 120 S.Ct. 2097.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We reject Smith\u2019s argument that the defendants have offered shifting reasons for their decision. In support of his argument, Smith points to a letter written by Defendants\u2019 attorney to the Equal Rights Division of the State of Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development. Page one of this letter states that Smith was fired because of his \u201congoing drug and gang affiliations,\u201d while page three of the letter states that Smith was subject to termination because of his \u201c[p]ast and potentially current gang affiliation.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated earlier, we agree with the district court that these statements diverge merely in form, not substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Thus, in asking whether Zarletti treated any similarly-situated employee differently from Smith, our focus is on whether the employee allegedly had equally serious and repeated criminal activity in his or her immediate past, including but not limited to drug and gang affiliations of similar quality, quantity, and recency. Hartnell is not similarly-situated for numerous reasons. The primary reasons are that Hartnell was never involved with a street gang, never sold controlled substances, and never engaged in criminal conduct within the three years before the sheriffs department assumed control of the house of corrections. Department records show that Hartnell was arrested and paid a fine for battery in May 1995 and for violating liquor laws, disorderly conduct, and loitering in 1989. Other charges against him for assault and selling liquor to minors were dismissed or settled out of court in 1989 or 1990. (Doc. No. 30 Ex. Q.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Although Smith contends that Hartnell was involved in street gangs, Smith sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ports this argument only by claiming that Hartnell told Smith that \u201cwhen he was younger he was in a gang or something at one point.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Supp.App. at 316.) Hartnell\u2019s statement is inadmissible hearsay that courts may not consider when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Pfeil v. Rogers, </em>757 F.2d 850, 861 (7th Cir.1985). Even if we were to consider this evidence, we would still affirm the district court because Smith has not shown that Zarletti had information at his disposal concerning Hartnell\u2019s former gang membership. Without such knowledge, we cannot conclude that Zarletti treated Hartnell differently than Smith. <em>See Friedel v. City of Madison, </em>832 F.2d 965, 974 (7th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We now turn to Smith\u2019s claim that he was treated differently than Kason. This claim is somewhat puzzling, because, after all, Kason and Smith were both terminated. Smith\u2019s complaint appears to be that the county granted Kason two formal hearings before an administrative review board, during which she was represented by counsel, before she was discharged, but that Smith was terminated without any hearing. However, Smith has not substantiated his complaint with any evidence besides his subjective opinions, which are based on rumors about how Kenosha County handled Kason\u2019s termination. (Appellee\u2019s Supp.App. at 327-28.) Therefore, we hold that Smith has not proffered admissible evidence that he was treated differently from Kason. <em>See Friedel, supra. </em>Because Smith has not established a prima facie ease of discrimination, summary judgment was warranted on this basis alone. <em>See Payne v. Milwaukee County, </em>146 F.3d 430, 434 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Had Smith established a prima facie case, then, pursuant to <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the burden of production would have shifted to the defendants to justify their personnel decision with race-neutral reasons. Defendants could have met this burden by explaining that they fired Smith because of his ties to drugs and street gangs. There would have been a total lack of evidence supporting Smith\u2019s claim that these proffered reasons were merely pretexts for discrimination. We, like the district court, analyze this evidence below.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Sheriff Zarletti learned about Smith\u2019s drug and gang involvement from a number of sources, including informant Linda Kutzke, who stated that she bought cocaine from Smith on a number of occasions between 1994 and 1997. Smith argues that he has called into question Sheriff Zarletti\u2019s statements that he personally spoke with Kutzke about Smith\u2019s drug sales. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15 \u00b6 76; 28.) Smith\u2019s argument misses the mark, however, for Smith concedes that Kutzke also spoke to Lt. Hedden and provided him with \u201cinformation ... that Mr. Smith had been involved in the delivery of cocaine since 1994.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 14 \u00b6 69.) Hedden relayed this and other similar information to Zarletti, and Zarletti fired Smith based on a reasonable belief that such information was true. (Hedden\u2019s Dep. at 52-55.) To establish pretext, Smith would have had to offer evidence demonstrating that Zarletti did not truly believe Hedden\u2019s statements \u2014 not merely that Zarletti may not have met with Kutzke \u2014 for Zarletti proffered that he terminated Smith because of his belief that Smith had ties to drugs and gangs, not simply because he had a meeting with Kutzke, during which she divulged this fact. <em>See Rand v. CF Indus., Inc., </em>42 F.3d 1139, 1145 (7th Cir.1994). Moreover, although Smith has attacked Kutzke\u2019s credibility as a confidential informant, he has failed to demonstrate pretext, for even if we assume that Kutzke\u2019s testimony was riddled with inaccuracies, the substance of her statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>was independently confirmed by numerous law enforcement officers, not to mention Smith himself. Zarletti \u201cis entitled to the assumption that those people he did consult were telhng the truth.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Finally, we return to our earlier discussion about defense counsel\u2019s one-time suggestion that the defendants objected to Smith\u2019s \u201congoing\u201d gang affiliation \u2014 as opposed to his recent gang affiliation. The most charitable inference to be drawn in Smith\u2019s favor is that the defendants \u201ctossed this additional \u2018reason\u2019 into the pot merely to make [their] case for firing [Smith] more impressive,\u201d <em>Russell v. Acme-Evans Co., </em>51 F.3d 64, 69 (7th Cir.1995), rather than to cover up discriminatory conduct. We recognize that an employee may sometimes avoid summary judgment by showing that the employer has articulated non-discriminatory reasons in such an inconsistent manner that a jury could find that the employer is dissembling. <em>See Hasham v. California St. Bd. of Equalization, </em>200 F.3d 1035, 1047 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Perfetti v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Chicago, </em>950 F.2d 449, 456 (7th Cir.1991). For example, an employer might proffer a specific reason and then completely abandon or contradict that reason under suspicious circumstances. The jury could then reject the proffered reasons and infer discriminatory animus based on the strength of the prima facie case and the employer\u2019s lack of credibility. <em>See, e.g., Stalter v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 285 (7th Cir.1999); <em>Emmel v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Chicago, </em>95 F.3d 627 (7th Cir.1996). However, summary judgment is appropriate when the employer has proffered legitimate non-discriminatory reasons that are consistent \u201cin substance if not word choice.\u201d <em>Rand, </em>42 F.3d at 1146; <em>Williams v. Alabama Indus. Dev. Training, </em>146 F.Supp.2d 1214, 1224 (M.D.Ala.2001) (\u201cEmployment law is not a game of \u2018Gotcha!\u00ae\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In other words, if there are only \u201crelatively minor differences among the labels attached to [the employee\u2019s] conduct,\u201d coupled with the existence of undisputed race-neutral reasons for the employer\u2019s decisions, then the evidence does not \u201crise to a level of inconsistency that permits an inference of discriminatory motive.\u201d <em>Little v. Cox\u2019s Supermarkets, </em>71 F.3d 637, 643 (7th Cir.1995). In this case, there is simply no evidence from which a rational jury could infer that Kenosha County terminated Smith because of his race. From our review of the record, we are convinced that the court\u2019s grant of Defendants\u2019 Motion For Summary Judgment was proper. <em>See, e.g., Raybon v. Alabama Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, </em>2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7240, 2001 WL 611194 at *4 (M.D.Ala.2001) (finding that a state trooper who \u201cconsorts with felons ... is a menace to the public who, of course, may be lawfully terminated.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">.

App. 42 at 1.) Page three of the letter states that a sheriff's investigation resulted in the conclusion that Smith was subject to termination because of his \u201d[p]ast and potentially current gang affiliation,\u201d <em>(Id. </em>44 at 3), while page five states that Smith was fired because of his \"unsuitability for the job, due to drug and gang affiliations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>46 at 5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
