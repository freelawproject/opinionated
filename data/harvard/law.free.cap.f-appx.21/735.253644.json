These were affirmative acts. In all its bills to Setterlund, it represented itself to be \u201cFamily Practice Clinic,\u201d on forms common to private medical practices. More significantly, it maintained an official registration in the State of Washington Department of Licensing that said that the \u201cregistered owner\u201d of \u201cFamily Practice Clinic\u201d was \u201cThompson <em>&amp; </em>Garnett.\u201d It registered the \u201cowner type\u201d as \u201cpartnership,\u201d with the partners owning the business as Neal R. Thompson and Michael E. Garnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-16\">The plaintiff acted on the faith of these acts of the defendants. She checked on whom to sue by contacting the Department of Licensing. Washington law, RCW 19.80.010, obligates any person or entity who conducts business in Washington under any trade name to register that trade name with the Washington State Department of Licensing. \u201cThe purpose of this statute is to provide notice to those engaging in a transaction with a business operating under an assumed name of the names of the persons conducting the business.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the Clinic was registered to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>private partnership, Setterlund filed her lawsuit as she did in reliance on the Department of Licensing\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Defendants argue that the plaintiff should have known better, because she was treated at the municipal hospital, and should have called the Clinic. It was reasonable to rely on the official records maintained in the Washington Department of Licensing rather than on such information as might have been obtained by asking a receptionist at a medical clinic how to sue the Clinic and its physicians. There was no unreasonableness in supposing the physicians treating a patient at a hospital were private physicians with privileges at the hospital, as is typical, rather than hospital employees, particularly where the bill to the patient for the treatment came from what purported to be the physician\u2019s clinic rather than from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Setterlund\u2019s injury, arising from permitting the defendants to contradict their representations that they were a private partnership and its private employees, was that her lawsuit was dismissed. Thus, her claim for estoppel is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Defendants argue that relief against the physician is barred under <em>Hardesty v. Stenchever.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiff argues that the Washington Supreme Court would not follow that intermediate appellate court decision, but we assume without deciding that it would. Nevertheless, in that case, the estoppel was not established, and in this case it was. Just as the government employee physician benefited from the shield afforded by the claim statute in that case, he is bound by the estoppel to assert the shield in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b766-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-12\">. <em>See </em>RCW 4.96.020.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-13\">. <em>Shafer v.

Because the Clinic's out-of-date and incorrect registration misled Setterlund, and because defendants in their answer and elsewhere showed that the hospital district had notice of the claim from the outset of the litigation, the plaintiff should be permitted on remand to amend her complaint as may be necessary to add the Hospital District as a defendant and otherwise to revise the complaint as may be necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
