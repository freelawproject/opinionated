In 1992 Brewer asked the Wisconsin Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (\u201cDVR\u201d) for help. Under Title I of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 720-765, states (like Wisconsin) that submit to certain regulatory requirements receive federal funding to provide vocational rehabilitation services. <em>See Mallett v. Wis. Div. of Vocational Rehab., </em>130 F.3d 1245, 1247 (7th Cir.1997). The Rehabilitation Act requires vocational rehabilitation counselors to work with eligible participants to jointly develop and agree to individualized rehabilitation programs to achieve employment goals. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 721(a)(9), 722(b)(1)(A). Brewer, who holds a master\u2019s degree, asked the DVR to provide financial assistance for her to attend law school. Brewer\u2019s counselor, however, developed a rehabilitation plan that focused on her returning to work rather than pursuing another degree. Brewer insisted that she wanted to go to law school and, as a result, the two could not agree on a plan. The DVR eventually closed her file.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Brewer brought this action alleging, as relevant here, that the defendants discriminated against her because of her mental illness in violation of \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Brewer also claims that the defendants\u2019 violations of the Rehabilitation Act are actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. She seeks compensatory and punitive damages. A magistrate judge, presiding by consent under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Brewer\u2019s \u00a7 504 claims. The magistrate judge \u25a0 also dismissed Brewer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the DVR and the individual defendants in their official capacities on sovereign immunity grounds, and dismissed her \u00a7 1983 claims that the individual defendants violated her constitutional rights by denying her request for financial assistance to attend law school. <em>See Mallett, </em>130 F.3d at 1253 (section 1983 is not an appropriate means of remedying an isolated violation of an otherwise legal rehabilitation plan). The magistrate judge, however, allowed Brewer to proceed on her claims under \u00a7 1983 that the individual defendants violated the Rehabilitation Act by implementing a policy that disfavors funding for graduate school. A jury later returned a verdict in favor of the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>On appeal Brewer argues that the magistrate judge erred by dismissing her \u00a7 1983 official capacity claims under the Eleventh Amendment. But we need not address immunity. Brewer\u2019s official capacity claims and her claims against the DVR, a state agency, may not proceed because \u00a7 1983 does not authorize damages suits against states. <em>See Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U.S. 765, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000); <em>Power v. Summers, </em>226 F.3d 815, 818 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Brewer also argues that the magistrate judge erred by granting summary judgment on her claims under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \u201cSection 504 is a civil rights provision that prohibits a federal grant recipient from discriminating against otherwise qualified handicapped individuals solely because of that handicap.\u201d <em>Mallett, </em>130 F.3d at 1257. To establish a \u00a7 504 violation, Brewer must demonstrate that (1) she is a handicapped individual as defined by the Rehabilitation Act; (2) she is otherwise qualified for participation; (3) the program receives federal financial assistance; and (4) she was denied the benefits of the program solely because of her handicap. <em>Id. </em>Like the plaintiff in <em>Mallett, </em>Brewer is not \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d to receive vocational benefits from the DVR, <em>i.e., </em>able to meet all of the program\u2019s requirements <em>in spite </em>of her handicap. <em>See id. </em>To the contrary, Brewer would not have been eligible to receive any rehabilitative services in the absence of her handicap. <em>See id. </em>Brewer cannot assert that the defendants violated \u00a7 504 without showing that non-handicapped applicants received the treatment denied to \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d handicapped applicants. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, the magistrate judge did not err in granting summary judgment for the defendants on Brewer\u2019s \u00a7 504 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Brewer also contends that the magistrate judge erred by refusing to order the defendants to turn over their personnel files. We review the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Brewer\u2019s motion to compel for an abuse of discretion, <em>Kalis v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>231 F.3d 1049, 1056 (7th Cir.2000), and will not reverse the judge\u2019s ruling without a clear showing that the denial of discovery resulted in substantial prejudice, <em>Packman v. Chi. Tribune Co., </em>No. 01-1016, 267 F.3d 628, 646-647 (7th Cir.2001). Counsel for the defendants represented to the magistrate judge that the personnel files requested by Brewer did not contain any relevant documents. Therefore, the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Brewer\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Brewer also raises two issue arising from trial. She first challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to allow the individual defendants to submit evidence demonstrating that the DVR had provided funding for other applicants to pursue graduate education. We review the magistrate judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Robbins, </em>197 F.3d 829, 837 (7th Cir.1999). The magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion by allowing the individual defendants to show that the DVR encouraged other applicants to attend graduate or law school; such evidence directly rebutted Brewer\u2019s claim that the DVR systemically discouraged graduate education. Brewer also challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s use of a special verdict question, but there is no indication in the record that she objected to its use to the district court. As a result, she forfeited the argument on appeal and we may not consider the issue even if the court erred in submitting the special verdict question to the jury. <em>See Deppe v. Tripp, </em>863 F.2d 1356, 1361 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
