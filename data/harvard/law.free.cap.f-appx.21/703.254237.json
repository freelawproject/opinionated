Perdew appeals the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Shaun Valiant. Perdew claimed under Section 1983 that Trooper Valiant violated his constitutional rights by arresting him without probable cause on suspicion of driving under the influence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Trooper Valiant stopped Perdew after observing his car weaving on the highway and crossing into an adjacent lane. Valiant questioned Perdew as to whether he had any medical problems, was taking any medications, was under the care of a physician, or had been drinking. Perdew said no. Valiant observed that Perdew\u2019s complexion was flush, a grayish/greenish film coated his tongue, his eyes were red and his pupils reacted slowly to light. Valiant administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Perdew failed; he then administered two standard field sobriety tests, both of which Perdew failed. Perdew then submitted to a field breathalyzer test that returned a negative result for alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">Trooper Valiant then summoned a Drug Recognition Expert (\u201cDRE\u201d) to conduct additional tests on Perdew. The DRE found Perdew\u2019s blood pressure elevated on two separate readings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and observed that Perdew\u2019s eyes were red and glassy, his face was flushed, his coordination was poor, and a green film coated his tongue. The DRE also administered the HGN test and observed a lack of convergence of Perdew\u2019s eyes. Based on his observations, the DRE concluded that Perdew had smoked marihuana. Valiant placed Per-dew under arrest for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs. Subsequent blood and urine tests conducted at the detention facility showed Perdew\u2019s body was devoid of drugs or alcohol at the time of the arrest. Six weeks later, based on these test results, the district attorney dismissed the driving under the influence charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">Perdew subsequently filed the instant Section 1983 claim alleging that Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Valiant violated his constitutional rights by arresting him for driving under the influence without probable cause. Valiant successfully moved for Summary Judgment. Perdew timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Summary judgment is proper when the moving party shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The non-moving party may not rest on the mere allegations in the pleadings, but must set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue of material fact for trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sufficient evidence must exist such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">On appeal, Perdew contends that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding Trooper Valiant\u2019s probable cause to arrest. \u201cProbable cause exists when facts and circumstances within the arresting officer\u2019s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution and prudence in the belief that the defendant is committing or has committed a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based on the facts available to Trooper Valiant, including the information provided by the DEE, at the time of the arrest, we hold that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">In Perdew\u2019s opposition to summary judgment, Perdew attacked Trooper Valiant\u2019s credibility, attributed his poor performance on the field sobriety tests to unfamiliarity with the movements and lack of physical conditioning, and claimed his under-the-influenee-like behavior resulted from driving for an extended period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The record before us is devoid of facts raising a genuine issue of material fact for trial. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment therefore was proper and it is, accordingly, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\">.

Several minutes later, a second reading was 166/106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-16\">. Perdew received additional citations for failure to have proof of insurance, having expired registration, and failure to maintain travel lane. Upon showing proof of insurance and valid registration at the time of arrest, the district attorney dismissed those charges. The district attorney dismissed the remaining charge for failure to maintain travel lane on the ground that forcing Perdew to travel from his home in Indiana to Nevada to stand trial did not serve the interest of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">. <em>Warren v.
