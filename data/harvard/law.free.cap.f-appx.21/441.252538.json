Quist, United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan; sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Jerry Lee Jones, a pro se federal prisoner, appeals from a district court judgment denying Jones\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Jones also moves for in forma pauperis status. Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, he claimed that the Bureau of Prisons improperly denied him the right to a sentence reduction after he successfully completed a drug treatment program. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a) (2000). The district court initially filed a memorandum opinion and order granting the petition. Before the entry of judgment, the district court rescinded the memorandum opinion and order and entered judgment for the warden based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In the district court and on appeal, Jones claims that the <em>Lopez </em>case should not apply retroactively to his case, citing <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). The district court distinguished <em>Teague </em>because it involved a rule of criminal procedure, not a Bureau of Prisons\u2019 regulation. The district court\u2019s analysis of this claim was proper. When the Supreme Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it in a civil case, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases that are still open. <em>Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 97, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <em>In re Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>44 F.3d 1310, 1317-18 (6th Cir.1995). Because the district court had not entered judgment in Jones\u2019s case, the case was still open; the district court properly applied the <em>Lopez </em>decision to deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Jones also raises arguments based on the cases of <em>Schering Corp. v. Shalala, </em>995 F.2d 1103 (D.C.Cir.1993), and <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). Because Jones did not raise these arguments in the district court, this court is precluded from reviewing them, <em>United States v. Means, </em>133 F.3d 444, 447 (6th Cir.1998). This court may exercise its discretion to review such issues in an exceptional case or to avoid a miscarriage of justice, <em>id., </em>but we conclude that neither of these exceptions is applicable to Jones\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">The motion for in forma pauperis status is granted solely for the purpose of deciding this appeal, and the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
