Razo had been deported after serving a 60-month prison term for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). As a result of his prior conviction he faced a maximum prison term of 20 years, rather than the two-year default maximum. <em>Compare </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-25\">On appeal Razo maintains that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the prior conviction used to support the increased maximum was not charged in the indictment. The Supreme Court has held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>otherwise; the recidivist enhancement found in \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor, not an element of the offense, and there exists no constitutional requirement that it be treated as something more. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Relying on <em>Apprendi, </em>Razo questions the continued validity of Almendarez-Torres,. but as we have repeatedly stated, we do not read <em>Apprendi </em>as having overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Dahler v. United States, </em>259 F.3d 763, 765-66 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Skidmore, </em>254 F.3d 635, 642 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Brough, </em>243 F.3d 1078, 1081 (7th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
