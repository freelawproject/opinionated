Rodriguez argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court violated his right to equal protection by imposing the statutory maximum prison term when it would have allowed a person with financial means an opportunity to attend a private drug rehabilitation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-26\">Because this claim was not raised before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999). <em>See also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (plain error is \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and the fairness of the district court\u2019s proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The record does not establish that the Rodriguez would have received a lighter sentence had he been able to pay for a private inpatient treatment program. At the revocation hearing, the district court questioned whether Rodriguez would be able to succeed at \u201cone more drug treatment program.\u201d Rodriguez had failed at two prior inpatient treatment programs while on supervised release. The judge noted that the only chance for Rodriguez\u2019s rehabilitation was \u201cto put [him] back in prison ... under circumstances where [he could] get this intense treatment.\u201d The district court could reasonably conclude that the best hope for Rodriguez\u2019s rehabilitation would be a possible enrollment in the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 intensive treatment program. The district court did not say that, if a private rehabilitation program had been a viable option, it would have imposed a shorter sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">There is no substantial evidence in the record supporting the speculative factual premise of Rodriguez\u2019s equal protection claim. The district court did not commit plain error in imposing sentence when revoking Rodriguez\u2019s term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
