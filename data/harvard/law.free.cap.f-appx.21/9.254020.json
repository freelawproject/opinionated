When those charges were dropped, plaintiff responded with the instant 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, filed pro se and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>alleging violation of his constitutional rights. Named as defendants were Bullock and the Dorchester district court (the venue for the aborted criminal proceedings). The district court reviewed the complaint prior to service of process, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), and discerned no arguable legal basis for plaintiff\u2019s claims. After spelling out the deficiencies in the complaint, the court gave plaintiff 35 days to show cause why it should not be dismissed. Plaintiff filed no response (or any other pleading) within that time \u2014 he admits on appeal that he \u201crefused\u201d to respond because of his disagreement with the court\u2019s analysis \u2014 and the case was accordingly dismissed with prejudice. Only later, in conjunction with a timely motion to amend judgment, and without any explanation for his tardiness, did plaintiff finally submit a response to the show-cause order. That motion was summarily denied, and plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">We affirm. By itself, plaintiffs unexplained failure to respond in timely fashion to the show-cause order would provide a sufficient basis for upholding the dismissal. Nor did the district court err in concluding that the complaint was \u201cfrivolous or malicious\u201d or \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Plaintiff asserts that the criminal-trespass charges were unfounded, in that he fell within a statutory exception involving \u201ctenants or occupants of residential premises.\u201d Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, \u00a7 120(\u00b6 2). Even if so, the Dorchester district court, which is a state entity, is immune from \u00a7 1983 liability for the reasons enumerated by the district court; the cases involving municipal agencies on which plaintiff relies are inapposite. In turn, plaintiff has provided no factual support for his suggestion that Bullock, by conspiring with the arresting officers, was herself acting \u201cunder color\u201d of law for \u00a7 1983 purposes. The district court afforded plaintiff ample opportunity to amend his complaint in order to correct these various shortcomings. As mentioned, plaintiff chose not to respond. Nor has he set forth any supplemental allegations, either in his untimely response to the show-cause order or in his brief on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>appeal, that would enable him to surmount the \u00a7 1915(e)(2) hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Plaintiff also contends that the district court\u2019s rulings called its impartiality into question and so warranted its recusal \u2014 an allegation we reject on its face as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
