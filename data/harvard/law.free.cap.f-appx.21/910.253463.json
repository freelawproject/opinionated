Choice Hotels International, Inc., </em>117 F.Supp.2d 1341, 1344-45 (S.D.Fla.2000), finding that Phonometrics had failed to raise a genuine issue concerning the infringement of U.S. Patent No. 3,769,463 (the \u201c \u2019463 patent\u201d). Because we have already held that claim 1 of the \u2019463 patent does indeed claim a device that gives callers cost information both <em>during </em>and after a long-distance call has ended, <em>see Phonometrics, Inc. v. Northern Telecom Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1459, 1465 (Fed.Cir.1998), and because Phonometrics has not even attempted to show that the features of the accused device meet this limitation, we <em>affirm </em>the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">We need not provide many of the details underlying this case, for we have already described and construed part of the \u2019463 patent in our previous opinions. <em>See generally id. </em>at 1464-66; <em>Intellicall, Inc. v. Phonometrics, </em>Inc., 952 F.2d 1384 (Fed.Cir.1992). Indeed, we held in <em>Northern Telecom </em>that the limitation \u201csubstantially instantaneous\u201d meant the phone display device claimed by the \u2019463 patent must give callers information about the cost of their long-distance call both during the call and after the call had ended. See 133 F.3d at 1465. We stated this holding no less than four times. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">This case involves the interpretation of the same limitation in the same claim in the same patent. Citing our decision in <em>Northern Telecom, </em>the trial court ruled that since no evidence showed that Choice Hotels\u2019 accused device similarly provided cost information <em>during </em>a call, Choice Hotels warranted summary judgment. On appeal, Phonometrics does not point to any record evidence showing that the accused device also provides cost information during a call. Instead, it characterizes our earlier construction of the \u201csubstantially instantaneous\u201d limitation as \u201cpure dictum\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10) or \u201cunnecessary dictum\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">This contention is simply baffling. We <em>held </em>in <em>Northern Telecom </em>that \u201csubstantially instantaneous\u201d meant the patented phone device gave a caller cost information \u201cthroughout the duration of the call,\u201d 133 F.3d at 1459, \u201cat all times <em>during </em>the call,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis in original), \u201cduring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>call,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201cnot only once the call has ended,\u201d <em>see id. </em>In other words, we have already addressed and answered the precise question presented in this appeal. Nor will we entertain new arguments such as alleged inoperability of the invention when the claims are construed as we have construed them, because all such arguments about the meaning of \u201csubstantially simultaneous\u201d either were or could have been made in the earlier appeals. Under principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>moreover, future panels like the present panel will follow the claim construction set forth by our court in the two decisions cited above and, therefore, we would not welcome further appeals seeking to re-litigate the meaning of that phrase. Indeed, further appeal on that issue would appear to be subject to possible sanctions as frivolously filed under Fed. R.App. P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Accordingly, we discern no error with the trial court\u2019s judgment and therefore affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
