We have carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and affirm the district court judgment for essentially the reasons stated in that court\u2019s Memorandum and Order, dated January 8, 2001. We add only the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">1. The conclusions of Dr. May Louie, claimant\u2019s treating physician, that claimant\u2019s Charcot Marie Tooth disease meets the listing for peripheral neuropathies and that claimant is disabled are not binding on the Commissioner as these determinations are reserved solely for the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(e)(1) and (e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">2. As for claimant\u2019s argument that she cannot perform the full range of sedentary work due to both exertional and non-exertional limitations, there are conflicts in the evidence. Claimant\u2019s own testimony at the hearing was contradictory and Dr. Lome\u2019s assessment of claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC) is inconsistent with her observations of claimant as recorded in her office notes. Other evidence inconsistent with the opinion of Dr. Louie can be found in the report of Dr. Alan Mandell and in the other RFC assessments in the record. This evidence, contrary to claimant\u2019s contention, is entitled to be credited by the Commissioner. <em>See Rodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>819 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam). Because conflicts are for the Commissioner to resolve, not the courts, <em>Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1981), the judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
