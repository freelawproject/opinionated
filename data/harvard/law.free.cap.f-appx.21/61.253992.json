The district court dismissed on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that Buckley failed to show the existence of a liberty interest. On appeal, Buckley principally challenges the dismissal; he also contends that the district court erred in refusing to appoint counsel for him and in refusing to allow him to file a second amended complaint. We see no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-24\">We affirm the dismissal of the action on its merits substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Seybert\u2019s Memorandum and Order dated May 14, 1999, adopting the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold dated March 31, 1999. <em>See also Barna v. Travis, </em>239 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>F.3d 169, 170-71 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">As to plaintiffs contention that the court should have granted his belated request to file a second amended complaint, we affirm that denial substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Seybert\u2019s Memorandum and Order dated December 29, 1997, adopting Magistrate Judge Gold\u2019s Report and Recommendation dated November 7, 1997. We see no abuse of discretion, <em>see, e.g., Cresswell v. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, </em>922 F.2d 60, 72 (2d Cir.1990); <em>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. v. Employers Insurance of Wausau, </em>786 F.2d 101, 103 (2d Cir.1986), in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Nor do we see any abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel to represent Buckley in this action. <em>See generally Pena v. Choo, </em>826 F.2d 168, 168-69 (2d Cir.1987) (per curiam); <em>Hodge v. Police Officers, </em>802 F.2d 58, 60 (2d Cir.1986); <em>Miller v. Pleasure, </em>296 F.2d 283, 284-85 (2d Cir.1961) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 U.S. 964, 82 S.Ct. 1592, 8 L.Ed.2d 830 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We have considered all of Buckley\u2019s arguments on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
