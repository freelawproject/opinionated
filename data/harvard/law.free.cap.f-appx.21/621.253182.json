We granted a certificate of appealability as to whether Loveland\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview two percipient witnesses constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(c), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">To prevail under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Loveland must demonstrate that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. Loveland cannot prove prejudice. Even if it was deficient performance for Loveland\u2019s counsel not to interview the Butterfields, their additional testimony would not have affected the outcome. First, the Butterfields did not witness the entire incident; rather, they saw the struggle <em>after </em>the first volley of gunfire. Second, although they did not see a gun in Loveland\u2019s hand, their declarations are consistent with Michael Butterfield\u2019s trial testimony that he did not \u201cnotice\u201d Love-land\u2019s hands. Third, the Butterfields\u2019s declaration that the trial re-enactment was nothing like what they had witnessed lacks probative value because they did not witness the entire altercation and it is completely devoid of detail. Fourth, Michael Butterfield\u2019s testimony at trial, which he has not recanted in his declaration, is entirely consistent with the prosecution\u2019s theory. Because Loveland was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to interview the Butterfields, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
