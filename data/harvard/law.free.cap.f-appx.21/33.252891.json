Ryan appeals from the February 7, 2000 judgment of the district court adopting the magistrate\u2019s Report Recommendation and denying Ryan\u2019s habeas corpus petition, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In his habeas petition, Ryan sought appointment of counsel and to vacate his 1995 conviction for one count of assault in the first degree and one count of leaving the scene of an accident without reporting, for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six and one-third to nineteen years. On December 29, 2000, this court appointed counsel and granted Ryan\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-25\">Ryan\u2019s conviction arises from an incident in Albany, New York in which he struck a former girlfriend, Patricia Cum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>mings, by car and then fled the scene. Although Ryan told his trial counsel that he was in Schnectady, New York with two friends when the incident occurred and that the two friends, William Garrity and John Hoffman, would testify to that effect, his counsel apparently did not interview the proposed alibi witnesses or call them to testify at Ryan\u2019s trial. In his federal habeas petition to the district court, Ryan unsuccessfully argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel\u2019s failure to adequately investigate and call these alibi witnesses constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">This court granted a certificate of appealability in connection with the following issues: (1) whether the district court had a proper factual basis for its determination that trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to call two alibi witnesses at trial; and (2) whether trial counsel\u2019s decision not to call the two alibi witnesses was reasonable and, if unreasonable, whether petitioner was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s errors such that petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">At the outset, we note that the district court had a proper factual basis for its determination of the effectiveness of Ryan\u2019s trial counsel. Specifically, the district court had before it a letter from one of the proposed alibi witnesses detailing his encounter with Ryan\u2019s trial counsel, motion papers from a state court proceeding that described the information received and efforts taken by Ryan\u2019s trial counsel with regard to the alibi witnesses, and the trial record. These sources were sufficient to enable the district court to \u201cfully resolve [the] ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d <em>Foster v. Ward, </em>182 F.3d 1177, 1184 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Though we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas petition, <em>Washington v. Schriver, </em>255 F.3d 45, 52 (2d Cir.2001), Ryan faces two obstacles. First, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), in order to obtain a writ of habeas corpus Ryan must show that the state court\u2019s decision rejecting his ineffective assistance claim \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Second, in order to establish that his trial counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective, Ryan must show that the representation (1) was not within the standards of objectively reasonable conduct and that it (2) prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In assessing whether the conduct of Ryan\u2019s trial counsel was reasonable, \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Moreover, when a party challenges matters of trial strategy, such as the decision not to call a witness, even greater deference is generally warranted: \u201c[A]n appellate court on a cold record should not second-guess such decisions unless there is no strategic or tactical justification for the course taken.\u201d <em>United States v. Luciano, </em>158 F.3d 655, 660 (2d Cir.1998). We find that Ryan cannot meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In this case, the record shows that Ryan\u2019s trial counsel made a strategic decision in declining to call Ryan\u2019s proposed alibi witnesses. As was noted by the magistrate in his Report Recommendation, Ryan\u2019s counsel spoke with the proposed alibi witnesses before trial and told them that he would not call them to testify because the prosecution \u201cwould tear [them] apart.\u201d We are not inclined to second-guess this strategic decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>On appeal, Ryan seeks to undermine the reasonableness of this decision by arguing that his counsel failed to adequately investigate his alibi defense by, among other things, not interviewing the proposed witnesses. Although this court has indicated that the failure to interview a proposed alibi witness is unreasonable in some circumstances, <em>see, e.g., Pavel v. Hollins, </em>261 F.3d 210, 220-22 (2d Cir.2001), it is also true that \u201cwhen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691. Here, Ryan\u2019s counsel asked Ryan to obtain statements from the witnesses which, together with what Ryan had told him and the police reports obtained by discovery, provided counsel with sufficient information to conclude, as he apparently did, that the alibi witnesses were not credible or that their testimony would harm Ryan more than it would help him. Thus, we find that Ryan\u2019s trial counsel fulfilled his \u201cduty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given this conclusion, we certainly cannot find that the state court\u2019s findings were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Because we find that the conduct of Ryan\u2019s trial counsel was reasonable, we do not need to address the question of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
