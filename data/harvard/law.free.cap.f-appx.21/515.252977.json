Based on undisputed testimony, the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> found the cards were used to charge between $1.3 and $1.5 million, and it used this amount of actual loss to the victim bank to increase Leonard\u2019s base offense level by 11 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)(L) (specific offense characteristics for crimes involving fraud). Leonard does not dispute the dollar amount charged on the stolen cards, but argues that the loss was not properly attributed to him because it was not reasonably foreseeable that his former girlfriend would emboss some of the cards and sell them. When determining the amount of loss under \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(14), however, the district court may use actual loss or intended loss, whichever is greater. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>18 F.3d 562, 570 (8th Cir.1994). The amount of loss in a case involving stolen credit cards includes \u201cany unauthorized charges\u201d made with those cards. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 n. 17. Thus, the district court did not commit clear error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>basing the amount of loss resulting from Leonard\u2019s possession of the cards on the actual loss to the victim bank. <em>See id. </em>(standard of review). Having pleaded guilty to possessing the stolen cards, Leonard was properly held responsible for the amounts charged on them. We thus affirm Leonard\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-18\"> The Honorable Joseph F.
