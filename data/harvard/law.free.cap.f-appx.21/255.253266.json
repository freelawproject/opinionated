Slorp Construction and Joseph Brown infringed the plaintiffs (Oberer Development Company (\u201cOberer\u201d)) Freedom home design copyright. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-20\">Oberer sued Joseph Brown alleging that Brown infringed Oberer\u2019s Freedom home design copyright, in violation of the Copyright Act of 1976, by copying the Freedom home design and producing plans and drawings for residential structures substantially similar to Oberer\u2019s Freedom home design. Oberer sued Slorp alleging that Slorp copied the Freedom home design by producing two residences which were substantially similar to Oberer\u2019s Freedom home design. The case proceeded to trial, without a jury, before Magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>trate Judge Merz with the parties\u2019 consent pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). Magistrate Judge Merz found for Oberer and entered judgment against Rick Slorp and Brown, jointly and severally, in the amount of $5,000 and permanently enjoined each of them from producing any drawings, plans, or structures, derived therefrom, which incorporate any copyrighted design of Oberer. Magistrate Judge Merz also awarded Oberer attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Rick Slorp timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">We review Magistrate Judge Merz\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Labor v. Cole Enters., Inc., </em>62 F.3d 775, 778 (6th Cir.1995). A factual finding is clearly erroneous only if the reviewing court has a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>149 F.3d 494, 499 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Upon review, we conclude that sufficient evidence exists in the record to support Magistrate Judge Merz\u2019s determination that Slorp and Brown willfully infringed Oberer\u2019s copyright in the Freedom home design. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a), 504(c)(2); <em>Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., </em>499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991). The remaining arguments on appeal lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
