However, she failed to show a causal link.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Wheeler demonstrated that the July 1997 incident of alleged retaliation took place \u201cclose on the heels\u201d of her contact with the EEO office in May 1997. <em>Ray v. Henderson, </em>217 F.3d 1234, 1244 (9th Cir.2000). However, she did not show that J.P. Morgan knew of her contacts with the EEO at the time of the July conflict. <em>See Cohen v. Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir.1982). Morgan denied such knowledge in two affidavits filed with the EEO and a declaration filed with the district court. Although Wheeler claimed Morgan lied, she did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Morgan knew of her EEO contacts at the time of the July incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">Wheeler argued that Morgan\u2019s statement in his affidavit about the July incident that he \u201chad no knowledge of any EEO activity by Ms. Wheeler\u201d could not be true because he had earlier completed an affidavit about the May 24th conflict. However, read in context, his affidavit referencing the July conflict refers to Morgan\u2019s knowledge as of the July 1997 incident. The evidence Wheeler presented to support her theory that Morgan lied was not \u201csuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict\u201d in her favor on her retaliation claim. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). For her claim to survive summary judgment Wheeler must have produced some \u201csignificant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.\u201d <em>T.W. Elec. Serv. Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). Since Wheeler did not present evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that Morgan knew of her EEO contact, summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">Even if Wheeler made out a prima facie case of retaliation, the Postmaster presented a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions which Wheeler failed to demonstrate was pretextual. She presented no direct evidence to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>port her retaliation theory. She also produced essentially no evidence to discredit the Postmaster\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. \u201c[W]hen evidence to refute the defendant\u2019s legitimate explanation is totally lacking, summary judgment is appropriate even though plaintiff may have established a minimal <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 890-91 (9th Cir.1994). Since Wheeler did not show pretext the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was appropriate on this ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-13\">.
