Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss John P. McGrath\u2019s petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. McGrath has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-20\">The Merit Systems Protection Board affirmed OPM\u2019s disallowance of McGrath\u2019s application for disability benefits. McGrath petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-21\">Although we generally have subject matter jurisdiction over a petition for review of a Board affirmance of an OPM disability benefit denial, our review is limited by statute. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(2). In his informal brief, McGrath challenges only the factual determination that he did not show that he is disabled for purposes of receiving disability benefits. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347 and <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985), this court has no jurisdiction to review that issue. <em>See Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620 (\u201cthe factual underpinnings of [5 U.S.C.] \u00a7 8347 disability determinations may not be judicially reviewed\u201d); <em>Anthony v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>58 F.3d 620, 626 (Fed.Cir.1995) (holding this court\u2019s review of disability determinations limited to deciding whether \u201cthere has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights\u201d or error of law; and precluded as to factual underpinnings).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-23\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b932-24\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b932-25\">(1) OPM\u2019s motion to waive Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-26\">(2) OPM\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-27\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
