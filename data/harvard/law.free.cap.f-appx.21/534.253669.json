Balliet\u2019s property is bounded on one side by property owned by Eddie Ward Jones, Mark Anthony Jones, and Tammy Jones (the Joneses) and on the remaining three sides by property owned by the United States, including portions of the Buffalo National River.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court granted the United States\u2019 summary judgment motion after Balliet failed to respond and dismissed Balliet\u2019s third-party complaint against the Joneses. Thereafter, Balliet filed the Rule 60(b) motions that are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s denial of Balliet\u2019s Rule 60(b)(1) motion which he founded upon an allegation of judicial error. <em>See Richards v. Aramark Servs., Inc., </em>108 F.3d 925, 927 (8th Cir.1997) (standard of review); <em>CRI, Inc. v. Watson, </em>608 F.2d 1137, 1143 (8th Cir.1979) (\u201c[R]elief may be granted under Rule 60(b)(1) for judicial error when inadvertence is shown.\u201d). Nor do we find an abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s denial of Balliet\u2019s motion to amend. <em>See Parnes v. Gateway 2000, Inc., </em>122 F.3d 539, 550-51 (8th Cir.1997) (reviewing a post-dismissal motion to amend under an abuse-of-discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny the United States\u2019 motion to strike the Joneses\u2019 brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-19\">. The Honorable H.
