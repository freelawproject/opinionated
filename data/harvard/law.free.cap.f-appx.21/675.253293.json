R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b705-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-24\">Minh Ha Lam appeals his 130-month sentence imposed following a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-25\">Lam contends that the district court erred by denying the additional one-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(1), because he admitted all elements of a conspiracy to commit robbery. <em>Cf. United States v. Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d 973, 980 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 898, 121 S.Ct. 231, 148 L.Ed.2d 165 (2000) (concluding that additional one-point reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(1) warranted where defendant admits elements of illegal re-entry offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326). Because the district court granted the two-level adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1(a), the additional one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>level adjustment was mandatory if Lam timely provided complete information to the government concerning his involvement in the offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(1); <em>United States v. CoronaGarcia, </em>210 F.3d at 980. We review this determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Blanco-Gallegos, </em>188 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Upon review of the record, we deem Lam\u2019s contention unpersuasive. The district court found Lam\u2019s admission incomplete. That finding is not clearly erroneous, and the district court therefore properly denied the extra one-level adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
