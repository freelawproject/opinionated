Swann appeals the district court\u2019s order granting judgment as a mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ter of law to Plaintiff in this collection action for default on a student loan. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A review of the record discloses that in response to Swann\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, which was supported by a sworn Certificate of Indebtedness, Plaintiff moved for judgment as a matter of law. Citing Swann\u2019s failure to present evidence, the district court granted Plaintiffs motion. We find that Plaintiffs motion for judgment as a matter of law was not properly before the district court under Fed. R.Civ.P. 50 or 52, and was in fact a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">A motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless proper notice is provided under <em>Roseboro v. Garrison, </em>528 F.2d 309, 310 (4th Cir.1975). <em>Roseboro </em>prohibits the entry of summary judgment based on a pro se party\u2019s failure to submit affidavits supporting his allegations unless such party is given a reasonable opportunity to file counter-affidavits or other appropriate materials and is informed that failure to file such a response may result in dismissal of the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Swann did not submit any affidavits in support of his claims to survive Plaintiffs de facto summary judgment motion. The district court granted Plaintiffs motion, in part, based on Swann\u2019s failure to produce such supporting evidence. On this record, we cannot find that the district court\u2019s failure to provide <em>Roseboro </em>notice was harmless error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order granting judgment as a matter of law to Plaintiff and remand this case to the district court with instructions to provide Swann with the notice and opportunity to respond to which he is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. The reason for remand is entirely procedural and is unrelated to the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
