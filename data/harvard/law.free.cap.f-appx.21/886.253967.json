KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Plaintiff-appellant Susan E. Early appeals from the district court\u2019s order (1) dismissing her complaint against the defendants pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e); (2) denying her motion to set her case for jury trial; and (3) denying her motion for leave to amend her complaint to add an additional defendant. Having carefully reviewed the record and the briefs filed in this court in light of the applicable law, we have determined that the district court\u2019s order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is therefore AFFIRMED for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order of December 22, 2000. Plaintiffs motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis is GRANTED. Her petition for writ of mandamus is DENIED. All other pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b917-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
