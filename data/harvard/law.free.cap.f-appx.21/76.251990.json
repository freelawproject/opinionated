By order dated August 25, 1997 the district court, pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), dismissed all of appellant\u2019s claims, after which Boyle filed a second Amended Complaint dated September 25, 1997, seeking to state claims for copyright infringement, quantum meruit, and breach of contract of bailment. No. 97 Civ. 135(SAS) (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 1997). By order dated December 5, 1997 the district court denied Boyle\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), and dismissed Boyle\u2019s claims for copyright infringement, but declined at that juncture to dismiss his claims for unjust enrichment and breach of a contract of bailment. No. 97 Civ. 135(SAS) (S.D.N.Y. February 23, 1998). On September 29, 1998, the district court granted summary judgement in favor of defendants on the claims remaining. 97 Civ. 1351(SAS) (S.D.N.Y.
