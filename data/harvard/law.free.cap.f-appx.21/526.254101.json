Brewer, </em>No. 97-1623, 1998 WL 42475 (8th Cir. Feb. 4, 1998) (unpublished per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 834, 119 S.Ct. 90, 142 L.Ed.2d 71 (Oct. 5, 1998). In August 2000, Mr. Brewer filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), applied retroactively to his otherwise untimely motion, and that he was sentenced beyond the authorized statutory maximum terms of imprisonment on his drug and gun convictions, where the drug type and quantity were not charged in the indictment, and the jury was not asked to determine the drug quantity for which he was accountable. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied relief, Mr. Brewer appeals, and we affirm. <em>See United States v. Moss, </em>252 F.3d 993, 999-1003 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-13\">. The Honorable Charles R.
