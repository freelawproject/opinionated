After carefully reviewing the briefs and record below, we <em>affirm </em>the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-16\">The issues on appeal center around two questions: (1) whether, as of September 30, 1997, the date he was last insured, claimant had the exertional capability to perform sedentary work, and (2) whether the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the Medical Vocational Guidelines (the \u201cGrid\u201d), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, was improper in light of his finding that claimant suffered from significant nonexertional limitations. Claimant also contends that the ALJ improperly discounted his subjective complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-17\">I. <em>Exertional Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-18\">We conclude that there was ample support in the record for the ALJ\u2019s assessment of appellant\u2019s exertional capabilities. Although claimant\u2019s treating physician concluded that he was disabled, that is an issue reserved for the Commissioner. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1); <em>Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>955 F.2d 765, 769 (1st Cir.1991); <em>Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir .1981). Moreover, the treating doctor\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with other evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>dence in the record including treatment notes and evaluations performed by both examining and non-examining physicians, and the record as a whole was adequate to support the findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ward v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>211 F.3d 652, 655 (1st Cir.2000); <em>Rodriguez, </em>647 F.2d at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The same can be said for the ALJ\u2019s findings concerning the appellant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. Although claimant suffered from \u201ca clinically determinable medical impairment\u201d \u2014 tenosynovitis and myositis \u2014 \u201cthat can reasonably be expected to produce the pain alleged,\u201d <em>Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>797 F.2d 19, 21 (1st Cir.1986), there was also evidence to the contrary, and the ALJ personally observed claimant at the hearing. \u201c[W]e pay particular attention to an ALJ\u2019s evaluation of complaints of pain in light of their subjective nature .\u201d <em>Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>890 F.2d 520, 523 (1st Cir.1989) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">II. <em>Nonexertional Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Claimant\u2019s nonexertional impairments present only a slightly closer question. Where a claimant has a nonexertional impairment in addition to an exertional limit, the decision to rely on the Grid to sustain the Commissioner\u2019s burden of proof depends upon whether the claimant\u2019s nonexertional impairments significantly affects his ability to perform the full range of jobs at the relevant exertional level. <em>See Rose v. Shalala, </em>34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir.1994); <em>Heggarty v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 990, 996 (1st Cir.1991); <em>Ortiz, </em>890 F.2d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Here, the ALJ found that claimant had a \u201csignificant\u201d nonexertional limitations that made it \u201cimpossible for him to perform tasks requiring constant overhead reaching and engage in complex, non routine and skilled tasks.\u201d However, the ALJ determined that claimant\u2019s capacity for the full range of (unskilled) sedentary work was not significantly compromised, and, using Rule 201.23 of the Grid as a \u201cframework,\u201d concluded that claimant was not disabled. Because the ALJ reached this determination without taking any vocational testimony, he is deemed to have relied exclusively on the Grid to show that jobs that claimant could perform existed in the national economy. <em>See Ortiz, </em>890 F.2d at 524 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">A. <em>Mental Restriction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">The relevant medical evidence shows that claimant suffered from \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d major depression, and exhibited symptoms of nervousness, anxiety, somatic difficulties, chest pain, and hypertension. Claimant\u2019s treating physician noted that he frequently had trouble understanding instructions. A treating psychiatrist and a consulting psychiatrist evaluated claimant and reported that claimant had a relatively normal mental status except for a depressed mood, poor concentration, poor recent memory, and diminished judgment and insight. Psychiatric RFC assessments and Psychiatric Review Technique Forms (\u201cPRTF\u201d) rated claimant as moderately limited in his activities of daily living and in several work-related areas of functioning, but only slightly or not significantly limited in all other areas of functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">In his decision, the ALJ expressly adopted the opinions of the psychiatrists who rated claimant\u2019s abilities to do work-related activities. To the extent claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>treating physician\u2019s opinion that claimant was unable to work is inconsistent with those reports, we note that the treating doctor is not a psychiatrist and that, in any case, her opinion on the ultimate issue of disability is not controlling. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1); <em>Irlanda Ortiz, </em>955 F.2d at 769; <em>Rodriguez, </em>647 F.2d at 222. Accordingly, we think that the ALJ was justified in relying on the expert medical opinions of the state psychiatrists, and his decision demonstrates that he gave due consideration to the effect of claimant\u2019s mental impairment on his capacity for unskilled work. Further, since the RFC and PRTF reports indicate that claimant was at the most moderately limited in areas of functioning required for unskilled work, we conclude that they adequately substantiate the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s mental impairment did not affect, more than marginally, the relevant occupational base.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">B. <em>Reaching Restriction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Finally, with respect to claimant\u2019s limitation on reaching, we recognize that, since reaching is an activity required in almost all unskilled jobs, significant limitations on reaching may eliminate a large number of occupations a person could otherwise do. <em>See </em>Social Security Ruling 85-15, <em>Titles II and XVI </em>\u2014 Capability <em>to do Other Work </em>\u2014 The <em>Medical Vocational Rules as a Framework for Evaluating Solely Nonexertional Impairments </em>(S.S.A. 1985), available in 1985 WL 56857. In this case, the ALJ did not find that claimant\u2019s overall ability to reach was significantly affected. Rather, the ALJ concluded that claimant was unable to perform only tasks requiring \u201cconstant overhead reaching with the left arm.\u201d Since this specific ability is only a narrow subset of the full range of reaching, and the evidence as a whole does not suggest that the ALJ\u2019s characterization of claimant\u2019s limitation was understated, we think the ALJ was justified in concluding that claimant\u2019s reaching restriction had only a marginal effect on the relevant occupational base. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s use of the Grid was proper and no further vocational evidence was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\"><em>Affirmed. </em>Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\">. For the same reason, we reject claimant\u2019s contention that the AU erred in failing to give controlling weight to his treating physician's opinion. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2); <em>Rodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>819 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1987); <em>Lizotte v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>654 F.2d 127, 130 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
