Insurance Company\u2019s claim for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">We agree that Mendez fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Varner\u2019s ostensible agency. \u201c[Tjhere are three requirements necessary before recovery may be had against a principal for the act of an ostensible agent. The person dealing with the agent must do so with belief in the agent\u2019s authority and this belief must be a reasonable one; such belief must be generated by some act or neglect of the principal sought to be charged; and the third person in relying on the agent\u2019s apparent authority must not be guilty of negligence.\u201d <em>Associated Creditors\u2019 Agency v. Davis, </em>13 Cal.3d 374, 399, 118 Cal.Rptr. 772, 788, 530 P.2d 1084 (1975); Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 2300; Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2334. Mendez raises a triable issue of fact as to <em>his </em>reasonable belief that Varner was an agent of T.H.E., and Mendez\u2019s failure to read and complete the application form before signing it does not constitute negligence in ascertaining Varner\u2019s status as an agent. However, Mendez cannot point to a sufficient act or omission <em>by T.H.E. </em>before the Flagg accident that led Mendez to believe that Var<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ner was in fact T.H.E.\u2019s agent. It is insufficient that T.H.E. made its proprietary insurance application forms available to Varner. Because Mendez fails to raise a triable issue of fact as to T.H.E.\u2019s conduct generating a reasonable belief in Varner\u2019s purported agency, Mendez cannot sustain his claim that Varner was the ostensible agent of T.H.E. and the counterclaims for breach of contract, reformation and breach of insurance policy, as reformed, negligent concealment and misrepresentation, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty must fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Because the policy covered only two trucks, neither one of which was involved in the Flagg accident, the face of the policy unambiguously barred a claim based on that accident. Accordingly, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing did not require T.H.E. to conduct any further investigation. <em>See, e.g., Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 36, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 390, 900 P.2d 619 (1995); <em>Brinderson-Newberg Joint Venture v. Pacific Erectors, Inc., </em>971 F.2d 272, 282 (9th Cir.1992). As a matter of law, T.H.E. did not violate its duty to act in good faith. <em>See, e.g., Lunsford v. American Guar. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>18 F.3d 653, 656 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this Circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
