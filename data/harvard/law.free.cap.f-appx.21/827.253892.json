MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">Appellant Ewing Hirata Vise pleaded guilty to drug and firearm charges. Vise challenges his sentencing under the United States Sentencing Guidelines on the ground that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>requires all facts relevant to sentencing under the guidelines be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Because a panel of this court has already rejected the applicability of <em>Apprendi </em>to the Sentencing Guidelines, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b857-24\">Ewing Hirata Vise pleaded guilty to manufacturing methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and possession of a firearm as a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On the drug count, he was given a life sentence under the mandatory sentencing provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>based on the quantity of drugs involved in prior drug convictions. Mr. Vise received a concurrent ten year sentence on the firearm count.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Vise appealed the sentence. During the pendency of the appeal, this court decided in <em>United States v. Santos </em>that the mandatory sentencing provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) apply only by consideration of the drug amount for the current conviction, not \u201crelevant conduct\u201d drug quantities. 195 F.3d 549 (10th Cir.1999). Vise\u2019s drug sentence was vacated and the case remanded to the district court for resentencing. <em>United States v. Vise, </em>211 F.3d 1279, 2000 WL 485174 (10th Cir.2000) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Just after remand, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>held that \u201cany fact which increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 120 S.Ct. at 2362. The district court ordered briefing on the impact of <em>Apprendi </em>on Vise\u2019s sentencing. Vise did not provide the district court with briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The district court resentenced Vise. The guideline sentence range was 155 -188 months. Vise received 188 months in prison and 6 years supervised release on the drug charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Vise contends that <em>Apprendi </em>requires that any factor which increases his guideline sentence range be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Vise did not present this argument to the district court. Normally, failing to make below a specific objection to sentencing precludes appellate review. <em>United States v. Gilkey, </em>118 F.3d 702, 704 (10th Cir.1997). Because, however, the applicability of <em>Apprendi </em>to the sentencing guidelines is \u201c \u2018a legal question involving application\u2019 \u201d of the guidelines, we review the sentence for plain error. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ciapponi, </em>77 F.3d 1247, 1252 (10th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">In <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>this court held that <em>Apprendi </em>\u201cdoes not apply to sentencing factors that increase a defendant\u2019s guideline range but do not increase the statutory maximum.\u201d 255 F.3d 1256, 1265 (10th Cir.2001). Vise concedes that <em>Sullivan </em>is dispositive, but wishes to raise the question of the applicability of <em>Apprendi </em>to preserve the issue for appeal to the United States Supreme Court. This panel can not overrule circuit precedent. <em>Berry v. Stevinson Chevrolet, </em>74 F.3d 980, 985 (10th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the sentence was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">The sentence imposed by the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b857-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
