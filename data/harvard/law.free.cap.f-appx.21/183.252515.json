We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge, and Richards\u2019 informal brief filed in this court. Because Richards failed to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s finding that his claims were procedurally defaulted, he has waived review of that issue on appeal. 4th Cir. R. 34(b). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Richards v. Angelone, </em>No. CA-00-601-2 (E.D.Va. July 25, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
