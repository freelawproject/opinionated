After conducting a hearing the court concluded \u201cthe State of Ohio [had] failed to sustain it\u2019s <em>[sic </em>] burden of proof and did not have probable cause to stop and detain the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The state\u2019s single assignment of error reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the appellee\u2019s motion to suppress evidence was well taken as it relates to the issue of probable cause to stop and detain the appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">In order for a law enforcement officer to make a valid and constitutional stop of an automobile, there must exist a reasonable suspicion by the officer that a traffic law is being violated or that criminal activity is being carried on. <em>Berkemer v. McCarty </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3150, 82 L.Ed.2d 317. A law enforcement officer does not need \u201cprobable cause for an arrest\u201d in order to make an investigative stop, but needs only \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d warranting the officer\u2019s further investigation. <em>State v. Brandenburg </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 109, 534 N.E.2d 906. In determining whether a traffic stop was proper, a reviewing court must view the stop in light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances. <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 291, 18 O.O.3d 472, 414 N.E.2d 1044, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Appellee\u2019s written motion filed with the trial court fails to challenge the propriety of the officer\u2019s investigative stop. Appellee\u2019s motion generally claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u201cThe arresting officer did not have probable cause to make the arrest for the crime with which Defendant is charged or to detain the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Appellee attempted to expound upon the basis for his motion at the suppression hearing by stating: \u201cThat being the case as the case is cited in the written memorandum, that the State would then have the burden of proof of going forward with the probable cause on the warrantless stop, detainment and arrest.\u201d Appellee\u2019s motion is inadequate to challenge the reasonableness of the initial stop and fails to conform to the specificity requirements of Crim.R. 47. <em>Xenia v. Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 216, 524 N.E.2d 889, and <em>Defiance v. Stafford </em>(Feb. 7, 1992), Defiance App. No. 4-88-10, unreported, 1992 WL 24864. In spite of the general, nonspecific form of appellee\u2019s motion and comments at the hearing, the state indicated it was sufficiently apprised as to the basis of the motion and was ready to proceed. In fact, the state did present sufficient evidence to meet its burden as to the initial stop of appellee even though appellee did not raise this ground in his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201cProbable cause to arrest\u201d and \u201cspecific articulable facts\u201d are two separate, distinct legal burdens which are not interchangeable. However, both parties in this case, as well as the trial court, misstate these concepts. Probable cause is not needed to stop a defendant suspected of violating a traffic law. Rather, an officer needs only \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d supported by \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d to make an initial stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In the present case the facts adduced at the hearing on the motion to suppress indicate that Lieutenant Combs pulled out of the lane of traffic and was sitting in his stopped patrol car when he observed appellee in his rear view mirror driving north on State Route 15 in the city of Defiance. As appellee drove by the patrol vehicle, the lieutenant observed appellee\u2019s car to be approximately three feet over the center line. Appellee stopped his car behind two others and waited for a train to finish crossing the road. In the meantime, the lieutenant contacted Trooper Schlegel and informed him about the vehicle and the driving-left-of-center violation. After the train passed and the gate was raised, appellee drove over the railroad tracks followed by the lieutenant. Appellee turned west onto Hopkins Street. Lieutenant Combs allowed Trooper Schlegel to pull in directly behind appellee. As Trooper Schlegel followed appellee\u2019s vehicle for a short distance he observed it go left of center two additional times in violation of R.C. 4511.25. Trooper Schlegel then stopped the vehicle for the left of center violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Once reasonable suspicion is found for an investigatory stop, an officer must then have probable cause to arrest a detainee. Upon speaking -with appellee about his driving left of center, the trooper suspected the additional violation of driving while under the influence of alcohol. The trooper\u2019s observations of appellee coupled with appellee\u2019s poor performance on several field sobriety tests were the indicators which provided the trooper with probable cause to arrest appellee for driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Specific and articulable facts, not probable cause, are all that is required for an officer to make a reasonable stop of a motorist in order to investigate a traffic violation. Appellee\u2019s failure to drive within his lane of travel provided Trooper Schlegel with sufficient and articulable facts making the stop of appellee\u2019s vehicle reasonable. The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Having found error prejudicial to appellant, we reverse the judgment of the Municipal Court of Defiance and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-10\">Hadley and Thomas F. Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
