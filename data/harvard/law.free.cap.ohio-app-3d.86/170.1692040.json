Brown, Registrar, Motor Vehicle Salvage Dealers Board (\u201cthe board\u201d), Ohio Department of Transportation, appeals a decision of the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas vacating the board\u2019s revocation of the motor vehicle salvage dealer\u2019s license held by plaintiff-appellee, Greg Vandemark.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Appellee owns and operates a motor vehicle salvage facility bordered on the north by State Route 125 in Amelia, Ohio. The Holly Town Mobile Home Park (\u201cHolly Town\u201d) overlooks the facility from a hill on the west side of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">On August 28, 1989 and February 7, 1990, a board representative inspected appellee\u2019s salvage facility. The representative determined that the facility was not shielded from \u201cordinary view\u201d on its north and west sides as required by R.C. 4738.11 and Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-4-04. The board then issued an adjudication order on October 1, 1990 which required appellee to comply with the shielding requirements within ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">A board representative inspected appellee\u2019s facility again on January 9, 1991, and concluded that the facility was properly shielded on its north side. However, the representative found that the facility remained improperly shielded on its west side. As a result, the board issued an adjudication order revoking appellee\u2019s motor vehicle salvage dealer\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, appellee appealed the revocation order to the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas. The court held that the board\u2019s finding of improper shielding on the west 'side was not supported by reliable, substantial and probative evidence. In the court\u2019s opinion, the residents of Holly Town were not \u201cordinary viewers.\u201d Accordingly, the court vacated the revocation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">On appeal, the board presents three interrelated assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\u201cThe Clermont County Court of Common Pleas erred when it did not recognize the authority of the Motor Vehicle Salvage Dealers Licensing Board to impose more stringent shielding requirements than those required under Chapter 4737 of the Ohio Revised Code for junkyards, and those required by the Highway Beautification Act, and thus abused its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">\u201cThe Clermont County Court of Common Pleas erred in not following the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State vs. Buckley </em>and thus abused its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">\u201cThe Clermont County Court of Common Pleas erred in holding that the adjudication order of the Motor Vehicle Salvage Dealers Board was in error, not in accordance with law, and that there was insufficient evidence, and that the order was not supported by reliable, substantial, and probative evidence, and thus abused its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">When reviewing a decision of the court of common pleas which addresses an administrative appeal based upon the weight of the evidence, this court\u2019s role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>is to determine whether the court of common pleas abused its discretion. <em>Angelkovski v. Buckeye Potato Chips Co. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 159, 11 OBR 242, 463 N.E.2d 1280. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment; it implies a decision without a reasonable basis which is clearly wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 11 OBR at 244, 463 N.E.2d at 1283. This standard guides our inquiry on each of the board\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In its first assignment, the board relies on R.C. 4738.11, Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-4-04, and the Highway Beautification Act, Section 136, Title 23, U.S.Code (\u201cthe Act\u201d), and argues that it is authorized to require that appellee shield his facility from the view of Holly Town residents. Appellee\u2019s position is that these provisions only require the shielding of salvage facilities from nearby roadways, not from private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">R.C. 4738.11 addresses the shielding rules for salvage facilities and states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201c(A) The motor vehicle salvage dealer\u2019s licensing board shall adopt rules prescribing the physical characteristics of facilities used by motor vehicle salvage dealers, * * * which shall include requirements for fencing or otherwise screening the view of the facilities to at least the extent required for junkyards by sections 4737.07 and 4737.09 of the Revised Code. Such rules shall be consistent with the standards adopted by the director of transportation pursuant to the \u2018Highway Beautification Act of 1965,\u2019 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">R.C. 4737.07 and 4737.09, the junkyard statutes referred to in R.C. 4738.11, require natural objects or a non-transparent fence to obscure the view of junkyards from nearby state or county highways, township roads, interstates, and primary highways. In addition, Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-4-04, which regulates the characteristics of the facilities used by motor vehicle salvage dealers, requires fencing which \u201cshield[s] the premises from ordinary view.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4501:l-4-04(A)(2)(b). Furthermore, the Act, also referred to in R.C. 4738.11, states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u201c(1) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a State from establishing standards imposing stricter limitations with respect to outdoor junkyards on the Federal-aid highway systems than those established under this section.\u201d Section 136(Z), Title 23, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">In the Act, the term \u201cjunkyard\u201d encompasses salvage facilities such as appellee\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Again, the board interprets the above statutory and administrative authority as allowing it to require the shielding of a salvage facility from the view of private property such as Holly Town. The board\u2019s rationale is as follows: First, the board argues that since the \u201cto at least the extent required for junkyards\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>language contained in R.C. 4738.11 enables it to adopt stricter shielding rules for salvage yards, it may require the shielding of private property. Second, making a similar argument, the board relies on Section 136(Z) of the Act which allows a state to impose stricter shielding requirements than those in the Act. Third, the board contends that the \u201cshield the premises from ordinary view\u201d requirement contained in Ohio Adm.Code 4501:l-4-04(A)(2)(b) authorizes the shielding of private property because it was promulgated pursuant to R.C. 4738.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">While we agree that R.C. 4738.11, the Act, and Ohio Adm.Code 4501:14-04 allow the board to promulgate rules and establish standards stricter than those in the state and federal junkyard shielding schemes, we do not agree that the board can require the shielding of private property under the guise of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Regulations \u201cshould not be read in a vacuum but must be read with reference to the enabling statute under which they were enacted.\u201d <em>Smith v. Haney </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 46, 48, 15 O.O.3d 56, 57, 398 N.E.2d 797, 799. An overview of R.C. 4738.11, the enabling statute under which Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-4-04 was enacted, and those provisions referred to therein clearly indicates that the \u201cordinary view\u201d shielding requirement is intended to aesthetically preserve the view from nearby roadways, not the view from private property. R.C. 4737.07, which the board\u2019s shielding rules, at minimum, must follow, is phrased entirely in terms of obscuring the view from nearby roadways. For example, the definition of \u201cfence\u201d as used in R.C. 4737.07 is \u201ca barrier\u201d which \u201cobscure[s] the junk from the ordinary view of persons passing upon those state, county, municipal, and township highways, roads and streets covered by sections 4737.05 to 4737.99 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 4737.05(C). In addition, the purpose of the Act, which the General Assembly requires the board\u2019s rules to be consistent with, is \u201cto protect the public investment in [the] highways, to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel, and to preserve natural beauty.\u201d Section 136(a), Title 23, U.S.Code. Nothing in the Act indicates an intention to protect private property. Furthermore, the Act and its accompanying regulations speak in terms of screening the view from the \u201cmain traveled way,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> not the view from private property. See Section 136(b) and (c), Title 23, U.S.Code; Sections 751.3, 751.7(c), and 751.9(a)(1), Title 23, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We feel that the \u201cordinary view\u201d requirement contained in Ohio Adm.Code 4501:l-4-04(A)(2)(b) must be read in conjunction with the above provisions. Thus, we hold that the term \u201cordinary view,\u201d for purposes of Section (A)(2)(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>contemplates only the view from the roadways specified by R.C. 4737.07 and the -Act. Accordingly, the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the board could not require appellee to shield his facility from the view of Holly Town. The board\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In its second assignment of error, the board argues that the common pleas court improperly applied the case of <em>State v. Buckley </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 128, 45 O.O.2d 469, 243 N.E.2d 66. <em>Buckley </em>involved a junkyard which was not sufficiently shielded from a highway elevated above it. In <em>Buckley, </em>R.C. 4737.07 was one of the statutes at issue, which, again, applies to salvage facilities through R.C. 4738.11. The board relies on the following language in applying <em>Buckley: </em>\u201cWe read the statutes in question as requiring that the fence effectively and substantially hide the cars in the junk yard from the public view contemplated by the statute. No unevenness of terrain which makes this difficult or impossible excuses violation of the statutory requirement.\u201d <em>Buckley, supra, </em>at 133, 45 O.O.2d at 472, 243 N.E.2d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In its decision, the court below stated that <em>Buckley </em>\u201calluded to unevenness of terrain as a possible excuse for violation of statutory requirements; here the need for at least a twenty-foot high fence in this court\u2019s mind creates a virtual impossibility of compliance with the requirements.\u201d Although the lower court may have misinterpreted the language from <em>Buckley </em>quoted above, for the following reasons, <em>Buckley </em>does not require us to find for the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">First, the above language from <em>Buckley, </em>contrary to the board\u2019s assertion, is not the holding of the case. The applicable portion of the court\u2019s holding is contained in paragraph two of the syllabus: \u201cThe statutory requirement, found in Sections 4737.05 and 4737.07, Revised Code, that junk be obscured from the ordinary view of persons passing upon state, county and township roads means that the junk must be entirely hidden from the view of <em>such passers-by </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the <em>Buckley </em>court equated \u201cordinary view\u201d with the view of persons traveling on the roadways near junkyards. Second, the issue in <em>Buckley </em>was the constitutionality of the \u201cjunkyard statutes,\u201d not whether a salvage yard operator must screen his facility from the view of those living on adjacent private property. Third, and most important, <em>Buckley </em>involved an unobscured view from an elevated <em>highway, </em>not an elevated parcel of private property. We find nothing in the <em>Buckley </em>opinion which indicates that salvage yards must be screened from the view of private property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>failure to interpret <em>Buckley </em>as the board does, therefore, was not an abuse of discretion and the board\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In its final assignment of error, the board argues that the finding of the court of common pleas that the board\u2019s adjudication order was not supported by reliable, substantial, and probative evidence constituted an abuse of discretion. In its final inspection of appellee\u2019s facility, the board determined that the facility was properly shielded from the view of those traveling on State Route 125 but improperly shielded from the view of those living in Holly Town. Because we find that the board cannot require appellee to shield his salvage facility from the view of those living in Holly Town, the common pleas court correctly vacated the board\u2019s order on the basis of a lack of reliable, substantial, and probative evidence. The court properly interpreted the board\u2019s authority, thus, its decision does not amount to an abuse of discretion. The board\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-7\">Koehler and William W. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">. \"Main traveled way\u201d is defined in Section 751.7(c), Title 23, C.F.R.:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\"Main traveled way. The traveled way of a highway on which through traffic is carried. In the case of a divided highway, the traveled way of each of the separated roadways for traffic in opposite directions is a main traveled way.

The board suggests that the language \u201cfrom the public view contemplated by the statute\u201d requires the screening of private property. However, because we conclude that the view contemplated by R.C. 4738.11 and Ohio Adm.Code 4504:l-4-04(A)(2) is only the view from nearby roadways, we need not analyze that language further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
