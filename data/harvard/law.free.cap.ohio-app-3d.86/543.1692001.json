Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County dismissing the complaint filed by plaintiff-appellant, John D. Hecker, against defendants-appellees, Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company and W.E. Knight.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">On January 12, 1989, appellant filed an action against appellees for personal injuries received in an accident which occurred on January 13, 1987. Appellant voluntarily dismissed that action in accordance with Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notice of that dismissal was mailed to counsel for appellees on November 8, 1990 and filed with the court on November 13, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Pursuant to R.C. 2305.19,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant refiled the action against appellees on November 13, 1991. Appellant\u2019s counsel filed instructions with the clerk to \u201chold without service until further request.\u201d On February 24, 1992, the trial court filed a <em>sua sponte </em>motion to dismiss the action for want of prosecution. On motion of appellant, for good cause shown, the trial court granted appellant until April 10, 1992, to issue service of summons or otherwise prosecute the action. On April 10, 1992, appellant issued instructions for service of summons by certified mail. Service was subsequently completed and appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, finding that the prior action was dismissed on November 8, 1990, the date of service by mail, and the second action was not \u201ccommenced\u201d until April 10, 1992, the date appellant requested issuance of summons from the clerk. Accordingly, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>court found that appellant did not meet the requirements of the savings statute, R.C. 2305.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Appellant asserts one assignment of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs complaint in its order of July 1, 1992.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The issue presented in this appeal is whether Civ.R. 3(A) supersedes the procedural requirements of R.C. 2305.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">A plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss an action \u201cby filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the commencement of trial * * *.\u201d Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a). The notice of dismissal in this case was filed on November 13, 1990. The one year period for refiling the action began to run on that date. The trial court erred in finding that the dismissal was effective on November 8, 1990, the date of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Civ.R. 3(A) provides that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court if service is obtained within one year from such filing upon a named defendant * * \u201cFiling\u201d is defined in Civ.R. 5(E) as filing with the clerk of court. The trial court erroneously relied upon R.C. 2305.17, which provides that an action is commenced \u201cby filing a petition in the office of the clerk * * * together with a praecipe demanding that summons issue * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Section 5(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">\u201cThe supreme court shall prescribe rules governing practice and procedure in all courts of the state, which rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right. * * * All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">R.C. 2305.17 was in existence before the Civil Rules became effective. The Civil Rules do not require that a praecipe for summons be filed with the complaint, but rather, Civ.R. 3(A) provides that an action is commenced by filing a complaint and obtaining service within one year from the date of filing. Civ.R. 4(A) provides that, absent instructions from the plaintiff, the clerk must issue a summons for service upon the filing of a complaint. To the extent R.C. 2305.17 requires a praecipe for summons, it is superseded by Civ.R. 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Appellant met the requirements of Civ.R. 3(A) and R.C. 2305.19 by filing his complaint within one year of the date of his prior dismissal and obtaining service within one year of the date of filing the complaint in the new action. The trial court erred in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County is reversed and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-6\">Evans, P.J., and Shaw, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\">. Although the notice of dismissal is entitled \u201cStipulation of Dismissal,\u2019\u2019 it clearly is not a stipulation pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(b) as it is signed by appellant\u2019s counsel only. Despite its title, it is a notice of dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-11\">. R.C. 2305.19 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201cIn an action commenced * * * if the plaintiff fails otherwise than upon the merits, and the time limited for the commencement of such action at the date of * * * failure has expired, the plaintiff * * * may commence a new action within one year after such date.\u201d A voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff is clearly a failure \u201cotherwise than upon the merits.\u201d See <em>Costell v.
