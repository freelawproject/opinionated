Appellees include Earl D. Simons and Logan M. Daugherty (collectively, \u201cappellees\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Simons, Daugherty, and Clark have been employed as sanitarians by the board since 1972. In 1979, Simons achieved the grade of senior sanitarian. In 1981, Clark and Daugherty also were promoted to senior sanitarian positions. Shortly thereafter, however, those two promotions were vacated because the eligibility list from which they were made had expired. Nevertheless, after the promotions were vacated, both persons continued to serve for eighteen months in temporary assignments. Subsequently, in August 1984, Daugherty was reappointed to the senior sanitarian position.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">On November 4, 1986, in an action related to sanitarian promotions, Cincinnati\u2019s city manager issued an administrative regulation to all city department and division heads entitled \u201cAffirmative Action Program Plan and Promotion Justification.\u201d This plan required that department heads give the city manager written justification for any extraordinary circumstance in which a person who was not a minority, woman, or handicapped person was to be promoted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Clark is African American; Simons and Daugherty are Caucasian.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In November 1987, after this plan was adopted, a board employee, Alfred Olverson, was promoted from his supervising sanitarian position to an administrative post within the board. That promotion created a permanent vacancy for supervising sanitarian. On May 29, 1986, prior to the Olverson vacancy, the city had conducted a promotional examination for the position of supervising sanitarian. One prerequisite for taking that examination included thirty-six months of experience as a senior sanitarian. Clark, however, had only approximately twenty-five months\u2019 senior sanitarian experience, obtained, in large part, in a temporary position following his invalid appointment. Nevertheless, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>requested that the civil service commission allow him to take the examination. When his initial request was denied, Clark, on May 13, 1986, again sought permission to take the examination, and after two appeals, the commission ruled in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In addition to Clark, three other persons relevant to this dispute \u2014 Simons, Daugherty, and one Robert Evans \u2014 sat for the May 29,1986 supervising sanitarian examination. Prior to the examination, Evans had been injured in an automobile accident during the scope of his employment with the board. As a result of his injuries, Evans was unable to perform his current duties as a senior sanitarian. His injuries, however, did not bar him from sitting for the supervising sanitarian examination. After one year of paid absence and five hundred hours of \u201clight duty,\u201d Evans received a physical examination by a city physician. The physician opined that Evans would not be able to perform \u201cthe full range of his duties within the foreseeable future.\u201d Thereafter, the board informed Evans that it intended to terminate his employment for medical reasons. Evans responded to the board\u2019s action by requesting that it delay his termination and \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d his medical condition for the supervising sanitarian position. Accordingly, the board granted that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In the meantime, as required by R.C. 124.26, the city\u2019s personnel department prepared an eligibility list based upon the supervising sanitarian examination results for the vacancy created by Olverson\u2019s promotion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among others, that list included Simons, Daugherty, Evans, and Clark. Thereafter, on December 8, 1987, as required by R.C. 124.27, the personnel department certified the three highest ranked names to the board for the purposes of filling the vacancy. Those were Evans, Daugherty, and Simons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>On November 16, 1987, the board assigned Clark to fill temporarily the Olverson vacancy even though his name was not on the certified list.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On January 15, 1988, while in the acting supervising sanitarian position, Clark wrote to the commission. In his letter, Clark complained that, because it was uncertain whether Evans would be able to perform the duties of a supervising sanitarian, he, rather than Evans, should have been certified. On January 28, 1988, the commission denied Clark\u2019s request; however, it did ask that the board delay appointing the supervising sanitarian until Evans\u2019s status was determined. Thereafter, Clark filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On January 28, 1988, as previously scheduled, the interviews with the three certified employees were conducted. There is evidence in the record to show that even before these interviews, the board had decided not to fill the Olverson vacancy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The interviews were conducted by Olverson, Robert Trentman, and Walter Handy of the board. The trial court stated that two of these men, including Olverson, are African Americans. The commissioner of health and the assistant commissioner of health also are African Americans.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On April 30, 1988, despite his efforts to retain his senior sanitarian position, Evans was terminated for medical reasons. Subsequently, Olverson requested that Evans\u2019s name be removed from the certified list and that Clark\u2019s name be substituted. Olverson submitted that request to Barbara Stephens, assistant commissioner of health, who forwarded it to Thomas Gamel, the human resource director for the board. On May 12, 1988, Gamel submitted the request to the commission. Consequently, on June 2, 1988, the commission removed Evans\u2019s name and added Clark\u2019s name. On that same day, the board interviewed Clark and promoted him to the supervising sanitarian position.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Despite the seven months that had passed since their original interviews, Simons and Daugherty were not interviewed when the final decision was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On June 20, 1988, Simons and Daugherty initiated these proceedings in which they alleged that appellants\u2019 actions violated the civil service laws and were an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>abuse of corporate power.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They further claimed they were deprived of due process and equal protection by appellants\u2019 actions, which violated Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code. More specifically, appellees sought a judgment vacating Clark\u2019s appointment, directing the appointment of either Simons or Daugherty, providing back pay, and ordering attorney fees pursuant to Section 1988, Title 42, U.S.Code.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Sitting without a jury, on July 26, 1991, the court below tried the matter. At the conclusion of those proceedings, the court granted appellees\u2019 demand for an order vacating Clark\u2019s appointment. The court also ordered appellants to appoint one of appellees to the supervising sanitarian position. Following further evidentiary material on the remaining matters, the court ordered appellants to pay appellees $20,542.50 in attorney fees and $1,451.67 in costs. From that judgment, appellants bring this timely appeal in which they assert four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">For their first assignment of error, appellants claim that the trial court misinterpreted R.C. 124.27, which deals with civil service promotions, by denying them the right to appoint Clark from the second certified list.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The civil service laws of Ohio are written to provide promotions based on \u201cmerit and fitness,\u201d not for \u201cpolitical reasons or affiliations.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Buckman v. Munson </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 319, 25 O.O. 455, 48 N.E.2d 109, paragraph one of the syllabus. Even though appellants concede that R.C. 124.27 applies in this ease, they contend that the board was entitled to make the appointment from a certified list of three \u201celigible\u201d candidates. Specifically, appellants sought to remove Evans from the certified list and replace his name with Clark\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">In support of their legal proposition, appellants cite <em>Bd. of Trustees of Madison Cty. Children\u2019s Home v. State ex rel. Laird </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 560, 1 O.O. 140, 192 N.E. 877. In <em>Madison Cty. Children\u2019s Home, </em>one of three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>candidates on a certified promotion list died before a final appointment was made. Thereafter, the remaining candidates brought a mandamus action to compel the board to appoint one of the two surviving candidates. The board, in turn, asserted that it would be illegal to appoint from the list of two.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court observed that, if the board had requested a certified list of three candidates, the commission would be required to meet that demand. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 1 O.O. at 142, 192 N.E. at 879. However, since the board had failed to make that request, \u201cappointment made from a certified list of less than three would not be illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further noted that, if the board originally had requested a full certified list of three and the commission had denied that request, it would not order appointment from the remaining two members. <em>Id. </em>at 564-565, 1 O.O. at 142-143, 192 N.E. at 879. However, because the board in <em>Madison Cty. Children\u2019s Home </em>took neither of these actions, the court forced the board to appoint from the original list, which had only two living members. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We find the foregoing authority to be inapposite to the appellants\u2019 position. Here, the commission\u2019s list consisted of three eligible candidates. Appellants admit that Evans was \u201clegally certified * * * to be considered for the position,\u201d and that \u201c[w]e had no reason not to interview him at that time.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The board\u2019s own testimony establishes that it realized that Evans was a viable \u2014 \u201celigible\u201d\u2014 candidate for the existing vacancy. This does not mean, however, that appellants were required to appoint Evans. Nonetheless, when appellants delayed seven months in replacing Evans\u2019s name with Clark\u2019s, they sought to subvert the civil service system by appointing their preordained favorite to the vacancy. Therefore, the trial court did not err when it ordered appellants to fill the Olverson vacancy from the original certified list.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellants\u2019 first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">In their second assignment of error, appellants maintain that this cause was not properly brought as a taxpayer\u2019s action pursuant to R.C. 733.59.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellants argue that Simons and Daugherty could not pursue this cause under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>R.C. 733.59 because the relief they sought inured to the benefit of private parties rather than to the public. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In <em>State ex rel. Caspar v. Dayton </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 16, 558 N.E.2d. 49, patrolmen sought to compel the city of Dayton to give credit to union members for vacation time and fringe benefits under a union contract. The court held that, because these benefits were not \u201cpublic\u201d rights, the suit could not be brought as an R.C. 733.59 taxpayer\u2019s action. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 558 N.E.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We believe that this case is distinguishable from <em>Caspar. </em>In <em>Caspar, </em>the city of Dayton had prevailed on at least some of its defenses and was not guilty of bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21, 558 N.E.2d at 54. By way of contrast, the trial court here found that appellants delayed in filling the vacancy to accomplish a preordained result. That delay and the subsequent appointment of Clark constituted favoritism and contravened the Ohio civil service laws. Furthermore, appellants\u2019 actions were an abuse of corporate power. Resultantly, the court determined that appellees\u2019 lawsuit benefited the city as a whole by protecting the integrity of the civil service system and ensuring its fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">From our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determinations are supported by competent evidence and, therefore, are not against the weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Under their third assignment of error, appellants maintain that the trial court erred by awarding appellees attorney fees in a taxpayer\u2019s cause of action (R.C. 733.59 <em>et </em>seq.). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">First, appellants contend that appellees are not entitled to the award because they did not comply with the statutory requirements of R.C. 733.59.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, appellants maintain that appellees did not first request that the city solicitor commence this cause. The trial court found, however, that such a request would have been a vain act because the solicitor\u2019s office previously had written legal opinions that opposed appellees\u2019 position. Accordingly, this argument fails. See, generally, <em>State ex rel. White v. Cleveland </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 37, 63 O.O.2d 79, 295 N.E.2d 665, paragraph two of the syllabus (when the city\u2019s legal office has already taken a position contrary to the taxpayer-plaintiff, the R.C. 733.59 request is excused).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Appellants next argue that appellees are not \u201ctaxpayers\u201d as contemplated by the statute. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the term taxpayer, within the meaning of R.C. 733.59, refers to a person who seeks to \u201cenforce a right of action on behalf of and for the benefit of the public.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Nimon v. Springdale </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 1, 35 O.O.2d 1, 215 N.E.2d 592, paragraph two of the syllabus. Given our disposition of appellants\u2019 second assignment of error, Simons and Daugherty are \u201ctaxpayers,\u201d and this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In addition, appellants contend that this action did not inure to the public benefit. We reject that contention here just as we did in the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Appellants further argue that appellees failed to post security for the cost of the proceeding as required by R.C. 733.59.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the record shows that appellees posted a security for costs upon filing the complaint, we find this argument to be feckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Appellants\u2019 final contention is that the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees was inappropriate under Section 1988, Title 42, U.S.Code. This contention fails on the authority of <em>Cincinnati ex rel. Kuntz v. Cincinnati </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 86, 606 N.E.2d 1028 (the party who prevails on state-law claim, which has a common nucleus of operative fact with an unsuccessful Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code claim, is entitled to attorney fees under federal law). Accordingly, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In their fourth and final assignment of error, appellants propound the argument that the trial court erred by awarding personal expenses to appellees as \u201ccosts\u201d to the prevailing parties. Costs that the trial court allowed and appellants contest, include postage, photocopying, and deposition expenses for court reporter\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Civ.R. 54(D) provides that prevailing parties should normally be awarded the costs of litigation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court has observed that costs, as the term is generally used in the state, include \u201c \u2018the statutory fees to which officers, witnesses, jurors and others are entitled for their services in an action * * \u201d <em>Centennial Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 50, 50, 23 O.O.3d 88, 89, 430 N.E.2d 925, 926.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The term does not include, however, \u201cfees and disbursements\u201d that are not allowed by statute. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 23 O.O.3d at 89, 430 N.E.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In a subsequent case, the court clarified the meaning of \u201cofficers\u201d as the term applies to costs. <em>In re Election of Nov. 6, 1990 </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 1, 577 N.E.2d 343.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court allowed expenses for court reporters and videotape technicians in depositions because those persons acted as \u201cofficers\u201d whose services were included in costs. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 577 N.E.2d at 345-346. By way of contrast, attorney fees, travel expenses, copying expenses, delivery charges, computerized legal research, expert witness fees, and telephone bills, were not allowed. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4, 577 N.E.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Based upon the foregoing authority, we conclude that the trial court did not err in awarding appellees their deposition expenses. However, we hold that costs for postage and photocopying expenses were improvidently allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">In summation, we overrule appellants\u2019 first, second, and third assignments of error. We overrule the fourth assignment of error insofar as it pertains to the award of deposition expenses to appellees. We sustain the fourth assignment only insofar as it pertains to the award of copying and postage expenses. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>remand this cause to the trial court to determine the amount of appellees\u2019 copying and postage expenses and to deduct those expenses from the costs it previously awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-6\">Shannon, P.J., and Gorman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-14\">.

The trial court allowed costs of $1,451.67. It did not, however, itemize the specific expenses.
