Corrigan, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Plaintiff State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cState Auto\u201d) appeals from the order of the trial court which awarded summary judgment to defendant Troy S. Rainsberg, in State Auto\u2019s declaratory judgment action. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">On November 3, 1989, Rainsberg struck two pedestrians on the Ohio Turnpike while operating a van owned by his employer. Rainsberg sustained personal injuries, and subsequently brought a claim for uninsured motorists coverage against State Auto, the insurer of the van. State Auto denied the claim, then instituted this declaratory judgment action to determine whether uninsured motorist coverage should be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Both parties moved for summary judgment and stipulated to the facts of the incident, as they were set forth in a crash report prepared by the State Highway Patrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">According to this report, Anderson Decime, Christopher Sposato and Robert Senn were en route from Cleveland to New York in Decime\u2019s uninsured vehicle. The vehicle broke down on Interstate 71 due to battery problems, but was then jump-started and the group entered the Ohio Turnpike. After proceeding five to ten miles, the car broke down again and Decime pulled over on to the left berm of the road. Decime activated the flashers and the men exited the car to signal for help. Sposato and Senn stood at the rear of the car and waived down help and as Decime opened the hood of the vehicle, Neophytos Hadjicharalambous pulled in front of the stalled car. Senn spoke with Hadjicharalambous, and he agreed to jump-start the vehicle. Senn and Sposato then returned to the rear of the vehicle to \u201cflag cars away,\u201d and Hadjicharalambous pulled to the right berm. He then began backing up in order to return to the left berm in proper position to jump-start Decime\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The flashers of Decime\u2019s vehicle subsequently failed. Thereafter, Rainsberg approached in his vehicle, and observed Hadjicharalambous backing up in the right berm. He did not see Decime\u2019s vehicle. A split second later, Rainsberg observed a pedestrian standing or walking in his lane of travel. Rainsberg struck both Senn and Sposato. Sposato died as the result of his injuries and Rainsberg sustained a broken hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The North Royalton Prosecutor subsequently determined that Rainsberg was proceeding in a lawful manner, and no charges were filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The parties further stipulated that the insurance policy issued by State Auto contains the following uninsured motorists provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u201cCOVERAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\u201cWe will pay all sums the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 caused by an \u2018accident.\u2019 The owner\u2019s or driver\u2019s liability of these damages must result from the ownership, maintenance or use of the \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">In addition, the parties agreed that Rainsberg is an \u201cinsured,\u201d who sustained \u201cbodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The trial court subsequently determined that uninsured motorist coverage was applicable because Rainsberg was \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d from Decime and liability resulted from the \u201cownership, maintenance or use of his uninsured vehicle.\u201d State Auto now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In its two interrelated assignments of error, State Auto urges this court to independently review the stipulated facts and conclude that the trial court erred in declaring that Rainsberg is \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d damages from Decime, due to the \u201cownership, maintenance, or use\u201d of Decime\u2019s uninsured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">As an initial matter, we note that an appellate court stands in the shoes of the trial court when reviewing appeals from judgments rendered solely on stipulated facts. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Slutz </em>(Oct. 13, 1987), Stark App. CA-7109, unreported, 1987 WL 18538. The appellate court therefore conducts an independent review in this instance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">With respect to State Auto\u2019s first argument, we note that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured auto,\u201d contained in an uninsured motorist provision of an automobile liability insurance policy, means that the insured must be able to prove the elements of his or her claim necessary to recover damages. <em>Sumwalt v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 294, 12 OBR 368, 466 N.E.2d 544 syllabus. That is, the plaintiff must establish fault on the part of the uninsured motorist which gives rise to damages, and prove the extent of those damages. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 12 OBR at 370, 466 N.E.2d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In this case, Rainsberg asserts that Decime was at fault pursuant to R.C. 4513.02(A) because he knowingly drove an unsafe vehicle on the highway. This court is hesitant to conclude that a vehicle which had to be jump-started on one previous occasion is \u201cdangerous\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4513.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Rainsberg further urges this court to conclude, as the trial court concluded, that Decime was at fault because he acted in concert with Sposato and Senn, and is therefore liable for their entry into Rainsberg\u2019s lane of travel. We find that the stipulated facts do not permit liability to be premised upon a concert of action. Pursuant to the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 315, Section 876:</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">\u201cFor harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">\u201c(a) does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a common design with him, or</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">\u201c(b) knows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself, or</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">\u201c(c) gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and his own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to the third person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Comment <em>c </em>states, however:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201cIn order for the rule stated in Clause (a) to be applicable, it is essential that the conduct of the actor be in itself tortious. One who innocently, rightfully and carefully does an act that has the effect of furthering the tortious conduct or cooperating in the tortious design of another is not for that reason subject to liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In this case, Decime\u2019s conduct was not itself tortious. Further, he did not assist Sposato and Senn in entering the roadway. In addition, he did not know where they were standing because his view was obscured by the hood of his vehicle. Moreover, absent a showing that Deeime was at fault, Rainsberg is not \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d from him and uninsured motorists coverage should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">With respect to State Auto\u2019s second argument, <em>ie., </em>that liability, if it exists, does not result from the \u201cownership, maintenance, or use of the \u2018uninsured motor vehicle,\u2019 \u201d we note that this phrase has been judicially construed to require \u201cthat a causal relation or connection must exist between the accident or injury and the \u2018ownership, maintenance or use\u2019 of a vehicle in order for the accident or injury to come within the meaning of the clause \u2018arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use\u2019 of a vehicle. Where such causal connection or relation is absent, coverage will be denied. See Annotation (1963), 89 A.L.R.2d 150, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u201cA number of authorities in this area define the term \u2018arising out of to mean \u2018originating from\u2019 or \u2018growing out of or \u2018flowing from.\u2019 Annotation, <em>supra, </em>89 A.L.R.2d at 61. The term has also been used to mean \u2018causally connected with, not proximately caused by.\u2019 See <em>Manufacturers Cas. Ins. Co. v. Goodville Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1961), 403 Pa. 603, 607, 170 A.2d 571, 573. Therefore, <em>the issue is not one of proximate cause. It is sufficient if the use is connected with the accident or the creation of a condition that caused the accident. </em>The consensus is that the issue is not one of proximate cause but the requirement of some causal relation or connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\"><em>u </em>* <em>% </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">\u201c * * * [I]t is required that there be a factual connection growing out of or originating with the use of the vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 199, 202, 525 N.E.2d 508, 511 (where driver attempts to comply with statute prohibiting transporting a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle as a prerequisite to travelling in truck, and passenger is injured, such injury is sustained in connection with \u201cuse\u201d of truck). Accord <em>Hall v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1957), 107 Ohio App. 13, 16-17, 7 O.O.2d 344, 345, 155 N.E.2d 462, 465 (claimant who was squeezed between a jeep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>and a second vehicle while waiting to attach a tow line to the jeep was injured in connection with the use of the jeep).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In this case, the accident clearly has a factual connection growing out of and originating with Decime\u2019s use of the uninsured vehicle as Rainsberg was injured in connection with Sposato and Senn\u2019s efforts to divert traffic away from the stalled vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">State Auto contends, however, that the instrumentality causing injury is the pedestrians, who were out of the vehicle, and not the vehicle. It therefore asserts that this matter is governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Kish v. Central Natl. Ins. Group </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 41, 21 O.O.3d 26, 424 N.E.2d 288. In <em>Kish, </em>however, the court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether the chain of events resulting in the accident was unbroken by the intervention of any event unrelated to the use of the vehicle. The application of this standard to the instant facts leads us to conclude that the intentional, criminal act of the murderer was an intervening cause of injury unrelated to the use of the vehicle. As the court below stated, \u2018the death resulted from an act wholly dissociated from and independent of the use of the vehicle as such.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In this case, the chain of events preceding the injury exclusively concerned the Decime group\u2019s efforts to obtain help with the vehicle and to divert traffic from it. There were no intervening acts unrelated to the use of the vehicle. Accordingly, the injury clearly results from use of the vehicle. In light of our previous determination that Rainsberg is not \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d from Decime, however, the judgment rendered below is hereby reversed and remanded for disposition consistent \"with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-11\">Spellacy and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
