Florez\u201d (\u201cDr. Florez\u201d). Joint App\u2019x at 62. During the 1960s, Dr. Florez served in several high-level diplomatic roles on behalf of the Republic of Cuba, including as <em>charge </em>d\u2019affaires<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Washington, D.C. He defected to the United States in 1968, became an American citizen in 1979, and died in October 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On November 20, 2013, the CIA answered Mr. Florez\u2019s request with a so-called <em>Glomar </em>response,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stating that it \u201ccan neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records responsive to [Mr. Florez\u2019s] request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. It asserted that the existence or nonexistence of such records \u201cis currently and properly classified and is intelligence sources and methods information\u201d that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. <em>Id. </em>On December 4, 2013, Mr. Florez timely filed an administrative appeal with the CIA\u2019s Agency Release Panel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On February 18, 2014, while Mr. Flo-rez\u2019s administrative appeal was pending, Mr. Florez timely filed the underlying action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The CIA and Mr. Florez filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On April 22, 2014, while the motions underwent briefing, the Agency Release Panel denied Mr. Florez\u2019s administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">On February 19, 2015, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Sidney H. Stein, <em>Judge) </em>granted summary judgment in favor of the CIA and denied Mr. Florez\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, holding that \u201cthe CIA\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response was justified and the existence of any records is exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 1 (for classified national defense or foreign policy secrets) and Exemption 3 (for matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute).\u201d <em>Florez v. CIA, </em>No. 14-cv-1002, 2015 WL 728190, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 19, 2015). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">During the pendency of this appeal, pursuant to a separate FOIA request, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) released several declassified documents pertaining to Dr. Florez on June 23, 2015, and one additional such document on July 24, 2015 (collectively, \u201cFBI Disclosures\u201d). Mr. Florez requested that the CIA revise its response to his FOIA request in light of the FBI Disclosures. The CIA reviewed the FBI Disclosures, but declined to alter its position that a <em>Glomar </em>response is supportable in these circumstances. <em>See </em>Letter from Preet Bharara, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, to Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of Court at 1, <em>Florez v. CIA, </em>No. 15-1055-cv (2d Cir. Dec. 18, 2015), ECF No. 57-1 [hereinafter \u201cCIA Ltr.\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Mr. Florez challenges the CIA\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response as inadequate under the FOIA, but we do not reach the merits of his challenge at this time. Because we find the FBI Disclosures relevant to the issues presented, we remand for the District Court to pass on the import of those documents in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">By statute, a district court must review <em>de novo </em>an agency\u2019s determination to withhold information requested under the FOIA, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B); <em>Main St. Legal Servs., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Sec. Council, </em>811 F.3d 542, 542 (2d Cir.2016), and we subsequently review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s ruling, see <em>Ctr. for Constitutional Rights v. CIA, </em>765 F.3d 161, 166 (2d Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1530, 191 L.Ed.2d 559 (2015). \u201cThe government bears the burden of demonstrating that an exemption applies to each item of information it seeks to withhold, and all doubts as to the applicability of the exemption must be resolved in favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>Ctr. For Constitutional Rights, </em>765 F.3d at 166 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Such \u201c[e]xceptions to FOIA\u2019s general principle of broad disclosure of Government records have consistently been given a narrow compass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\u201cAn agency may carry its burden by submitting declarations giving reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption, and such declarations are accorded a presumption of good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We find a <em>Glomar </em>response justified only in \u201cunusual circumstances, and only by a particularly persuasive affidavit.\u201d <em>N.Y. Times Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>756 F.3d 100, 122 (2d Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Halpern v. FBI, </em>181 F.3d 279, 295 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201c[T]he good faith presumption that attaches to agency affidavits only applies when accompanied by reasonably detailed explanations of why material was withheld. Absent a sufficiently specific explanation from an agency, a court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review is not possible and the adversary process envisioned in FOIA litigation cannot function.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">II. FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">On the merits, which we do not reach in this opinion, this appeal presents an ordinary <em>Glomar </em>inquiry: whether the existence or nonexistence of documents, within the CIA\u2019s possession and responsive to Mr. Florez\u2019s request, is itself a fact exempt from disclosure under one of two FOIA exemptions. Because the relevancy of the FBI Disclosures is determined by the scope of the claimed exemptions, we briefly describe the two exemptions at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">The CIA relies upon FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3 to support its <em>Glomar </em>response. FOIA Exemption 1 \u201cexempts from disclosure records that are \u2018specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,\u2019 and \u2018are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ctr. for Constitutional Rights, </em>765 F.3d at 164 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1)). The agency asserts that the existence or nonexistence of responsive records is information properly classified pursuant to \u00a7 1.1(4) of Executive Order 13,526, which permits classification of information that, if disclosed, \u201creasonably could be expected to result in damage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage.\u201d 75 Fed. Reg. 707, 707 (Dec. 29, 2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">FOIA Exemption 3 \u201cpermits the Government to withhold information from public disclosure provided that: (1) the information is \u2018specifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2019; and (2) the exemption statute \u2018requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue\u2019 or \u2018establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u2019 \u201d <em>ACLU v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>681 F.3d 61, 72 (2d Cir.2012) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3)). Here, the CIA invokes Section 6 of the CIA Act of 1949, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507 (exempting the CIA from any law that \u201crequire[s] the publication or disclosure of the organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency\u201d), and Section 102A(i)(Z) of the National Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024(i)(l) (protecting \u201cintelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">III. FBI Disclosures</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">During the pendency of this appeal, the FBI Disclosures were brought to our attention by Mr. Florez and submitted to us by the CIA. Our threshold inquiry in this appeal is whether the FBI Disclosures should be considered in adjudicating this case. Mr. Florez, on one hand, urges us to consider the documents ourselves and con-elude that \u201cthe FBI release thoroughly undermine[s] the CIA\u2019s position.\u201d Letter from David E. McCraw, Attorney for Sergio Florez, to Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court at 1, <em>Florez v. CIA, </em>No 15-1055-cv (2d Cir. Dec. 18, 2015), ECF No. 53. The CIA, on the other hand, urges us to evaluate its response to Mr. Florez\u2019s FOIA request \u201cas of the time it was made and not at the time of [our] review,\u201d CIA Ltr. at 1 (internal quotation marks omitted), and therefore ignore the FBI D\u00edscIot sures in our analysis of the merits. If, however, we \u201cdetermine that the FBI disclosures are relevant to the issues on appeal, the CIA respectfully requests that this case be remanded to the district court to allow the CIA to submit additional declarations addressing the FBI disclosures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 n. 2. Accordingly, we first address whether the FBI Disclosures are relevant to the case. Answering that question in the affirmative, we next consider whether we should ignore the disclosures \u2014 resolving the merits based on the record as it existed at the time of Mr. Florez\u2019s FOIA request \u2014 or remand the case to allow the District Court to weigh the significance of the documents in the first instance. Our precedent, judicial efficiency, and common sense all militate towards the latter and we therefore remand the case to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">A. Relevance</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Due to issues of timing, the District Court below never had the opportunity to weigh the significance of the FBI Disclosures and, accordingly, on appeal, \u201cwe lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the benefit of an evaluation of this issue by the district court.\u201d <em>Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of WorldCom, Inc. v. SEC, </em>467 F.3d 73, 79 (2d Cir.2006) (Soto-mayor, /.). We therefore limit our inquiry at this juncture to whether the documents are relevant to the merits of this appeal, such that we need consider whether to accord the District Court the opportunity to assess them in the first instance. <em>See Eric M. Berman, P.C. v. City of New York, </em>796 F.3d 171, 175 (2d Cir.2015) (per curiam) (\u201c[I]t is this Court\u2019s usual practice to allow the district court to address arguments in the first instance.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also, e.g., United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 159 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam) (concluding that the \u201cbest solution\u201d for evaluating \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d was for such evidence to \u201cbe addressed ... by the district court first\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1044, 119 S.Ct. 1345, 143 L.Ed.2d 508 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u201cEvidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 401. <em>See also United States v. Certified Envtl. Servs., Inc., </em>753 F.3d 72, 90 (2d Cir.2014) (\u201c[T]he definition of relevance under Fed. R. Evid. 401 is very broad\u201d). More briefly stated, evidence is relevant if it has \u201cappreciable probative value.\u201d <em>Relevant, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014); <em>see also United States v. Litvak, </em>808 F.3d 160, 179-80 (2d Cir.2015). \u201cRelevance is a legal determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Staniforth, </em>971 F.2d 1355, 1358 (7th Cir.1992) (Posner, <em>J.) abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Wells, </em>519 U.S. 482, 117 S.Ct. 921, 137 L.Ed.2d 107 (1997). Conversely, it is \u201cthe province of the finder of fact to determine what weight to accord\u201d such relevant evidence. <em>Jim Beam Brands Co. v. Beamish &amp; Crawford Ltd., </em>937 F.2d 729, 736 (2d Cir.1991). <em>Accord Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 898, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983) (\u201c[T]he rules of evidence generally extant at the federal and state levels anticipate that relevant, unprivileged evidence should be admitted and its weight left to the factfinder, who would have the benefit of cross-examination and contrary evidence by the opposing party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">We conclude that the FBI Disclosures are relevant to the present <em>Glomar </em>inquiry. At minimum, the FBI Disclosures are germane to the CIA\u2019s asserted rationale for asserting a <em>Glomar </em>response, which is that confirming the existence or non-existence of responsive records would confirm either the Agency\u2019s interest or disinterest in Dr. Florez as an intelligence asset. Specifically, the documents appear to include the following revelations: (1) the FBI investigated Dr. Florez\u2019s background and tracked his career development, official activities, and international relocations, <em>see, e.g., </em>CIA Ltr., Ex. A at 13, 27, 32, 36, 45-46; <em>id. </em>Ex. B at 1; (2) the FBI cultivated informants in order to obtain information concerning Dr. Florez, including material which pertained to both his professional and personal conduct, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>Ex. A at 6, 16-17, 19, 21, 23, 29, 35, 45-46; and (3) several other government departments and agencies provided to or received from the FBI information concerning Dr. Flo-rez, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>Ex. A at 25 (Department of State; Immigration &amp; Naturalization Sendee (\u201cINS\u201d)), 27-28 (Department of State), 34-35 (Department of State; Navy\u2019s Office of Naval Intelligence (\u201cONI\u201d); Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations (\u201cOSI\u201d); Army\u2019s Chief of Staff for Intelligence (\u201cACSI\u201d)), 47 (same); <em>id. </em>Ex. B at 1 (INS).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">These public disclosures have appreciable probative value in determining, under \u201cthe record as a whole,\u201d \u201cwhether the jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tifications set forth in the [CIA\u2019s] declaration are logical and plausible in this case.\u201d <em>Ctr. for Constitutional Rights, </em>765 F.3d at 168. The CIA\u2019s declaration relies heavily on the import of masking the government\u2019s intelligence interest (if any) in Dr. Florez and in maintaining complete secrecy as to whether any intelligence activities were focused on him. Though the FBI Disclosures do not reveal the CIA\u2019s activities or involvement, they appear to suggest that multiple government departments and agencies were investigating, monitoring, and had an intelligence interest in Dr. Florez, and that the FBI cultivated informants to gather information about him. This now-public information may bear on the CIA\u2019s position that the mere acknowl-edgement that it does or does not have possession of documents that reference Dr. Florez would harm the national security, or otherwise disclose Agency methods, functions, or sources.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The Dissent disagrees that the FBI Disclosures even <em>might </em>bear on the sufficiency of the CIA\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response and therefore concludes that we should deem those disclosures irrelevant. <em>See </em>Dissent at 3-11. With respect to our dissenting colleague, we simply diverge on this point. Whereas the Dissent casually dismisses the FBI Disclosures as \u201cdisclosing] little regarding Dr. Florez,\u201d <em>see </em>Dissent at 192, we believe the documents contain disclosures that bear upon whether the CIA is able to carry its burden in this case, to wit, \u201cwhether on the whole record the Agency\u2019s judgment objectively survives the test of reasonableness, good faith, specificity, and plausibility.\u201d <em>Gardels v. CIA, </em>689 F.2d 1100, 1105 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The Dissent attempts to downplay the scope of the FBI Disclosures at every turn, shrugging them off as revealing nothing more than \u201cthat the FBI maintained some interest in Dr. Florez for some period of time.\u201d <em>See </em>Dissent at 195. But to be clear, the disclosures in fact reveal a wealth of information, including that the FBI maintained an active interest in Dr. Florez for well over a decade, tracking the development of his career, including his foreign deployments and travel on behalf of the Cuban government in Europe, documenting his familial affiliations and personal affairs, and taking a particular interest in the fact he had grown disillusioned with the communist regime in Cuba and contemplated defection to the United States. These findings were shared with a myriad of other agencies, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the Department of State, the Navy\u2019s Office of Naval Intelligence, the Army\u2019s Chief of Staff for Intelligence, and the Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations, in addition to being circulated to the FBI\u2019s Foreign Liaison Desk and FBI legal attach\u00e9s in Madrid and Paris.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>this information would be probative to a reasonable finder of fact attempting to discern the \u201creasonableness, good faith, specificity, and plausibility\u201d of the CIA\u2019s current <em>Glomar </em>response.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Rather than grapple with the full scope of the disclosures, the Dissent fixates on the fact that the disclosures emanate from the FBI, rather than the CIA. Although apparently hesitant to plainly say as much, the Dissent essentially argues that, under the official acknowledgment doctrine, the disclosures of other federal agencies \u2014 regardless of the extent to which they bear on the validity of another agency\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>rationale \u2014 are never relevant and must be wholly disregarded. <em>See </em>Dissent at 195-96 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7. This conclusion confuses the act of waiver \u2014 which we uniformly recognize as a privilege reserved to the agency asserting a <em>Glomar </em>response\u2014 with an agency\u2019s independent obligation to \u201ccarry its burden by submitting declarations giving reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption,\u201d <em>Ctr. For Constitutional Rights, </em>765 F.3d at 166 (internal quotation marks omitted), a burden which can only be carried when the agency\u2019s declarations \u201care not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Nat\u2019l Sec. Agency, </em>678 F.3d 926, 931 (D.C.Cir.2012). In other words, a third party agency\u2019s diselo-sures cannot waive the asserting agency\u2019s right to a <em>Glomar </em>response, but such disclosures may well shift the factual groundwork upon which a district court assesses the merits of such a response.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The official acknowledgment doctrine prohibits agencies from \u201cproviding] a <em>Glomar </em>response when the existence or nonexistence of the particular records covered by the <em>Glomar </em>response has been officially and publicly disclosed.\u201d <em>Wilner, </em>592 F.3d at 70. This waiver is limited only to official and public disclosures made by the same agency providing the <em>Glomar </em>response, and therefore does not \u201crequir[e] [the agency] to break its silence\u201d as a result of \u201cstatements made by another agency.\u201d <em>Frugone v. CIA, </em>169 F.3d 772, 775 (D.C.Cir.1999) (refusing to \u201ctreat the statements of the [Office of Personnel Management] ... as tantamount to an official statement of the CIA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">But we do <em>not </em>impute the FBI\u2019s decision to disclose information about Dr. Florez to the CIA, or suggest that the FBI Disclosures necessarily preclude the CIA\u2019s right to assert a <em>Glomar </em>response. <em>See Wilson v. CIA, </em>586 F.3d 171, 187 (2d Cir.2009) (declining to \u201cinfer official disclosure of information classified by the CIA from ... [the] release of information by another agency\u201d). Rather, we simply conclude that the FBI Disclosures are relevant evidence \u2014 unavailable to the District Court at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the time of its initial decision \u2014 bearing upon the sufficiency of the justifications set forth by the CIA in support of its <em>Glomar </em>response. Put simply, the official acknowledgment doctrine has no impact on our opinion in this case. The Dissent\u2019s exclusive reliance on the official acknowl-edgement doctrine, to create out of whole cloth a rule limiting the evidence a district court may consider in a <em>Glomar </em>inquiry, only serves to demonstrate that it is promoting a solution of no applicability to this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Rather than place an arbitrary limitation on the range of evidence a district court may consider in assessing the sufficiency of an agency affidavit filed in support of a <em>Glomar </em>response, our cases instruct that we accord \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to such affidavits, but only \u201cprovided [that] the justifications for nondisclosure are not controverted by contrary evidence in the record .... \u201d <em>Wilner, </em>592 F.3d at 68 (citation omitted). <em>See also Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr., </em>678 F.3d at 931 (district courts, in <em>Glomar </em>case, may grant summary judgment on the basis of agency affidavits \u201cif they are not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record\u201d). Indeed, categorically excluding public documents as evidence when reviewing a <em>Glo-mar </em>response flies in the face of our own instruction that \u201c[i]n evaluating an agency\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response ... [t]he court should attempt to create as complete a public record as is possible.\u201d <em>Wilner, </em>592 F.3d at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted). It defies reason to instruct a district court to deliberately bury its head in the sand to relevant and contradictory record evidence solely because that evidence does not come from the very same agency seeking to assert a <em>Glomar </em>response in order to avoid the strictures of FOIA. <em>See Gardels, </em>689 F.2d at 1105 (\u201cThe test is not whether the court personally agrees in full with the CIA\u2019s evaluation of the danger \u2014 rather, <em>the issue is whether on the whole record </em>the Agency\u2019s judgment objectively survives the test of reasonableness, good faith, specificity, and plausibility in this field of foreign intelligence in which the CIA is expert and given by Congress a special role.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Having determined that the FBI Disclosures are relevant to the merits of this case, we briefly address why remand is appropriate in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">B. Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Although we conclude that the FBI documents are relevant to this case, our precedent nonetheless permits us to set aside the FBI Disclosures by adhering to the so-called \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201ca FOIA decision is evaluated as of the time it was made and not at the time of a court\u2019s review,\u201d <em>N.Y. Times, </em>756 F.3d at 110 n. 8. In our view, however, departure from that practice is warranted in this instance. Indeed, having now found the FBI Disclosures relevant to the sufficiency of the asserted <em>Glomar </em>rationale, the CIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>asks us to proceed in this precise manner. <em>See </em>CIA Ltr. at 3 n.2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">First, the policy underpinning the general rule does not apply here. As one of our sister circuits has explained, \u201c[t]o require an agency to adjust or modify its FOIA response based on post-response occurrences could create an endless cycle of judicially mandated reprocessing each time some circumstance changes.\u201d <em>Bonner v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>928 F.2d 1148, 1152 (D.C.Cir.1991). This ease features no such judicially mandated reprocessing, as Mr. Florez, not the courts, requested that the CIA modify its FOIA response in light of the FBI Disclosures. Without being directed to do so, the CIA then reviewed those documents and determined not to alter its response to Mr. Florez\u2019s FOIA request after due consideration. <em>See </em>CIA Ltr. at 1 (\u201cThe CIA has reviewed [the FBI Disclosures] and informed [Mr.] Florez\u2019s counsel that they do not alter ... the CIA\u2019s response .... \u201d). Thus, the CIA has already voluntarily undertaken and completed any \u201creprocessing\u201d that could arise from remanding the case to allow the District Court to consider the FBI Disclosures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Second, consideration of the FBI Disclosures is \u201cthe most sensible approach\u201d in this case. <em>N.Y. Times, </em>756 F.3d at 110 n. 8 (rejecting the government\u2019s' argument \u201cthat we cannot consider any official disclosures made after the District Court\u2019s opinion,\u201d and concluding that \u201c[t]aking judicial notice\u201d of \u201congoing disclosures by the Government made in the midst of FOIA litigation\u201d is \u201cthe most sensible approach\u201d); <em>accord ACLU v. CIA, </em>710 F.3d 422, 431 (D.C.Cir.2013) (taking notice of statements post-dating district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment). If we were to proceed to the merits, and therefore potentially affirm the decision of the District Court, without considering the FBI Disclosures, we would accomplish little more than consign Mr. Florez to filing a fresh FOIA request, beginning the process anew with the FBI Disclosures in hand. Such an outcome makes little sense and would merely set in motion a multi-year chain of events leading inexorably back to a new panel of this Court considering the precise question presented here, perhaps in about two-and-a-half years (Mr. Florez\u2019s FOIA request was submitted in November 2013). This delay would not serve the purposes of FOIA or the interests of justice, and it is inefficient to send Mr. Florez back to the end of the line.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the' CIA has already reviewed the FBI docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ments and reaffirmed its <em>Glomar </em>response, we know how the CIA would respond to Mr. Florez\u2019s renewed request, and there is no reason we should not take into account the reality in which this action proceeds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Third, remanding the case is in keeping with our general policy that the trial court should consider arguments \u2014 and weigh relevant evidence \u2014 in the first instance. <em>See Quinones on Behalf of Quinones v. Chater, </em>117 F.3d 29, 36 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cAs the [factfinder] did not address this evidence, we think it best to remand the case so that he can consider in the first instance what weight to accord it.\u201d); <em>Eric. M. Berman, P.C., </em>796 F.3d at 175; <em>Salameh, </em>152 F.3d at 159; <em>accord Sprint/United Mgmt. Co. v. Mendelsohn, </em>552 U.S. 379, 387, 128 S.Ct. 1140, 170 L.Ed.2d 1 (2008) (\u201cRather than assess the relevance of the evidence itself and conduct its own balancing of its probative value and potential prejudicial effect, the Court of Appeals should have allowed the District Court to make these determinations in the first instance, explicitly and on the record.\u201d); <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 293, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982) (chastising the Court of Appeals for \u201cfailing] to remand for further proceedings\u201d after determining that \u201cthe District Court had failed to consider relevant evidence\u201d and instead making \u201cits own determinations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In sum, proceeding to decision while willfully ignoring relevant materials would breed judicial inefficiency and produce an outcome contrary to that which might result from consideration of additional materials that \u2014 through no fault of Mr. Flo-rez\u2019s \u2014 were unavailable to him at the time the FOIA request was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">C. <em>Jacobson </em>Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">In the interests of judicial economy and orderly resolution of this matter, we find prudent a limited remand to the District Court .pursuant to our practice under <em>United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 22 (2d Cir.1994). The remand permits the District Court to reconsider its prior conclusion in light of the FBI Disclosures, and any additional materials it permits the parties to submit, <em>see N.Y. Times, </em>756 F.3d at 110 n. 8 (explaining that the panel granted \u201cthe Government\u2019s request for an opportunity to submit new material concerning public disclosures made after the District Court\u2019s decision\u201d), and then return its determination to us for consideration without the need for a new notice of appeal, briefing schedule, and reassignment to a new panel unfamiliar with the case. <em>See, e.g., N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Children v. Velez, </em>629 Fed.Appx. 92, 94 (2d Cir.2015) (summary order) (remanding pursuant to <em>Jacobson </em>\u201c[b]ecause th[e] issue was not raised in the district court,\u201d and \u201cwe conclude that it should be addressed in the first instance there\u201d); <em>United States v.

Upon the filing of such a letter, the opposing party may file a response of the same maximum length within fourteen days. Oral argument will be scheduled at the panel\u2019s discretion. If neither party files an initial letter within thirty days of the order\u2019s entry, appellate jurisdiction will be restored automatically, and an order affirming the District Court will issue immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We conclude that the FBI Disclosures are relevant to the issues raised in this appeal and that those documents should be considered in this case. Accordingly, we REMAND the case to the District Court with instructions to enter an order that states whether its prior conclusion that the CIA adequately justified its <em>Glomar </em>response must be revised in light of the FBI Disclosures and any post-remand submissions. Either party may restore appellate jurisdiction by filing a letter with the Clerk of this Court, as prescribed above.

Reg. 707, 707 (Dec. 29, 2009), the determinative consideration under Exemption 1, there is no obvious reason why such third party disclosures cannot, in certain instances, likewise permit an inference contradicting an asserting agency\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response under Exemption 3. Indeed, in this case, beyond a separate boilerplate recitation of the Exemption 3 framework, <em>see </em>Joint App'x at 54-56, the CIA has proffered a single general rationale with respect to both Exemptions. <em>See </em>Joint App'x at 43-46. We leave it to the District Court, in the first instance, to assess \u201con the whole record\u201d whether, in light of the recent FBI Disclosures, this rationale \"objectively survives the test of reasonableness, good faith, specificity, and plausibility.\u201d <em>Gardels v.

Indeed, the Dissent appears to recognize as much, repeatedly explaining why these <em>particular </em>disclosures supposedly do not bear upon the CIA's <em>Glomar </em>rationale. For instance, the Dissent touts the fact that the FBI Disclosures \u201cdo not even mention the CIA,\u201d Dissent at 193, or \"even discuss the CIA or its activities,\u201d Dissent at 191. Accordingly, the \"documents here ... are simply not helpful in assessing the logic and plausibility\u201d of the <em>Glomar </em>response at issue. Dissent at 192. <em>See also </em>Dissent at 194-95 (\"[T]hese documents ... are simply not relevant to the question whether the CIA\u2019s justification for its <em>Glomar </em>response <em>in this case </em>is plausible and makes sense\u201d (emphasis in original)). This tacit acknowledgment that <em>certain </em>disclosures from a third party agency might weigh on the validity of a <em>Glomar </em>response (i.e., those expressly referring to the asserting agency or its activities) makes all the more puzzling both the Dissent's refusal to allow the District Court to weigh the facts in the first instance (as the Dissent itself has plainly done) and its insistence on propagating a <em>per se </em>rule barring consideration of third party disclosures on the sufficiency of an agency\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\">. The Dissent attempts to extrapolate this limitation from the \"animating principles\u201d of the official acknowledgment doctrine, which, it contends, bar the \" 'anomalous result\u2019 that disclosures by one agency could open the door to compelled disclosure by another.\u201d <em>See </em>Dissent at 196 n. 7 (quoting <em>Frugone, </em>169 F.3d at 775). Suffice to say, we do not believe that allusion to the \"animating principles\u201d of an inapplicable doctrine serves to vindicate the Dissent\u2019s proposed rule. Moreover, as already explained, this categorical limitation is at odds with the Dissent\u2019s own acknowledgment that <em>certain </em>agency disclosures might, in some hypothetical instances, lead to disclosure by another agency. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dissent at 195.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">.

In such circumstances, it is difficult to discern (to say the least) how these FBI documents could affect, in any way, the adequacy of the <em>CIA\u2019s </em>showing (supported by declaration) that its <em>Glomar </em>response to Florez\u2019s FOIA request was appropriate \u2014 that information regarding the existence or nonexistence of records in the CIA\u2019s possession is exempt from disclosure under two separate FOIA exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The majority principally asserts that the FBI disclosures may call into question whether revealing the existence or nonexistence of records in the CIA\u2019s possession relevant to Dr. Florez reasonably could be expected to result in harm to the national security.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maj. Op. at 17 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6. The FBI records, however, neither address nor cast light on the national security harms that the CIA relied on before the district court in asserting its entitlement-to FOIA Exemption (b)(1): <em>inter alia, </em>that confirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tion of the existence or nonexistence of responsive records reasonably could be ex^ pected to cause damage to the national security by disclosing \u201cwhether or not the <em>CIA </em>has or had an intelligence interest in [Dr.] Florez or his associates,\u201d \u201cwhether or not the <em>CIA </em>engaged in intelligence operations involving him, and the location of those operations,\u201d and whether \u201cthe <em>CIA </em>maintained any human intelligence sources related to an interest in [Dr.] Florez\u201d \u2014 the public revelation of which could jeopardize both human intelligence sources and the Agency\u2019s credibility in maintaining them. <em>See </em>J.A. 49-52 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">These are significant national .security concerns. As the D.C. Circuit has repeatedly noted, sources abroad, fearing retaliation against themselves or family and friends, \u201coften refuse to aid the CIA absent assurances of confidentiality\u201d that logically must be honored \u201ceven decades after the death of the foreign national,\u201d lest the Government\u2019s substantial interest in the effective operation of its foreign intelligence service be thwarted. <em>Wolf v.

The FBI documents here \u2014 which, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s claim to the contrary, \u25a0 disclose little regarding Dr. Florez and say <em>nothing at all </em>about any connection to the CIA \u2014 are simply not helpful in assessing the logic and plausibility of such concerns in the present case. Indeed, the majority\u2019s claim to the contrary hinges on reframing the CIA\u2019s asserted national security interest as involving a generalized concern with \u201cmasking the <em>government\u2019s </em>intelligence interest (if any) in Dr. Florez\u201d \u2014 a reframing that, however subtle, simply gainsays the significant national security concerns associated with and peculiar to the effective operation of this country\u2019s foreign intelligence service. Maj. Op. at 184-85 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">At any rate, all this is somewhat beside the point. For as it turns out, only one of the two exemptions on which the district court based its decision (each of which provides a separate and independent basis for a <em>Glomar </em>response) even requires a showing that confirming or denying the existence of responsive records reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1); <em>see also </em>Exec.

As the Supreme Court has stated, this exemption \u201capplies to records that any other statute exempts from disclosure, thus offering Congress an established, streamlined method to authorize the withholding of specific records that FOIA would not otherwise protect.\u201d <em>Milner v.

I thus cannot agree that these records even potentially affect the conclusion, already drawn by the district court, that the CIA has adequately shown that the claimed exemptions apply by providing \u201cexplanations of potential harm to national security\u201d that are \u201cboth \u2018logical\u2019 and \u2018plausible\u2019 \u201d and by demonstrating that \u201cacknowledging the existence or nonexistence of the records [Florez] seeks could reasonably be expected to lead to the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and methods as well as clandestine intelligence activities,\u201d which are at the core of the functions of Agency personnel. <em>Florez v. C.I.A., </em>2015 WL 728190, *6, *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 19, 2015) (quoting <em>Wilner, </em>592 F.3d at 73).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The majority cannot explain how these FBI documents, which do not even mention the CIA, much less any relationship between the CIA and Dr. Florez, are relevant to assessing the logic and plausibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>of the Agency\u2019s justification for its <em>Glomar </em>response. Faced with this difficulty, the majority faults me for even <em>pointing out </em>that the FBI documents do not mention the CIA, asserting that to do so is inconsistent with my <em>real </em>position that the disclosures of one federal agency \u201care <em>never </em>relevant and must be wholly disregarded\u201d in assessing the propriety of another agency\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response. Maj. Op. 186 (emphasis added). I take no such position, however, as to hypothetical cases not presently before this panel, nor do I pronounce, as the majority repeatedly charges, \u201ca rule limiting the evidence a district court may consider in a <em>Glomar </em>inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187. I do no more than conclude (contrary to the majority) that these FBI documents, suggesting (albeit without particulars, and to a limited degree) that the FBI maintained some interest in Dr. Florez for some period of time, are simply not relevant to the question whether the <em>CIA\u2019s </em>justification for its <em>Glo-mar </em>response <em>in this case </em>is plausible and makes sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The majority also charges me with \u201cexclusive reliance on the official acknowledgment doctrine,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 187, which it says I use to \u201cpropagat[e] a <em>per se </em>rule barring consideration of third party disclosures on the sufficiency of an agency\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 186 n. 8. Again, I urge no such rule. That said, however, I cannot agree that this doctrine is not properly considered in assessing the question whether these FBI documents are relevant to the CIA\u2019s rationale for its <em>Glomar </em>response. Indeed, my conclusion that they are not is only reinforced through more general consideration of the FOIA statute and <em>Glomar </em>doctrine itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The FOIA statute recognizes different agencies\u2019 divergent missions, interests, and methods, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (requiring disclosure on an agency-by-agency basis), and it is well established that the disclosure of material by one agency will not be attributed to another, so as to forestall the second agency\u2019s recourse to appropriate FOIA exemptions. <em>See Wilson v. C.I.A., </em>586 F.3d 171, 186 (2d Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]he law will not infer official disclosure of information classified by the CIA from ... release of information by another agency, or even by Congress.\u201d); <em>see also Moore v. C.I.A., </em>666 F.3d 1330, 1333 n. 4 (D.C.Cir.2011) (release of a document <em>\u201cby the FBI\u201d </em>cannot constitute \u201can official acknowledgment <em>by the CIA\u201d); Frugone, </em>169 F.3d at 774-75 (upholding the CIA\u2019s ability to make a <em>Glomar </em>response despite official disclosure of the same information by the Office of Personnel Management). In the <em>Glomar </em>context specifically, moreover, courts have long recognized the danger in \u201crequiring [an agency] to break its silence\u201d as a result of \u201cstatements made by another agency.\u201d <em>Frugone, </em>169 F.3d at 775. Agencies have different missions. \u201c[I]t is logical to conclude\u201d regarding a foreign intelligence service like the CIA, for instance, \u201cthat the need to assure confidentiality\u201d to human intelligence sources and to foster confidence in such assurances vis-a-vis past, present, and future sources may require \u201cneither confirming nor denying the existence of records\u201d regarding foreign nationals \u2014 whether or not they be subjects of interest or persons with whom the Agency maintained a relation \u2014 for many years. <em>Wolf, </em>473 F.3d at 377; <em>see also Fitzgibbon, </em>911 F.2d at 763-64 (noting \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in protecting both national security information and \u201cthe appearance of confidentiality so essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence service\u201d (quoting <em>Sims, </em>471 U.S. at 175, 105 S.Ct. 1881)). Other agencies may not share this concern at all, or to the same degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The majority acknowledges that, provided an agency has established a proper basis for a <em>Glomar </em>response, an agency is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>not required to break its silence \u201cas a result of \u2018statements made by another agency.\u2019\u201d Maj. Op. at 186 (quoting <em>Frugone, </em>169 F.3d at 775). The majority asserts that this precedent is inapplicable here, however, because the majority is not \u201cimput[ing] the FBI\u2019s decision to disclose information about Dr. Florez to the CIA, or suggesting] that the FBI Disclosures necessarily preclude the CIA\u2019s right to assei\u2019t a <em>Glomar </em>response.\u201d Maj. Op. at 186-87. Instead, the majority asserts, \u201cwe simply conclude that the FBI Disclosures are relevant evidence \u2014 unavailable to the District Court at the time of its initial decision \u2014 bearing upon the sufficiency of the justifications set forth by the CIA in support of its <em>Glomar </em>response.\u201d Maj. Op. at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">But how can these documents be relevant, given that they do not even mention the CIA, when the declarations supporting the CIA\u2019s claimed exemptions are centrally concerned with harms associated with revealing the existence or nonexistence of documents reflecting a classified connection <em>to the CIA, </em>in its role as the United States\u2019 foreign intelligence service? With respect, the majority is cavalier, I conclude, in its dismissal of the official ac-knowledgement doctrine\u2019s relevance to this case. If, on remand, the district court were to determine that the FBI documents render illogical or implausible the CIA\u2019s affidavits (how the district court could reach such a conclusion, given the FBI disclosures themselves, I cannot say), that conclusion <em>would </em>produce the \u201canomalous result\u201d of one agency\u2019s revelations obligating disclosure of classified material by another. <em>Frugone, </em>169 F.3d at 775. The majority\u2019s error in deeming these irrelevant documents germane thus appears to invite by the back door what the official acknowl-edgement doctrine prohibits at the front.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">With respect, I simply cannot see the basis on which these FBI documents are relevant to the <em>Glomar </em>inquiry that the district court has already undertaken. As we have said, \u201c[i]n evaluating an agency\u2019s <em>Glomar </em>response, a court must accord \u2018substantial weight\u2019 to the agency\u2019s affidavits, \u2018provided [that] the justifications for nondisclosure are not controverted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of ... bad faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilner, </em>592 F.3d at 68 (quoting <em>Minier v. C.I.A., </em>88 F.3d 796, 800 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>(9th Cir.1996)); <em>see also Wolf, </em>473 F.3d at 374 (noting that courts \u201cconducting <em>de novo </em>review in the context of national security concerns ... \u2018must accord <em>substantial weight </em>to an agency\u2019s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Miller v. Casey, </em>730 F.2d 773, 776 (D.C. Cir. 1984))). There is no evidence of bad faith here, and the FBI documents are in no way contrary to the justifications for nondisclosure already proffered by the CIA. In such circumstances, a court \u201cshould not conduct a more detailed inquiry to test the agency\u2019s judgment and expertise or to evaluate whether the court agrees with the agency\u2019s opinions.\u201d <em>Larson, </em>565 F.3d at 865; <em>accord Wilner, </em>592 F.3d at 76; <em>see also Students Against Genocide, </em>257 F.3d at 835 (noting that \u201cthe assessment of harm to intelligence sources and methods is entrusted to the Director of Central Intelligence, not to the courts\u201d). To rely on these documents as a basis for remand is to \u201csecond-guess the predictive judgments made by the government\u2019s intelligence agencies\u201d in precisely the manner we have in the past eschewed. <em>Wilner, </em>592 F.3d at 76 (quoting <em>Larson, </em>565 F.3d at 865).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">I conclude, for substantially the reasons set out in the district court\u2019s careful and thorough opinion, that the CIA met its burden in justifying its <em>Glomar </em>response. Because I can discern no basis on which the FBI disclosures draw into question the CIA\u2019s explanations as to why information regarding the existence or nonexistence of records in its possession is exempted from disclosure by FOIA, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to remand and would, instead, affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. This Circuit joined the D.C., First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in recognizing the propriety of a <em>Glomar </em>response in 2009. As this Court then noted, \"[t]he <em>Glomar </em>doctrine is well settled as a proper response to a FOIA request because it is the only way in which an agency may assert that a particular FOIA statutory exemption covers the \u2018existence or nonexistence of the requested records' in a case in which a plaintiff seeks such records.\u201d <em>Wilner v.

In remanding to the district court, the majority suggests that it is proceeding \u201cin [the] precise manner\u201d requested by the CIA. Maj. Op. at 187. This is incorrect. The CIA has asserted that the FBI\u2019s disclosures \"do not affect the disposition of this case,\u201d that the FBI\u2019s decision to release information regarding Dr. Florez \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the propriety of the CIA\u2019s claimed exemptions,\u201d and that, accordingly, the FBI documents \"do not bear on this Court\u2019s consideration of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d Gov\u2019t Letter Br. 2-3. The Government requests remand only in a footnote, <em>id. </em>at 3 n.2, and only in the event that this Court rejects, as it has, the CIA's position that the FBI disclosures lack \"any bearing on this Court\u2019s consideration of the issues raised in this appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b217-12\">. As pertinent here, FOIA Exemption (b)(1), <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1), one of the two separate exemptions on which the CIA's <em>Glomar </em>response was based, requires a showing that confirming or denying the existence of responsive records \"reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security,\u201d Exec. Order No. 13526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707, 707 (Dec. 29, 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-5\">. The majority seriously downplays the significance of the CIA\u2019s reliance on FOIA Exemption (b)(3), contending that \u201cthe CIA has proffered a single general rationale with respect to both Exemptions.\u201d Maj. Op. 18 n.6. This is incorrect. The CIA\u2019s Exemption (b)(3) rationale focuses on the specific statutory provision at issue and the materials it protects\u2014 not on the potential effects of disclosure on the national security. The declaration of Martha M. Lutz, Chief of the CIA\u2019s Litigation Support Unit, states specifically regarding the claimed exemption under the National Security Act, for instance, that \"acknowledging the existence or nonexistence of records reflecting a classified connection to the CIA would reveal information that concerns intelligence sources and methods, which the National Security Act is designed to protect.\u201d J.A. 55. Once the National Security Act has been invoked pursuant to FOIA Exemption (b)(3), our inquiry focuses narrowly on the question \"whether the withheld material relates to intelligence sources and methods.\u201d <em>Larson v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>565 F.3d 857, 865 (D.C.Cir. 2009); <em>see also Fitzgibbon, </em>911 F.2d at 761 (noting that Exemption (b)(3) \"differs from other FOIA exemptions in that its applicability depends less on the detailed factual contents of specific documents; the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statute\u2019s coverage\u201d (quoting <em>Ass\u2019n of Retired R.R. Workers, </em>830 F.2d at 336)). The majority simply elides this distinction between Exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. <em>See also Wolf, </em>473 F.3d at 378 (noting in the context of FOIA Exemption (b)(3) that the Supreme Court \"gives even greater deference to CIA assertions of harm to intelligence sources and methods under the National Security Act\u201d then in the context of the (b)(1) exemption); <em>Students Against Genocide v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>257 F.3d 828, 835 (D.C.Cir. 2001) (same); <em>Fitzgibbon, </em>911 F.2d at 766 (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b220-5\">. The majority contends that the FBI documents reflect that \"the FBI maintained an active interest in Dr. Florez for well over a decade.\u201d Maj. Op. at 185. Even if this were the case, it in no way undercuts the CIA's assertion that information as to the existence or nonexistence of documents in <em>its </em>possession reflecting a classified connection <em>to the CIA </em>constitutes information concerning intelligence sources and methods that is exempt from FOIA disclosure by the National Security Act \u2014 an assertion to which this Court owes deference. <em>See Wolf, </em>473 F.3d at 378; <em>Students Against Genocide, </em>257 F.3d at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"AS5\">At any rate, after careful review, not the \"casual[]\u201d one the majority inexplicably charges me with, <em>see </em>Maj. Op. at 185, I read the FBI disclosures very differently. Far from establishing the FBI\u2019s \"active\u201d interest in Dr. Florez and providing a \"wealth of information\u201d about him, <em>see </em>Maj. Op. at 185, these documents, which total under 60 pages amassed over ten years, offer precious little insight into Dr. Florez beyond basic biographical information and speculation about his personal life. Nearly half of the documents divulge no information about him whatsoever. Some of the more reliable information concerning him, moreover, appears to come from two newspaper clippings among the documents, one announcing his appointment as <em>charge d'affaires </em>in Washington, D.C. and the other his defection from the Castro regime. To be sure, the FBI maintained a file on Dr. Florez and copied certain agencies (not including, of course, the CIA) on certain documents. Bureau offices on occasion exchanged whatever information they had about him, particularly (and unsurprisingly, given the FBI\u2019s domestic counterintelligence orientation) when Dr. Florez was stationed in Washington, D.C. and, years later, when he decided to defect to the United States. The fact that the Bureau periodically communicated the scant information it had concerning Dr. Flo-rez internally and with specified external agencies, however, hardly reveals the kind of defined, concrete interest that could even conceivably be of \"appreciable probative value\u201d in assessing whether the CIA, a separate agency with interests, sources, and methods of its own, met its burden in justifying its <em>Glomar </em>response. <em>Id. </em>at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"A01\">The majority does not even endeavor to set out the string of logical inferences that are necessary to establish the relevance of this material to the CIA\u2019s assertion of FOIA Exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3). It cannot, and for a simple reason. The mere fact that the FBI maintained some interest in a foreign diplomat who was stationed in this country for a period and who eventually defected here \u2014 the only non-conjectural conclusion that one may reach from these documents \u2014 is simply not germane to the question whether the CIA\u2019s invocation of FOIA Exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) is adequately supported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\">. The \u201cofficial acknowledgment\u201d case law, as I read it, has two animating principles. The cases ordering disclosure on the basis of official acknowledgment tend to emphasize the first of these: that an agency, having already disclosed certain classified information, cannot later refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of that information. <em>See, e.g., N.Y. Times Co. v. Dep't of Justice, </em>756 F.3d 100, 122 (2d Cir.2014); <em>Wolf, </em>473 F.3d at 379. The cases rejecting arguments of official acknowledgment, however, at least when those arguments rely on disclosures by a third party (often another agency), point to the harm of using one agency\u2019s disclosures as a \"FOIA backdoor\u201d to obligate another agency to reveal classified information. <em>See, e.g., Wilson, </em>586 F.3d at 186; <em>Frugone, </em>169 F.3d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"AmXJ\">To be sure, these courts did not address the novel theory of relevance before us here. Nevertheless, they uniformly resisted any temptation to reconsider the responding agency\u2019s justification for its <em>Glomar </em>response in light of third party disclosures. As the D.C. Circuit put it in <em>Frugone, </em>in discussing the National Security Act exemption, \"[cjommon sense suggests that [those charged with the protection of intelligence sources and methods] must have authority to maintain secrecy commensurate with [this statutory] responsibility,\u201d notwithstanding another agency\u2019s disclosures. 169 F.3d at 775. Here, although styled as an evidentiary matter distinct from the \"official acknowledgment\u201d doctrine, the majority\u2019s theory of relevance implicates the same concern: that Congress could not have intended the \"anomalous result\u201d that disclosures by one agency could open the door to compelled disclosure by another. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
