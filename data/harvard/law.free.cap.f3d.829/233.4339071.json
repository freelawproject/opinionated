Townes, Judge, denying his amended petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that the prosecution suppressed a psychiatric record of an evaluation of the complainant, in violation of Fuentes\u2019s due process rights, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and that Fuentes\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to prepare cross-examination or call expert witnesses to counter expert testimony introduced by the prosecution. The district court denied the petition on the ground that the State courts\u2019 rejections of Fuentes\u2019s constitutional claims were neither contrary to nor unreasonable applications of clearly established federal law, the standard set by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). On appeal, Fuentes contends principally that the rejection by the New York Court of Appeals of his Brady claim was an unreasonable application of the materiality standard established by Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995), and that the decision of the Kings County Supreme Court \u2014 the highest State court to address his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on the merits \u2014 was an unreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). For the reasons that follow, we conclude, without need to assess the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, that Fuentes\u2019s petition should have been granted with respect to the Brady claim. The contents of the suppressed psychiatric record provided information with which to impeach the complaining witness and to support the defendant\u2019s version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the events. The New York Court of Appeals, as the State concedes, misread the psychiatric record. And although the State argues that the error was harmless, the Court\u2019s conclusion that suppression of the document had no prejudicial effect resulted from its lack of understanding of what the psychiatric record stated, along with its failure to balance the evidence in light of the record as a whole and its inability to appreciate the import of the document in the unique context of this case, where (a) the issue was not whether an alleged rapist was the defendant but instead whether what occurred was a rape rather than a sexual encounter in which the complainant participated willingly, (b) the complainant provided the only evidence that what occurred was a crime, and (c) the withheld document was the only evidence by which the defense could have impeached the complainant\u2019s credibility as to her mental state. We reverse the decision of the district court and instruct that a new judgment be entered, ordering that Fuentes be released unless the State affords him a new trial within 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The present case arises out of the alleged sexual assault by Fuentes on a woman \u2014 referred to herein as \u201cG.C.\u201d \u2014 on the roof of her apartment building in the early morning hours of January 27, 2002. It is undisputed that Fuentes and G.C. had oral and vaginal intercourse on that roof; but the only persons present were G.C. and Fuentes, and the issue for trial was whether the sex was consensual. As set out in greater detail below, G.C., who was 22 years old in January 2002, testified that in the wee hours of January 27 she had gone to an arcade with friends; that a few hours later she left with the same friends to go home; and that when she exited the subway alone near her home, a stranger\u2014 later identified as Fuentes \u2014 followed her home, threatened her with a knife, and raped and sodomized her. In contrast, Fuentes, 23 years old in January 2002, testified that he and G.C. had met in a bar at the arcade, hit it off, left together, went to G.C.\u2019s building for the mutual purpose of having sex, and had done so; however, when G.C. suggested that they see each other again and Fuentes demurred, she became angry and self-deprecating and said he would be sorry. The principal issue on this appeal is whether Fuentes was denied a fair trial by the prosecution\u2019s nondisclosure of the psychiatric record made with respect to G.C. later on January 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">A. The State\u2019s Evidence at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The State\u2019s trial evidence included G.C.\u2019s medical records and the testimony of several witnesses. In addition to G.C., the State\u2019s witnesses included one of the friends who had been with G.C. at the arcade on January 27, two police officers, and expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">1. G.C.\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">G.C. testified that just after midnight on January 27 she, her friend Tammy Little (or \u201cTammy\u201d), and Tammy\u2019s sister, cousin, and mother were in Manhattan at an arcade in Times Square. Some three hours later, G.C. and her friends left to go home to Brooklyn by subway. At the appropriate stop, G.C. left the others and switched to a G train to the Flushing Avenue station, near the Marcy Projects where she lived with her mother and three sisters. While walking home from that subway station, G.C. noticed a man \u2014 identified at trial as Fuentes \u2014 walking behind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">When G.C. entered her building, Fuentes followed her inside. Having \u201ca bad feeling,\u201d G.C. declined to get into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>building\u2019s elevator with Fuentes, intending to use it after he had used it. (Trial Transcript (\u201cTr.\u201d) 368-69.) However, when the elevator returned to the ground floor, Fuentes was still inside. He appeared to be exiting, but as G.C. was entering, he pushed her in and followed her; Fuentes put a knife to her neck, and told her, \u201c \u2018don\u2019t do nothing stupid or I\u2019ll cut you.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at 369-70.) They took the elevator to the sixth floor, the top floor and the floor on which G.C.\u2019s apartment was located; they then walked up a flight of stairs to the roof. Once on the roof, Fuentes forced G.C. to engage in oral and vaginal sex. G.C. did not see a condom and did not recall that one was used. (See id. at 375, 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">They then took the stairs and elevator down, with Fuentes holding his knife to G.C.\u2019s neck. After they exited the building, Fuentes put the knife away, put his arm around G.C.\u2019s shoulders as if she \u201cwas his girlfriend,\u201d and \u201casked [G.C.] to walk with him to the train station.\u201d (Id. at 377.) On the way, Fuentes apologized and said \u201che was going through something.\u201d (Id. at 377-78.) Fuentes told G.C. his mother w\u00e1s from Honduras, and G.C. testified that she \u201cmust have\u201d told him she too was Honduran. (Id. at 403.) Fuentes told G.C. his name was \u201cAlex.\u201d (Id. at 378, 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">When they arrived at the subway station and went down the stairs, Fuentes took G.C.\u2019s cell phone, powered it down, wiped its surface, and returned it to her. He warned G.C. not to call the police. (See id. at 379.) When Fuentes asked G.C. \u201c \u201cwhich side goes to Queens?\u2019 \u201d she informed him they were on the wrong side; they went back up to the street, and Fuentes crossed to the side on which the G train goes to Queens. (See id.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">G.C. watched Fuentes descend toward the Queens-bound platform; she then walked back to her apartment and went to sleep. (See id. at 380-81.) She did not tell her mother she had been raped. Asked why, G.C. responded, \u201c[bjecause she wouldn\u2019t have believed me.\u201d (Id. at 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">When G.C. awoke around noon, she got dressed and went to Tammy\u2019s home, where she told Tammy and Tammy\u2019s sister and mother that she had been raped. After about an hour, G.C. left and went to Woodhull Hospital and reported that she had been raped. A rape kit was prepared, and hospital personnel informed the police. (See id. at 383.) G.C. described her attacker to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">2. Testimony of Tammy Little</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">\u2022 Tammy Little, G.C.\u2019s good friend since high school, testified that she, her mother, and her sister were at the arcade in Times Square with G.C. in the early morning hours of January 27; Tammy testified that the four of them eventually left Manhattan together via subway. (See Tr. 501-02). Tammy did not see Fuentes that night, nor did she see G.C. talk to any men while they were at the arcade. (See id. at 504-05.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Tammy testified that G.C. came to her house in the afternoon on January 27 and told Tammy and Tammy\u2019s mother that she had been raped \u201cwhen she was home, she was going into the building.\u201d (Id. at 503.) Tammy testified that G.C. did not provide any other details; she \u201cdidn\u2019t tell [them] she got raped at knifepoint\u201d (id. at 507):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">Q. And when she told you she got raped, what did she say to you? What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">A. That was it, that she was raped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATm\">(Id.) In response, Tammy and her mother were in shock, did not tell G.C. to call the police, and said nothing. (See id. (\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d).) G.C. departed; Tammy did not know where she went (see id. at 504):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Q. So she came in, told you she was raped and just left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">(Id. at 508.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">3. Police Witness Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Police officer Kevin Fedynak and his partner interviewed G.C. at Woodhull Hospital on January 27. Fedynak testified that G.C. described her attacker as a well-dressed \u201cmale Hispanic, light skin, about six foot two, 200 pounds, going by the name of Alex.\u201d (Tr. 456; see id. at 465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Police detective Steven Litwin testified that two years later, in January 2004, he was informed that the male DNA collected in G.C.\u2019s rape kit matched that of Fuentes. He arrested Fuentes in June of that year. (See id. at 676-78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Litwin had interviewed G.C. in September of 2002 \u2014 her first police interview since January 27, 2002, another detective having made several unsuccessful attempts to interview her in the interim. (See id. at 675-76, 682-83; see also id. at 405-08 (testimony of G.C.).) Litwin testified \u2014 after reviewing the record of his September 2002 interview of G.C. \u2014 that in describing the January 27 events to him, G.C. told him that Fuentes was not on her building\u2019s elevator when it returned to the ground floor; instead, she got on the empty elevator alone, but the elevator then stopped at the second floor. (See id. at 684-85.) (G.C., in her testimony, denied having given Lit-win this version of the event (see id. at 419-20).)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">4. Medical and Expert Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">The record of G.C.\u2019s physical examination at the hospital on January 27 indicated that her appearance was within normal limits, as were her skin, sensory organs,. and alertness. (See Tr. 568-71, 573.). The examination did not rev\u00e9al any bruises, swelling, or lacerations anywhere on her body, or any marks on her neck to indicate any trauma. (See id. at 571-72, 576-77, 586-87 (\u201cno signs of trauma to any\u201d \u201cparts of [G.C.\u2019s] body that were examined\u201d).) On \u201cthe assumption that she [had been] sexually assaulted,\u201d G.C. \u201cwas given prophylactic antibiotics for sexually transmitted diseases.\u201d (Id. at 565.) The examination had revealed \u201cno external or internal trauma ... in the pelvic area.\u201d (Id. at 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">The State called two expert witnesses with respect to the effects of rapes on victims. One, Daniel McSwiggan, was a Woodhull Hospital nurse who was certified in sexual assault forensic examination. McSwiggan, who had not examined G.C., testified that \u201cthe absence of visible trauma to [G.C.\u2019s] vaginal area,\u201d noted during her January 27 pelvic examination, did not mean that she had not been raped. (Id. at 565-66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">The other, Dr. Eileen Treacy, was a psychologist who also had not examined G.C. She testified that \u201ca recognizable pattern of behavior that is exhibited by victims of sexual assault,\u201d called \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d (id. at 646), may include delayed reporting of the event. However, rapes by strangers are \u201creported with higher frequency\u201d than non-stranger rapes. (Id. at 653, 659.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">B. Fuentes\u2019s Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">Fuentes testified in his own defense and called one additional witness. The latter was Aubry Weekes, a private investigator who was a retired New York City detective and who interviewed G.C. for the defense in February 2005. Weekes testified that G.C. told him she had met Fuentes at the arcade and had left with him; she \u201c[s]aid Mr. Fuentes took her home.\u201d (Tr. 711.) (G.C., in her testimony, denied having told Weekes that she met Fuentes at the arcade (see id. at 430-31).) Weekes testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>fled that G.C. did not tell him she had left the arcade with Tammy (see id. at 711); she did not tell him she was raped at knifepoint (see id. at 698); she did not tell him she was raped (see id.).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Fuentes testified that in the early morning hours of January 27, 2002, he and two friends were at the arcade in Times Square, and there he met G.C. in the bar on the second floor. (See id. at 716-18.) Fuentes told G.C. his name was \u201cAlex Fuentes\u201d (id. at 759); he testified that he is called \u201cAlex\u201d although his first name is \u201cJose,\u201d because all of the males in his family have the first name Jose and they all go by their middle names (id. at 716). Fuentes testified that he and G.C. conversed, discussing school, their jobs, their birthdays, their shared connection to Honduras, music, and the Honduran singer \u201cLisa Left Eye Lopez\u201d [sic], (Id. at 719-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Around 4 a.m., Fuentes said he was leaving; G.C. said she was leaving too, and Fuentes suggested that they go to a place near where he lived in Queens, or to his apartment. He and G.C. left the arcade together, taking the R train to Queens, and engaging in kissing, heavy petting, and giggling en route (see id. at 742, 744). However, when Fuentes mentioned that they would need to be quiet in his apartment because a relative was living with him, G.C. told him. that \u201cshe had a better spot [for them] to go to.\u201d (Id. at 723.) Fuentes and G.C. changed trains at Queens Plaza and took the G train to the Flushing Avenue stop. G.C. led Fuentes from the subway station to her apartment building, where she took him to the roof. Once on the roof, Fuentes and G.C. engaged in oral and vaginal intercourse. Fuentes stated that he put on a condom prior to the vaginal intercourse, but that it broke during the act; in the heat of the moment, with G.C.\u2019s encouragement, he continued without one.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">When they were done, Fuentes asked G.C. how to get back to the subway, and she offered to walk with him. (See id. at 754-55.) On the way, G.C. suggested that the two of them \u201cgo to South Street Seaport and basically hang out again.\u201d (Id. at 755.) Fuentes, however, preoccupied with thoughts of the need to get an STD test because he had had unprotected sex with someone he had just met, did not immediately respond. G.C. asked Fuentes if he was listening to her and pointed out that he had not yet asked for her phone number. When Fuentes suggested that they just \u201c \u2018leave things the way they are,\u2019 \u201d G.C. asked if Fuentes thought she was \u201c \u2018a ho.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at 757.) Fuentes assured G.C. that he was not judging her, but reiterated that it was a \u201c \u2018one-night stand\u2019 \u201d and that he would like to \u201c \u2018leave it at that.\u2019 \u201d (Id.) Now upset, G.C. told Fuentes that he must think she was \u201c \u2018a ho\u2019 \u201d and that he was \u201c\u2018going to be sorry.\u2019\u201d (Id. at 757-58.) Fuentes testified that G.C. was so vehement that a subway employee in the booth looked up at them. Because G.C. \u201cwas acting erratic\u201d and seemed \u201cunstable,\u201d Fuentes told G.C. that he was leaving and did not want her phone number. (Id. \u00e1t 758.) When he walked away, G.C. cursed at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">C. The Undisclosed Psychiatric Record</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">While in the middle of his closing argument, Fuentes\u2019s attorney was leafing through the trial exhibits, including the medical records the State had introduced. He discovered among G.C.\u2019s medical records a page \u2014 titled \u201cRecord of Consultation\u201d \u2014 that the prosecution had not produced to the defense. The Record of Consultation (or \u201cROC\u201d) disclosed that when G.C. was at Woodhull Hospital on January 27 having reported she had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>raped, she had a psychiatric consultation. In pertinent part, the Record of Consultation reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">[G.C.] is a 22 y-o Black female, single, living w/ mothe[r], working in Mc-Donalds x 2m, reporting depression x 2y and ideas of killing herself since then, because she has \u201cfamily problems\u201d feeling mistreated by mother, frequent crying spells, withdrawn, lack of energy\u2014 Now, she feels angry at herself \u201cbecause she went home late and put herself a[t] risk\u201d \u2014 Fair sleep \u2014 She has no SI currently and her depression is \u201cas usual\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFQK\">-PPH: (-) \u2014 Substance Abuse Hx: Marijuana use x 2, last y</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar4\">-PMH: Asthma \u2014 LMP: 1/02</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1z\">-MSE: A + 0 x3, mood depressed, denies S/H ideations or A/V hallucinations, no delusions elicited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">IMP: I Dysthymic Disorder: Pt wants someone to talk to about her problems. \u2014 Cannabis Abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">Suggest: Refer to Psych Clinic upon D/C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">(Court Exhibit A-l (emphases added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Upon discovering the previously undisclosed Record of Consultation, Fuentes\u2019s attorney requested a sidebar, and he later moved for a mistrial on the ground that the nondisclosure of the ROC constituted a Brady due process violation. Fuentes\u2019s attorney had been assured by the prosecutor that all of G.C.\u2019s medical records had been turned over (see, e.g., Tr. 843-44), and yet the defense had not been given the Record of Consultation (see, e.g., id. at 844-45). He argued that the cross-examination he could have conducted if he had known of the ROC \u201cwould have had a major effect on th[e] jury\u2019s opinion of [G.C.\u2019s] credibility in this case.\u201d (Id. at 847.) Further, G.C.\u2019s mental health history as shown in the ROC would have substantiated Fuentes\u2019s account of G.C.\u2019s erratic behavior at the subway station, and thus supported Fuentes\u2019s version of the events. (See, e.g., id. at 863-64.) Counsel also pointed out that during her trial testimony, G.C. \u201cbroke down on the stand and cried many times. And the jury could have very easily been led to believe the reason she was crying was the result of this incident. Now, after looking at this psych, record, we find she was crying well before the events of that evening .... \u201d (Id. at 851.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">The prosecutor admitted to the judge that she had intentionally withheld the Record of Consultation from discovery but stated that she did so out of concern for psychiatrist-patient privilege. The court admonished the prosecutor for failing to at least disclose the document to the court to obtain a ruling on discoverability; it reserved judgment on Fuentes\u2019s mistrial motion until after return of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The jury, on its second day of deliberations, found Fuentes guilty of first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy. The court did. not grant a mistrial, having concluded (see id. at 866-67) that the Record of Consultation was not Brady evidence because the document did not contain anything exculpatory. After denying a posttrial motion to set aside the verdict because of the asserted Brady violation, inter alia, the court sentenced Fuentes principally to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">D. The State-Court Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Fuentes appealed his conviction, renewing his contention, inter alia, that the State\u2019s deliberate suppression of the Record of Consultation constituted a Brady violation that denied him a fair trial. The Appellate Division affirmed, stating that \u201c[w]hile the People unquestionably have a duty to disclose exculpatory material in their control, a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial is not violated when, as here, he is given a meaningful opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>to use the allegedly exculpatory material to cross-examine the People\u2019s witnesses or as evidence during his case .... \u201d People v. Fuentes, 48 A.D.3d 479, 479, 851 N.Y.S.2d 628, 628 (2d Dep\u2019t 2008), af'fd on other grounds, 12 N.Y.3d 259, 879 N.Y.S.2d 373, 907 N.E.2d 286 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The New York Court of Appeals, in a 5-2 decision, affirmed, concluding that \u201cthe undisclosed document is not material,\u201d and that therefore, \u201cthe People\u2019s nondisclosure, while ill-advised, does not constitute a Brady violation.\u201d People v. Fuentes, 12 N.Y.3d at 260, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 374, 907 N.E.2d 286. The Court of Appeals majority (or \u201cMajority\u201d) recognized that although all of G.C.\u2019s medical records had supposedly been disclosed to the defense pursuant to the State\u2019s open-file discovery agreement, and they were all introduced in evidence by the State during its direct case, the Record of Consultation, made by a hospital psychiatrist who interviewed G.C. on January 27, had been withheld from discovery.

Impeachment evidence falls within the ambit of a prosecutor\u2019s Brady obligation (see Giglio v United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-155, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 [1972]). To establish a Brady violation, a defendant must show that (1) the evidence is favorable to the defendant because it is either exculpatory or impeaching in nature; (2) the evidence was suppressed by the prosecution; and (3) prejudice arose because the suppressed evidence was material (see Strickler v Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-282, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 [1999]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">People v.

Further, the victim testified in specific detail regarding how defendant took steps to avoid apprehension, including turning her cell phone off and wiping it clean of fingerprints. It is also contrary to common sense to believe that the victim would have invented a rape and subjected herself to an invasive hospital examination in the hope of getting revenge for defendant\u2019s supposed refusal of her advances.

The Federal Habeas Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">In 2011, Fuentes, proceeding pro se, timely commenced the present habeas case, raising multiple constitutional claims. In 2012, following exhaustion of his claims in state court, .the district court appointed counsel to represent him, and the amended habeas petition was filed, asserting only the Brady claim and a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Both claims were rejected by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">The magistrate judge to whom the district court referred Fuentes\u2019s petition for report and recommendation recommended that the petition be granted on the ground that the New York Court of Appeals unreasonably applied the materiality standard for Brady claims set by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Court in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555. The magistrate judge concluded principally that the New York Court of Appeals majority erred (a) in not realizing that the Record of Consultation stated that G.C. had been in a state of depression for two years, (b) in apparently not recognizing that the prosecution\u2019s failure to produce this document deprived Fuentes of the opportunity to investigate and cross-examine G.C. with regard to her mental health history, and (c) in unreasonably discounting the importance of this impeachment material, given that G.C.\u2019s testimony was the only inculpating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The district court, in a Memorandum and Order dated September 30, 2014 (\u201cD.Ct. Ord.\u201d), denied habeas, rejecting the recommendation to grant the writ on the basis of the Brady claim. Although agreeing with the magistrate judge, that the New York Court of Appeals misread the Record of Consultation with respect to the duration of G.C.\u2019s depression, the district court concluded that \u201cit was not clearly established by federal law that the information contained in the ROC was material for Brady purposes,\u201d D.Ct. Ord. at 10-11, because \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has not addressed whether mental health information such as the type contained in the ROC is considered \u2018material\u2019 for Brady purposes,\u201d id. at 12. The district court also stated that the Record of Consultation in no way suggested that G.C. was unable to accurately and truthfully perceive and recall events. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Fuentes moved in this Court for a certificate of appealability, arguing that the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of his Brady claim was an unreasonable application of federal law, and that the State Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was an unreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This Court granted the motion. As we now conclude that the writ should have been granted on the basis of the Brady claim, awarding Fuentes release or a new trial, we do not further address his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">A. AEDPA Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">To the extent pertinent here, AED-PA provides that \u201cwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d a federal court may not grant a state prisoner\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuP\">resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (emphases added). \u201c \u2018[Cjlearly established Federal law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u201d refers to \u201cthe governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d Lockyer v.

In applying this principle, we bear in mind that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule. If a legal rule is specific, the range may be narrow. Applications of the rule may be plainly correct or incorrect. Other rules are more general, and their meaning must emerge in application over the course of time. Applying a general standard to a specific case can demand a substantial element of judgment. As a result, evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule\u2019s specificity.

Due Process and the Prosecutorial Duty of Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\"> The due process principles applicable here are well and clearly established. \u201cThe prosecution [has an] affirmative duty to disclose evidence favorable to a defendant _\u201d Kyles, 514 U.S. at 432, 115 S.Ct. 1555.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). See id., at 86, 83 S.Ct. 1194 (relying on Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935), and Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213, 215-216, 63 S.Ct. 177, 87 L.Ed. 214 (1942)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Kyles, 514 U.S. at 432, 115 S.Ct. 1555. The contours of the duty have progressively been refined. In Brady, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. In United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), the Court held that the duty to disclose such evidence is applicable irrespective of whether the accused made a request. In United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), the Court held that the duty to disclose exists irrespective of whether the information bears on the defendant\u2019s innocence or a witness\u2019s impeachment. And if the withheld evidence contains material for impeachment, it falls within the Brady principles even if it may also be inculpatory: \u201cOur cases make clear that Brady\u2019s disclosure requirements extend to materials that, whatever their other characteristics, may be used to impeach a witness.\u201d Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 282 n. 21, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999); see, e,g., Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">However, the withholding of such evidence does not violate the accused\u2019s due process right unless the evidence is \u201cmaterial,\u201d in the sense that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375. In Banks v. Dretke, 540 U.S. 668, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004), the Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">[o]ur touchstone on materiality is Kyles v.

Kyles instructed that the materiality standard for Brady claims is met when \u201cthe favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d 514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Banks, 540 U.S. at 698, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (emphases ours).

(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">In Strickler, in which the petitioner had been convicted of capital murder, one issue at trial was the identity of the robbers/murderers, and evidence for impeachment of an eyewitness to the robbery had been suppressed. The Supreme Court noted that there was \u201cconsiderable forensic and other physical evidence linking petitioner to the crime,\u201d including: the petitioner\u2019s fingerprints on the inside and outside of the victim\u2019s car; \u201cshoe impressions,\u201d near where the victim\u2019s body was found, \u201cmatching] the soles of shoes belonging to petitioner\u201d; a bag at petitioner\u2019s mother\u2019s house containing identification cards belonging to the victim; and hairs near the victim\u2019s body that \u201cwere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>microscopically alike in all identifiable characteristics to petitioner\u2019s hair.\u201d Strickler, 527 U.S. at 293 &amp; n. 41, 268-69, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Strickler Court approved the rejection of the petitioner\u2019s Brady claim because it was \u201cnot convinced ... that there [wa]s a reasonable probability that the jury would have returned a different verdict\u201d if the testimony of the eyewitness in question \u201chad been either severely impeached or excluded entirely.\u201d Id. at 296, 119 S.Ct. 1936. In sum, \u201cin Strickler, considerable forensic and other physical evidence link[ed] [the defendant] to the crime and supported the capital murder conviction,\u201d Banks, 540 U.S. at 701, 124 S.Ct. 1256 (internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201c[t]he witness whose impeachment was at issue in Strickler gave testimony that was in the main cumulative,\u201d id. at 700, 124 S.Ct. 1256. \u201cIn contrast\u201d in Banks, the Court\u2019s confidence in the verdict was undermined where the testimony of the witness who could have been impeached by the withheld evidence was \u201cthe centerpiece\u201d of the relevant phase of the prosecution\u2019s case. Id. at 701, 124 S.Ct. 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">With these principles in mind, and reviewing the decision of the district court de novo, see, e.g., Contreras v. Artus, 778 F.3d 97, 106 (2d Cir. 2015), we conclude (1) that the district court erred in ruling that federal law as set forth by the Supreme Court did not sufficiently clearly establish that records as to a witness\u2019s mental health may be Brady material, and (2) that the decision of the New York Court of Appeals was an unreasonable application of the above Brady standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">C. The Applicability of Brady to Available Psychiatric Records as Clearly Established by the Supreme Court of the United States</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The district court ruled that AED-PA precludes habeas relief to Fuentes on his Brady claim on the ground that the United States Supreme Court has not sufficiently clearly addressed whether records as to a witness\u2019s mental health, such as the Record of Consultation here showing G.C.\u2019s depression and Dysthymic Disorder, may properly be considered Brady material. We disagree. Based on clearly established fundamental rights and principles, we think it indisputable that if the prosecution has a witness\u2019s psychiatric records that are favorable to the accused because they provide material for impeachment, those records fall within Brady principles, and that the Supreme Court has so recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, see Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403-06, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), guarantees the defendant in a criminal prosecution the right to confront the witnesses against him. This \u201cmeans more than being allowed to confront the witness physically,\u201d for \u201c[t]he main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination,\u201d Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted), and \u201cthe cross-examiner has traditionally been allowed to impeach, he., discredit, the witness,\u201d id. at 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">In particular, a witness\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d may be attacked \u201cby means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand.\u201d Id. (emphases added); see, e.g., United States v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45, 52, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984) (\u201c[b]ias is a term used ... to describe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor of or against a party\u201d (emphasis added)). Cross-examination is especially \u201cimportant where the evidence consists of the testimony of individuals whose memory might be faulty or who, in fact, might be perjurers or persons motivated by malice, vindictiveness, intolerance, prejudice, or jealousy.\u201d Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 496, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959) (emphases added). \u201cA successful showing of bias on the part of a witness would have a tendency to make the facts to which he testified less probable in the eyes of the jury than it would be without such testimony.\u201d Abel, 469 U.S. at 51, 105 S.Ct. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">These principles are sufficiently fundamental that their applicability to. available psychiatric evidence raising questions about the witness\u2019s biases and the reliability of his or her testimony is beyond doubt. In Williams [Michael] v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (\u201cWilliams [Michael]\u201d), one of the Supreme Court\u2019s earliest opinions exploring AED-PA, the Court dealt with a habeas claim that \u201cthe prosecution had violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), in failing to disclose a report of a ... psychiatric examination\u201d of Jeffrey Alan Cruse, the petitioner\u2019s collaborator in robbery and murder who was the main witness against the petitioner at trial. Williams [Michael], 529 U.S. at 427, 120 S.Ct. 1479. The report described Cruse as having feelings of worthlessness and constant suicidal thoughts, see id. at 439, 120 S.Ct. 1479; and at Cruse\u2019s sentencing, his attorney cited the report\u2019s statement that Cruse was suffering from, inter alia, severe depression, see id. at 438, 120 S.Ct. 1479. There was no question that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the psychiatric report could be a proper basis for a habeas petition under Brady: The Supreme Court noted that when Cruse was sentenced, there were \u201crepeated references to a \u2018psychiatric\u2019 or \u2018mental health\u2019 report in [the sentencing] transcript .... with details that should have alerted counsel to a possible Brady claim.\u201d Id. (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Rather, the question facing the Supreme Court was whether, under AEDPA, the petitioner could be given a federal-court evidentiary hearing on the claim, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2) (limiting the right to such a hearing \u201c[i]f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings\u201d). The Supreme Court noted that although \u201c[t]he transcript put petitioner\u2019s state habeas counsel on notice of the report\u2019s existence and possible materiality,\u201d Williams [Michael], 529 U.S. at 439, 120 S.Ct. 1479 \u2014 indeed, \u201cstate habeas counsel\u201d had \u201cattached [a copy of the transcript] to the state habeas petition he filed,\u201d id. at 438, 120 S.Ct. 1479 \u2014 \u201c[p]e-titioner did not develop, or raise, ... the prosecution\u2019s alleged Brady violation regarding Cruse\u2019s psychiatric report until he filed his federal habeas petition,\u201d id. at 429, 120 S.Ct. 1479. The Court thus concluded that Williams was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he had \u201cnot exercise[d] the diligence required to preserve the claim that nondisclosure of Cruse\u2019s psychiatric report was in contravention of Brady.\u201d Williams [Michael], 529 U.S. at 437-38, 120 S.Ct. 1479.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">We think it beyond doubt that the Supreme Court recognizes the application of Brady principles to a witness\u2019s psychiatric records, possessed by the prosecution, that may be used to impeach his credibility, particularly where, as here, the witness\u2019s testimony is the only evidence that there was in fact a crime and the State\u2019s other evidence is not strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>D. The Decision of the New York Court of Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Although the New York Court of Appeals recognized that Brady principles are applicable to impeachment evidence in available psychiatric records, we conclude that its ultimate determination in this case \u2014 that the suppression of the Record of Consultation was not prejudicial \u2014 constituted an unreasonable application of Supreme Court principles for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">First, a materiality analysis requires a careful, balanced examination of the nature and strength of the evidence presented, as well as an evaluation of the potential impact of the evidence on the witness\u2019s credibility. Entirely missing from the Majority\u2019s reasoning is any analysis of how the ROC might have benefited the defense. That failure was due in large part to the fact that the Court of Appeals\u2019 assessment of the Record of Consultation itself was fundamentally flawed because the Majority misread the document. The Majority found that the psychiatric record had \u201cextremely limited utility as impeachment evidence,\u201d People v. Fuentes, 12 N.Y.3d at 265, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 377, 907 N.E.2d 286, believing that it was \u201cunclear\u201d that G.C.\u2019s suicidal thoughts mentioned in that document were not simply \u201cthe result of having been raped only hours earlier,\u201d id. at 264, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 377, 907 N.E.2d 286. However, the Record of Consultation stated precisely that G.C. \u201creport[ed] depression x 2y and ideas of killing herself since then\u201d (Court Exhibit A-l (emphases added)), and the State concedes that \u201cx 2y\u201d means extending for \u201ctwo years\u201d (State\u2019s brief on appeal at 48 (\u201cFuentes is correct that New York Court of Appeals mistakenly concluded that the record of consultation was unclear as to whether the complainant\u2019s suicidal thoughts were present before the incident .... [T]he record of consultation shows that her suicidal thoughts were present as early as two years before the incident.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Thus, the suppressed psychiatric record stated unambiguously that on January 27, 2002, G.C. told the hospital psychiatrist that she had been depressed and suicidal for two years. This information was consistent with the Record of Consultation\u2019s notation of \u201cDysthymic Disorder\u201d (Court Exhibit A-l), a condition whose \u201cessential feature,\u201d according to the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (\u201cDSM-IV\u201d) \u2014 which is \u201can objective authority on the subject of mental disorders,\u201d Fuller v. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., 423 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir. 2005) \u2014 is a \u201cchronically depressed mood that occurs for most of the day more days than not for at least 2 years,\u201d DSM-IV at 345, with symptoms that may include \u201clow self-esteem,\u201d id. at 345, 347. Among \u201cthe most commonly encountered symptoms in Dys-thymic Disorder may be feelings of inadequacy\u201d and \u201cexcessive anger,\u201d id. at 346; and the \u201cchronic mood symptoms may contribute to interpersonal problems or be associated with distorted self-perception,\u201d id. at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Thus, while the Court of Appeals majority, not recognizing the actual content of the psychiatric record, viewed its impeachment value as \u201cat best, minimal,\u201d the information as to G.C.\u2019s chronic depression and Dysthymic Disorder would have, inter alia, provided a way to cross-examine G.C. as to her mental state, and potentially corroborated Fuentes\u2019s account of her behavior as \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cerratic\u201d when he declined to see her again, to wit, being angry and volubly upset at being rejected. (Tr. 757-58.) And, importantly, timely disclosure of the ROC would have provided defense counsel with an opportunity to seek an expert opinion with regard to the ROC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>indication of other significant symptoms, in order to establish reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors because of G.C.\u2019s predisposition toward emotional instability and retaliation \u2014 an opinion he was able to obtain after he eventually learned of the psychiatric record but not in time to present it to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In short, given the Majority\u2019s inaccurate reading of the ROC, its application of the Brady principles to the instant case was objectively unreasonable because of its inability to make a reasonable assessment of the benefits to the defense of exploring G.C.\u2019s mental state as revealed in the ROC.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Second, the Majority also found that suppression of the Record of Consultation did not result in prejudice' in part because of \u201cthe strength of the People\u2019s case,\u201d stating that Fuentes\u2019s version of the events was \u201cimplausible],\u201d People v. Fuentes, 12 N.Y.3d at 265, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 377, 907 N.E.2d 286, and \u201cwas contradicted in several key respects,\u201d id. at 264, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 377, 907 N.E.2d 286. This did not reflect a careful, balanced, or fair examination of the nature and strength of the evidence presented, for it both overstated the strength of the State\u2019s case and disregarded evidence that supported the plausibility of Fuentes\u2019s version.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Contrary to the Majority\u2019s depiction, the State\u2019s other evidence was not overwhelming. In only one respect was Fuentes\u2019s version contradicted by evidence other than the testimony of G.C. herself. As there was no disagreement that intercourse in fact occurred, the presence of semen in G.C.\u2019s vagina did not contradict Fuentes\u2019s version. As the State\u2019s DNA expert testified, \u201cthere isn\u2019t\u201d a test for whether a sexual encounter was \u201cconsensual\u201d (Tr. 618-19); \u201c[a]ll I can tell you is his semen is present\u201d (id. at 619).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Nor did the other medical evidence contradict Fuentes\u2019s version, for there was no affirmative scientific evidence that force had been used against G.C. The hospital examination revealed no trauma or abnormality, external or internal, in G.C.\u2019s pelvic area \u2014 or indeed anywhere on her body. Instead, the State\u2019s expert medical evidence consisted of testimony that the \u201cabsence\u201d of trauma (and the lack of a prompt rape report) did not mean that there had not been rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Tammy Little\u2019s testimony that G.C. left Manhattan with Tammy and family was the only evidence, other than G.C.\u2019s own testimony, that contradicted Fuentes\u2019s version of the events. As the Court of Appeals dissenters noted, credibility was central; and indeed, the jury, during its deliberations, requested rereading of the testimonies of various witnesses, including Tammy (see Tr. 859, 872). If the jury had also had before it the information from G.C.\u2019s psychiatric record that was consistent with Fuentes\u2019s testimony, it could well have questioned the credibility of Tammy, especially in light of her description of G.C. as coming to Tammy\u2019s home and announcing \u2014 without detail \u2014 that she had been raped (see id. at 507 (Tammy\u2019s testimony that G.C. said \u201cthat she was raped\u201d; \u201c[t]hat was it\u201d); id. at 508 (\u201cshe came in, told [us] she was raped and just left\u201d)) \u2014 and of the response of Tammy and her mother, doing nothing and saying nothing (id. at 507).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The only other evidence that the Court of Appeals could cite as contradicting Fuentes\u2019s version of the events was the testimony of G.C. herself. The Majority cited Strickler in mentioning the materiality element of a Brady claim; but this case was nothing like Strickler, where there was ample forensic evidence on the key issue (see, e.g., Part II.B. above) and the testimony of the witness in question was cumulative. Here, there was no forensic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>evidence of rape; G.C.\u2019s testimony was the sine qua non of the State\u2019s case. Without her testimony, there could be no prosecution at all. The Majority could not properly conclude that the suppression of evidence impeaching G.C. would be of little value because of G.C.\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">This is particularly so in light of several significant red flags in G.C.\u2019s testimony, which were nowhere adverted to in the Majority\u2019s opinion. For example, the Majority did not mention that G.C. admitted on cross-examination that she had shared some of her personal details with Fuentes, including her Honduran descent and probably her birthday (see Tr. 402-03). That testimony could be viewed in a different light had the jury been aware of the ROC. In addition, there were aspects of G.C.\u2019s trial testimony describing the event that were contrary to what other witnesses testified G.C. had told them. For example, she testified at trial that Fuentes pushed her into the elevator on the ground floor (id. at 369-70); but Detective Litwin testified that G.C., when interviewed, told him that when the elevator returned to the ground floor it was empty, that she got in, but then it stopped on the second floor (see id. at 684-85; but see id. at 419-20 (G.C. denying that she had given Litwin that version)). Further, G.C. testified that Fuentes had taken her cell phone, powered it down, and used his sleeve to wipe it clean of his fingerprints after they went into the subway station (see Tr. 379); but Officer Fedynak testified that when he and his partner interviewed G.C. on January 27, she had not described that action as taking place in the subway; instead, G.C. told them Fuentes took her phone and wiped it off in the elevator on the way down after she and Fuentes had left the roof (see id. at 465) \u2014 action that would seem to have been impossible if, as G.C. testified at trial (see id. at 376-77), he was holding a knife to her neck during that entire time. In addition, Weekes, a retired police detective, testified that G.C. told him (though at trial' she denied so telling him (see id. at 430-31)) that she had met Fuentes at the arcade, and that Fuentes \u201ctook her home\u201d (id. at 711). Nor is it clear how Fuentes would have known to take G.C. to the roof of her building, had he just been a stranger following her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Lastly, in assessing Fuentes\u2019s version of the events as implausible, the Majority made no mention whatever of the fact that Fuentes told G.C. his name. G.C. testified that he told her his name was \u201cAlex\u201d (Tr. 378, 428); she so informed the police officers who interviewed her at the hospital (see id. at 456 (testimony of Officer Fedy-nak)); and Fuentes testified he had told her his name (see id. at 759). It was thus beyond dispute that Fuentes told G.C. his name; what was in dispute was where and when that occurred. And, as an objective matter, it seems more plausible that he would have told her his name when meeting and talking with her in a bar than after stalking her from the subway and raping her.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The Majority thus significantly overstated the strength of the State\u2019s case, and it concluded unreasonably that Fuentes\u2019s version of the events was \u201ccontrary to common sense,\u201d People v. Fuentes, 12 N.Y.3d at 265, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 377, 907 N.E.2d 286. At trial, the jury deliberated for two days considering which version to accept, asking for, inter alia, read-backs of the testimonies of G.C., Fuentes, and Tammy. As the Court of Appeals dissenters noted, \u201cthe issue of credibility was central to the jury\u2019s consideration of the case,\u201d id. at 266, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 378, 907 N.E.2d 286. See United States v. Gil, 297 F.3d 93, 104 (2d Cir. 2002) (noting, where the key \u201cquestion hinged on credibility,\u201d that the jury\u2019s \u201cstruggle]\u201d with that question\u2014 evinced by its request for read-backs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>testimony \u2014 was relevant to the determination of materiality). Accordingly, far from evaluating the \u201ctrial testimony as a whole,\u201d People v. Fuentes, 12 N.Y.3d at 264 n.*, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 376 n.*, 907 N.E.2d 286, the Majority ignored substantial aspects of the testimony, thereby overstating the strength of the State\u2019s case, and in so doing failed to make a reasonable assessment of how the ROC could benefit the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Third, the Majority\u2019s assessment of the Record of Consultation as having \u201cat best, minimal\u201d value was based in part on its view that the ROC would have \u201cstrengthened\u201d the State\u2019s case by corroborating G.C.\u2019s testimony that she had walked home from the subway alone. Id. at 264, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 376-77, 907 N.E.2d 286. But reliance on potentially inculpatory aspects of the suppressed document is not a proper application of Brady principles. See, e.g., Strickler, 527 U.S. at 282 n. 21, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (rejecting the prosecution\u2019s contention that documents were not Brady material because they were \u201cinculpatory,\u201d stating that \u201c[o]ur cases make clear that Brady\u2019s disclosure requirements extend to materials that, whatever their other characteristics, may be used to impeach a witness\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Finally, the Majority failed to consider the unique importance of this evidence. We do not suggest that a prior history of depression or even suicidality by itself necessarily constitutes material impeachment evidence. But the Majority focused on the absence of any indication that G.C. suffered from hallucinations or delusions, see People v. Fuentes, 12 N.Y.3d at 264, 879 N.Y.S.2d at 377, 907 N.E.2d 286; the lack of notation as to a cognitive disorder, however, was not significant in the circumstances here, where the key issue at trial was not whether G.C. was impaired as to her perceptions. The question was not G.C.\u2019s ability to identify Fuentes as the man in question but rather her motivation for accusing Fuentes of engaging in conduct to which she had not consented; and the Record of Consultation was pertinent to the issue of her motivation because it identified a relevant mood disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">At bottom, the trial record presented two diametrically opposing versions of what happened, and the jury had to decide whether G.C.\u2019s version of the events, despite Fuentes\u2019s version, should be believed beyond a reasonable doubt. G.C.\u2019s testimony was the only evidence that what occurred on the rooftop was a rape rather than a sexual encounter in which she was a willing participant; Fuentes\u2019s version was that the encounter was consensual and that G.C. thereafter became angry and vindictive when it became clear that he did not want to see her again. If the jury had been aware of the psychiatric record revealing that G.C. suffered from a chronic disorder characterized by low self-esteem, feelings of inadequacy, and excessive anger \u2014 and if counsel had been able to develop this line of defense further by obtaining in time for trial a psychiatric opinion that was obtainable only after the belated discovery of the withheld Record of Consultation \u2014 the jury could well have given greater credence to Fuentes\u2019s version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">In sum, the suppressed psychiatric record provided the only evidence with which the defense could have impeached G.C. as to her mental state and explained why she might have fabricated a claim of rape. The Majority\u2019s failure to consider the context of this impeachment evidence renders its Brady-materiality analysis objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Court of Appeals majority\u2019s determination that G.C.\u2019s psychiatric record had no more than minimal value was based principally on (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>its failure to understand what that Record of Consultation stated, (b) its failure to recognize weaknesses in the State\u2019s case, (c) its impermissible reliance on the fact that the ROC also contained information that could be considered consistent with G.C.\u2019s accusation, (d) its reliance on the content of the testimony of G.C. herself, the witness to be impeached, and (e) its failure to consider the uniquely important nature of the ROC in these circumstances, where G.C. provided the only evidence that Fuentes\u2019s conduct was a crime and where the ROC was the only evidence by which the defense could have impeached G.C.\u2019s credibility as to her mental state. In light of these failures and in light of evidence in the record as a whole that was not mentioned by the Majority and that was consistent with Fuentes\u2019s version of the events, we conclude that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision that the State\u2019s suppression of G.C.\u2019s psychiatric record was not prejudicial was an objectively unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. The State\u2019s suppression of the psychiatric record, which would have revealed a disorder that both provided a basis for questioning G.C.\u2019s credibility and provided further support for Fuentes\u2019s version of the events, undermines confidence in the outcome of Fuentes\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We have considered all of the State\u2019s arguments in support of the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 decision and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for entry of a new judgment ordering that Fuentes be released unless the State affords him a new trial within 90 days.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-5\">.

Accordingly, in an effort to protect both individual liberty and federalism, a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus in disagreement with a state court\u2019s decision only if that decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). In order to hold that a state court\u2019s decision was an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law, a federal court must conclude \u201cthat there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief,\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 98, 131 S.Ct. 770, and that \u201cthere [was] no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court\u2019s decision conflicts with [the Supreme] Court\u2019s precedents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 102, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>131 S.Ct. 770.

Critically, our review must defer to the decision, <em>i. e., </em>the substantive conclusion, reached by the state court \u2014 not the reasoning it employed to reach that decision. Our Circuit adopted this position in 2001, stating candidly, \u201c[W]e are determining the reasonableness of the state courts\u2019 \u2018decision,\u2019 not grading their papers.\u201d <em>Cruz v.

The Supreme Court has reinforced this approach in two cases applying deferential review to state court decisions entirely lacking any explanation of their reasoning. <em>See Johnson v.

But, as discussed above, we are to determine whether there is \u201cany reasonable argument\u201d that the ROC was not material under the <em>Brady </em>standard, <em>Premo, </em>562 U.S. at 123, 131 S.Ct. 733, not parse the state court opinion for \u201cdeficient reasoning,\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>255 F.3d at 86. In other words, we must conclude not only that the suppression of the ROC creates a \u201c\u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result\u201d and \u201cundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial,\u201d <em>Kyles v.

By way of overview, dysthymic disorder is \u201ca chronically depressed mood,\u201d accompanied by \u201cat least two of the following additional symptoms\u201d: \u201cpoor appetite or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, low energy or fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration or difficulty making decisions, and feelings of hopelessness.\u201d DSM-IV, at 345. In other words, a chronically depressed mood is the only symptom that exists in every diagnosis of dysthymic disorder; to make a diagnosis, a doctor must conclude that two (or more) of the other listed symptoms are present, but the specific two may vary among individual cases. Importantly, therefore, the existence of a diagnosis alone does not indicate which of the possible additional symptoms are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Furthermore, although \u201cchronic\u201d carries a connotation of severity in common parlance, in the context of dysthymic disorder, it simply means \u201cpresent for more days than not over a period of at least 2 years.\u201d DSM-IV, at 343; <em>see also Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), </em>The Mayo Clinic, http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder/ home/ove-20166590 (last visited July 11, 2016) (characterizing dysthymia as \u201ca continuous long-term (chronic) form of depression\u201d). Dysthymic disorder is considered \u201cless severe\u201d than \u201cMajor Depressive Disorder,\u201d which involves episodes of at least two weeks in which the depressive mood is \u201cpresent for most of the day, nearly every day.\u201d DSM-IV, at 343. The DSM-IV estimates that, at any given time, three percent of the population suffers from dysthymia, and another three percent has suffered from it in the past. <em>See id. </em>at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The majority\u2019s analysis takes the general description of this disorder and runs with it. Without any evidence that G.C. actually experienced any such symptoms, the majority ominously warns that dys-thymic disorder \u201cmay\u201d also be accompanied by \u201cfeelings of inadequacy,\u201d \u201cexcessive anger,\u201d \u201cinterpersonal problems,\u201d or \u201cdistorted self-perception.\u201d Majority Op., <em>ante, </em>at 249 (internal quotation marks omitted). It then converts generally associated features that \u201cmay be\u201d present in people who suffer from this disorder into a conclusion that \u201cG.C. suffered from a chronic disorder <em>characterized by </em>low self-esteem, feelings of inadequacy, and excessive anger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252 (emphasis added). This analytical leap is simply untenable: these symptoms are not part of the \u201cDiagnostic Features\u201d of the disorder, DSM-IV, at 345-46, but instead are part of the DSM-IVs \u201cAssociated Features\u201d category, <em>id. </em>at 346-47, which is a category describing \u201cclinical features that are frequently associated with the disorder but that are not considered essential to making the diagnosis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 256. In other words, the fact that these symptoms <em>may </em>appear in individuals with the disorder cannot be extrapolated as characteristics of the disorder for every individual suffering from dysthymic disorder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No aspect of the record here indicates that the doctor diagnosed G.C. with these specific associated features; while the ROC mentions that G.C. experienced difficulty with her mother, frequently cried, and was angry at herself \u201cbecause she went home late and put herself at risk,\u201d J.A. 536 (internal quotation marks omitted), these statements are hardly diagnoses of \u201cexcessive\u201d anger or systemic \u201cinterpersonal problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The majority then says, incredibly, that this generic description of the possible associated features of a minor depressive disorder \u2014 a disorder that between roughly 4.5 and 9.5 million people will experience this year<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201cpotentially corroborated Fuentes\u2019s account of her behavior as \u2018unstable\u2019 and \u2018erratic\u2019 when he declined to see her again, to wit, being angry and volubly upset at being rejected.\u201d Majority Op., <em>ante, </em>at 249 (emphasis added). First, there is simply no connection between the symptoms actually diagnosed in the ROC and this conclusion. Second, potentially corroborating Fuentes\u2019s account is not enough. To grant habeas relief, the majori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ty has to conclude not only that the suppression of this record \u201cundermines confidence\u201d in the verdict, <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555 (internal quotation marks omitted), but also that it does so to such an overwhelming level of objective certainty that no fairminded jurist could disagree, <em>see Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Some psychiatric history evidence unquestionably will be so material to witness or victim credibility that the only objectively reasonable conclusion is that its suppression violates <em>Brady. </em>This evidence, however, is not in that category. Cases in which courts have held mental health histories so clearly material under <em>Brady </em>that habeas relief is warranted \u2014 including all the ones on which Fuentes relies \u2014 uniformly show a significantly higher severity of diagnosis and a significantly stronger nexus between the nature of the disorder and its effect on the particular witness\u2019s credibility. In <em>Browning v. Trammell, </em>for example, the psychiatric report described \u201ca severe mental disorder\u201d that made the prosecution\u2019s \u201cindispensable witness\u201d \u201chostile, assaultive, combative, and even potentially homicidal\u201d with a tendency to \u201cblur reality and fantasy and project blame onto others.\u201d 717 F.3d 1092, 1106 (10th Cir. 2013); <em>see also Gonzalez v. Wong, </em>667 F.3d 965, 982-84 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding psychiatric reports to be material where they detailed a history of deceitful and manipulative behavior by a witness as well as symptoms of schizophrenia, implicating his \u201ccompetency to perceive accurately and testify truthfully\u201d). The Third Circuit found a mental health evaluation of an eyewitness showing blackouts, dissociative tendencies, poor judgment, and distorted perceptions of reality to constitute material impeachment evidence. <em>See Wilson v. Beard, </em>589 F.3d 651, 665-66 (3d Cir. 2009); <em>cf. United States v. Pryce, </em>938 F.2d 1343, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (reversing conviction based on failure to permit cross-examination of an eyewitness on the basis of recent hallucinations). The Ninth Circuit held that the withholding of expert reports on a developmentally disabled victim\u2019s ability to understand consent was sufficiently material to warrant habeas relief. <em>See Bailey v. Rae, </em>339 F.3d 1107, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2003). Into the company of mental health characteristics that are clearly and expressly tied to a critical component of witness credibility, the majority adds \u201ca chronically depressed mood that occurs for most of the day more days than not for at least 2 years.\u201d DSM-IV, at 345. One of these things is not like the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Despite Fuentes\u2019s arguments to the contrary, this ease is not analogous to a single-eyewitness case containing a withheld witness statement that the witness \u201c \u2018would not know [the perpetrators] if [he] saw them,\u2019 \u201d directly contradicting the witness\u2019s statement on the stand that he had \u201c[n]o doubt\u201d about the defendant\u2019s identity, <em>Smith v. Cain, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 627, 629-30, 181 L.Ed.2d 571 (2012) (second and third alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, each side presented one corroborating witness: the prosecution presented Tammy Little, who testified that Fuentes had not met G.C. at the arcade as he claimed, and the defense presented a private investigator, who testified that G.C. had told him that the sexual activity was consensual. Though the majority recounts at length ways in which G.C.\u2019s version of events could be attacked, <em>see </em>Majority Op., <em>ante, </em>at 249-53, these facts were all known to the jury as a basis for contesting G.C.\u2019s testimony. Nothing in the ROC contradicted her testimony, nor did it provide non-speculative evidence that G.C.\u2019s mental state included a propensity to react in an emotionally disturbed or vindictive manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to a one-night stand\u2019s refusal to see her again.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Instead, both Fuentes and the majority rely on rampant speculation about symptoms not diagnosed in the psychiatric report in order to claim its materiality. None of the suppositions made about G.C. \u2014 that she would become irrational after rejection or that whatever emotional reaction she had would manifest in a false accusation of rape \u2014 is supported by the record that was before the state court. <em>See Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 181, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (\u201c[R]eview under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d). Although Fuentes appeals to the potential for further investigation by defense counsel, as did the state court dissenters, the record provides no basis to think that further investigation <em>would </em>\u2014 as opposed to <em>might </em>\u2014 have uncovered actual symptoms in G.C. supporting Fuentes\u2019s characterization of her as emotionally volatile or manipulative. <em>See Wood v. Bartholomew, </em>516 U.S. 1, 6, 116 S.Ct. 7, 133 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995) (per curiam) (reversing Ninth Circuit\u2019s grant of habeas relief on <em>Brady </em>grounds \u201cbased on mere speculation\u201d that suppressed polygraph results \u201cmight have led respondent\u2019s counsel to conduct additional discovery that might have led to some additional evidence that could have been utilized\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A speculative appeal to possible symptoms \u2014 which the excluded document gives us no reason to believe G.C. experienced \u2014 is simply not a basis on which to hold a state court\u2019s decision \u201cso lacking in justif\u00edcation that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The majority opinion identifies no Supreme Court precedent that squarely addresses psychiatric reports in the <em>Brady </em>context, such that finding no materiality here can be truly be called \u201can unreasonable application of[] clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Smith v.

(\u201cWhen there is no Supreme Court holding on a given issue, \u2018it cannot be said that the state court unreasonably] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law1 within the meaning of AEDPA.\u201d (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 77, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006))). Its only attempt is to cite <em>Williams [Michael] v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), a case in which the Court decided the petitioner could not receive an eviden-tiary hearing on, <em>inter alia, </em>his claims of suppression of a psychiatric report. <em>Williams [Michael], </em>however, did not examine the materiality of a psychiatric report; rather, it concerned whether the petitioner had developed the factual basis for his arguments in state court under \u00a7 2254(e)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 440, 120 S.Ct. 1479. It is well established in federal habeas law that we must consider only the holdings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not the dicta, of Supreme Court cases. <em>See, e.g., Musladin, </em>549 U.S. at 74, 127 S.Ct. 649 (citing <em>Williams [Terry] v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). Concluding that <em>Williams [Michael] </em>implies the <em>Brady </em>materiality of all psychiatric reports is not applying clearly established federal law. Even if the case were about materiality, however, the psychiatric report in <em>Williams [Michael] </em>showed severe mental health conditions, possessed by the specific witness and with an indisputable impact on his credibility: the report detailed the main cooperating eyewitness\u2019s, \u201clittle recollection of the [murders], other than vague memories, as he was intoxicated with alcohol and marijuana at the time\u201d and also detailed his post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, and overwhelming guilt and shame for his participation in the murders. <em>Williams [Michael], </em>529 U.S. at 438-39, 120 S.Ct. 1479 (internal quotation marks omitted). Like the examples from other circuits cited above, there can be no reasonable disagreement that such information about a key eyewitness seriously calls into question the credibility of his testimony. The same cannot be said for the ROC, which itself contains no information tending to impeach G.C.\u2019s testimony or to portray her as emotionally volatile or vindictive. <em>Williams [Michael] </em>simply does not create a clearly established rule on the materiality of psychiatric reports and especially not of those that do not facially impeach witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The majority has, in essence, grounded its decision on concerns with what it views to be analytical errors in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion. But even a clearly erroneous decision does not satisfy the standard for granting the writ. <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 75, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). While focusing on whether or not the Court of Appeals accurately analyzed the record, the majority has \u201call but ignored the only question that matters under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u201d \u2014 namely, \u201cwhether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that [the state court\u2019s decision] [is] inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of th[e] [Supreme] Court.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770 (internal quotation \u2019marks omitted). As a result, the majority has committed the same error for which the Supreme Court criticized the Ninth Circuit in <em>Harrington:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4P\">The Court of Appeals appears to have treated the unreasonableness question as a test of its confidence in the result it would reach under <em>de novo </em>review: Because the Court of Appeals had little doubt that [the petitioner\u2019s] claim had merit, the Court of Appeals concluded the state court must have been unreasonable in rejecting it. This analysis overlooks arguments that would otherwise justify the state court\u2019s result and ignores further limitations of \u00a7 2254(d), including its requirement that the state court\u2019s decision be evaluated according to the precedents of this Court. It bears repeating that even a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted). Given that there is no specific holding from the Supreme Court on psychiatric records under <em>Brady, </em>we are left with the highly general <em>Kyles </em>standard, which by necessity creates \u201cmore leeway ... in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>541 U.S. at 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140. A decision that the ROC does not create a reasonable probability of a different verdict is simply not outside of that leeway. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Perhaps it is the prosecutor\u2019s intentional decision to exclude the ROC from a purported open-file discovery without disclosing that fact to the defendant or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>court that draws the majority\u2019s ire. It is certainly inexcusable for a prosecutor to represent that everything has been produced when it has not \u2014 and even more inexcusable to answer a direct question by the court by detailing G.C.\u2019s various physical examinations in the hospital but omitting the psychological evaluation. <em>See </em>J.A. 177-78.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014 the Supreme Court has told us that no greater remedy is available under <em>Brady </em>for a prosecutor\u2019s intentional violation of constitutional standards than for an inadvertent one. <em>See Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Thus, we are bound to the narrow questions of whether the evidence was favorable, suppressed, and material. <em>See Poventud v. City of New York, </em>750 F.3d 121, 133 (2d Cir. 2014) (en banc). In no universe does a conclusion that this one-page, minimally probative document is not prejudicial under <em>Brady </em>constitute an \u201cextreme malfunction ] in the state criminal justice system[]\u201d; instead, the majority has engaged in \u201cordinary error correction\u201d of the kind we are forbidden by Congress to undertake. <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770 (internal quotation marks omitted). And in making just such an error correction, the majority\u2019s dissatisfaction with the prosecutor\u2019s conduct and the state courts\u2019 treatment of the record has led to its misapplication of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and Supreme Court precedent framing the deferential nature of our habeas review.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">.

See 22 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 1200, Rule 3.3(a) (\"A lawyer shall not knowingly ... make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer .... \u201d); <em>id. </em>Rule 3.4(a)(1) (\"A lawyer shall not ... suppress any evidence that the lawyer or the client has a legal obligation to reveal or produce .... \u201d); <em>id. </em>Rule 3.8(b) (\"A prosecutor ... shall make timely disclosure ... of the existence of evidence or information known to the prosecutor ... that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the sentence, except when relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of a tribunal.\u201d); <em>id. </em>Rule 4.1 (''[A] lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a third person.\u201d). Accordingly, I have directed the Clerk of the Court to forward copies of the majority opinion and this dissent to the Grievance Committee for the Second, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Judicial Districts in the Second Department in order that they may consider whether the prosecutor in this case breached her ethical obligations in a manner warranting professional discipline.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
