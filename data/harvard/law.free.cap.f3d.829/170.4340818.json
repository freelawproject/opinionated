The district court sentenced him to 130 months in prison due, in part, to the court\u2019s finding that Blow qualified as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1. Section 4B1.1 enhances a defendant\u2019s offense level under the Guidelines if the defendant, <em>inter alia, </em>has at least two previous convictions for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). \u201cCrime of violence\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">[A]ny offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-15\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, <em>or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-16\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7-4B1.2(a) (emphasis added). The,italicized portion of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) is known as the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">Blow, having previously challenged his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, now moves for leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. He argues that his \u00a7 4B1.1 sentence enhancement was rendered unconstitutional by <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). In that case, the Supreme Court declared that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), was unconstitutionally vague. The ACC\u00c1 provides for a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for defendants convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) if they have three prior \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d or \u201cserious drug offense[s].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d contains a residual clause that is identical to the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Blow claims that one of his two prior convictions that the district court found to be crimes of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) was a Vermont conviction for aggravated domestic assault under 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 1043(a)(3). This conviction, he asserts, could only have qualified as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause, and is therefore no longer a valid basis for enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1 after <em>Johnson. </em>The Government opposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the motion on the grounds that <em>Johnson </em>is not retroactive to cases on collateral review challenging Guidelines sentencing range calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">This Court must deny leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 claim unless, in relevant part, it \u201ceontainfs]\u201d \u201ca new rule <em>of </em>constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h)(2). This Court may authorize the filing of a successive \u00a7 2255 motion only if the movant has made a prima facie showing that the proposed motion satisfies the successive criteria. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C); <em>see Bell v. United States, </em>296 F.3d 127, 128 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (stating that the prima facie standard applies to \u00a7 2255(h) motions). \u201cA prima facie showing is not a particularly high standard. An application need only show sufficient likelihood of satisfying the strict standards of \u00a7 2255 to \u2018warrant a fuller exploration by the district court.\u2019\u201d <em>Bell, </em>296 F.3d at 128 (quoting <em>Bennett v. United States, </em>119 F.3d 468, 469 (7th Cir. 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Supreme Court has held that <em>Johnson </em>announced a new rule of constitutional law that is retroactive on collateral review. <em>Welch v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016). Furthermore, the statutory language that was found unconstitutionally vague in <em>Johnson </em>is identical to the language in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) now challenged by Blow. However, there are conflicting decisions in other circuits as, to the question of whether <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Welch </em>apply to Guidelines provisions. The Eleventh Circuit held, in a direct appeal involving a <em>Johnson </em>based challenge to the \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) residual clause, that Guidelines provisions cannot be attacked as unconstitutionally vague. <em>United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185, 1196 (11th Cir. 2015). But other circuits have rejected that conclusion. <em>See United States v. Madrid, </em>805 F.3d 1204, 1212 n. 10 (10th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>803 F.3d 931, 933 (8th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>638 Fed.Appx. 172, 178 n. 14 (3d Cir. 2015) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in another Eleventh Circuit case to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>the precise question at issue here \u2014 whether <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively to \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause. <em>See Beckles v. United States, </em>No. 15-8544, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2510, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2016 WL 1029080 (U.S. Jun. 27, 2016). The Eleventh Circuit in <em>Bedeles </em>affirmed the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) residual clause based on <em>Johnson </em>partially on the grounds that the opinion in <em>Johnson </em>does not purport to affect anything other than the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Beckles v. United States, </em>616 Fed.Appx. 415, 416 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (unpublished). But the Fourth Circuit recently decided, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit, to grant a motion to file a .successive \u00a7 2255 motion raising the same issue, concluding, in part, that <em>Johnson </em>announced a substantive rule that shortened the reach of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), and the decision\u2019s effect was thus retroactive under <em>Welch. In re Hubbard, </em>No. 15-276, 825 F.3d 225, 229-35, 2016 WL 3181417, at *3-6 (4th Cir. Jun. 8, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">In sum, there is substantial disagreement among other circuits on the question on which the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in <em>Bedeles. </em>On consideration, we conclude that Blow has made a prima facie showing that his claim satisfies \u00a7 2255(h) and warrants fuller exploration by the district court. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED, and the case is transferred to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. However, because the Supreme Court will likely de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cide in <em>Beckles </em>whether <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively to the Guidelines, the district court is instructed to hold Blow\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion in abeyance pending the outcome of <em>Beckles. </em>The district court is free to consider termination of the stay, on motion or sua sponte.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
