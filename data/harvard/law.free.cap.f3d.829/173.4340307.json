(with its successor, defendant Bear Stearns Companies L.L.C., \u201cBear\u201d) and the lawsuit filed by SRM Global Master Fund Limited Partnership (\u201cSRM\u201d), a registered private investment fund, against Bear, Bear\u2019s officers, and Bear\u2019s auditor, defendant De-loitte <em>&amp; </em>Touche L.L.P. (\u201cDeloitte\u201d). The principal question presented is whether the class action tolling rule set forth in American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974), applies to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(2), the five-year statute of repose that limits the time in which plaintiffs may bring claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, see Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 650, 130 S.Ct. 1784, 176 L.Ed.2d 582 (2010). We hold that American Pipe tolling does not apply to \u00a7 1658(b)(2). As we explain below, we also conclude that SRM failed adequately to allege that it relied on any misrepresentations in making investment decisions, an element of its common law fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">SRM\u2019s complaint alleges the following facts, which we assume to be true and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Cruz v. FXDirectDealer, LLC, 720 F.3d 115, 118 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">In the years prior to Bear\u2019s collapse in 2008, Bear and its officers made material misstatements and omissions that overstated the value of Bear\u2019s assets, the adequacy of Bear\u2019s capital reserves and liquidity, and the quality of Bear\u2019s risk management and valuation procedures. Deloitte falsely certified that the Form 10-Ks that Bear filed for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 presented fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">In 2007 and 2008 SRM purchased Bear common stock and entered into swap agreements based on the value of Bear common stock. Two specific allegations in the complaint relate to SRM\u2019s decision to purchase or sell stock, or enter into or unwind the swap agreements, in rebanee on the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations. First, SRM abeges that it read and relied on the misrepresentations in Bear\u2019s 2006 Form 10-K \u201cin its analysis of Bear and in deciding whether it should purchase Bear securities.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 31. Second, SRM alleges that it read and relied on Deloitte\u2019s misrepresentations in Bear\u2019s 2006 and 2007 Form 10-Ks \u201cin its analysis of Bear and in deciding whether it should liquidate, retain or increase its investment in Bear.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 101. SRM also asserts \u201cholder claims,\u201d alleging that it retained its Bear stock and decided not to unwind the swap agreements in reliance on the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>After Bear collapsed, the defendants were sued in a series of putative class actions that were eventually consolidated and settled. At its request, SRM was excluded from the settlement class. It instead filed this complaint in April 2013, asserting that the defendants had made material misrepresentations in violation of SEC Rule 10b-5 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and had also committed common law fraud under New York law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Relying on \u00a7 1658(b)(2), the defendants moved to dismiss SRM\u2019s complaint as time-barred. SRM responded that the statute of repose in \u00a7 1658(b)(2) was tolled by the filing of a putative class action complaint against Bear and the individual defendants in March 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Sweet, J.), rejected SRM\u2019s argument based on our decision in Police &amp; Fire Retirement System of City of Detroit v. IndyMac MBS, Inc., 721 F.3d 95 (2d Cir. 2013). The District Court held that American Pipe tolling does not apply to \u00a7 1658(b)(2), and that SRM\u2019s Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims were therefore time-barred. It dismissed SRM\u2019s Section 20(a) claims for failure to state a primary violation of Section 10(b). And it also dismissed SRM\u2019s common law fraud claims, holding that New York law does not recognize holder fraud claims and that SRM failed adequately to plead reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"A5T\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7b\">A. SRM\u2019s Federal Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Under the tolling rule set forth in American Pipe, \u201cthe commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\u201d 414 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. 756. Section 1658(b)(2), however, is not a statute of limitations. It is a statute of repose, which \u201cis not a limitation of a plaintiffs remedy, but rather defines the right involved in terms of the time allowed to bring suit.\u201d P. Stolz Family P\u2019ship L.P. v. Daum, 355 F.3d 92, 102, 104 (2d Cir. 2004) (identifying \u00a7 1658(b)(2) as a statute of repose); see Merck &amp; Co., 559 U.S. at 650, 130 S.Ct. 1784 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">In IndyMac, we held that American Pipe tolling does not apply to the statute of repose in Section 13 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77m, which limits the time in which plaintiffs may bring actions under Sections 11 and 12(a) of that Act. IndyMac, 721 F.3d at 112. Noting that Section 13 is a statute of repose, we explained that if viewed as a form of equitable tolling American Pipe tolling does not apply to Section 13 because \u201ca statute of repose is subject only to legislatively created exceptions, and not to equitable tolling.\u201d Id. at 106, 109 (quotation marks omitted). Nor could it apply, we concluded, if American Pipe tolling is legal in nature and based on Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \u201c[S]tatutes of repose create a substantive right in those protected to be free from liability after a legislatively-determined period of time.\u201d Id. at 106 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cPermitting a plaintiff to file a complaint ... after the repose period set forth in Section 13 of the Securities Act has run would therefore necessarily enlarge or modify a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tive right and violate the Rules Enabling Act [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b) ],\u201d which \u201cforbids interpreting Rule 23 to \u2018abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 109 (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2561, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">For the reasons we provided in IndyMac, we hold that American Pipe tolling does not apply to \u00a7 1658(b)(2)\u2019s five-year statute of repose. First, as a statute of repose, \u00a7 1658(b)(2) is not subject to-equitable tolling, see id. at 106, 109; and second, it creates a substantive right in defendants to be free from liability after five years \u2014 a right that American Pipe tolling cannot modify without running afoul of the Rules Enabling Act, see id.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">SRM argues that the textual differences between Section 13 and \u00a7 1658(b)(2) \u2014 in particular, Section 13\u2019s \u201cin no event\u201d language \u2014 distinguish IndyMac.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But we did not base our holding in IndyMac on Section 13\u2019s \u201cin no event\u201d language. There is no reason to think that it is that particular phrase that secures for defendants in actions under Sections 11 and 12(a) of the Act a substantive right to be free from liability after three years. Nor do any other textual differences between Section 13 and \u00a7 1658(b)(2) dissuade us from concluding that IndyMac applies to \u00a7 1658(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Because the complaint fails to allege that the defendants made any misrepresentations within five years of the filing of SRM\u2019s complaint, SRM\u2019s Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims are time-barred under \u00a7 1658(b)(2)\u2019s five-year statute of repose. And because SRM fails to state a claim under Section 10(b), we agree with the District Court that its Section 20(a) claim \u201cmust also fail for want of a primary violation.\u201d ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Tr. of Chi. v. JP Morgan Chase Co., 553 F.3d 187, 207 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">B. SRM\u2019s Common Law Fraud Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">We turn next to SRM\u2019s common law fraud claims under New York law, all of which were dismissed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">To plead a common law fraud claim under New York law, a \u201cplaintiff must allege facts to support the claim that it justifiably relied on the alleged misrepresentations.\u201d ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Goldman, Sachs <em>&amp; </em>Co., 25 N.Y.3d 1043, 1044 (2015). SRM\u2019s complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a plausible claim that it purchased or sold stock, or entered into or unwound swap agreements, in reliance on the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint\u2019s only relevant factual allegations' assert that SRM relied on the misrepresentations in Bear\u2019s 2006 Form 10-K \u201cin its analysis of Bear and in deciding whether it should purchase Bear securities,\u201d Joint App\u2019x 31 (emphasis added), and that it relied on Deloitte\u2019s misrepresentations in Bear\u2019s 2006 and 2007 Form 10-Ks \u201cin its analysis of Bear and in deciding whether it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>liquidate, retain or increase its investment in Bear,\u201d Joint -App\u2019x 101 (emphasis added). Neither these allegations nor any others specifically plead, as necessary to SRM\u2019s common law fraud claims, that SRM actually purchased or sold stock, or actually entered into or unwound a swap agreement, in reliance on the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations. Without such an allegation, we conclude, SRM\u2019s common law fraud claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The same is true of SRM\u2019s holder fraud claims. As noted above, the District Court held that New York courts do not recognize holder fraud claims, relying principally on two recent First Department cases. Special App\u2019x 24-25 (citing Bank Hapoalim B.M. v. WestLB AG, 121 A.D.3d 531, 995 N.Y.S.2d 7, 11 (1st Dep\u2019t 2014) and Starr Found. v. Am. Int\u2019l Grp., Inc., 76 A.D.3d 25, 901 N.Y.S.2d 246, 248-50 (1st Dep\u2019t 2010)). We need not decide whether New York law permits holder fraud claims, because even assuming that it does, SRM has failed to point us to any part of its complaint that adequately alleges reliance on any misrepresentations in deciding to hold rather than sell its stock. See Cont\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Mercadante, 222 A.D. 181, 225 N.Y.S. 488, 491 (1st Dep\u2019t 1927); see also In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 109, 117 (2d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[I]t is well established that we can affirm the dismissal of a complaint on any basis supported by the record.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed SRM\u2019s holder fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We have considered SRM\u2019s other arguments, including those made in its letter filed pursuant to Rule 28(j) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\">. SRM also alleged violations of Section 18 of the Exchange Act but does not appeal the District Court\u2019s dismissal of those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-12\">. That complaint was subsequently consolidated with other putative class action complaints. Deloitte was a defendant in the consolidated class action lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. Section 13 provides in relevant part, \"In no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created under section 77k or 771(a)(1) of this title more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public, or under section 771(a)(2) of this title more than three years after the sale.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77m. Section 1658(b)(2) states that \"a private right of action ... may be brought not later than ... 5 years after such violation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b203-14\">. Because the complaint fails to meet the Twombly pleading standard, we do not consider whether the stricter pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) apply to the reliance element of SRM\u2019s common law fraud claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
