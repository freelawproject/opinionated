Since the filing of Jeffries\u2019 petition for rehearing en banc, our court has ruled that the Supreme Court has not applied <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) to the career offender sentencing guidelines defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>nition in United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>In re Arnick, </em>826 F.3d 787, 2016 WL 3383487 *1, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 11030 *2 (5th Cir. Jun. 17, 2016).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">2. Even assuming arguendo that <em>Johnson </em>does apply to the residual clause of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), nowhere in his belated briefing to our court last year, his petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court, or his petition for rehearing, has Jeffries demonstrated that he was sentenced under the residual clause. It is certainly not \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d under plain error review that his conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02 for the crime of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon causing physical injury to which he pleaded guilty is not a \u201cuse of force\u201d conviction under 4B1.2(a)(l) or an enumerated offense under Application Note 1 to \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Guzman, </em>797 F.3d 346 (5th Cir. 2015); <em>cf. Beckles v. United States, </em>No. 15-8544, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2510, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2016 WL 1029080, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 4142 (U.S. Jun. 27, 2016)(granting certio-rari on a case involving whether a sawed-off shotgun is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)); <em>United States v. Soto-Rivera, </em>811 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2016)(addressing crime of felon in possession of a firearm under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) and application notes); <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>619 F.3d 474 (5th Cir. 2010)(plurality opinion addressing whether crime of possession of a sawed-off shotgun was a crime of violence). The Supreme Court did not strike down the \u201cuse of force\u201d prong in <em>Johnson </em>and, indeed, since that time has applied a similar \u201cuse of force\u201d prong in a case of a reckless assault. <em>Voisine and Armstrong v. U.S., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2272, 195 L.Ed.2d 736 (2016)(\u201cuse of force\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) includes reckless assault).</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
