Pursuant to ORS 250.067(1), the challenging parties submitted to the Secretary of State timely written comments on the earlier, proposed ballot title. Consequently, they are entitled to bring these challenges to the certified ballot title. ORS 250.085(2) and (5). On review, we modify the ballot title and certify.it as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The text of the proposed initiative measure provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\u201cThe Constitution of the State of Oregon is amended by creating a new section to be added to and made a part of Article 1. The new section shall be known as \u2018The Minority Status and Child Protection Act\u2019 and will read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">\u201cSection 41: MINORITY STATUS BASED ON HOMOSEXUALITY PROHIBITED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\u201c(1) In the State of Oregon, including all political subdivisions and government units, minority status shall not apply to homosexuality; therefore, affirmative action, quotas, special class status or special classifications such as \u2018sexual orientation,\u2019 \u2018domestic partnerships\u2019 or similar designations shall not be established on the basis of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">\u201c(2) Children, students and employees shall not be advised, instructed or taught by any government agency, department or political unit in the State of Oregon that homosexuality is the legal or social equivalent of race, color, religion, gender, age or national origin; nor shall public funds be expended in a manner that has the purpose or effect of promoting or expressing approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">\u201c(a) The State of Oregon, political subdivisions and all units of state and local government shall not grant marital status or spousal benefits on the basis of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">\u201c(b) The State of Oregon, political subdivisions and all units of state and local government, with regard to public employees, shall generally consider private lawful sexual behaviors as non-job related factors, provided such factors do not disrupt the work place and that such consideration does not violate subsections (1) and (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201c(c) Though subsections (1) and (2) are established and in effect, no unit of state or local government shall deny to private persons business licenses, permits or services otherwise due under existing statutes; nor deprive, nullify, or diminish the holding or exercise of any rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Oregon or the Constitution of the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">\u201c(d) Though subsections (1) and (2) are established and in effect, this section shall not limit the availability in public libraries of books and materials written for adults which address homosexuality, provided access to such materials is limited to adults and meets local standards as established through the existing library review process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\u201c (3) The PEOPLE INTEND, that if any part of this enactment be found unconstitutional, the remaining parts shall survive in full force and effect. This Section shall be in all parts self-executing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The Attorney General certified the following ballot title to the Secretary of State for the proposed initiative measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: GOVERNMENTS CANNOT BAR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS, APPROVE HOMOSEXUALITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall constitution bar laws forbidding discrimination against homosexuals, prohibit spending public funds in manner promoting or expressing approval of homosexuality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends state Constitution. Governments cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">\u201c \u2014 bar discrimination against homosexuals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">\u201c\u2014 advise or teach children, students, employees that homosexuality equates legally or socially with race, other protected classifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">\u201c \u2014 spend public funds in manner promoting or expressing approval of homosexuality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-13\">\u201c\u2014 grant spousal benefits, marital status based on homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-14\">\u201cMeasure nonetheless allows adult library books addressing homosexuality with adult-only access.

Public employees\u2019 private lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>sexual behaviors considered non-job related if workplace undisrupted, consideration complies with measure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Under ORS 250.085(4), we review ballot titles for substantial compliance with ORS 250.035 and 250.039.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner Mabon, one of the chief petitioners for the proposed initiative measure, challenges portions of the caption, the question, and the summary. Petitioners Norman and Kaufman challenge only the final sentence of the summary. We address the parties\u2019 arguments in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">ORS 250.035(l)(a) requires a caption of not more than ten words that \u201creasonably identifies the subject of the measure.\u201d In this case, Mabon objects to the portion of the caption that reads \u201cGOVERNMENTS CANNOT BAR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS.\u201d Mabon contends that, with that portion of the caption, the Attorney General has not reasonably identified the <em>subject </em>of the measure, but rather has speculated about a potential <em>effect </em>of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">This court has held that \u201c[t]he Caption requires only <em>identification </em>of the subject matter of the measure; it should not be * * * a vehicle for conclusions about how a measure may affect legal rights and duties.\u201d <em>Bauman v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 490, 494, 789 P2d 258 (1990) (emphasis in original). In this case, we do not agree that the Attorney General has engaged in \u201cspeculation\u201d in describing the measure as one that will prevent governments from barring discrimination against homosexuals. As discussed more fully below, there can be no question that that will be one of the effects of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>measure. Nevertheless, as noted, the role of the caption is reasonably to identify the measure\u2019s <em>subject. </em>We are not convinced that the Attorney General\u2019s caption, which emphasizes one particular <em>effect </em>of the measure, accomplishes that purpose. <em>See Ransom v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 654, 662, 791 P2d 489 (1990) (noting that a proposed caption focused inappropriately on the measure\u2019s \u201cperceived effects,\u201d rather than on its subject).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">If enacted, the impact of this measure would be broader than the effect that the Attorney General has chosen to emphasize in the caption. The measure would not simply prevent governments from extending the protection of anti-discrimination laws to homosexuals; it would prevent governments from creating any classifications based on homosexuality. (For further discussion of this point, see <em>infra, </em>317 Or at 414-15.) The certified caption is phrased too narrowly to communicate this broad impact of the measure. <em>See Baker v. Keisling, </em>312 Or 385, 391-92, 822 P2d 1162 (1991) (narrow phrasing of caption would cause voters to be informed inaccurately of the scope and coverage of the measure; court certified alternative caption).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Mabon contends that \u201c[t]he subject of the measure, from its own language, is a restriction on government from granting minority status based upon homosexuality.\u201d Thus, he asks this court to certify a caption that reads: \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION, GOVERNMENT CANNOT APPROVE, GRANT MINORITY STATUS FOR HOMOSEXUALITY.\u201d However, the concept of government \u201cgranting minority status\u201d to homosexuals has no recognized meaning outside of this measure, the phrase is not self-defining, and the measure does not itself define the phrase except as it is defined by the words of the measure following the clause, \u201cminority status shall not apply to homosexuality.\u201d Thus, use of the term \u201cminority status\u201d in the caption would do little to inform the voters of the measure\u2019s subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">That said, we nonetheless could include the phrase in the caption, albeit partially undefined, by putting it in quotation marks. <em>See, e.g., Baker v. Keisling, supra </em>(words \u201cbehaviors,\u201d \u201cabnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse,\u201d \u201csexual orientation,\u201d \u201csexual preference,\u201d and \u201cquotas, minority status, affirmative action, or similar concepts,\u201d found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>proposed measure, included in ballot title). That is not a desirable course. Circumstances occasionally may compel the Attorney General (or this court) to use quotation marks around a word or a phrase from a proposed measure, but doing so runs the risk of creating a negative impression of the measure \u2014 some voters may interpret such a choice to suggest that the writer of the ballot title is at a loss to figure out <em>what </em>the measure means. If we can avoid the use of quotation marks and still keep faith with our statutory task, we shall do so. In this case, we believe that it is possible. The proposed measure\u2019s subject is the relationship between governments and homosexuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">We conclude that the following caption substantially complies with the requirement that the caption reasonably identify the \u201csubject\u201d of the measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP1\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: GOVERNMENTS CANNOT APPROVE, CREATE CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON, HOMOSEXUALITY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">THE QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">ORS 250.035(l)(b) requires a question of not more than 20 words that \u201cplainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure.\u201d The chief purpose is \u201cthe most significant aim or end which a measure is designed to bring about.\u201d <em>Glerum v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 22, 28, 774 P2d 1093 (1989). In this case, Mabon objects to the Attorney General\u2019s question because, according to Mabon, \u201cthe phrase, \u2018bar laws forbidding discrimination against homosexuals,\u2019 reaches beyond the unambiguous language of the measure and assumes secondary effects.\u201d As with the caption, Mabon asks this court to certify a question employing the term \u201cminority status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">As we noted above (and as we explain more fully below), we do not agree with Mabon\u2019s contention that the Attorney General has engaged in speculation in concluding that one effect of the measure will be to prevent governments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>from barring discrimination against homosexuals. That effect is certain. Nor do we agree with Mabon that any such effect will be \u201csecondary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Nevertheless, we are not convinced that that effect, which the Attorney General has chosen to emphasize in the question, is the \u201cmost significant aim or end which [the] measure is designed to bring about.\u201d As noted above and discussed below, the impact of the measure is broader than preventing the government from extending the coverage of anti-discrimination laws to homosexuals; it prohibits government from creating any classifications based on homosexuality. Moreover, as we previously have noted, \u201c[t]o be of most help to the voter, the question should build on, and be consistent with, the caption.\u201d <em>Baker v. Keisling, supra, </em>312 Or at 392. Therefore, we certify the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">QUESTION: Shall constitution bar governments from creating classifications based on homosexuality or spending public funds in manner expressing approval of homosexuality?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">THE SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">ORS 250.035(l)(c) requires \u201c[a] concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d In this case, Mabon objects to use of the phrase \u201cbar discrimination against homosexuals\u201d in the summary. He contends that, \u201c[i]n predicting a secondary effect, the Attorney General has departed from the strict impartiality required.\u201d Again, Mabon asks this court to use the phrase \u201cminority status,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe proper approach is to confine the analysis, as much as possible, to the words actually employed in the text of the measure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">This court has held that \u201c[speculation about potential secondary effects has no place in any part of [a] ballot title.\u201d <em>Bauman v. Roberts, supra, </em>309 Or at 495. However, as we have noted already, the Attorney General\u2019s description of the measure as one that will prevent governments from barring discrimination against homosexuals is not based on speculation. Neither is such an effect \u201csecondary.\u201d On the contrary, the idea expressed in the challenged sentence flows directly from the wording of the measure itself and describes one of the major effects of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The measure in this case provides that \u201cminority status shall not apply to homosexuality.\u201d Although, as noted above, the concept of \u201cgranting minority status\u201d to homosexuals does not have a recognized meaning outside of this particular measure, the measure itself undertakes to define the concept. Specifically, the measure provides that \u201cminority status shall not apply to homosexuality; <em>therefore, </em>affirmative action, quotas, special class status or special <em>classifications such as \u2018sexual orientation,\u2019 </em>\u2018domestic partnerships\u2019 or similar designations <em>shall not be established </em>on the basis of homosexuality.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) By inclusion of the clause following the word \u201ctherefore,\u201d the measure defines, at least in part, the meaning of the reference in the antecedent clause to \u201cminority status.\u201d Thus, the measure itself gives meaning to the concept of \u201capplying\u201d or \u201cgranting minority status\u201d to homosexuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">One meaning of that concept, as provided for in the measure, is a prohibition against establishing \u201cspecial class status or special classifications such as \u2018sexual orientation,\u2019 \u2018domestic partnerships\u2019 or similar designations * * * on the basis of homosexuality.\u201d Under the terms of the measure, then, if a government body were to establish a classification of \u201csexual orientation\u201d based on homosexuality, that action would constitute the forbidden practice of granting or applying \u201cminority status\u201d to homosexuals. There can be no question that an anti-discrimination law that included within its protected classifications \u201csexual orientation,\u201d defined to include homosexuality, would fall within the scope of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the Attorney General has not \u201c[s]peculat[ed] about potential secondary effects\u201d of the measure in describing the measure as barring laws that prohibit discrimination against homosexuals. There remains, however, Mabon\u2019s contention that the words of the measure should control.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">This court has held that, \u201c[i]n general \u2014 and absent a compelling reason to the contrary \u2014 the Attorney General should use the actual language of the measure in the Summary.\u201d <em>Sampson v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 335, 340, 788 P2d 421 (1990). It also has been said that, \u201c[w]hen the language in the measure is unambiguous, it is not the job of the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>General or of this court to substitute its interpretation of the measure for the language of the measure itself.\u201d <em>Oregon Citizen\u2019s Alliance v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 599, 606-07, 783 P2d 1001 (1989) (Carson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In this case, Mabon advocates use of the term \u201cminority status,\u201d because that term appears in the measure itself. However, as we noted above, the concept of government \u201cgranting minority status\u201d has no recognized meaning outside of this measure. Thus, use of the term \u201cminority status\u201d in the summary would not help the voters understand one of the major effects of the measure \u2014 the ban on laws prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals. Helping the voters understand that effect is a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d for the Attorney General\u2019s divergence from the language of the measure itself. We decline Mahon\u2019s invitation to certify the alternative ballot title that he has proposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Our rejection of Mahon\u2019s specific arguments does not end our discussion, however. There are at least two different things wrong with the four-word statement, \u201cbar discrimination against homosexuals.\u201d The first lies in the use of a chain of three words, \u201cbar discrimination against,\u201d that have the combined effect of creating a triple negative. All three, \u201cbar,\u201d \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d and \u201cagainst,\u201d include the idea of opposition. Such awkward phrasing should be avoided where possible. Likewise, the use of the word \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d while accurate, is better avoided (if possible), because of the negative context in which that word normally is used. While surely not intended that way by the Attorney General, saying that governments cannot oppose discrimination can be a \u201cloaded\u201d description. The same ideas are communicated in a less pejorative manner by deleting the challenged four-word description and substituting the following: \u201ccreate classifications based on homosexuality.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Finally, we consider the challenge brought by petitioners Norman and Kaufman to the final sentence of the summary. That sentence reads: \u201cPublic employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behaviors considered non-job related if workplace undisrupted, consideration complies with measure.\u201d Norman and Kaufman contend that \u201cthe last four words make the sentence so awkward and obscure that most voters will have no idea what it means.\u201d They have proposed the following alternative: \u201cPublic employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behaviors may be cause for discharge, if those behaviors disrupt workplace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The final sentence of the summary attempts to summarize the following portion of the measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cThe State of Oregon, political subdivisions and all units of state and local government, with regard to public employees shall generally consider private lawful sexual behaviors as non-job related factors, provided such factors do not disrupt the work place and that such consideration does not violate subsections (1) and (2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We agree that the Attorney General\u2019s attempt to summarize this provision is too unclear to be left in the summary of the measure. The Attorney General admits that the sentence is \u201cdifficult to read\u201d and does not oppose the alternative proposed by Norman and Kaufman, providing that one further change is made: the Attorney General contends that the alternative sentence \u201cwould be more accurate and neutral if it used the term \u2018personnel action\u2019 rather than discharge.\u201d Petitioners agreed to that change at oral argument. We, too, agree. Therefore, we incorporate the alternative sentence, with the Attorney General\u2019s change, into the summary that we certify.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We make one other adjustment in the final paragraph. The second sentence, which begins with the phrase, \u201c[gjovernment also cannot,\u201d should, for consistency, be moved up to the compendium of other things that government is forbidden by the proposed measure to do. Thus, there will be added, after the \u201cGovernments cannot\u201d phrase, the following item: deny constitutional rights, services due to existing statutes.\u201d The last paragraph of the ballot title is rewritten to provide: \u201cMeasure nonetheless allows adult library books addressing homosexuality with adult-only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>access. Public employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behaviors may be cause for personnel action, if those behaviors disrupt workplace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The following ballot title is certified for the proposed initiative measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: GOVERNMENTS CANNOT APPROVE, CREATE CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON, HOMOSEXUALITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">QUESTION: Shall constitution bar governments from creating classifications based on homosexuality or spending public funds in manner expressing approval of homosexuality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">SUMMARY: Amends state Constitution.
