Therefore, they are entitled to petition this court seeking different titles. ORS 250.085(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The first proposed ballot measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cArticle I, section 8, of this Constitution shall not be interpreted to prevent the People, the Legislative Assembly, or any City or County from enacting laws regulating or prohibiting obscenity, to the extent permitted by the United States Constitution. For purposes of this section the term \u2018obscenity\u2019 shall have the meaning given it by the United States Supreme Court, and in addition shall also include child pornography.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The Attorney General certified the following Caption, Question, and Summary for the ballot title of that measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: NO FREE SPEECH PROTECTION FOR OBSCENITY, CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall state constitution say that free speech clause may not be read to ban laws against obscenity, including child pornography?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">\u201cSUMMARY: This constitutional amendment concerns the meaning of Article I, section 8, the state constitution\u2019s free speech guarantee. The state supreme court has said that section bans laws against obscenity, but has not said whether it bans laws against child pornography. The measure prevents reading that section to ban state and local laws against obscenity, to the extent the United States Constitution allows such laws. The measure defines \u2018obscenity\u2019 to have the meaning given by the United States Supreme Court, and also to include child pornography.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Petitioners challenge the certified Caption, Question, and Summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">The second proposed ballot measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201cArticle I, section 8, of this Constitution shall not be interpreted to prevent the People, the Legislative Assembly, or any City or County from enacting laws regulating or prohibiting obscenity, to the extent permitted by the United States Constitution. For purposes of this section the term \u2018obscenity\u2019 shall have the meaning given it by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The Attorney General certified the following Caption, Question, and Summary for the ballot title of that measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: FREE SPEECH CLAUSE ALLOWS LAWS REGULATING, PROHIBITING OBSCENITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall state constitution bar interpreting free speech clause to prevent state, local governments from enacting laws regulating or prohibiting obscenity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\u201cThis measure would add a new provision to the Oregon Constitution. Article I, section 8 forbids laws that restrict the right to speak, write, and print freely on any subject. The state supreme court has said that this section bars laws against obscenity. The measure would say that this section cannot be interpreted to prevent state or local governments from enacting laws regulating or prohibiting obscenity, to the extent the United States Constitution allows such laws. \u2018Obscenity\u2019 has the meaning given by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">With respect to the second measure, petitioners challenge only the certified Question and Summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The Attorney General responds that the challenged portions of the two ballot titles \u201csubstantially comply\u201d with the requirements established in ORS 250.035(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(4) (court shall review a ballot title for \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements of ORS 250.035 and ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>250.039, the provision establishing readability requirements) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In addition, the Attorney General contends that the Question and Summary certified for the second measure cannot be modified in the manner proposed by petitioners, because ORS 250.035(2) prohibits the use of ballot titles that \u201cresemble, so far as probably to create confusion, any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d Petitioners counter that the two measures are very similar and that ORS 250.035(2) does not prohibit the use of similar ballot titles in that circumstance. They assert that, to the contrary, where two proposed measures are very similar, ORS 250.035(2) prohibits the use of <em>dissimilar </em>ballot titles, because that would \u201cprobably * * * create confusion\u201d in the minds of voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">ORS 250.035(2) states that a ballot title <em>\u201cshall not resemble </em>* * * any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cresemble\u201d means \u201cto be like or similar to.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1930 (unabridged ed 1976). The statutory proscription apparently is intended to avoid the creation of \u201cconfusion\u201d between or among the respective ballot measures to which the ballot titles apply. ORS 250.035(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Petitioners contend for the opposite rule; they would have the statute require that a ballot title <em>shall resemble </em>the title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election if the measures are very similar. The statute does not state or necessarily imply the rule for which petitioners contend, however. <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (in construing a statute, the court is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We recognize that the two ballot measures proposed by petitioners are very similar. Nevertheless, they differ in one significant particular: the use, in the first proposed measure, of the phrase \u201cand in addition shall also include child pornography.\u201d As applied here, therefore, ORS 250.035(2) requires the Attorney General to certify a ballot title for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>petitioners\u2019 second proposed measure that does \u201cnot resemble\u201d the ballot title certified for their first proposed measure. The Attorney General has substantially complied with that provision. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(4) (requiring substantial compliance).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For example, the Caption for the first measure reads: \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: NO FREE SPEECH PROTECTION FOR OBSCENITY, CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\u201d The Caption for the second measure, which reads, \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: FREE SPEECH CLAUSE ALLOWS LAWS REGULATING, PROHIBITING OBSCENITY,\u201d is sufficiently dissimilar to avoid confusion between the two measures in the minds of voters. The Questions closely track the Captions and likewise are dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">We also have considered all of petitioners\u2019 specific arguments concerning each ballot title, standing alone. We conclude that each ballot title substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Ballot titles certified. This decision shall become effective pursuant to ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-15\"> We have consolidated the two cases for the purposes of argument and opinion, because they are related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\"> ORS 250.035(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">\u201cThe ballot title of any measure to be initiated or referred shall consist of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHc\">\u201c(a) A caption of not more than 10 words which reasonably identifies the subject of the measure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-14\">\u201c(b) A question of not more than 20 words which plainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-15\">\u201c(c) A concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> Petitioners do not argue that the ballot titles fail to comply with ORS 250.039. Accordingly, we do not consider the ballot titles\u2019 compliance with that statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\"> <em>See also Crumpton v. Keisling, </em>317 Or 322, 855 P2d 1107 (1993) (court\u2019s role is not to determine whether a petitioner\u2019s proposed ballot title is \u201cbetter\u201d than the certified ballot title, but only to determine whether the certified ballot title substantially complies with ORS 250.035; certified ballot title substantially complied with ORS 250.035(1); because petitioners did not give notice to Secretary of State of certified ballot title's alleged failure to comply with ORS 250.035(2), court did not reach that question).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
