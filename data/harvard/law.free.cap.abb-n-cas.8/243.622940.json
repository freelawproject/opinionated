Defendants are estopped from denying their undertaking (Jarvis <em>v. </em>Sewall, 40 Barb. 449; Levi <em>v. </em>Dorn, 28 <em>How. Pr. </em>217): It is not necessary to an equitable estoppel that the party should design to mislead. If his act was calculated to mislead and actually has misled another acting upon it, that is enough (Manufacturers\u2019 &amp; Traders\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Hogan, 30 <em>N. Y. </em>226; National Continental Bank <em>v. </em>Bank of Commonwealth, 50 <em>Id. </em>586; Phillip <em>v. </em>Gallant, 62 <em>Id. </em>257; Blair <em>v. </em>Wait, 69 <em>Id. </em>113; Bates <em>v. </em>Mench, 2 <em>Hun, </em>568; Chamberlain <em>v. </em>Applegate, <em>Id. </em>510; Gopsill v. Decker, 4 <em>Id. </em>625; Decker <em>v. </em>Judson, 16 <em>N. Y. </em>439; 1 <em>Abb. Nat. Dig. </em>535, and cases cited as to sureties). The undertaking was executed; no particular form being required <em>(Edwards Prom. Notes, </em>91; Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Spicer, 6 <em>Wend. </em>443; Reed <em>v. </em>Drake, 7 <em>Id. </em>345, 346; 3 <em>Parsons Cont. </em>6 ed. 4-12; <em>Daniels Negotiable Instruments, </em>58, and cases cited; <em>Bishop Cont. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 169-173; 1 <em>Bouv. Inst. </em>290). What the intent of the parties was in putting their names to the paper is a question of fact for the jury (1 <em>Chitty Cont. </em>11 Am. ed. 549; 2 <em>Kent Comm. </em>511. marg. pag.).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-7\"><em>I.

But their names are written in the instrument as those of the parties who undertake, <em>&amp;e. </em>They justify upon the same paper, and appear before a notary, and acknowledged that they have executed the \u201cforegoing instrument.\u201d This is certainly a strong way of giving their assent to the contract contained in it, and there can be very little doubt that they supposed at the time that they had bound themselves by it. If they omitted signing at the end of the undertaking by design, it would certainly look like an intentional deception; in which case they should be estopped from disputing the execution after the paper has answered its purpose by staying the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">But we think that what the defendants did amounted to an execution of the paper. Under our statute of frauds, requiring a memorandum in writing to be subscribed, &lt;\u00a3c., it has been held sufficient if the names of the parties to be bound appear in the body of the instrument (Davis <em>v. </em>Shields, 24 <em>Wend. </em>322).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">This doctrine has generally been applied where the party to be charged wrote the instrument, then writing his own name, but this, we apprehend, is not essential. It has been held that when a trader, who is in the habit of delivering <em>printed </em>bills of parcels, to which his name is prefixed, delivered one containing the quantity and price of the article, it was a good note in writing within the statute of frauds, particularly if it is referred to by a subsequent letter (Sanderson <em>v. </em>Jackson, 3 <em>E. P. </em>180).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In Schneider <em>v. </em>Norris (2 <em>M. &amp; S. </em>286), held that a bill of parcels in which the name of the <em>vendor </em>was printed, and that of the vendee written by the vendor, was a sufficient memorandum within the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>frauds, and charged the vendors. Lord Ellenboeough said,, \u201chere there is a sig'ning by the party to be charged, by words recognizing the printed names as much as if he had subscribed his mark to it, which is strictly the meaning of signing; and by that the party has incorporated and avowed the thing to be his, and it is the same as if he had written Norris &amp; Co., with his own hand\u201d (See also, 3 <em>Parsons Cont. </em>4-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In the case before us, the undertaking was to be executed; and conceding that this required that it should be signed, which is undoubtedly the common understanding as to the mode of execution, the foregoing and other authorities show that this is substantially done when the party writes his name in the body of the instrument, <em>or adopted in that connection. </em>This the defendants did most unequivocally by their justification and acknowledgment before the notary. We think, therefore, that the plaintiff should have judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">New trial granted, with costs of appeal to appellant, to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Neilsom\", J.\u2014I concur in this opinion and in the conclusions. The principle involved is well illustrated in Jackson <em>ex dem. </em>Kenyon <em>v. </em>Virgel (3 <em>Johns. </em>540), and in Millius <em>v. </em>Shafer (3 <em>Den. </em>60), and in the cases there recited.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\"> Reversed in 26 <em>Wend. </em>341. The case in the text is, however, sustained by analogy by Hubbell <em>v. </em>Livingston, 3 <em>Code R. </em>63, as well as by the other cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
