Lyon, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7V\">maker of the note, though a married woman, expressly charged her separate estate with the payment thereof (Yale <em>v. </em>Dederer, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>265; 22 <em>Id. </em>459; 68 <em>Id. </em>329; Corn Exchange Ins. Co. v. Babcock, 42 <em>Id. </em>614; Maxon v. Scott, 55 <em>Id. </em>247; Manhattan B. <em>&amp; </em>M.

Brown, 74 <em>Id. </em>82). The word \u201clien\u201d is synonymous with \u201ccharge\u201d <em>(Webster Dict.; </em>McVey <em>v. </em>Cantrell, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>297; Rohrbach <em>v. </em>Germania Fire Ins. Co., 62 <em>Id. </em>48, 52; Taddenken v. Cantrell, 69 <em>Id. </em>597), In Second National Bank of Watkins <em>v. </em>Miller (63 <em>Id. </em>639), the court held that a note made to order of husband and indorsed by him was presumptively a nullity, because there was no express charge against her separate estate. Had there been such a charge the note would .have been valid (Sheldon <em>v. </em>Clairey, 61 <em>Barb. </em>475; Wright <em>v. </em>Wright, 54 <em>N. Y. </em>427; <em>Bliss </em>Code, 258). Deed between husband and wife will be enforced in equity (Hunt <em>v. </em>Johnson, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>27). The allegations of the complaint were sufficient and proper in form against the maker of the note as a <em>feme </em>sole, coverture being matter of defense to be pleaded (Smith <em>v. </em>Dunning, 61 <em>N. Y. </em>249). The case of Kelso <em>v. </em>Tabor (52 <em>Barb. </em>125) has been overruled. That of Loomis <em>v. </em>Ruck (56 <em>N. Y. </em>462) has no application here. It is not necessary to resort to a court of equity to enforce defendant\u2019s liability because she has contracted in such form as to make it binding upon her separate estate (Carpenter <em>v. </em>O\u2019Dougherty, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>660; Maxon <em>v. </em>Scott, 55 <em>Id. </em>. 247, and cases <em>supra). </em>Defendants never having made the mortgage, are estopped from denying the negotiability of the note. The privilege has been waived and abandoned, and cannot be interposed as a barrier to recovery because it once existed. They have elected, to so consider it and that is irrevocable (Dinsmore <em>v. </em>Duncan, 57 <em>N. Y. </em>580; Bodine <em>v. </em>Killeen, 53 <em>Id. </em>93; Sherman <em>v. </em>Elder, 24 <em>Id. </em>381). The time to execute the mortgage was within sixty days from date ; the time of maturity was sixty-three days from date ; it could then have been negotiated before maturity. The terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the instrument did not modify that part which contains a promise to pay absolutely to the order of the payee a sum certain on the day specified (Smith v. Holland, 61 <em>N. Y. </em>635; Arnold v. R. R. Co., 5 <em>Duer, </em>211; Hodges v. Schuler, 22 <em>N. Y. </em>114; Dinsmore v. Duncan, 57 <em>Id. </em>573; Frank v. Wessels, 64 <em>Id. </em>155; Skillen v. Richmond, 48 <em>Barb. </em>428; Benedict <em>v. </em>Cowden, 49 <em>N. Y. </em>396; Baker v. Seaman, <em>61 N. Y. </em>648; Attorney-General v. Continental Life Ins. Co. 71 <em>Id. </em>325; 1 <em>Pars. Bills and Notes, </em>26; Bruce v. Carter, 72 <em>N. Y. </em>616; Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada <em>v. </em>Griswold, 72 <em>Id. </em>472). The parties to this instrument by their acts and admissions have given it a negotiable character, with all the incidents of negotiable paper (Evertson v. National Bank of New York, 66 <em>N. Y. </em>14).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> If it is non-negotiable, the defendants are still liable, the wife as maker, and the husband as guarantor or maker (Richards v. Warring, 4 <em>Abb. Ct. App. Dec. </em>47; Seymour v. Van Slyke, 8 <em>Wend. </em>403, 421, and cases cited; Dean v. Hall, 17 <em>Id. </em>214; Josselyn v. Ames, 3 <em>Mass. </em>274; Hunt v. Adams, 5 <em>Id. </em>358; Herrick v. Carman, 12 <em>Johns. </em>159; Seabury v. Hungerford, 2 <em>Hill, </em>80; Hall v. Newcomb, 3 <em>Id. </em>233 ; Griswold v. Slocum, 10 <em>Barb. 40</em>2; Crowell v. Hewitt, 40 <em>N. Y. </em>491; Gilbert v. Sharp, 2 <em>Lans. </em>412; Phelps v. Vischer, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>69; Thomas v. Murray, 32 <em>N. Y. </em>609). If the instrument be considered as a contract, and the indorsement of the husband thereon merely an assignment of the same, then the wife is liable (Second National Bank of Watkins v. Miller, 63 <em>N. Y. </em>639).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-5\"><em>Hermon H. Shook, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6K\">The plaintiffs are not indorsees, the instrument sued on not being a negotiable promissory note. (Cook v. Satterlee, 6 <em>Cow. </em>108; Skillen v. Richmond, 48 <em>Barb. </em>428; Sackett v. Palmer, 25 <em>Id. </em>179; James v. Hagar, 1 <em>Daly, </em>517; 1 <em>Parsons on Contr. </em>4 ed. 209, 210, and cases there cited; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Chitty on </em>Bills, 55; Stevens <em>v. </em>Blunt, 7 <em>Mass. </em>240). Negotiability is not saved by the words to \u201c pay to A. L. Rawson or order\u201d (Austin <em>v. </em>Burns, 16 <em>Barb. </em>643). Nor can it become negotiable by the failure to execute the mortgage mentioned therein (Seacord <em>v. </em>Burling, <em>5 Den. </em>444; Richardson <em>v. </em>Martyn, 30 <em>Eng. L. &amp; Eg. </em>365; Kelley <em>v. </em>Hemingway, 13 <em>Ill. </em>604). The title to this instrument could pass to plaintiffs from the husband without his indorsement, by mere delivery, but the only legal effect of such a transfer would vest in them the interest which he had before the transfer (Loftus <em>v. </em>Clark, 1 <em>Hilt. </em>310). They would then hold only as assignees, subject to all defenses by the wife against the husband (James <em>v. </em>Hagan, 7 Daly, 517, Franklin Bank <em>v. </em>Raymond, 3 <em>Wend. </em>69). The instrument being a contract between a husband and wife directly, is void at common law (Cropsey <em>v. </em>McKinney, 3 <em>Barb. </em>47; Martin <em>v. </em>Martin, 1 <em>Greenl. </em>394; White <em>v. </em>Wager, 32 <em>Barb. </em>250; Jackson <em>v. </em>Parks, 10 <em>Cush. </em>550; Sweat <em>v. </em>Hall, 8 <em>Vt. </em>187; Curtis <em>v. </em>Brooks, 37 <em>Barb. </em>476). Without the intervention of a third party they cannot contract together, being but one person in the view of the law (1 <em>Pars. on Contr. </em>4 ed. 299, 300; <em>Coke on Lit. </em>112, a; <em>Reeve Dom. Rel. </em>89, 90; Marshall <em>v. </em>Rutter, 8 <em>T. R. </em>545 Carter <em>v. </em>Carter, 14 <em>Sm. &amp; M. </em>59; Martin <em>v. </em>Martin, 1 <em>Greenl. </em>394). This common law rule has not been changed by statutes or the Code. The note is, <em>prima </em>facie, a nullity, because made payable to her husband, and it does not appear that it was in her separate business, or for the benefit of her separate estate (Second National Bank of Watkins <em>v. </em>Miller, 63 <em>N. Y. </em>639). It is not validated by the fact that it is expressly made a lien upon her separate estate (Kelso <em>v. </em>Tabor, 52 <em>Barb. </em>125). The law will, not presume that it was made for the benefit of her separate estate (Nash <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 71 <em>N. Y. </em>199). A promissory note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>made by a married woman does not import a consideration, and is not <em>per se </em>negotiable. A consideration must be shown (Scudder <em>v. </em>Gori, 18 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>223; 28 <em>How. Pr. </em>155). The plaintiffs had knowledge o\u00a3 all its infirmities, of all the circumstances affecting its validity, and therefore did not acquire a valid title (Comstock <em>v. </em>Hier, 73 <em>N. Y. </em>273). A contract between husband and wife directly is void at law. and can be upheld only in equity in certain cases (Winans <em>v. </em>Peebles, 32 <em>N. Y. </em>423; Ballin <em>v. </em>Dillaye, 37 <em>Id. </em>35; Hunt <em>v. </em>Johnson, 44 <em>Id. </em>27; White <em>v. </em>Wager, <em>supra; </em>Meeker <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 <em>Hun, </em>533 ; <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Van Order v. Van Order, 8 <em>Id. </em>315). A wife cannot make an executory contract (9 <em>N. Y. </em>205; 18 <em>Id. </em>265; 15 <em>Barb. </em>28; 12 <em>How. Pr. </em>17). Same effect as to other contracts (4 <em>Duer, </em>96; 16 <em>How. Pr. </em>93; <em>Id. </em>158). The words \u2018\u2018value received\u201d are merely formal, and even if this instrument was in form a negotiable instrument, being by a married woman, it does not import a consideration (Scudder <em>v. </em>Gori, <em>supra; </em>3 <em>Robt. </em>661; 28 <em>How. Pr. </em>155).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> Rev\u2019g 4 <em>Hun, </em>692.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> Rev\u2019d in 7 <em>All.

Further, it was in no sense wanting in \u25a0consideration. \u201cValue received\u201d is specified, and it is admitted that the indorsement to plaintiff was also \u201cfor value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">As to the husband, treating it as a non-negotiable note, he is still liable under Cromwell <em>v. </em>Hewitt (40 <em>N.
