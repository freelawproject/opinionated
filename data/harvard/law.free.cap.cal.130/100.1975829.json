The note signed by the president of the company is the contract of the corporation, and the intent to bind the corporation is plainly inferable from the terms of the instrument and a signature thereto.

The appeal is from the latter judgment; and the sole question involved is whether the note sued on was the note of the latter defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The note is signed, \u201cAnnie Kline Rikert, Pres. Stockton and Tuolumne Co. R. R. Co. Annie Rikert Personally,\u201d and is set out at length in the complaint. The answer of the defendant corporation denies that it \u201cmade, executed, or delivered to-plaintiff the promissory note\u201d sued on. The court found that the defendant Rikert \u201cmade, executed, and delivered\u201d the note to plaintiff; and that the defendant corporation \u201cnever made, executed, or delivered\u201d it. It is claimed on behalf of the appellant that the evidence was insufficient to justify the latter finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence on this point consisted of a resolution of the board of directors of the corporation of date March 5, 1898\u2014conferring on the president, as \u201cthe agent and chief executive of the board,\u201d the power \u201cto incur indebtedness, negotiate loans, to enter into any contracts or agreements, .... and otherwise to act as the agent of the corporation\u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and the note itself, which was produced from the custody of the plaintiff, was put in evidence without objection on the part of the defendants, and with their admission that the defendant Rikert was, and ever' since December 27, 1897, had been, president of the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">This evidence would seem to be sufficient to support the appellant\u2019s contention; but it is urged, on behalf of the respondent, in support of the finding, that there was no evidence of The genuineness of the president\u2019s signature to the note; that it did not appear that she had the power to sign it on behalf of the corporation; and that the note on its face appears \u201cto have been the personal note of Annie Kline Rikert only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">1. With regard to the first point, we do not understand the answer of the defendant to make any issue as to the genuineness of the signature. The note is set out in the complaint, and its delivery is admitted and found. As to the execution of it, the denial is simply that it was executed by the defendant corporation; which\u2014as the delivery of the note is admitted \u2014amounts merely to a denial of the subscription of the instrument by the corporation (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1933), which was never alleged. The answer must, therefore, be construed as admitting the genuineness of the note\u2014i. e., the genuineness of the actual signatures. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 447; Abbott\u2019s Law Dictionary, Anderson\u2019s Law Dictionary, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, word \u201cGenuine\u201d; <em>Baldwin v. Van Deusen, </em>37 N. Y. 489; <em>Cox v. Northwestern Stage Co., </em>1 Idaho, 376, 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Accordingly, the court finds that Annie Kline Rilcert \"made, executed, and delivered\u201d the note to the plaintiff; which is in effect a finding of the genuineness of both her signatures. Hence the finding objected to cannot be construed as a finding to the contrary. Otherwise we would have to regard it as contrary, not only to the admissions of the pleadings, but to the evidence; for the note was read in evidence without objection; and this\u2014under the circumstances\u2014was in effect an admission of the genuineness of the signatures. (1 Hayne on New Trial and Appeal, sec. 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">2. The execution of the note was clearly within the powers conferred upon the president by the resolution of March 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>1898; and the resolution itself was within the powers of the board. <em>(Hawley v. Gray Bros. etc. Co., </em>106 Cal. 337; Civ. Code, sec. 2319; Morawetz on Corporations, sec. 538; <em>McKiernan v. Lenzen, </em>56 Cal. 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\">With regard to the point\u2014which seems to have been urged in the court below\u2014that under section 4 of article IV of the by-laws, the signature of the secretary was necessary to give validity to the note, it will be sufficient to say that the provision in question does not require the secretary to sign all notes and obligations, but simply that notes or obligations \u201csigned officially by the president and secretary shall be binding on the corporation\u201d; and that precisely the same point was involved in <em>Hawley v. Gray Bros. etc. Co., supra, </em>and fully discussed in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">3. The court erred in holding that the note is not the note of the corporation defendant. It has undoubtedly been held that a note with no mention of a corporation, or other principal, in the body of it, and merely signed \u201cJohn Doe, president/ or \u201cagent,\u201d or even \u201cpresident\u201d of a named corporation, is not a note of the corporation or other principal. Such was the case in <em>Hobson v. Hassett, </em>76 Cal. 203,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>Chamberlain v. Pacific etc. Co., </em>54 Cal. 103, cited by respondent. But within the principle announced and the authorities cited in <em>Hobson v. Hassett, supra, </em>the note in the case at bar would clearly be the note of the corporation. In the Chamberlain case the form of the obligation in the body of the note was \u201cI promise to pay,\u201d and there was only one signature, which was \u201cD. P. Sackett, president\u201d of the named corporation. In the case at bar the form of the obligation is \u201cwe or either of us promise,\u201d and the note is signed, first, \u201cAnnie Kline Rikert, Pres. Stockton and Tuolumne Co. R. R. Co.,\u201d and then below \u201cAnnie Kline Rikert personally.\u201d This clearly shows that the first signature was for the corporation, and the second for herself personally; and having power to bind the corporation, the note, as signed, is a clear, intentional and legally sufficient exercise of that power. The case is similar to that of <em>Farmers\u2019 etc. Bank v. Colby, </em>64 Cal. 352, where the note was signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u201cG. A. Colby, Prest. Pac. Peat Coal Co.,\u201d and \u201cD. K. Tripp, See. pro tem.,\u201d and was \u201cindorsed\u201d by said Colby and some other persons; and the court said: \u201cBead as a whole, we think it apparent from its face that it is the note of the company indorsed by the individuals,\u201d and that \u201cpromissory notes, like other instruments, \u2022 must be given that effect which accords with the obvious intent of the parties to them.\u201d It is not always necessary that the name of the principal shall be signed with the statement following \u201cby the\u201d agent, although that is no doubt the best form. In <em>Jones v. Clark, </em>42 Cal. 180, the form of the note was \u201cfor and on behalf of the Dardanelles Mining Company I promise to pay,\u201d and it was signed \u201cWilliam Bufus Longley, superintendent for the company\u201d; and the court said: \u201cThere can be no doubt that it is binding on the partnership, provided that Longley had authority to execute it.\u201d In <em>Southern Pac. Co. v. Von Schmidt Dredge Co., </em>118 Cal. 368\u2014where the signature of the president was held to bind the company, in a case not nearly as strong as the one at bar \u2014there is an elaborate discussion of the subject and a citation of many authorities.
