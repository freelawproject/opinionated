Defendant demurred to the complaint for insufficiency of facts, and his demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment. The case turns upon the sufficiency of the affidavit in the original action of <em>Marsh v. Fkumoto, </em>to confer jurisdiction to make the order of arrest. The arrest was caused under subdivisions 1 and 5 of section 479 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The section reads as follows: \u201cThe defendant may be arrested, as hereinafter prescribed, in the following cases: 1. In an action for the recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ery of money .... when the defendant is about to depart from the state with intent to defraud his creditors; .... 5. When the defendant has removed or disposed of his property, or is about to do so, with intent to defraud his creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFc\">Section 481 provides as follows: \u201cThe order may be made whenever it appears to the judge, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or some other person, that a sufficient cause of action exists, and that the case is one of those mentioned in section 479. The affidavit must be either positive or upon information and belief, and when upon information and belief it must state the facts upon which the information and belief are founded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Auf\">The affidavit in question was before this court in <em>Ex parte Fkumoto, </em>120 Cal. 316, and was, in the opinion then rendered, thoroughly analyzed and its defects specifically pointed out. Whether in the affidavit it was made to appear that a cause of action existed against Fkumoto without reference to the complaint in the action then pending, and whether the affidavit could be aided by such reference, were questions not decided and need not now be decided. At the hearing on <em>habeas corpus </em>the court determined that there was a material lack in the affidavit in respect of the jurisdictional facts required to bring the case -within the statute, and we see no reason now for coming to any different conclusion. Eeference to the opinion in that case will relieve us from again presenting the numerous fatal defects of the affidavit. Suffice it to say that the court determined that the facts stated in the affidavit \u201cdo not bring the case within either of the provisions of the statute relied on by respondent\u201d; that there is no ex-press averment in the affidavit, nor are facts stated from which a deduction may be made, that \u201cdefendant is about to depart from the state with intent to defraud his creditors.\u201d The court said: \u201cBoth the present purpose and the specific intent found in the language of the statute are wanting in the affidavit\u201d; and it was added: \u201cWhen the language of such a statute is departed from, the party must at his peril employ words of equivalent import; and a failure in this respect is fatal.\u201d It was further said that the affidavit \u201cis equally wanting in facts to show that defendant had removed or disposed of his property, or was about to do so, with intent to defraud his creditors.\u201d Again: \u201cThere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>is another fatal defect common to the entire affidavit. Several of the statements of fact are made expressly on information and belief, .... whereas the facts upon which such information and belief are founded are in no instance given. In this,\u201d said the court, \"the affidavit fails tb comply with one of the express and most material requirements of the statute.\u201d And finally the court said: \"As the jurisdiction to issue the warrant rests upon the affidavit, it results from what has been said that the order of arrest was void, and the warrant is no authority for petitioner\u2019s detention.\u201d Respondent seems to he of the impression that jurisdiction is aided by the pendency of the action. It is necessary to the jurisdiction that an action be pending (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 480, 483); hut, as above stated, jurisdiction to make the order rests upon the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The learned judge who heard the demurrer expressly placed his ruling upon the authority of <em>Dusy v. Helm, </em>59 Cal. 188. We think the opinion in that case has been misunderstood. It was there said: \u201cIf the judge to whom the application was made had jurisdiction to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence disclosed by the affidavit to procure the order of arrest, the party applying for it cannot be held responsible unless there was an entire lack of evidence of some essential fact which the law requires to be shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">That was an action to recover possession of' certain personal property, and the affidavit was based upon subdivision 3 of section 479, <em>supra; </em>the statement in the affidavit was: \"That the defendant in said action did, on or about October 19, 1874, fraudulently conceal and remove all said property, to prevent its being found or taken by the sheriff,\u201d etc. There was a positive averment of the facts which the statute made a ground for the arrest, and hence it was true, as stated in the opinion, that there was not entire lack of evidence of some essential fact required to he stated. In the case now here, this court has already determined that the affidavit failed in many particulars to comply with the express and most material requirements of the statute, and especially in its allegations of material facts* upon information and belief without stating the facts upon which such information and belief were founded. But the statute expressly requires that when the affidavit is upon in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>formation and belief \u201cit must state the facts upon which the information and belief are founded.\u201d We cannot agree with respondent that it is but error to be corrected on appeal where facts are stated as was done in the affidavit before us. We think an affidavit resting wholly, or in any one essential particular, on information and belief, without stating the facts upon which such belief is founded, does not confer jurisdiction to issue the order. The statute must be complied with or there is no jurisdiction to issue the order. <em>(In re Vinich, </em>86 Cal. 70; 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 1st ed., 682, and cases cited.) It was said in <em>Spice v. Steinruck, </em>14 Ohio St. 213: \u201cIt is clear, we think, that in the exercise of this special and extraordinary power conferred by the statute and interfering with the personal liberty of the defendant, the course prescribed by the statute must be strictly pursued.\u201d It was further said in <em>Dusy v. Helm, supra: </em>\u201cThe judge having determined, in the exercise of the jurisdiction committed to him by the law, that the affidavit by its statements of facts was sufficient to entitle the party applying for the order, to hold that such party is liable for damages for the erroneous judgment of the judge, would impose on him a responsibility not ^warranted by law.\u201d Respondent quotes this paragraph apd apparently claims that where the judge assumes jurisdiction, or has determined to exercise it, \u25a0 there can be no liability, for the reason that his judgment is but erroneous. But the court cannot confer jurisdiction by merely assuming it; nor can its determination that it has jurisdiction confer it. Where the judge has in fact no jurisdiction to act, his order of arrest is void; and whether he has jurisdiction must be determined from the affidavit itself and not from what the judge thinks it authorizes him to do. The plaintiff must see to it that he is clothed with actual, not merely apparent, authority before he can deprive the defendant of his liberty. When the court in <em>Dusy v. Helm, supra, </em>said that there would be no liability\u2014\u201cthe judge having determined in the exercise of the jurisdiction committed to him by the law\u201d\u2014the statement presupposed jurisdiction to exist; and the court did not say nor intend to say that the judge would have jurisdiction because he determined that he had it. What the court in effect said was, that as the judge had jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in that particular case, as it clearly had, in its exercise his determination .as to the sufficiency of the facts to justify him in making the-order was mere error. But it was not said, and we do not think it has ever been said, that where jurisdiction is lacking the issuance of the order would be but error. The distinction is apparent in all the cases cited by respondent, and we think is clearly admitted in <em>Gillett v. Thiebold, </em>9 Kan. 427, relied on by respondent as \u201csingularly similar to the case at bar,\u201d and in which Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion. It was there said: \u201cWhere the statute prescribes certain conditions for the exercise of powers by an inferior tribunal, a disregard of those conditions renders the attempted exercise of those powers void.\u201d In the case we have here this court has already decided that the statutory conditions, upon which the power to act depended, were disregarded, and hence the order was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We do not feel called upon to further notice the very able discussion of the question found in respondent\u2019s brief. We are clearly of the opinion that the court had no jurisdiction to issue the order, and that it was so decided in <em>Ex parte Fkumoto supra. </em>Such being the fact, the numerous cases relied on by respondent have no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Gray, C., and Haynes, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is reversed. Van Dyke, J., Garoutte, J., Harrison, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">A petition for a hearing in Bank was filed and denied, and from the order of denial Beatty, C. J., dissented, and filed the following opinion on the 17th of October, 1900:</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b121-10\">BEATTY, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">I dissent from the order denying a rehearing in this case. The decision in <em>Ex parte Fkumoto, </em>120 Cal. 316, having been made by the court in Bank, is authority which the commissioner and the Department were no doubt bound to follow; but it does not establish the law of this case, and if erroneous should be set aside. I think the court in that case erroneously decided that the affidavit of this defendant failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to state facts sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to make the order. In my opinion the affidavit contains everything necessary not only to give the court jurisdiction, but to fully justify the order of arrest. I think the judgment in this ease should, therefore, have been affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
