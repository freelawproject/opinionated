W. Cornett, a guard, was concealed therein; that he fired upon the intruder three times. The undisputed evidence further shows that appellant was in the town of Greenville, where this store was situated, on the evening of the 10th with a wagonload of peaches for sale; that he was seen at the camp meeting by his father and mother, who testified to that effect, at Greenville about 10 p. m. that night; that he was seen by one C. E. Ashmore at about fifteen minutes before 12 o\u2019clock on that night near the burglarized store; that he was again seen by another party at about 1 o\u2019clock that morning. The undisputed evidence further shows that about 3:30 a. m. on the morning of the burglary appellant went to the owner of the wagon yard .and woke him up and told him he wanted to get his wagon out of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>yard and that he did get the wagon out about that time and left Green-ville. The witness Cornett admits that he told various and sundry persons before the arrest of appellant that the person he shot in the house burglarized was either a negro or a white man blacked, \u00e1nd that he was a tall man. This was also testified to by quite a number of witnesses. But Cornett testified upon trial that as soon as appellant was arrested he recognized him as the man whom he shot in the house, and upon trial he positively identified appellant as the burglar and says he was mistaken about him being as tall as he said he was or being a black man, and testifies that he is sure appellant is the man. The \u2022undisputed evidence further shows that on the morning of the 11th appellant called a doctor to dress his arm, and that he was suffering from a gunshot wound which penetrated his arm, which the doctor says had been recently inflicted; that on the next day after this he had his wound dressed by another physician, who testified that it was a gunshot wound. Appellant made no explanation to either of these physicians so far as the record shows, as to how he got this wound. He was arrested within forty-eight hours after the burglary and placed in jail.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-5\"><em>Spearman &amp; Peak, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeO3\">On question of admitting evidence as to time defendant was seen at a certain place: Sanders v.

W. Cornett on the trial swears positively to the identity of the defendant as the man who entered the store, it was not necessary to give a charge on circumstantial evidence. It is true on cross-examination and by proof of statements made at other times and places the appellant to some extent weakens the force of this identifying testimony, but this goes only to the weight to be given it by the jury, and did not render' a charge on circumstantial evidence necessary. It is&gt; only when the testimony relied on for a conviction is wholly circumstantial that the court is required to so charge. Tooney v. State, 8 Texas Crim. App., 452; Buntain v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 515; Hunnicutt v. State, 18 Texas Crim. App., 498; Hayes v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 404; Williams v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 82, 124 S. W. Rep., 954, and cases cited in sec. 203, Branch\u2019s Texas Crim. Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Complaint is made of the remarks of the . district attorney. It appears from the evidence that the watchman fired at the alleged bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>glar three times, that defendant when arrested had been shot through the arm. The defendant did not testify, nor was there any evidence offered explaining how he received this wound, although appellant, during the trial, placed his arm in evidence, showing that the bullet entered the back of the arm and came out in front, the contention being that it would have been impossible for Cornett to have made this wound at the time he fired at the burglar, inasmuch as the bullet did not go in the body. Cornett had testified that when he first fired the arms of the man were hanging by his side. There might be force in this contention if only one shot had been fired, but as Cornett says the burglar turned and ran, when he fired twice more, and there being no positive testimony which shot inflicted the wound, the contention is without much strength. However, this shows the contention of defendant, and the bill recites that the district attorney said: \u201cIf the defendant did not receive that wound in Orr Little\u2019s store, as shown by the testimony of the State, wouldn\u2019t you like to know where the defendant did receive said wound ? If he received the wound at the hands of a highwayman, would you not like to have heard the man who inflicted the wound or some witness who saw the wound inflicted testify in this case?\u201d It is contended that is a reference to defendant\u2019s failure to testify. He had offered this wounded arm in evidence, but did not say how or when he received the wound. We think under the circumstances the district attorney was justified in using the language quoted; and it can not be said to be more than an indirect reference to his failure to testify if thal much can be said, and it is not every incidental reference to such fact that will be cause for reversal and especially is this true, when it is only by a strained construction the language can be said to refer to defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Wooten v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 151; Combs v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 334; Cabrera v. State, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 141; Green v. State, 31 S. W. Rep., 386, and cases cited in 5 Enc. of Law &amp; Prac., 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Those bills in the record which' show that when attempting to prove up contradictory statements of the witness Cornet, the defendant also desired to prove what the witnesses had said to Cornett at that time. In refusing to permit such statements to be introduced in evidence the court did not err, as it was not necessary to render plain the statement of Cornett. What these witnesses may have said to Mr. Cornett would not be admissible as original evidence, and would not tend to impeach him.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Several physicians testified in the case, and after qualifying and testifying to an examination of the wound in the arm, there was no error in permitting them to state as to the length of time the wound had been inflicted at the time of the examination. In their testimony they gave as a reason the condition of the wound, describing it, flow of blood, etc., and such facts and circumstances as enabled them, with their medical knowledge, to testify in regard to such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">A witness testified that he saw appellant in Greenville on the night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>of the burglary at ten or fifteen minutes to 12 o\u2019clock. On cros\u00e1examination by appellant it was shown this witness knew the time by reason of the fact that he had been so informed by another person when appellant moved to exclude the testimony. The time this witness saw the appellant was not a material issue in the case, but only the fact that he had seen him in Greenville that night; consequently the court did not err in the matter. But if this should be held to be error, it would be no ground for reversal, because the appellant proved the same facts by defendant\u2019s father and mother and other witnesses, so that the fact that appellant was in Greenville on the night of the burglary ceased to be a contested issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">There are a number of bills in the record relating to a question of whether or not the jury discussed the failure of defendant to testify on the trial of the case before they arrived at their verdict. In the first place it may be said that the testimony heard on this motion was not filed in the court below until February 15, 1913, when the court had adjourned on the 31st day of the preceding November. Being filed after term time, it can not be considered. (Probest v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 608.) In the next place it may be said that the affidavits raising this issue were sworn to before one of the attorneys in this case, and on motion of the State were stricken from the record for this reason, and in this the court did not err. (Maples v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 169.) But should we ignore these matters, and consider the affidavits, evidence and all proceedings had in this matter, the foreman of the jury testified: \u201cI was the foreman of the jury that tried Lewis Pullen at this term of the court for burglary; when the jury was charged and we went out in the room to deliberate on the cash, the first thing done by the jury was to elect a foreman; I was elected foreman; the next thing done, I read th\u00e9 charge to all of them; then we took a ballot; the result of that ballot was nine \u2018guilty\u2019 and three \u2018not guilty.\u2019 The first thing that was done after that ballot was taken was Mr. Abernathy was the first one spoke; he was over next to the east door; he said, T was one that voted \u201cnot guilty,\u201d but I am better satisfied now and I am willing to reconsider my ballot and go with the majority.\u2019 Mr. Clark was the next man that spoke, and says: \u2018I was another,\u2019 and he says: \u2018It was funny\u2019\u2014before he said that, though, he said: \u2018I wa\u2019n\u2019t satisfied in my own mind which way to vote, but I am willing to go with Mr. Abernathy\u2019\u2014that is, go with the nine; the next was Mr. Reavis, he stood between Mr. Clark and I, and he said: \u2018I am the other man, I reclcen,\u2019 he says, T voted \u201cnot guilty,\u201d <em>\u2019 </em>but he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t have my mind right well made up and wanted to know how much punishment; I wanted it the lowest; but I didn\u2019t know how to get it, but if you will give him the lowest punishment I am with the bunch,\u2019 if he didn\u2019t say \u2018bunch\u2019 I am mistaken, but I think he said \u2018bunch.\u2019 At this time Mr. Clark said: \u2018I think it is funny he didn\u2019t tell ns how he got that shot if he didn\u2019t get it there and had that coat in evidence and his arm, too.\u2019 I had the charge in my hands and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>raised it up and says to Mr. Clark, I says: \u2018We are instructed not to consider that\u2019; another gentleman, I can point him out but I can\u2019t call his name, but he said: T remember that in the charge.\u2019 (Witness here pointed out Mr. Presley.) I opened the charge and read that part of it over aloud twice so that all might understand it thoroughly. How Mr. Clark telling about coming up there, several did crowd around to see it read, but I read it aloud twice\u2014made three readings of it; I read it the first time before anything was done. Mr. Clark having said this and Mr. Reavis having said that, I says, Tt seems all right except the punishment, if you are ready for the ballot we will ballot over; first, we were all one way; we didn\u2019t ballot by writing ballot; I said, \u2018A rising ballot will do just as well,\u2019 and they all arose up. I said: \u2018Are you all ready for the time?\u2019 but I says, \u2018You .all ought to write it because I don\u2019t like to see jurors vote like the others do,\u2019 and they all put down on it \u2018two years,\u2019 the whole twelve of us; there was one or two or rnajffie three said \u2018guilty, two years,\u2019 and I take it it was those that voted \u2018not guilty\u2019 before put that \u2018guilty, two years.\u2019 What I have stated here was the only reference made in the jury room to the defendant\u2019s failure to tell how he got the wound.\u201d Seven other jurymen also testified, and taking into consideration' the two affidavits filed, would make ten of the jurymen who were heard. The evidence to our mind clearly authorized the court to find as he did that the remark was made after the jury had agreed that appellant was guilty, but before the fixing of the number of years of punishment, and as the jury assessed the lowest penalty authorized by law, no reversible error is presented by this ground in the motion for new trial if all defects in presenting the question are waived.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b189-6\">[Rehearing denied May 14, 1913.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">We have carefully considered each bill of exception and ground in the motion for new trial, and no error is presented. The evidence, we think, conclusively shows the guilt of appellant, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
