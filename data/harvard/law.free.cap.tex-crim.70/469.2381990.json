Rep., 42, 136 S. W. Rep., 467, or the Durham case, 155 S. W. Rep., 222, are not analogous cases. They sustain the Act providing for the appointment of official stenographers for District and County Court by the judges thereof. The Act of May 1, 1909, page 374, we submit that where an official stenographer has been appointed by the court that this Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>applies in misdemeanor criminal cases as well as in others because the Act itself says, that it provides for the appointment of official stenographers for County Courts and County Courts at law by the judge thereof. This court is compelled to cognizance the fact that County Courts and County Courts at law are included in this Act, and that misdemeanor eases are tried in said County Courts and when there has been an official stenographer appointed in a misdemeanor case then this Act applies.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-8\">[Rehearing denied June 11, 1913.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-3\"><em>C.

In the order overruling the motion for new trial appellant was allowed twenty days from adjournment to prepare and file bills of exception and a statement of facts. Eone of his bills of exception, nor his statement of facts, were filed until thirty days after the court adjourned. Therefore, neither his bills nor his statement of facts can be considered by this court. Durham v. State, 155 S. W. Rep., <em>222.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Eothing is presented which we can consider in the absence of a statement of facts and bills of exception.
