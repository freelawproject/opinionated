At the time the offense is alleged to have been committed Mr. Ash was out of town. About 5 o\u2019clock on the evening of July 8, 1912, Mrs. Ash sent prosecutrix, Velma Ash, who was then twelve and one-half years old, to town to mail a letter, and the defendant saw her in town and asked to walk home with her. Then they walked on down the railroad track toward her home a piece and turned off and went down a little road, and from this road they turned off into a little branch, the view from the outside being cut off by trees. When they got down in this branch the defendant asked prosecutrix to kiss him, which she refused to do, and he forced her to. He then forced her to sit down by him on the bank and took out his knife and cut her bloomers between the legs, the prosecutrix trying to get away from him at this time. Prosecutrix then testifies that defendant had intercourse with her against her will. The mother of prosecutrix testified that the bloomers worn by Velma on the day in question were cut between the legs and that she found on them some white stain. Dr. Rosser, who examined prosecutrix ten days after the alleged commission of the offense, testified that the private parts of prosecutrix had been penetrated, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>W.

This was the second application, the case having been continued at a prior term on his motion on account of absence of certain witnesses. As one of appellant\u2019s attorneys was present, and, so far as we are able to judge from this record, ably conducted his defense, the court did not err in overruling the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The father of the girl alleged to have been raped was absent from home at the date of the offense. Her mother wrote for him, and on his return home, as soon as he could get his family physician, he had the girl examined, and the physician positively testifies to penetration. While this was some ten days after the alleged offense, it was not so remote as to render it inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">The mother of Velma Ash testified to examining the bloomers of her daughter and found them cut. This was admissible and the court did not err in so holding. However, the bill states she testified she \u201cfound the passage from him on them.\u201d It was also permissible for her to state that she found \u201cwhite stuff- like the passage from a man on the bloomers,\u201d and this is what the court states he understood the witness to testify, but, in approving the bill, he approves it as prepared by appellant\u2019s counsel, and this would have her to say she \u201cfound the passage from <em>him </em>on them.\u201d It was improper to permit her to so testify, but her whole testimony shows she was not present at the time the offense was committed, did not find the passage on the drawers until next morning, and we do not think it such error as will necessitate the reversal of the case under the evidence adduced on this trial. Later on she states when she found this stain on the bloomers \u201cit had dried,\u201d and makes it manifest that she did not intend to lead the jury to believe that she knew who put the stain on the drawers,' and this inadvertent expression in the use of the words \u201cfrom him\u201d in connection therewith, while erroneous, adds no strength to the case for the State, and under such circumstances such error has been held to be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">The testimony is such that it unquestionably supports the verdict and finding of the jury, and the heavy penalty assessed was doubtless occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>sioned by the fact that appellant was a mature man, a seeming friend to the family, one who had been the guest of the father; one who \u201cdropped in\u201d at all hours of the day and then when the father was called from home took advantage of this occasion to attempt the ruin of his daughter. This doubtless was deemed by them as so reprehensible to indicate that he was devoid of those instincts which go to make good citizenship.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b640-7\">[Rehearing denied June 4, 1913.-\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
