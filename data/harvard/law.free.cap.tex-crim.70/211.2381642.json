The prosecuting witness in this ease had testified appellant sold him a half pint of alcohol; and whether or not he kept such an article for sale was a legitimate inquiry. Wagner v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 306; Starbeck v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 192; Myers v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 558; Field v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 524; Myers v. State, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The only other bills in the record relate to the failure of the court to give some special charges relating to the argument of the county attorney. There are no bills, of exception showing that such remarks were made by the county attorney. We think the remarks not improper as they were based on legitimate deductions from the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
