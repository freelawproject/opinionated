It is not certified by the stenographer; is not signed- by the attorneys who tried the case, neither is it approved by the trial judge, and under such circumstances it can not be considered for any purpose. And as we must conclude in the absence of the evidence that the judge charged the law and all the law applicable to the facts, we must presume there was no error in refusing the special charges requested, and the only matter presented in a way we can review it is the motion in arrest of judgment on account of alleged defects in the indictment. The indictment charges the theft to have been accomplished in both - ways the statute states the offense can be committed. This is permissible under our system of pleading. Steele v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 337; Thomas v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 329. In alleging the property stolen, it is alleged to be \u201ctwenty dollars in monet of the value of twenty dollars,\u201d the word \u201cmonet\u201d being used where it was intended to say \u201cmoney.\u201d In no standard dictionary do we find any such word as \u201cmonet,\u201d and it is apparent that it is but a clerical or typographical error where the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201ct\u201d is used in the word where \u201cy\u201d was intended, and such inaccuracies have never been held to be fatal to an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u25a0The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
