VADA filed with this Court a motion to dismiss alleging that the order of the circuit court overruling the demurrers was not an appealable order and, thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the order.

After a hearing, the hearing officer recommended that Tesla's request for a dealership in Richmond be denied. Tesla requested review by the Commissioner.

In a June 26, 2017 order, the circuit court overruled the demurrers and ruled that VADA has standing as an aggrieved party to appeal the Commissioner's decision. The order also granted VADA leave to amend the petition for appeal to include two individual dealerships as petitioners. The circuit court did not reach the merits of VADA's claims of error. The Commissioner and Tesla filed an appeal of the circuit court's June 26, 2017 order pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Code 17.1-405(4).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      ANALYSIS\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      \"The Court of Appeals of Virginia is a court of limited jurisdiction.\"\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth v.

The circuit court's decision\n     that the VADA has standing merely determines that the case may proceed at this time. The subject matter of VADA's administrative appeal is still in the breast of the circuit court, and the court \"as the ends of justice may require\" may reconsider its decision.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Thrasher\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2044766\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/204/399/#p403\">\n       204 Va. at 403\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.E.2d%20286\">\n       131 S.E.2d at 289\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Because the order clearly does not address the merits of the administrative appeal, it\n     does not adjudicate the principles of the cause.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.E.2d%20286\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      Appellants, however, urge this Court to deny VADA's motion to dismiss these appeals, to reverse the circuit court's overruling of their demurrers, and to dismiss VADA's appeal of the Commissioner's decision. They argue that if VADA is not an aggrieved party then sovereign immunity prevents VADA from challenging the Commissioner's decision. While the legal principle is correct, the argument is circular because the argument prevails only if we reverse on the merits the circuit court's order. However, this is precisely what this Court does not have jurisdiction to do because here the circuit court's interlocutory order regarding standing did not adjudicate the principles of the cause. Thus, even if we agreed with appellants that the circuit court erred in concluding VADA is an aggrieved party for purposes of the Virginia Administrative Process Act, we simply have no statutory jurisdiction to review the trial court's order at this point in the litigation.\n      <em>\n       Lancaster\n      </em>\n      , 86 Va.

For unless this inquiry can be determined affirmatively, the court has no election, although, if it were permitted to examine the bill, it might be of opinion the bill was multifarious, or demurrable for misjoinder of parties, or that it should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, but must dismiss the appeal.\").\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      CONCLUSION\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      The circuit court's order overruling the demurrers filed by the Commissioner and Tesla and granting leave for the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association to amend its petition for\n     appeal did not adjudicate the principles of the cause; it was thus not an appealable interlocutory order, and this Court has no jurisdiction to consider it. Accordingly, we dismiss these appeals.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      This order shall be published and certified to the circuit court.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
