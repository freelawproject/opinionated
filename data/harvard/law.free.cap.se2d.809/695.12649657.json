The appellants argue that the circuit court erred in finding the appellee, Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA), has standing to file an appeal in the circuit court challenging a case decision by the Commissioner. VADA filed with this Court a motion to dismiss alleging that the order of the circuit court overruling the demurrers was not an appealable order and, thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the order. We conclude this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeals, and we grant VADA's motion to dismiss.</p><p id=\"p-10\">BACKGROUND</p><p id=\"p-11\">Tesla requested an evidentiary hearing by the Commissioner to determine if it qualified under Code \u00a7 46.2-1572(4) to open a manufacturer-owned dealership in Richmond, Virginia. A hearing officer appointed by the Commissioner granted VADA's request to intervene in the proceeding. After a hearing, the hearing officer recommended that Tesla's request for a dealership in Richmond be denied. Tesla requested review by the Commissioner. The Commissioner ruled that Tesla qualified under Code \u00a7 46.2-1572(4) to open a dealership.</p><p id=\"p-12\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"512\" href=\"#p512\" id=\"p512\">*512</a>Pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4026 of the Virginia Administrative Process Act, VADA filed an appeal with the circuit court from the Commissioner's case decision; the appeal named the Commissioner and Tesla as appellees. The Commissioner and Tesla filed demurrers to the action, arguing that VADA had no standing to appeal the Commissioner's decision. In a June 26, 2017 order, the circuit court overruled the demurrers and ruled that VADA has standing as an aggrieved party to appeal the Commissioner's decision. The order also granted VADA leave to amend the petition for appeal to include two individual dealerships as petitioners. The circuit court did not reach the merits of VADA's claims of error. The Commissioner and Tesla filed an appeal of the circuit court's June 26, 2017 order pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act. <em>See</em> Code 17.1-405(4).</p><p id=\"p-13\">ANALYSIS</p><p id=\"p-14\">\"The Court of Appeals of Virginia is a court of limited jurisdiction.\" <em>Commonwealth v.

Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to hear appellants' interlocutory appeals only if the circuit court's order adjudicates the principles of the cause. Code \u00a7 17.1-405(4). The merits of VADA's administrative appeal center on its contention that the Commissioner committed error by finding Tesla qualifies for a dealership pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-1572(4). The circuit court's June 26, 2017 order addressed VADA's right to proceed with an appeal of the Commissioner's decision and to amend its petition for appeal; it clearly did not address, let alone adjudicate, VADA's assertion that the Commissioner erred. The circuit court's decision <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"515\" href=\"#p515\" id=\"p515\">*515</a>that the VADA has standing merely determines that the case may proceed at this time. The subject matter of VADA's administrative appeal is still in the breast of the circuit court, and the court \"as the ends of justice may require\" may reconsider its decision. <em>See</em> <em>Thrasher</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2044766\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/204/399/#p403\">204 Va. at 403</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.E.2d%20286\">131 S.E.2d at 289</extracted-citation>. Because the order clearly does not address the merits of the administrative appeal, it <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"698\" href=\"#p698\" id=\"p698\">*698</a>does not adjudicate the principles of the cause. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.E.2d%20286\">id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-16\">Appellants, however, urge this Court to deny VADA's motion to dismiss these appeals, to reverse the circuit court's overruling of their demurrers, and to dismiss VADA's appeal of the Commissioner's decision. They argue that if VADA is not an aggrieved party then sovereign immunity prevents VADA from challenging the Commissioner's decision. While the legal principle is correct, the argument is circular because the argument prevails only if we reverse on the merits the circuit court's order. However, this is precisely what this Court does not have jurisdiction to do because here the circuit court's interlocutory order regarding standing did not adjudicate the principles of the cause. Thus, even if we agreed with appellants that the circuit court erred in concluding VADA is an aggrieved party for purposes of the Virginia Administrative Process Act, we simply have no statutory jurisdiction to review the trial court's order at this point in the litigation. <em>Lancaster</em>, 86 Va.

Rule 2A:3 requires the agency secretary to \"transmit the record to the clerk of the court named in the notice of appeal\" <em>after</em> the circuit \"court has entered an order overruling any motions, demurrers and other pleas filed by the agency.\" Here, the circuit court did not have the agency record before it when it determined that the VADA was an aggrieved party for purposes of the Virginia Administrative Process Act. After the circuit court has reviewed the agency record and heard additional arguments on the merits, it may reconsider whether VADA is an aggrieved party. <em>Thrasher</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2044766\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/204/399/#p403\">204 Va. at 403</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.E.2d%20286\">131 S.E.2d at 289</extracted-citation>. <em>See also</em> <em>Chaplain v.
