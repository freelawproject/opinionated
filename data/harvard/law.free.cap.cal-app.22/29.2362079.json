This line had attached to it numerous short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>lines bearing hooks which hung from the main cord into the water of the river, and it was from the hooks on these short lines that defendant was detaching fish at the time of his arrest. He stated to the arresting officer that he had placed the line there; that he was fishing for the market, and that the only way he could catch fish was by using these lines. He made the further statement to the officer that he would break the law, as it was not right but unconstitutional. No evidence was introduced at the trial on behalf of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The points urged upon which it is claimed that a reversal of the judgment and order denying a new trial should be directed are quite technical and call for but brief consideration. Defendant first insists that, because the information charged him with both having set and used a set line, two offenses are alleged. The statute under which the prosecution was had does indeed provide that any person who shall either set or use a set line or fixed contrivance for catching fish in the waters of the state shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars, or imprisonment for not less than fifty days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. It has very long been settled that under a statute which describes several acts, the doing of any or all of which shall constitute a crime, a defendant may be charged either with the doing of a single act so described, or by the doing of all of them. This rule is so well settled that we need only cite one of the several decisions which affirm it. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Leyshon, </em>108 Cal. 440, [41 Pac. 480].) It is also contended that it was not sufficiently charged by the information that the alleged crime was committed in the county of Kings, and in support of this contention counsel for defendant relies wholly upon the omission of the district attorney to place a comma after the word \u201cinformation\u201d in the body of the charge. It was alleged in the information that defendant, on the twenty-first day of March \u201cand before the filing of this information at the county and state aforesaid, did willfully and unlawfully,\u201d etc. Because of the lack of a comma after the word \u201cinformation,\u201d it is now contended that the phrase \u201cat the county and state aforesaid\u201d should be read as referring to the place where the information was filed rather than to the place where the crime was alleged to have been committed. This contention should not be sustained as it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>very evident as to what was intended to he there charged, and the defendant could not in any wise have been misled or prejudic\u00e9d by the failure of the district attorney to be more, exact in his use of punctuation marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">The evidence was abundant to support the verdict of the jury, and the defendant appears to have been given every opportunity to defend himself against the charge and to have had a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Allen, P. J., and Shaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
