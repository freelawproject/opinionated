The proceeding was had under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the ground upon which the 'order was asked for and allowed was that the alleged default of the defendant was due to inadvertence and excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">As is shown in <em>Kramm etc. </em>v. <em>Stockton Electric R. R. Co., </em>Civil No. 1115, <em>ante, </em>p. 737, [136 Pac. 523], this day decided, the order appealed from is not one from which an appeal may be taken, and this appeal will, therefore, have to be dismissed.
