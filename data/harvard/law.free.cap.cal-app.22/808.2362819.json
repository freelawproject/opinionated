The principal question here is as to the validity of said ordinance. We are, however, relieved of the duty of considering the various objections to said ordinance urged by counsel for appellant in the briefs and at the oral argument, as the matter is foreclosed by the decision of the supreme court in the <em>Application of E. N. Ellsworth </em>for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>165 Cal. 677, [133 Pac. 272].</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">In view of that decision, the only remaining question that might give rise to an honest difference of opinion is whether the violation of the ordinance, which prescribes no penalty, should subject one to the charge of maintaining a nuisance within the definition of that term as found in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">At the oral argument, though, it was stated and not denied that the defendant had voluntarily enlarged his business as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>hotel-keeper so as to remove him from the inhibition of said ordinance, and, as we are informed said ordinance has been made complete by suitable action of the board of supervisors, the suggested consideration is virtually a moot question and may be passed as of only academic importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Chipman, P. J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
