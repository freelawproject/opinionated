It is upon this finding that appellant bases an argument that the judgment in favor of plaintiff is not supported by the findings. But an assignment for collection, without any consideration being paid by the assignee, vests the legal title in the assignee, which is sufficient to enable him to recover, though the assignor retains an equitable interest in the thing assigned. This is of no concern to the debtor. <em>(Greig </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>99 Cal. 316, [33 Pac. 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">No other point is presented by the record or urged for a reversal; and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Lennon, P.
