J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyQ\">Defendant was convicted of violating an ordinance of the city of Woodland, passed under the Local Option Law, prohibiting the keeping and conducting a place where alcoholic liquors are sold, the said city being incorporated and no-license territory. The appeal is from the judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Defendant urges but two grounds for the .reversal of the judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">First. That the court erred in admitting in evidence the deposition of the witness Joe Monieo; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">Second. That the court erred in refusing to allow defendant to show the existence .of other places in the immediate neighborhood where alcoholic liquors were sold and distributed, in rebuttal of evidence that men were seen coming from the direction of defendant\u2019s house in an intoxicated condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">1. After having sufficiently made the preliminary proof of failure to find the witness Monieo within the jurisdiction of the court, the record shows as follows: \u201cMr. Bailey (prosecuting attorney) : We now offer to read in evidence the testimony of the witness Joe Monieo at the preliminary examination before Hon. J. E. Strong, justice of the peace sitting as committing magistrate in the ease of the People of the State of California, plaintiff, <em>v. </em>M. Beretoni, defendant, myself appearing for the prosecution and Julian &amp; Gibbs appearing as attorneys for the defendant and cross-examining the witness. The Court: Is it duly certified ? Mr. Bailey: Duly certified. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">The grounds of objection were that \u201cthe deposition was never certified,\u201d that it \u201chas no proper certificate,\u201d that it \u201cappears to be in a different form from the one which was originally filed in the action,\u201d that \u201cit has been improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>withdrawn from the record,\u201d that it \u201chas been changed and modified,\u201d that it \u201cdoes not conform to the provisions of the statute,\u201d that \u201cit is not a true or correct copy of the testi-' mony taken.\u201d i</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It appeared that the reporter was appointed by the justice' of the peace and no objection was made to his appointment. \u201cThe Court: The certificate shows he was sworn, but the ques-, tion is whether the certificate would be evidence of that fact, or not.\u201d A further objection was made, that the deposition] \u201cdoes not state the name of the witness, nor the place of residence, business or profession.\u201d Counsel for defendant stated' that he would ask \u201cto have the reporter called to show that; he is not competent to act as reporter.in this case,\u201d claiming] that he could not object at the taking of the testimony at the'preliminary examination and that \u201cthis is the proper time, for the making of that objection as the certificate of the cor-: rectness of the transcript of the testimony is merely <em>prima facie </em>evidence. Mr. Bailey: That is part of the defendant\u2019s. case. The Court: The deposition seems to be in accordance - with law, and of course the defendant will have every oppor-' tunity to show if it is not, and if it is not, it will be stricken \u25a0 out. The objection will be overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The deposition was then read:'\u201cTestimony of Joe Monico] sworn for the prosecution. Mr. Bailey: Q. What is your', name? A. Joe Monico.\u201d It then proceeds by question and\u25a0 answer, showing the examination in chief and cross-examination. Testimony of numerous witnesses was taken for the people and for defendant and both parties rested. Defendant did not offer to call the reporter to establish his objection; to his qualifications. The record fails to show the certificate ; to Monico\u2019s deposition. There was no evidence and no at-' tempt was made to show that there was no certificate to the; deposition. On the contrary, it appears from what took place \u2022 that there was a certificate. It seems to us that, such being ! the fact, it was defendant\u2019s duty to incorporate the certificate ' in the record in order that its sufficiency or insufficiency might. be determined. The burden was on defendant and not on the prosecution to show error, if error there was. As was said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>143 Cal. 375, 382, [77 Pac. 169]: \u201cIt does not, however, follow that in this case there was error in admitting the deposition, for <em>it </em>must be assumed, upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>record before us, that the transcript produced was duly certified by the reporter as being a correct statement of the testimony and proceedings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>144 Cal. 48, 61, [77 Pac. 777]; Hayne on New Trial and Appeal, p. 1574; Id., 1582, note 6h.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">2. About a block distant from Beretoni\u2019s was a suspected \u201cblind pig\u201d kept by one Bertolucci. His house was \u201craided\u201d the same night the officers made a like visitation of Beretoni\u2019s and for like purpose. Witness Murphy, a deputy sheriff, testified that the officers found some intoxicating liquors in Bertolucci\u2019s house\u2014quite a variety of liquors, including wine, beer, and whisky. The witness was asked on cross-examination: \u201cDid you go to Bertolucci\u2019s on a search warrant? Did you arrest Mr. Bertolucci? Did you get any admissions from Mr. Bertolucci? Did you secure any evidence against Bertolucci?\u201d Objections t.o the relevancy, competency, and materiality of these questions were sustained. It does not appear that the witness went to Bertolucci\u2019s armed with a search warrant to look for intoxicating liquors. This warrant, if the witness had one, may have had reference to some other offense than keeping and disposing of. intoxicating liquor. The questions as to his arrest and as to his admissions were not addressed to his having intoxicating liquors in violation of any ordinance. No objection was made to the evidence showing what the officers found at Bertolucci\u2019s. The further questions should have been more specific and should have pointed in some definite way to the fact,- if it was the fact, that the intoxicated persons seen to have been coming from the direction of defendant\u2019s might have obtained their liquor from Bertolucci\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We discover no prejudicial error in the record and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
