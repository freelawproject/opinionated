(Const., art. VI. sec. 4.) That section, among other things, provides that the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction on appeal from the superior courts \u201cin all cases at law which involve the title or possession of real estate.\u201d This court cannot, therefore, acquire jurisdiction in such cases by direct appeal; nor, obviously, has this court the right or the power to dismiss an appeal of which it has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">It is accordingly ordered that the appeal, together with the motion to dismiss the same, be transferred to the supreme court. *</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Chipman, P.
