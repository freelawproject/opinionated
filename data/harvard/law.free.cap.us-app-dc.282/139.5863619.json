Perry as an additional subject of investigation. However, Perry was not subsequently indicted and as authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f) he now applies for an award of $8,421.74 as reimbursement for the fees and expenses paid to his attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In such circumstances the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>(the Act), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">(1)Award of fees.\u2014Upon the request of an individual who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel pursuant to this chapter, the division of the court may, if ho indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation, award reimbursement for those <em>reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees </em>incurred by that individual <em>during that investigation </em>which would not have been incurred <em>but for </em>the requirements of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f) (emphasis added). Inquiries into the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act focus on two principal elements: (1) whether the fees would not have been incurred \u201cbut for\u201d the Act and (2) whether such fees are \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The investigation by the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice, and its decision not to recommend prosecution provides ample support for the conclusion that, in the investigation conducted by the Independent Counsel, Perry was being subjected to expenses for a duplicative investigation that he would not have been subjected to in the absence of the Ethics in Government Act. <em>See In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1420 (D.C.Cir.1989). On that basis we find that the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement of the statute is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In addition to the but for requirement the Act restricts the Court to making awards for payments of \u201creasonable\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees. It is difficult for the Court to find that attorneys\u2019 fees are reasonable if, as here, the billings merely specify a certain amount of time for a \u201cconference\u201d with no further specification as to the subject matter of the conference. The application is lacking in this respect. However, from our experience in other independent counsel cases we take notice that the total amount of <em>time </em>devoted to the defense of the client \u201cduring [the] investigation\u201d is reasonable, though the documentary support submitted in support thereof is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\"> We also find the attorneys' fees <em>rates </em>to be reasonable. They are billed at $150 per hour for one attorney and $60 per hour for a law clerk and the reasonableness of such rates is supported by affidavits of qualified disinterested lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">So much for the fees incurred <em>during </em>the investigation. In addition the application requests an award by the Special Division for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in the preparation of the application to the Court for attorneys\u2019 fees. The Final Report of Independent Counsel was filed with the court on March 14, 1989 and the application requests reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred from March 27, 1989 to June 16, 1989 in the preparation of the fee application. Obviously, such fees were not incurred <em>during the investigation, </em>nor were they incurred in Perry\u2019s defense. The Act therefore does not permit the court to award fees for such purpose. <em>In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1427 (D.C.Cir.1989). The provision \u201cduring [the] investigation\u201d in \u00a7 593(f)(1) indicates a congressional intent to limit the award to attorneys\u2019 services rendered, during the investigation, in asserting the merits of subject\u2019s defense against the criminal charges being investigated. <em>Id. </em>Fees incurred in preparation of the fee application are not \u201creasonably related to a defense to ... [the Independent Counsel\u2019s] investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 993 (D.C.Cir.1989)). As the Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity it must be strictly construed. <em>United States v. Mottaz, </em>476 U.S. 834, 851, 106 S.Ct. 2224, 2234, 90 L.Ed.2d 841 (1986); <em>Lehman v. Nakshian, </em>453 U.S. 156, 161, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 2701-02, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981); <em>In re Olson </em>at 1428; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>In re Donovan </em>at 994-95; <em>In re Jordan, </em>745 F.2d 1574, 1576 (D.C.Cir.1984). The application to the Special Division of the Court for attorneys\u2019 fees in the total sum of $8,421.74 must thus be reduced by $2,790.20 as fees incurred in the preparation of the fee application are not reimbursable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">It is therefore ordered that applicant be awarded reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $5,631.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\n<em>Order accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
