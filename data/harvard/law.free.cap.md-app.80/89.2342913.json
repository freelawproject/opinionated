The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, in response to that question, granted summary judgment in favor of the employer, Federated Department Stores, Inc. t/a Bloomingdale\u2019s. For the reasons hereafter stated, we are of an entirely different point of view and reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Suzanne Spahr, the security director at Bloomingdale\u2019s White Flint, Maryland store, recovered a stolen calculator from an attache case belonging to Thach Le, a Bloomingdale\u2019s salesperson. Immediately thereafter, Le, allegedly as a result of coercion, signed a statement admitting to the theft. Le\u2019s employment with the store was promptly terminated. Le then sued Bloomingdale\u2019s for false arrest, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. There was no claim for any physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Bloomingdale\u2019s asserted that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act precluded Le from bringing the suit against it for any tortious acts that occurred during his employment. Bloomingdale\u2019s maintained that Le could seek redress only through the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The circuit court, relying on this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Schatz v. York Steak House Sys., </em>51 Md.App. 494, 444 A.2d 1045 (1982), and <em>Continental Cas. Co. v. Mirabile, </em>52 Md.App. 387, 449 A.2d 1176 (1982), agreed that the Act barred a tort action against Bloomingdale\u2019s. We think the circuit court misconstrued those cases. Unlike the instant case, <em>Schatz </em>and <em>Mirabile </em>involved physical and psychological injuries for which compensation is provided under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u201cAside from the exceptions\u201d created by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act itself, \u201cthe operation of the law is exclusive of all other remedy and liability, as to both employer and employee who come within\u201d its purview. <em>Knoche v. Cox, </em>282 Md. 447, 453, 385 A.2d 1179 (1978). Section 15 of the Act directs that benefits are payable for disability or death \u201cresulting from an accidental personal injury sustained by the employee arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d \u201cInjury,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d \u201caccidental injury,\u201d and \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d are defined by the statute as \u201caccidental injuries arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The Court of Appeals, in interpreting the term \u201caccidental injury,\u201d has held that, insofar as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law is concerned, \u201caccidental injury\u201d means <em>physical injury </em>to the person caused by some unusual condition or occurrence in the employment. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Zapf, </em>192 Md. 403, 410, 64 A.2d 139 (1948); <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 486-87, 6 A.2d 48 (1939); <em>White v. Safe Dep. &amp; Trust Co., </em>140 Md. 593, 599, 118 A. 77 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">A \u201ccompensable injury may be found whenever an accidental physiological change is found to have arisen out of and in the course of employment.\u201d R. Gilbert &amp; R. Humphreys, Jr., <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>\u00a7 5.2 (1988); <em>Sargent v. Board of Educ., Balto. Co., </em>49 Md.App. 577, 433 A.2d 1209 (1981). Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are not payable without proof of a personal injury. R. Gilbert &amp; R. Humphreys, <em>supra </em>at 85. Ergo, \u201cthe absence of a physiological change or physical harm or damage should preclude a finding that an injury occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has heretofore addressed the question of whether non-physical injury torts are within the ambit of the Act, but courts in other jurisdictions have held that tort , actions are not barred by Workers\u2019 Compensation Acts when the essence of the injury is non-physical. <em>See e.g. McGee v. McNally, </em>119 Cal.App.3d 891, 174 Cal.Rptr. 253 (1981); <em>Vigil v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>555 F.Supp. 1049 (Dist.Ct.Colo.1983); <em>Hogan v. Forsyth Country Club Co., </em>79 N.C.App. 483, 340 S.E.2d 116 (1986). All three of those foreign cases cite Professor Larson\u2019s exhaustive treatise, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, 2A, </em>\u00a7 68.34(a), as authority for their holding. Larson there comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">\u201cIf the essence of the tort, in law, is non-physical, and if the injuries are of the usual non-physical sort, with physical injury being at most added to the list of injuries as a makeweight, the suit should not be barred. But if the essence of the action is recovery for physical injury or death, the action should be barred even if it can be cast in the form of a normally non-physical tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Larson further remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201c[Ojrdinarily these torts would not come within the basic coverage formula of the typical workmen\u2019s compensation act: \u2018personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.\u2019 But the matter is complicated by the fact that occasionally a tort of this type will become intertwined with a compensable injury in some way____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-8\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 68.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">We think it clear that before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act may serve as a barrier to an employee\u2019s civil suit for the intentional torts of a supervisory employee, the complainant must have sustained a physical or mental injury. The matters alleged by Le did not involve physical injuries or a disabling mental condition. Le merely complained that Ms. Spahr detained him in Bloomingdale\u2019s security office against his will, coerced him into signing a confession, and that he was \u201cled crying through the ... store.\u201d Under the facts as pleaded, Le did not sustain an \u201caccidental injury\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Md.Ann.Code art. 101. Therefore, the Act has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">When the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not provide a remedy to the employee, a civil tort action is not barred. Le has alleged causes of action that are not compensable under the Compensation Act but which, if proven, will allow recovery in a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The quiddity of false arrest, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress is non-physical. Those torts are ordinarily outside the scope of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Since they are not within the Act, the statute does not protect the employer from actions grounded on those particular torts. We conclude, therefore, that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Bloomingdale\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">. <em>Schatz v. York Steak House Sys. </em>was an action for injuries to an employee who was raped while at work. <em>Continental Cas. Co. v. Mirabile </em>involved a claim stemming from an assault and battery upon an employee while he was at work. Undoubtedly both cases involved physical injury to the claimant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
