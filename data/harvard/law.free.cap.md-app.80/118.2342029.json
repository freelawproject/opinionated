There was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and yet we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">Appellant never suggested that he was not drunk \u2014 legally intoxicated \u2014 when Officer Lavern Johnson came upon him on the evening of April 6, 1988. He simply denied that he was driving while in that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">The case presented a classic conflict in the evidence \u2014 the quintessential jury issue. Officer Johnson testified that she observed appellant driving north on Park Heights Avenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>erratically and without headlights, that she activated her siren and flashing lights, and, after a brief pursuit, pulled him over. She approached his car and asked for his license and registration card,, which he was unable to produce. Detecting the odor of alcohol, she requested him to get out of his car to take a fi\u00e9ld sobriety test. Appellant did get out of the car and take (and fail) the test. He was then arrested. A subsequent breath test revealed a blood alcohol content of 0.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Appellant told a different story. He said that he had been to an American Legion meeting on Madison Avenue, that he had been drinking, and that, in accordance with Legion custom, one of his \u201ccomrades\u201d took his car keys and offered to drive him, in his (appellant\u2019s) car, at least partway home. Appellant\u2019s testimony was somewhat unclear, but it appears that the comrade intended to drive him north on Park Heights Avenue as far as Cold Spring Lane and then leave appellant and catch a bus, but that, just after passing Park Circle, the comrade saw a bus going his way and so left appellant farther south than anticipated. Appellant claimed that he had a friend who lived across the street from where the comrade left him and expected the friend to assist him in some way. To his chagrin, however, appellant discovered that (1) his friend was not home, (2) the comrade had neglected to return his car keys, and (3) it was raining. To make the best of a bad situation, appellant left his car and sat in the rain on another car parked a block or so from his car, waiting for a cab. That is what he was doing, he said, when Officer Johnson came upon him. He swore that he was on, not in, the car, that the car he was on was not his, and that he could not have been driving a car because he had no keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Prior to offering his own testimony, appellant proposed to call his comrade as a witness to testify, in the words of defense counsel, \u201c[t]hat my client wasn\u2019t driving.\u201d The State objected because \u201c[w]e have no notice of any witness whatsoever.\u201d The court sustained the objection and precluded the witness from testifying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: You had got his name. Under the circumstances I have to rule him out. I\u2019ll tell you why. It\u2019s not so much the technical applicability of the rule, which I think I\u2019m obliged to do in any event, but in a case of this nature, when the person is going to come in and I presume the proffer is he\u2019s going to testify that he wasn\u2019t driving. Isn\u2019t that the proffer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">MR. GRIER [Defense counsel]: That my client wasn\u2019t driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">THE COURT: He being your client. This clearly is something that the State has an absolute right to know about in advance and for the purpose of doing the proper investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">It\u2019s a dramatic statement that may fly directly in the face of the State\u2019s case and goes to the heart of this case and it\u2019s first presented to them at 14 minutes after 3:00 in the midst of a trial which really should conclude today if possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">You know I\u2019m not rushing the trial, but we have a horrendous docket. I think it\u2019s unduly bound to move these cases along. This case was originally scheduled in the district court and your client decided to bring it here for a jury trial. So he\u2019s had more than ample time to notify everybody in the world of his witnesses or this witness I should say. So I\u2019m going to exclude the witness with all due respect and with some regret.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The court erred in that ruling. The error requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u201cIn the orthodox common-law practice,\u201d says Professor Wigmore via Professor Chadbourn, \u201cno notice was required to be given to the prosecution of witnesses intended to be called by the accused.\u201d 6 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence in Trials at Common Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1855b, 1847(1) (Chadbourn Rev. 1976). That is no longer entirely the case. As Wig-more/Chadbourn point out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">\u201c[M]odern conditions have revealed (or produced) frequent abuses by unscrupulous counsel in manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>testimony, and the calling of such witnesses without prior notice renders it impracticable for the prosecution to expose the fabrication. A false <em>alibi </em>is perhaps the most frequent issue in which this kind of chicanery is used with success; the prosecution, if given warning, could be prepared with witnesses to refute it; but without warning the refutation is impracticable. Accordingly, legislation has been enacted requiring the accused to give to the prosecution the same fair warning to which he himself is universally entitld....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1855b. See also <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 81-82, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1895-1896, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970) and <em>Wardius v. Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 471-72, 93 S.Ct. 2208, 2210-11, 37 L.Ed.2d 82 (1973), dealing specifically with the advent and purpose of \u201cnotice of alibi\u201d rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Although one or more States, in response to the problem, appear to have adopted broad discovery rules requiring the prosecution and the defense to disclose <em>all </em>intended witnesses, <em>see, for example, Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988) (noting and enforcing Illinois Sup.Ct. Rule 413(d)), most States that have addressed the problem have carefully limited the mandatory disclosure of defense witnesses to alibi witnesses. <em>See </em>6 J. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1855b n. 5; <em>see also Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 387, 456 A.2d 29, <em>cert. denied </em>461 U.S. 948, 103 S.Ct. 2114, 77 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1983). That is the Federal practice as well. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Until 1977, criminal defendants in Maryland were not required by Rule or statute to disclose anything to the State prior to trial. The on\u00edy discovery required in criminal cases was on the part of the State, <em>see </em>Gen. Rules of Pract. and Proc. Pt. IV, Rule 5; Md. Rule 728 (1957), and, notwithstanding a reference in the Rule to the \u201cinherent power of the court to require; or permit discovery,\u201d the Court of Appeals seemed to regard the right to discovery as essentially limited to what was allowed in the Rule. <em>See Kardy v. Shook, J., </em>237 Md. 524, 539-40, 207 A.2d 83 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Discovery requirements on the part of defendants first appeared in Maryland in 1977 with the revision of the Ch. 700 Rules applicable to criminal causes. Rule 741 d. required a defendant, upon request by the State, to provide certain demonstrative evidence (\u00a7 d.l), reports of <em>experts </em>whom the defendant intended to call as witnesses (\u00a7 d.2), and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">\u201cUpon designation by the State of the time, place and date of the alleged occurrence, furnish the name and address of each witness other than the defendant whom the defendant intends to call as a witness to show he was not present at the time, place and date designated by the State in its request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">(\u00a7 d.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The current Maryland Rule (Rule 4-263(d)(3)) is virtually identical to former Rule 741 d, the only differences being of a stylistic nature. With respect to the disclosure of witnesses other than experts, it follows in substance, if not in procedure, Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.1, <em>see Middleton v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 286, 289 n. 1, 431 A.2d 734, <em>cert. denied </em>291 Md. 779 (1981), and the Florida rule approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Williams v. Florida, supra, </em>399 U.S. 78, 104-05, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1907-08. It is, in fact, narrower than those rules, which require disclosure not only of the witnesses but also of the specific places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense. <em>Compare 2 </em>American Bar Assoc. Std. for Crim. Justice 11-3.3(a)(i) (2d ed., Supp.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Maryland rule is obviously a limited one in this regard. It does not require advance disclosure of all defense witnesses but only those who will be called either as experts or to show \u201cthat the defendant was not present at the time, place and date\u201d of the offense, as designated by the State. The witness proffered by appellant was neither an expert nor called to show that appellant was not <em>present, </em>only that he was not <em>driving. </em>Appellant\u2019s presence at the scene, as we have said, was conceded. Because the witness was not an alibi witness covered by the Rule and because no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>other proper challenge was made to his proffered testimony, the court erred in excluding him. The error, of course, was of Constitutional dimension, as it effected a transgression of appellant\u2019s right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to present witnesses in his defense. Given the clear and predominant issue of credibility upon which the case hinged, there is no way that we can say the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
