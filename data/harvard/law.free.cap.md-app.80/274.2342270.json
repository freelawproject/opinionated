On January 20, 1987, William Stinchcomb, appellant, pled guilty in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Gordy, J., presiding) of assault and battery. The court sentenced appellant to three years imprisonment, suspended the sentence, and placed appellant on probation for five years. One of the special conditions of probation required appellant to attend the Walter P. Carter Community Mental Health and Retardation Center at the University of Maryland Hospital (Carter Center). On June 6, 1988, he was charged with violating his probation. The matter came before Judge Clifton Gordy for a hearing on November 21, 1988. The court found that appellant violated the conditions of his probation, revoked his probation, and reimposed the original sentence. In this appeal, appellant asks the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">Did the trial judge err in concluding that it had no choice but to sentence appellant to a period of incarceration as opposed to imposing a suspended sentence, conditioned upon his admission into an in-patient psychiatric facility?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">At the probation revocation hearing on November 21, 1988, Dorothy Heim, a senior agent with the Division of Parole and Probation in Baltimore City, testified in detail regarding the specific violations of probation committed by appellant. In particular, she testified that appellant had violated condition 4, which required him to \u201cobey all laws.\u201d Specifically, he was convicted on May 20, 1988 of assault and assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to one year imprisonment that was suspended in favor of a one-year probation. She further testified that appellant violated condition 10, which required him to attend the Carter Center for outpatient psychiatric treatment, because he failed to show up at the Center for his scheduled appointments. Ms. Heim also testified that appellant had attempted to commit suicide twice since August. She concluded that in her opinion appellant \u201cis a threat to public safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>and also to himself.\u201d Appellant did not dispute Ms. Heim\u2019s testimony; rather, he admitted to the court that he needs help \u201creal bad\u201d and suggested that the judge order that he be placed in the Carter Center in an inpatient program.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The trial court found that appellant had violated conditions 4 and 10 of his probation. Defense counsel then commented to the court that appellant \u201ccertainly needs some sort of treatment.\u201d The court noted that it had previously required appellant to attend the Carter Center for treatment, but that he is \u201ceither unable or unwilling to accept it and receive it while his assaultive behavior continues. He is a clear and present danger to himself and to the public at large.\u201d The court then inquired as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE7\">[The Court]: Mr. Ragland, are you aware of any authority that I have to order inpatient treatment in a criminal case at a psychiatric center?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">MR. RAGLAND [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, you alone would not have that authority. I believe that would have to be referred to the medical office and through their discretion if that was the appropriate course I believe they could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">MR. DOAN [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, to my knowledge there is no way to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">THE COURT: To mine either. The problem here is the Court\u2019s clearly addressed that Mr. Stinchcomb needs special treatment and the system as presently constituted has no facility nor special treatment, no mechanism for special treatment, no avenue to get him there for special treatment. That\u2019s the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">He is not ill enough to be found not criminally responsible and sent to Perkins. The only other option to him is on probation and have him sent to Walter P. Carter Center and I\u2019ve already done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">MR. DOAN: It\u2019s clear he\u2019s not going to do that. He\u2019s dangerous to the community. I don\u2019t know what jail or DOC is going to do, other than it\u2019s going to keep him from being a danger to the community at least for a while until he gets out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Following this discussion, the court sentenced appellant to the jurisdiction of the Division of Corrections for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>Voluntary Hospitalization as a Condition of Probation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The nature of probation revocation proceedings is well settled in Maryland. \u201cProbation is a matter of grace, which is in effect a bargain made by the people with the malefactor that he may be free as long as he conducts himself in a manner consonant with established communal standards and the safety of society.\u201d <em>Wink v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 677, 680, 547 A.2d 1122 (1988) <em>(quoting Smith v. State, </em>306 Md. 1, 6, 506 A.2d 1165 (1986)). <em>See also Donaldson v. State, </em>305 Md. 522, 531, 505 A.2d 527 (1986); <em>Matthews v. State, </em>304 Md. 281, 292-93, 498 A.2d 655 (1985). Upon a finding of a violation of probation, a trial judge has several options: he may \u201csentence the person to serve the period of imprisonment prescribed in the original sentence or any portion thereof,\u201d or he may suspend the sentence \u201cin whole or in part and the offender may be placed on further probation on terms and conditions the judge deems proper____\u201d Md. Ann.Code, Article 27, \u00a7 642 (1987 Repl.Vol.). <em>See Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The question whether to revoke probation is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Turner v. State, </em>307 Md. 618, 626, 516 A.2d 579 (1986). The trial court\u2019s determination to revoke probation is reviewable by an appellate court \u201cfor purposes of determining whether that discretion has been abused in any way, or whether an erroneous construction has been placed by the trial judge on the conditions of [probation].\u201d <em>Humphrey v. State, </em>290 Md. 164, 168, 428 A.2d 440 (1981) <em>(quoting Swan v. State, </em>200 Md. 420, 426, 90 A.2d 690 (1952)). <em>See also Turner, supra; Herold v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 295, 303, 449 A.2d 429 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s order should be reversed because he abused his discretion in revoking appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>lant\u2019s probation. Appellant asserts that a trial court possessed the authority, pursuant to Md.Ann. Code Article 27 \u00a7 641A(a) (1987 Repl.Vol.), to require an individual to obtain inpatient treatment at a psychiatric facility as a condition of probation when the individual agrees to participate in such a program. <em>See Maus, supra; Herold, supra. </em>In this case appellant stated that he would be willing to enter such a program; however, according to appellant, the court incorrectly perceived that it lacked the authority to impose such a condition on him and, therefore, simply revoked his probation and reinstated the original sentence to be served in the Division of Correction. The State, on the other hand, argues that the court fully appreciated its power to require appellant to attend a psychiatric treatment facility on an in- or out-patient basis. In fact, the judge had previously ordered that appellant attend the Carter Center as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Appellant's failure satisfactorily to participate in this voluntary treatment program placed him in violation of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the State argues, the court acted within its discretion and properly revoked his probation and reimposed the original sentence. The State further argues that the trial court could not grant appellant\u2019s request to commit him to the Carter Center as a condition of probation because this type of commitment is equivalent to committing him to imprisonment, and \u201ca court cannot impose imprisonment as a condition of probation.\u201d <em>Maus, supra, </em>311 Md. at 104, 532 A.2d 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In <em>Maus, </em>the appellant requested that he be permitted to participate in the Second Genesis program as a condition of probation. The trial court granted his request and ordered that one of the conditions of Maus\u2019 probation was that he enroll and complete the Second Genesis program. The Court of Appeals ruled that while a trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>cannot impose imprisonment as a condition of probation, residence in a facility such as Second Genesis is not the equivalent of imprisonment, and that Maus\u2019 residence at the program not be considered \u201cin custody\u201d within the context of Md.Ann.Code, art. 27 \u00a7 6380(a). <em>Id. </em>at 104, 532 A.2d 1066. In the same vein, we hold that residence in the Carter Center is similar to that of the Second Genesis residence in <em>Maus. </em>In no respect would appellant\u2019s residence in the Carter Center constitute being \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of Section 6380(a). We recognize that the court cannot order that appellant be committed to the Carter Center, however, the court can make voluntary commitment and continued participation in necessary in-patient therapy a condition of probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We cannot determine from the record below whether the trial court realized that he could order appellant to commit himself voluntarily to the Carter Center as a condition of probation. Consequently, we shall vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED WITHOUT AFFIRMANCE OR REVERSAL FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">. The State points out that appellant was also in violation of his probation for failing to obey condition 4 which required that he \u201cobey all laws.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-5\">. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann. art. 27 \u00a7 641(a)(1)(i) (1987 Repl.Vol. &amp; 1988 Supp.), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">The terms and conditions may include ordering the person to pay a fine or pecuniary penalty to the State, or to make restitution, but before the court orders a fine, pecuniary penalty, or restitution the person is entitled to notice and a hearing to determine the amount of the fine, pecuniary penalty, or restitution, what payment will be required, and how payment will be made. The terms and conditions also may include any type of rehabilitation program or clinic, or similar program, or the parks program or <em>voluntary hospital program.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\">. We are not remanding the case to determine whether appellant violated his probation, as that is undisputed. We are remanding only for the purpose of determining appellant's punishment for violating his probation. When appellant, by his own acts, violated probation, he created the condition that made it possible for the court to revoke his probation and reimpose the original sentence. Because of the special circumstances of this case, however, the court may, in its discretion, modify the terms of his probation and order appellant voluntarily to commit himself to. the Carter Center. On the other hand, the court may determine that voluntary commitment at the Carter Center would not be appropriate in this case, and that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>lant should serve the remainder of his sentence in the Division of Correction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
