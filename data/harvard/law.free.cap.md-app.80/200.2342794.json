Gurany and Company, Inc. (referred to collectively as \u201cGurany\u201d), motion to dismiss Patapsco\u2019s complaint, with prejudice, due to Patapsco\u2019s failure to adhere to the 30 day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>time constraints under Md. Rule 2-326(c). That rule requires in part that: \u201cWhen [an] ... action transferred [from the District Court upon demand for a jury trial] is one over which the District Court does not have exclusive original jurisdiction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a complaint complying with Rules 2-303 through 2-305 shall be filed within 30 days after service of the demand for a jury trial by the defendant.\u201d Patapsco argues on appeal that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">I. The circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing appellant\u2019s claim with prejudice for failure to file a circuit court complaint within 30 days of the jury trial request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">II. The circuit court erred in not holding a hearing on appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We agree with Patapsco\u2019s position on the first issue and reverse. We do not address the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Patapsco filed a District Court complaint against Gurany in which Patapsco alleged that Gurany breached a lease agreement between the parties. Gurany responded on March 10, 1988 by filing a Rule 3-325(a)(2) demand for a jury trial. The record was subsequently transferred to the circuit court, <em>see </em>Rule 3-325(c), and notice of the transfer was mailed to Patapsco on March 30, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Although Patapsco had 30 days from March 30, 1988 (May 2,1988) in which to file a circuit court complaint, Rule 2-326(c), Gurany moved on April 22 to dismiss the complaint for an alleged infraction of Rule 2-326(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Patapsco filed a circuit court complaint on May 5,1988 (3 days late), but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>circuit court judge, at a hearing on May 25, 1988, granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Rule 2-326(c) does not expressly provide sanctions for the plaintiffs failure to comply with that Rule\u2019s requirement that a complaint be filed in the circuit court within 30 days after service of the defendant\u2019s demand for a jury trial. Gurany argues that, given this absence of express sanctions in the Rule, the courts should analogize to Rule 2-507(c), \u201cDismissal for Lack of ... Prosecution,\u201d which provides for a dismissal of an action <em>\u201cwithout prejudice\u201d </em>following a one year inactivity in the docket entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">We reject Gurany\u2019s suggested approach and instead opt for the procedures recommended by the authors of the Maryland Rules Commentary, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">A complaint that is filed late is subject to a motion to strike under Rule 2-322(e). In the absence of prejudice, however, the motion will ordinarily be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">P. Niemeyer &amp; L. Richards, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>45-46 (Supp.1988). According to Niemeyer and Richards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATL\">When an action that is <em>not </em>within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the District Court is transferred to the circuit court under section (c) of this rule, the plaintiff must file a new complaint in the circuit court within 30 days. A primary purpose of the complaint is to trigger time periods for, for example, the filing of an answer, counterclaim, or third-party claim. If the plaintiff fails to file the complaint as required, the action does not proceed, and the defendant has no obligation to respond until the new complaint is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-10\"><em>Id. </em>The authors\u2019 position is supported by the express terms of Rule 2-322(e) which provides in pertinent part that: \u201cOn motion made by a party before responding to a pleading ... or on the court\u2019s own initiative at any time, the court ... may order any pleading that is late or otherwise not in compliance with these rules stricken in its entirety.\u201d <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>also 2 </em>Poe <em>Pleading and Practice, </em>\u00a7 668 (1970); <em>National Building Co. v. Gosnell, </em>116 Md. 640, 644, 82 A. 557 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Although the circuit court judge granted Gurany\u2019s motion to \u201cdismiss\u201d and not a Rule 2-322(e) motion to strike, <em>supra, </em>we shall, nevertheless, review the court\u2019s decision as if it had <em>sua sponte </em>granted a motion to strike rather than a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The decision to grant a motion to strike lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Lancaster v. Gardiner, </em>225 Md. 260, 270, 170 A.2d 181 (1961). Such discretion, however, is not unlimited and the courts must be cognizant of the rule that, in deciding a motion to strike for failure to file a pleading timely, they should afford \u201cgreat liberality in the allowance of amendments in order to prevent the substantial injustice of a cause from being defeated by formal slips or slight variances.\u201d <em>Goldstein v. Peninsula Bank, </em>41 Md.App. 224, 230, 396 A.2d 542 (1979); Niemeyer &amp; Richards, <em>supra, </em>at 46. Absent prejudice to the defendant, the motion to strike ordinarily should be denied, <em>id.; </em>5 C. Thompson &amp; D. Jakala, Cyclopedia of Federal Procedure \u00a7 15.398 (3rd ed. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Applying this standard to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find that the circuit court judge abused his discretion in dismissing with prejudice Patapsco\u2019s action against Gurany. There is no indication in the record that any prejudice resulted from Patapsco\u2019s mere three day delay in filing the circuit court complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\">. The District Court\u2019s exclusive original jurisdiction does not ordinarily include those cases where the amount in controversy is more than $2500.00. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 4 \u2014 402(d) (1984 &amp; Supp. 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\">. We do not decide whether Patapsco\u2019s premature motion to dismiss was a nullity as we assume, <em>infra </em>at I, that the court\u2019s judgment is a result of the court acting <em>sua sponte </em>to strike the pleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\">. We recognize that the practical effect of the court's granting of a motion to dismiss, without leave to amend, Md. Rule 2-322(b)(2), is no different than the granting of a motion to strike the entire initial complaint without giving leave to amend, Rule 2-322(e). Both have a preclusive effect under the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
