Hahner; William M. Densford; William E. Miller, II; Frances L. Miller and The Riggs National Bank of Washington, D.C., co-trustees under the will of John W. Miller; and John L. Miller and Associates (\u201cAppellees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In denying DMH\u2019s motion the court ruled that appellees, as the sellers of a certain piece of agricultural land, had adequately notified DMH, the buyer of that land, of the potential imposition by the State of an \u201cagricultural land transfer tax,\u201d Subtitle 3 of the Tax Property Article, and, therefore, the appellees were not liable under \u00a7 13-308 of the Tax Property Article which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">Notice of tax liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">(a) <em>Notice to buyer. </em>\u2014 When a contract is executed for the transfer of any interest in agricultural land, the seller shall notify the buyer, in writing, that the transfer may be subject to the agricultural land transfer tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">(b) <em>Liability for failure to notify. </em>\u2014 If a seller fails to notify a buyer as required by subsection (a) of this section, the seller is liable to the buyer for the agricultural land transfer tax paid by the buyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The circuit court judge then ruled, by way of granting appellees\u2019 motion, that, by the express terms of the parties\u2019 land sales contract, the agricultural transfer tax was to be paid one-half by the buyer and one-half by the sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>On appeal DMH raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">I. Did the circuit court err in its initial holding that DMH is not a \u201cbuyer\u201d within the purview of \u00a7 13-308?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">II. Did the circuit court judge err in his alternative conclusions that a buyer\u2019s actual knowledge of the agricultural land transfer tax satisfies the statutory requirement that the seller give the buyer written notice of such a tax and that DMH had actual knowledge of that tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">III. Assuming that DMH was adequately notified of the agricultural land transfer tax, thereby satisfying the requirements of \u00a7 13-308(a), did the circuit court judge err in ruling by way of summary judgment that, under the terms of the land sales contract, the parties agreed that each would pay one-half of the agricultural land transfer tax?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Although we rule in the appellees\u2019 favor on only one of these three issues, that being number III, we, nevertheless, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Prior to August 1987, the appellees were tenants in common of an approximately 42 acre tract of land (the \u201cProperty\u201d) located in Oxon Hill, in Prince George\u2019s County. In January 1986, Harvey Maisel, individually, and on behalf of John Driggs, and Maisel-Hollins Development Company, Inc. (which included Michael Hollins) prepared a written offer (the \u201cfirst offer\u201d) to purchase the Property. That offer provided in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">All Documentary Stamps, Transfer Taxes and Recordation Taxes are to be paid for equally by Seller and Purchaser, <em>provided, however, any transfer or other taxes pertaining to any rezoning or farmland or timberland assessment for the Property shall be paid solely by Seller </em>to the extent that they exceed the regular rates for transfer and recordation taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">(Emphasis supplied.) (The undisputed evidence indicates that both Maisel and Hollins took special notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>provision concerning the payment of the agricultural land transfer tax.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">When the first offer was rejected by the appellees the parties entered further negotiations. On August 14, 1986, these negotiations culminated in an \u201cAgreement of Sale\u201d between the appellees, as sellers, and the <em>individuals </em>who had made the first offer (Harvey Maisel, Michael S. Hollins, and John Driggs) as the buyers. This agreement, which provides in general terms that the buyers were to pay $5,237,277.00 for the Property and set August 3, 1987 as the closing date, also directs, at \u201cSection 9\u201d, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">The cost of preparing all necessary conveyancing papers, the title examining charges, notary fees and recording taxes incurred in recording the deed, and all other ordinary settlement charges shall be paid by Purchaser. Transfer taxes shall be split equally between Seller and Purchaser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Subsequent to the signing of the August 14 Agreement of Sale, but before the eventual closing date, Driggs, Maisel and Hollins entered into a joint venture, DMH, which had as its purpose the acquisition and development of the Property. The three individuals assigned to DMH \u201call their right, title, interest and estate\u201d in the Agreement of Sale. Thereafter, on August 3, 1987, the closing date under the Agreement, appellees conveyed the Property to DMH; this was apparently the first time that appellees were made aware of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">When the deed to the Property was subsequently recorded the following taxes were assessed against the Property: a State Agricultural Land Transfer Tax of $238,327.95, as provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Maryland Tax Property Article (1986); a Prince George\u2019s County transfer tax, pursuant to Prince George\u2019s County Code \u00a7 10-188; and a general State transfer tax applicable to all real estate transactions, Md. Tax Property Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 13-202 to 13-203. This assessment precipitated a dispute between the parties as to who should pay the agricultural land transfer tax. Appellees asserted that, pursuant to Section 9 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Agreement of Sale, one-half of each of the taxes, including the agricultural land transfer tax, should be paid by the buyer and one-balf by the sellers. DMH, on the other hand, argued that appellees failed to provide the written notice required by \u00a7 13-308(a) and, therefore, under \u00a7 13-308(b) appellees were solely .responsible for the value of the tax. To avoid any further delays in the transaction, the parties entered into an agreement whereby each paid one-half of each tax and DMH reserved the right to institute legal proceedings to recover any amount paid by it for the agricultural land transfer tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">DMH subsequently filed suit, under \u00a7 13-308(b), in which it asserted that appellees, as the sellers of property subject to an agricultural land transfer tax, had failed to provide DMH, as the buyer, of written notice of such tax and that under \u00a7 13-308(b) appellees were, therefore, liable for the full amount of that tax. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The circuit court judge, ruling on the motions for summary judgment, held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">(1) DMH, as the assignee of the land sales contract, is not a \u201cbuyer\u201d entitled to the protections of \u00a7 13-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">(2) Assuming that DMH is a \u201cbuyer\u201d under \u00a7 13-308, where the buyers of property which is subject to an agricultural land transfer tax have <em>actual </em>notice that the property is subject to such a tax, the requirements of \u00a7 13-308(a), which calls for <em>written </em>notice, are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">(3) The admissions by Maisel and Hollins that they considered that the Property carried an agricultural land transfer tax, coupled with the court\u2019s observations of the buyers\u2019 sophistication in real estate matters, indicated that the buyers did have actual knowledge of the agricultural land transfer tax and, therefore, the notice requirements of \u00a7 13-308 were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">(4) The parties agreed that all transfer taxes would be paid one-half by each party and pursuant to \u00a7 13-102 of the Tax Property Article that agreement controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The court then issued an order which, in effect, maintained the economic <em>status quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<em>Scope of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The circuit court judge, in entering summary judgment under Maryland Rule 2-501, determined that \u201cthere was no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that ... [appellees were] entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(e). On review of this decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">[W]e [too] are concerned with whether there was a dispute as to any material fact and if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In considering the duly shown facts, all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom must be considered in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and against the party making the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>Liscombe v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 621, 495 A.2d 838 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\n<em>Is DMH a \u201cBuyer\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Section 13-308(a) provides that \u201c[w]hen a contract is executed for the transfer of any interest in agricultural land, the seller shall notify the buyer ... that the land may be subject to the agricultural land transfer tax.\u201d The circuit court judge concluded that, since the \u201cbuyer\u201d under this section must be a party to the transaction \u201cwhen a contract [of sale] is executed,\u201d \u00a7 13-308 did not provide any protection for a subsequent assignee of the contract who, although a buyer, was not so \u201cwhen a contract [of sale] was executed.\u201d We disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion and hold that DMH is a \u201cbuyer\u201d entitled to the benefits of \u00a7 13-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Assuming, but only for purposes of this discussion, that appellees did not satisfy the notice requirements of \u00a7 13-308(a), under \u00a7 13-308(b), at the moment that appellees and the individual buyers executed the August 14, 1986 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201cAgreement of Sale\u201d, the appellee's became liable to the buyers to pay the full amount of the agricultural land transfer tax resulting from the August 14 Agreement. Consequently, when the individual buyers assigned \u201call their right, title, interest and estate\u201d in the \u201cAgreement of Sale\u201d to DMH, DMH, as assignee, took \u201cthe subject of the assignment with all rights and remedies possessed by or available to the assignor,\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Security Fund, State of Maryland v. All Coverage Underwriters, Inc., </em>22 Md.App. 586, 614, 325 A.2d 115 (1974), including the statutory remedy for the transfer tax under \u00a7 13-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Appellees contend that the practical effect of this holding will be \u201cthat any person or entity intervening, by acquisition or development of some right or interest in or under a contract of sale, between the time of the execution of a contract for the sale of real property and the ultimate conveyance by deed, would be entitled to [\u00a7 13-308(a)] notice,\u201d from the seller. The statute, however, does not require that notice be given <em>after </em>the execution of the contract of sale but only <em>\u201cwhen </em>a contract is executed.\u201d Since the seller executes a contract of sale only with the buyer/assignor (and not subsequent assignees) the seller would not be required, under our interpretation of \u00a7 13-308, to provide notice to subsequent assignees. We note that \u00a7 13-308(a) requires that notice be provided when a <em>\u201ccontract \u201d </em>is executed and not when a <em>\u201cdeed \u201d, </em>Md. Real Property Code Ann. \u00a7 l-101(c) (1986), is transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Appellees,, citing <em>Strickland v. Sellers, </em>78 F.Supp. 274, 276 (1948) and <em>Snodgrass v. Sisson\u2019s Motor Home Sales, Inc., </em>161 W.Va. 588, 244 S.E.2d 321, 322-23 (1978), argue that the right conferred upon the buyer by \u00a7 13-308 is a penalty provision and is, therefore, not assignable. <em>Id. </em>The applicable rule, as stated in 6A C.J.S. <em>Assignments </em>\u00a7 42 (1975), is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">A statutory right of action is generally assignable, except where it is conferred on one of a particular class, in the nature of a personal privilege, or penalty available to him alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>A statutory right of action is assignable where the statute imposes a contractual relation, and not a penalty in the strict sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We reject appellees\u2019 classification of \u00a7 13-308 as a strict penalty provision or personal privilege. Rather, we find that this provision \u201cimposes a contractual relation\u201d between the buyer and seller by defining which of the two must pay the agricultural land transfer tax where the writings of the parties are silent on the issue. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-102 and \u00a7 13-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">We also reject the circuit court judge\u2019s interpretation that the \u00a7 13-308(a) requirement, that notice of the agricultural land transfer tax be \u201cin writing\u201d, is satisfied where the seller fails to provide the <em>written </em>notification but the buyer has <em>actual </em>notice of such a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The issue here is essentially \u201c[w]ill knowledge of the facts of which notification is to be given, acquired informally, take the place of the law\u2019s punctilios?\u201d 1 M. Merrill, Merrill on Notice \u00a7 505 (1952). Merrill states as the general rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">If it [(notice)] is simply for the purpose of giving information, or of creating a likelihood that information will be received by the noticee, knowledge, which accomplishes this end, is an acceptable substitute. If, on the other hand, the notification is required for some formal purpose, such as the preservation of a record, or impressing the noticee with the significance thereof, knowledge will not take its place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">This position is in accord with the few Maryland appellate decisions which touch upon the issue. The Court of Appeals has held on the one hand that, \u201cthe requirement of notification purposed to inform may be satisfied by proof of actual notice [(knowledge)].\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>273 Md. 195, 210, 328 A.2d 737 (1974); <em>see also McClay v. Maryland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Assemblies, Inc., </em>269 Md. 465, 476-77, 306 A.2d 524 (1973) (Board\u2019s failure to provide appellants with proper statutory-notice of a hearing was of no effect in light of appellant\u2019s appearance at the hearing); <em>Clark v. Wolman, </em>243 Md. 597, 600, 221 A.2d 687 (1966) (to same effect as McClay). But, on the other hand, the courts have held that strict compliance with the statutory notification procedures <em>are </em>required, for example, to cancel a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy because the purpose of the statute is not just to notify the employer, but, more importantly, to insure that a substitute policy is obtained. <em>Pressman v. State Accident Fund, </em>246 Md. 406, 412-13, 228 A.2d 443 (1967). Moreover, the logic underlying Merrill\u2019s statement of the rule is also in accord with the purpose underlying the Maryland cases interpreting a statutory notice provision; that being to \u201ccarry out the intent of the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Compare Dean v. Pinder, </em>312 Md. 154, 161, 538 A.2d 1184 (1988) <em>and </em>Merrill \u00a7 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Undoubtedly a purpose of the notice provision embodied in \u00a7 13-308 is to inform the potential buyer of the impending agricultural land transfer tax and this purpose would certainly be satisfied by the buyer\u2019s <em>actual </em>knowledge of such a tax. However, the words of the statute, which are the primary source of the legislature\u2019s intent, <em>Dean, </em>312 Md. at 161, 538 A.2d 1184, indicate that information dissemination is not the primary objective of \u00a7 13-308; the primary objective is to preserve the State\u2019s agricultural land.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The agricultural land preservation motive behind the agricultural land transfer tax is evidenced by the overall statutory scheme. Section 13-306 of the Tax Property Article requires that two-thirds of the revenues generated by the agricultural land development tax are to be \u201cremitted into the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund...,\u201d \u00a7 13-306(a)(2), and used \u201cto preserve agricultural land and woodland,\u201d Md. Agricultural Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2-501, and 2-505 (1985). The tax supports this preservation motive in two ways: it generates revenues to enable the State to purchase agricultural land preservation easements, Agri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>cultural Code \u00a7 2-505(c)(3); and, secondly, the tax inhibits property owners from transferring agricultural land to non-agricultural uses, <em>see </em>Md. Tax Property Code \u00a7 13-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Although the revenue generating motive of \u00a7 13-306 is furthered regardless of whether the seller gives the buyer written notice of transfer tax (from a revenue generating position, it does not much matter who pays the tax, so long as it is paid), the transfer inhibiting motive is not fully realized where actual written notice is avoided. This is so because, when followed, the written notification provision in the Tax Code forces the parties to take <em>written </em>notice of the five percent tax \u201cwhen the contract is executed.\u201d The statute thereby insures that the transfer inhibiting objective is not only expressly recognized, but that it is given its fullest effect before the buyer agrees to pay a price which is appropriate only for the commercial or residential development of the land and which, ordinarily, far exceeds the land\u2019s agricultural worth; a result which would force the development of the land. The full effect of the tax must be recognized and its significant inhibiting effects overcome and made part of the basis of the negotiations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, the fact that, under \u00a7 13-308(b), the penalty for silence falls upon the seller further supports the statute\u2019s transfer inhibiting motive as the <em>seller </em>who has the option of retaining the land in its agricultural or woodland status pays, not the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We hold, therefore, that \u00a7 13-308 of the Tax Property Article, which requires that the buyer receive written notice of a potential agricultural land transfer tax, is not satisfied by the buyer\u2019s <em>actual </em>notice; <em>written </em>notice must be given. This conclusion, however, does not end our discussion because, unlike the trial court, we find that DMH did in fact receive written notification of the agricultural land transfer tax and that that notice was legally sufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 13-308(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Section 13-308 states only that \u201cthe seller shall notify the buyer, in writing, that the transfer may be subject to the agricultural land transfer tax ...\u201d it does not \u201cprescribe a form [for the notice].\u201d <em>Bob Holding Corp. v. Normal Realty Corp., </em>223 Md. 260, 267, 164 A.2d 457 (1960). In such a case the question becomes \u201cwhether the notice given constitutes substantial compliance [with the statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 164 A.2d 457; <em>Ottenheimer Publishers, Inc. v. Employment Security Administration, </em>275 Md. 514, 519-20, 340 A.2d 701 (1975); <em>Montgomery County v. Glassman, </em>245 Md. 192, 200-204, 225 A.2d 448 (1967), and that issue is one for the <em>courts </em>to decide, not a jury. Merrill \u00a7 754 (\u201c[W]hether the notification given complies with the statutory standard is a question for the court, unless more than one inference of fact can be drawn as to the impression it should reasonably convey.); <em>see also Peters v. Ramsay, </em>273 Md. 21, 25-26, 327 A.2d 472 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The only \u201cwriting\u201d, \u00a7 13-308(a), between the buyer and seller \u201cwhen the contract <em>[sub judice </em>was] executed,\u201d <em>id., </em>was the August 14, 1986 Agreement of Sale itself. Consequently, the issue before this Court is whether the provisions in the August 14 Agreement satisfied the requirement of \u00a7 13-308(a) that the \u201cseller notify the buyer ... that the transfer may be subject to the agricultural land transfer tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The Maryland law governing the interpretation of contracts was summarized for this Court by Judge Garrity in <em>Walker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>66 Md.App. 687, 691-92, 505 A.2d 884 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[W]e construe the instrument as a whole to determine the intention of the parties. <em>Aragona v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>281 Md. 371, 378 A.2d 1346 (1977). In so doing, we \u201cshould examine the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.\u201d <em>Pacific Indemnity [Company v. Interstate Fire and Casualty Company, </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486 (1985)]. Furthermore, words in a ... [contract] should be given their ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and accepted meaning, the test being \u201cwhat meaning a reasonable prudent lay person would attach to the term.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">The court ... may construe unambiguous ... provisions as a matter of law. Additionally, ... language is not ambiguous simply because it is general in nature or undefined by the policy. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Marks Rentals, Inc., </em>288 Md. 428, 433, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980). In fact, ambiguity arises only if the language is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning by a reasonably prudent layperson. <em>Id. </em>In the event that language is found to be ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be admitted to determine the intention of the parties. If the extrinsic evidence clarifies the ambiguity, interpretation of the contract is a matter for the court. If the extrinsic evidence fails to clarify and the ambiguity persists, then the interpretation of the contract becomes a matter for the jury to decide. <em>Pacific Indemnity, </em>302 Md. at 389, 488 A.2d 486____ [(Additional citations omitted.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Section 9 of the August 14 Agreement states that \u201c[t]ransfer taxes shall be split equally between the seller and purchaser.\u201d In light of the fact that the property was subject to no fewer than three \u201ctransfer taxes\u201d and that the parties\u2019 disagree as to which taxes this phrase refers, we find that this language is ambiguous and subject to interpretation with the aid of the extrinsic evidence. <em>Walker, supra. </em>Furthermore, as will be explained below, because \u201cthe extrinsic evidence clarifies the ambiguity, [the] interpretation of [this] contract is a matter [of law] for the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>66 Md.App. at 692, 505 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The first offer of January 1986, which was drafted by essentially the same individuals who were the buyers under the final Agreement, provided that the sellers would pay any farmland assessment. The subsequent agreement between the drafters of the initial offer, who by that time were acting under the name of their joint venture rather than as individuals, made the very significant change that all transfer taxes would be split evenly between the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Given the significant financial impact of this change, the sophistication of the parties, the length of their negotiation, and the detail of their final Agreement, the only meaning that \u201ca reasonable prudent layperson would attach to the term\u201d, <em>Walker, </em>66 Md. at 691, 505 A.2d 884, \u201ctransfer taxes\u201d, as used in the final agreement, is that ascribed by the Appellees; the parties to the Agreement intended that the phrase \u201ctransfer taxes\u201d, as used therein, specifically includes the Agricultural Land Transfer Tax imposed under \u00a7\u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Tax Property Article. Any other construction would yield the unreasonable interpretation that a major expense that was part of the original offer between these sophisticated negotiators was totally ignored by them in their detailed final agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Accordingly, based on the evidence in this case, where the parties to the agreement for the sale of land, which all were aware was potentially subject to the imposition of the Agricultural Land Transfer Tax, by their use of the phrase \u201ctransfer taxes\u201d intended to include therein the Agricultural Land Transfer Tax. The provision in the agreement of sale that the parties would split all \u201ctransfer taxes\u201d was sufficient under the facts of this case to establish written notification to the buyer \u201cthat the transfer may be subject to the agricultural land transfer tax\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 13-308(a) of the Tax Property Article. Therefore, the sellers/appellees are not liable under \u00a7 13-308(b) for the full amount of the agricultural land transfer tax. The buyer received the statutorily mandated written notification of the possible imposition of that tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\n<em>Liability Under the Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Since we have determined which taxes are involved, the question whether the parties are each liable under the <em>Agreement </em>(not the statute) for one-half of the agricultural land transfer tax depends upon the construction of Section 9 of the Agreement of Sale. Where, as here, \u201cthe terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>a contract (with reference to the payment of the taxes) are clear and unambiguous, the construction of those terms is within the province of the court.\u201d <em>H &amp; R Block, Inc. v. Garland, </em>278 Md. 91, 97, 359 A.2d 130 (1976); <em>James Julian, Inc. v. State Highway Administration, </em>63 Md.App. 74, 95, 492 A.2d 308 (1985). The contract specifically requires that \u201c[tjransfer taxes shall be split equally between Seller and Purchaser\u201d and the parties are, therefore, bound by this section and \u00a7 13-102 of the Tax Property Article (which provides that the terms of the parties\u2019 contract control) each to pay one-half of all transfer taxes, including the agricultural land transfer tax imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Tax Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANT AND ONE-HALF BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<author id=\"b315-5\">ROSALYN B. BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The majority holds that Md.Tax-Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-308(a) (1986), which requires the seller to give written notice to the buyer of a potential agricultural land transfer tax, is mandatory and that actual knowledge on the part of the buyer will not satisfy this requirement. The majority also concluded that the contractual provision specifying that \u201ctransfer taxes\u201d be split equally between the buyer and the seller was sufficient written notification. I concur in the result limited to the facts of the case, although I do not agree that actual knowledge may not substitute for the statutory written notification required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Maryland case law has consistently held that notification, purposed to inform, may be replaced by actual knowledge. <em>Rolfe v. Clark, </em>269 Md. 14, 18, 304 A.2d 231 (1973); <em>Tyson v. Masten Lumber &amp; Supply Co., </em>44 Md.App. 293, 302, 408 A.2d 1051 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>287 Md. 758 (1980). This is especially so where the knowledge has been acted upon without reliance upon the absence or defects of the notice. <em>Clark v. Wolman, </em>248 Md. 597, 600, 221 A.2d 687 (1966). Therefore, we must first look to the legislative history to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>determine the purpose of the notification provision. Second, we must determine whether DMH acted in reliance upon the absence of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Before the notification provision was codified in the Property Tax Article in 1985, it was contained in Md.Code Ann. Art. 81, \u00a7 278F(k) (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The preamble to Art. 81, \u00a7 278 provides that it is for the purpose of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201cimposing a tax on the transfer of agricultural land under certain circumstances; \u00a1providing for the calculation, administration, and collection of this tax; <em>providing certain restrictions on local agricultural transfer taxes; </em>and providing for the use of the proceeds of this tax <em>and the tax on certain planned development lands.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">1981 Md.Laws Ch. 808. Furthermore, the preamble for this section\u2019s recodification in the Property Tax Article (\u00a7\u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq.) </em>provides that its purpose is to revise</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APVJ\">\u201cthe laws relating to State transfer tax, agricultural land transfer tax, county transfer tax, and transfer taxes generally, including imposition, exemptions, rates, calculation, payment, and administration, and to distribution of transfer tax revenues____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">1985 Md.Laws Ch. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Both preambles indicate that the major thrust behind these provisions is the assessment of taxes and the collection of revenues. While both provide that a certain portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of these revenues be distributed to the Maryland Agricultural Preservation Fund (Art. 81, \u00a7 278F(h) (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), and Md. Tax-Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-806 (1986, 1988 Cum.Supp.)), the means for preserving Maryland\u2019s farm lands are contained in Md.Agric.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2-501 <em>et seq. </em>(1974, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1988 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The legislative purpose of assessing and collecting these revenues would be fulfilled regardless of whether the buyer received actual written notice. Moreover, even if a secondary purpose of this subtitle were to inhibit the transfer of agricultural land to nonagricultural use <em>(see DMH Joint Venture v. Hahner, </em>No. 1708, Sept. Term, 1988, slip op. at 11), that purpose would be fulfilled by the buyer\u2019s actual knowledge that the transfer may be subject to a substantial tax.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the fact that the penalty for failure to notify falls upon the seller (\u00a7 13-308(b)) is readily susceptible to the interpretation that the Legislature intended to protect an unsophisticated purchaser from an unexpected tax assessment. Therefore, I believe a fair reading of the statute and its legislative history indicate that the Legislature intended the notice provision in \u00a7 13-308 to be for the purpose of <em>informing </em>the buyer of a possible additional tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Next, in determining whether DMH relied upon the absence of the notification, we must examine its conduct throughout the transaction. In January 1986, DMH made a written offer to appellees which provided that \u201cany transfer or other taxes pertaining to any rezoning or farmland or timberland assessment for the Property shall be paid for solely by Seller.\u201d Appellees rejected this offer. Subsequently, the parties executed a contract which provided that the \u201ctransfer taxes\u201d would be split equally between the seller and the buyer. DMH realized that the land might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>subject to the agricultural land transfer tax and made the tax part of the bargained for exchange in the contract. Thus, DMH did not act in reliance on the absence of the notification. Therefore, I would conclude that, in a case such as this, a buyer\u2019s actual knowledge of a potential agricultural land transfer tax may supplant the written notification provision in Md.Tax-Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-308(a) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Finally, while DMH admits that it knew the law, that it was a sophisticated developer, and that the property was agricultural and hence might be subject to the agricultural land transfer tax, it attempts to make a great deal out of the fact that it did not know this land was in fact subject to the tax. Section 13-308(a), however, does not require that the buyer be informed that the property <em>is </em>subject to the tax. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201cWhen a contract is executed for the transfer of any interest in agricultural land, the seller shall notify the buyer, in writing, that the transfer <em>may be </em>subject to the agricultural land transfer tax.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In this context, \u201cmay be\u201d is used to denote the possibility, not the certainty, that the property will be subject to the tax. Thus, DMH\u2019s arguments on this point have no merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\">. In this sense, \u00a7 13-308 can be considered analogous to Hester Prynne\u2019s scarlet letter. \u201cThe Scarlett Letter\u201d by Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">. A comparison of Art. 81, \u00a7 278F(k) with \u00a7 13-308(a) of the Property Tax Code reveals that the modifications in the language clarified the requirement. Article 81, \u00a7 278F(k) required that, if the land <em>will be </em>subject to the agricultural land transfer tax, the buyer must be notified that the land transferred <em>may be </em>subject to the tax. This creates an inconsistency between what the seller knows <em>(i.e., </em>that the land will be subject to the tax) and what information must be given to the buyer <em>(i.e., </em>that the land may be subject to the tax). Section 13-308(a), on the other hand, provides, in essence, that, if the land <em>may be </em>subject to the tax, the buyer must be so informed. Thus, there is greater consistency between the seller\u2019s knowledge and the information to be given to the buyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\">. The majority\u2019s interpretation may even encourage sophisticated developers to avoid the tax by drafting offers for the purchase of property which simply leave out any mention of the agricultural land transfer tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
