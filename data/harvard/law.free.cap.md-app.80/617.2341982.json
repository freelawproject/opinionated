BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">At issue on this appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City are questions of entitlement. Barry D. Rollins and Raymond A. Brookhart, substituted trustees under a deed of trust (appellants) securing indebtedness owed by Anthony Bravos, one of the appellees, to Loyola Federal Savings and Loan Association (Loyola), maintain that the purchaser of fire damaged property at foreclosure sale is also entitled to receive insurance proceeds paid in respect of the damage. Bravos and an insurance adjustment company, Goodman-Gable-Gould-Co., the other appellee, argue, on the other hand, that the proceeds must be applied to extinguish Bravos\u2019 debt and that, since Loyola\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>bid at foreclosure exceeded Bravos\u2019 debt to it, it was entitled to none of the proceeds. Goodman also maintains that it is entitled to have its fee for adjusting the fire insurance claim paid out of those proceeds. It is Bravos\u2019 position that he is entitled to retain that portion of the insurance proceeds remaining after the extinguishment of Loyola\u2019s mortgage debt, the payment of appellee Goodman\u2019s fee, and the payment of other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The trial judge accepted appellees\u2019 argument and ruled against appellants. Appellants have appealed. As will hereinafter become apparent, it provides appellants little solace.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Bravos borrowed $240,000 from Loyola for the purchase of property located at 921 N. Charles Street. To secure the indebtedness, he deeded the property to appellants in trust for Loyola. He also executed a Deed of Trust Note made payable to Loyola. Paragraph 6 of the deed of trust provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">That he will keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the said premises insured as may be required from time to time by the holder of the note against loss by fire and other hazards, casualties, and contingencies in such amounts and for such periods as may be required by the holder of the note and will pay promptly, when due, any premium on such insurance, provisions for payment of which has not been made hereinbefore. All insurance shall be carried in companies approved by the holder of the note and the policies and renewals thereof shall be held by the holder of the note and have attached thereto loss payable clauses in favor of and in form acceptable to the holder of the note. In event of loss he will give immediate notice by mail to the holder of the note, who may make proof of loss if not made promptly by the party of the first part, and each insurance company concerned is hereby authorized and directed to make payment for such loss directly to the holder of the note instead of to the party of the first part and the holder of the note jointly, and insurance proceeds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>or any part thereof, may be applied by the holder of the note as [sic] its option either to the reduction of the indebtedness hereby secured or to the restoration or repair of the property damaged. <em>In event of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust or other transfer of title to the said premises in extinguishment of the indebtedness secured hereby, all right, title, and interest of the party of the first part in and to any insurance policies then in force shall pass to the purchaser or grantee. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">After Bravos paid only a small portion of the principal amount of the loan, he defaulted and foreclosure proceedings against the property were instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Prior to the commencement of foreclosure proceedings, the property was damaged by a major fire. At the time that it was sold, the property was valued at approximately $125,000; it had not been repaired, thus, the lower value. Notwithstanding the value of the property, appellants sold the property at public auction to their principal, Loyola, at a purchase price of $265,000, an amount in excess of the principal amount of the Deed of Trust note.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Prior to the sale and after consultation with appellants, the auctioneer advised the prospective bidders concerning their right to receive insurance proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJD\">During the time that you are the successful bidder and it\u2019s knocked down to you, the insurance money comes in prior to the auditor ratifying his auditors report you will not necessarily be [e]ntitled to the insurance claim in money, it will be applied to the debt. If, however, the auditor ratifies his report and the money has not come in, then you may have a right to claim the money____ It is obvious the place has been fire damaged, there is a claim for fire damage. The monies have not come in. If the money comes in during the time that the auditor has not ratified his report, his audit between 16-20 days approximately from sale date for ratification, then you will have the right to claim the money if he ratifies the auditor\u2019s sale, the auditor\u2019s report. If the money comes in during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the time he has not ratified it, the money will be applied to the debt____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Questions from the bidders produced the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiP\">AUDIENCE: When does all that take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8S\">AUCTIONEER: We are still waiting for the insurance money. If the insurance money comes in between now and time that the sale has not been ratified by the auditor, you will not have a claim on the money, it will be applied to the debt. If the money comes in after the time that the sale has been ratified by the auditor you will have a right to the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">AUDIENCE: Does that take place after the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtO\">AUCTIONEER: Let me explain something to you. You\u2019re not listening. (Let Mr. Rinaudo go a little further.) The sale must first must be ratified by the court under an order of starting within thirty days after the date we record it. After the sale has been ratified the auditor states his account which is a period of time from 15 to 20 days after the ratification of sale. After the 20 days, then the court auditor sends out his notices and then if there are no objections to the auditor\u2019s account then the sale that auditor\u2019s account is ratified. Then you are talking about a month to two months from now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHN\">AUDIENCE: And if it comes in before that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlN\">AUCTIONEER: It goes into the auditor\u2019s account as additional deposit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Subsequent to the sale, Loyola received the insurance proceeds in the amount of $188,040.25. Loyola did not apply the proceeds to reduce its mortgage debt, rather it asserted its entitlement to them as the purchaser at the foreclosure sale. In the meantime, Loyola sold the property it had purchased at foreclosure for $265,000 for $130,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The initial report of sale was filed, and ratified, shortly after the foreclosure sale. When the insurance proceeds had been received, appellants filed an amended report of sale, acknowledging receipt of the proceeds and seeking to include them as part of the property sold to, and bought by, Loyola. That amended report was ratified by the court and appellees filed a timely objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Treating Bravos\u2019 objection as a motion for reconsideration, the court, by order dated April 4, 1988, referred the case to the General Equity Master for \u201chearing, report and recommendation as provided by Rule 2-541.\u201d Because appellee Goodman\u2019s motion alleged an equitable lien on any surplus remaining after the foreclosure sale, the court, by order of the same date, pursuant to Md.Rule W75, referred it to the auditor \u201cfor a determination of its validity and priority.\u201d To date, the auditor has not rendered a decision in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Bravos\u2019 objection challenged Loyola\u2019s entitlement to the insurance proceeds on two grounds:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">1. That [the] Deed of Trust allows Loyola Federal, upon foreclosure, to keep the insurance proceeds so long as the debt is extinguished. Loyola Federal has not extinguished the debt, however, they propose to keep the insurance proceeds and also to make a claim for the full amount of the debt plus interest, denying the Defendant of any benefit from the insurance he maintained on the premises. In the alternative, without considering a foreclosure, Loyola must use the insurance proceeds to reduce the mortgage debt or to restore the premises, either of which would have benefit the Defendant. Loyola has also refused to exercise those options.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">2. That the instructions given by the auctioneer before the bidding commenced were confusing, misleading and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>chilled the bidding process allowing Loyola to purchase the property at below market value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The General Equity Master rejected both rationales and concluded that, inasmuch as Loyola was entitled to the insurance money, its amended Report of Sale should be accepted by the court. As to the latter, the Master found: \u201c[sjince Loyola Federal, the lender, purchased at the sale, the announcements by the auctioneer are not relevant\u201d and, in any event, objection on that basis \u201cshould have been timely raised [within thirty days of] the original report of sale ...\u201d pursuant to Md.Rule BR6.b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Concerning the former, the Master construed the last sentence of paragraph six of the Deed of Trust. She concluded that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018other transfer of title to the said premises in extinguishment of the indebtedness hereby\u2019 is a separate term from \u2018foreclosure.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEPK\">[u]nder Maryland law foreclosure does not extinguish the debt, and the lender has a right to a deficiency judgment[,] Rule W75.b [,i]t would be incorrect to interpret the deed of trust language in a manner that modifies the word foreclosure with the phrase \u201cin extinguishment of the indebtedness\u201d. Such an interpretation would be contrary to both the syntax of the deed of trust and existing Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The trial court sustained exceptions, filed by both appellees, to the Master\u2019s Report and Recommendation. By its order, the court rescinded its prior approval of the amended report; ordered that the auditor apply the insurance proceeds as a reduction of Loyola\u2019s claim; and ordered that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>auditor allow Goodman\u2019s claim in the amount of its fee for adjusting the insurance claim. It is from this order that appellants have appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Appellants maintain that paragraph six of the deed of trust and, in particular, the last sentence of that paragraph, means that the insurance proceeds pass to the foreclosure sale purchaser as a part of the property sold at the foreclosure sale. To reach this result, appellants interpret \u201cforeclosure\u201d as being different from \u201cother transfer of title to the said premises in extinguishment of the indebtedness secured hereby.\u201d Thus, limited to the situation applicable to them, appellants read the last sentence as follows, \u201cin the event of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust, ... all right, title, and interest ... in and to any insurance policies then in force shall pass to the purchaser or grantee.\u201d Appellants thus rely upon the rule of the last antecedent, pursuant to which, modifying words, clauses, or phrases refer to the words, clauses, or phrases immediately preceding them and not to remote antecedents. <em>See In Re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, </em>525 P.Supp. 1265, 1286 (D.Md.1981); <em>Sullivan v. Dixon, </em>280 Md. 444, 451, 373 A.2d 1245 (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, it is implicit in appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>argument that the phrase, \u201cinsurance policies then in force\u201d, necessarily includes insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Rules of construction, including grammatical rules, while helpful, are not controlling as to the meaning of a particular phrase. <em>See Stanbalt Realty v. Commercial Credit Corp., </em>42 Md.App. 538, 543, 401 A.2d 1043 (1979). Where the context, <em>In Re Mid-Atlantic, </em>525 F.Supp. at 1286, or the intention of the parties indicate that it is otherwise, an interpretation suggested by the rule of the last antecedent will be subordinated to the context or the intent of the parties. In short, \u201c[t]he \u2018last antecedent\u2019 rule is merely an aid to construction and will not be adhered to where remote antecedent is clearly intended.\u201d 42 Md.App. at 544, 401 A.2d 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">It is true, as appellants insist, that unless the proceeds of the sale are sufficient for that purpose, the mere foreclosure on a deed of trust and even sale of the property pursuant to the foreclosure proceedings, does not \u201cextinguish\u201d the debt, <em>see Mizen v. Thomas, </em>156 Md. 313, 319, 144 A. 479 (1929); <em>Weismiller v. Bush, </em>56 Md.App. 593, 598-99, 468 A.2d 646 (1983); in appropriate circumstances, a deficiency judgment may be entered in favor of the mortgagee. <em>Kronovet v. Lipchin, </em>288 Md. 30, 57, 415 A.2d 1096 (1980); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>McKenna v. Sachse, Executor, 225 </em>Md. 595, 599-600, 171 A.2d 732 (1961); <em>Kline v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>43 Md.App. 133, 143, 403 A.2d 395 (1979); <em>Garland v. Hill, </em>28 Md.App. 622, 630, 346 A.2d 711, <em>aff'd, </em>277 Md. 710, 357 A.2d 374 (1975). That this is so does not, however, render ineluctable the position taken by appellants. The validity of their position necessarily depends upon the extent to which it reflects the status of Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">As we have seen, the mortgaged property was substantially damaged by a hazard against which the mortgagor was required to and, indeed, did, insure, prior to default. Upon his default, foreclosure proceedings were instituted and a foreclosure sale held prior to the insurance proceeds being paid. Notwithstanding the fact that the property had a much lower value after the fire than it had before, the mortgagee purchased the property for an amount in excess of the debt owed by the mortgagor. Thus, the precise issue presented here is whether, under these facts, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale is entitled to receive, in addition to the premises bid upon, insurance proceeds due in respect of the damage to those premises. Put another way, the question is: were the insurance proceeds a part of the consideration for which the mortgagee bid at the foreclosure sale? This precise issue has not been decided by a Maryland court. Other jurisdictions have, however, and, for the most part, they have applied the \u201cforeclosure after loss\u201d principle. <em>See, e.g., Calvert Fire Insurance Company v. Environs Development Corp., </em>601 F.2d 851, 855-56 (5th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Lititz Mutual Insurance Company, </em>694 F.Supp. 159 (M.D.N.C. 1988); <em>Tech Land Development, Inc. v. South Carolina Insurance Company, </em>57 N.C.App. 566, 291 S.E.2d 821, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 N.C. 563, 294 S.E.2d 228 (1982); <em>Laurel National Bank v. Mutual Benefit Insurance Company, </em>297 Pa.Super. 473, 444 A.2d 130 (1982); <em>Smith v. Stockton, Whatley, Davin &amp; Company, </em>487 So.2d 923 (Ala.Civ.App.1985); <em>Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company v. Wilborn, </em>291 Ala. 193, 279 So.2d 460 (1973); <em>Imperial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>Mortgage Corporation v. Travelers Indemnity Company of Rhode Island, </em>43 Colo.App. 74, 599 P.2d 276 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The approach taken by these courts, which may be characterized as the majority view, <em>see Lititz Mutual Insurance Company, </em>694 F.Supp. at 160; <em>5A J Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 3403 (1970, 1981 Supp.), stresses the sequence of events. Thus, where the insured premises are damaged before foreclosure proceedings have been instituted or, if after they have been instituted, prior to the sale being held, and the mortgagee purchases the property at the foreclosure sale, the mortgagee is permitted to retain the insurance proceeds pursuant to a mortgage clause requiring insurance, to the extent of any deficiency between the amount brought at foreclosure and the amount of the debt. The remainder of the proceeds is payable to the mortgagor. <em>See Wilborn, </em>279 So.2d at 463; <em>Smith, </em>487 So.2d at 925; <em>Calvert, </em>601 F.2d at 856; <em>Tech Land Development, </em>291 S.E.2d at 823. This is so because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">The creditor\u2019s interest in the insurance proceeds is recognized as security for the payment of the debt. The insurance is an alternative source of payment and once the debt is paid by some other means any right to the insurance is thereby extinguished. Equity requires that subsequent events such as payment of the underlying debt not be ignored when a court distributes the insurance proceeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\"><em>Calvert, </em>601 F.2d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Moreover, the mortgagee who bids on the property at the sale \u201cis bound by its bid, [and] the debt has to that extent been satisfied and extinguished\u201d. <em>Calvert, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">A case quite similar to the case before us is <em>Smith. </em>There, the mortgagor was obligated, under a clause virtually identical to paragraph six of the mortgage in this case, to maintain insurance on the mortgaged premises. Although foreclosure proceedings were instituted prior to the premises being damaged, the foreclosure sale was not held until afterwards. At the sale, the mortgagee bid the exact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>amount of principal and interest then due, plus the expenses of foreclosure. Being the successful bidder, the mortgagee sought to recover and retain the insurance proceeds payable in respect of the damage to the premises and the trial court granted summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama reversed, rejecting an argument very similar to that made here, that the last sentence of the applicable mortgage paragraph, whereby the mortgagor assigned all of his \u201cright, title and interest ... in and to the insurance policies then in force\u201d to the mortgagee distinguished that case from <em>Wilborn. </em>The Court reasoned, quoting from <em>Wilborn:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\"><em>A </em>debt is as effectually paid whether by the voluntary act of the debtor, or by compulsory proceedings of any sort which have that legal effect. When so, all rights as a creditor immediately terminate____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">It is a fixed principle that when a mortgagee forecloses his mortgage, and at the sale the property brings, and he collects the full amount of his debt, he is no longer a creditor, but his debt is paid. This is so when he buys at the sale, with due authority, bidding the full amount of his debt. He is then the owner of the property, and not a creditor. There is in the former owner only a statutory right, which is not a property ownership. He has collected his debt as effectually as if another had bought the property and paid him the full amount as purchase money, or if the debtor had paid him in cash of his own accord____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">487 So.2d at 926, quoting <em>Aetna Insurance Company v. Baldwin County Building and Loan Association, </em>231 Ala. 102, 163 So. 604, 605-06 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">As we have indicated, no Maryland case has decided this precise issue. It has been decided, however, that where a mortgage requires the mortgagor to insure the property against loss and the property is so insured when a loss occurs as to which the insurance applies, the proceeds of the policy of insurance must be applied to the extinguishment of the debt. <em>See Seidewitz v. Sun Life Insurance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>Company of America, </em>144 Md. 508, 514-515, 125 A. 78 (1924); <em>Rent-A-Car Company v. Fire Insurance Company, </em>158 Md. 169, 177-78, 148 A. 252 (1929). <em>See also Heinz v. German Building Association, </em>95 Md. 160, 169, 51 A. 951 (1902), in which the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Smith v. Packard, </em>19 N.H. 575, it is said that if a policy of insurance upon mortgaged property be assigned to the mortgagee as collateral security any sum of money, to which, as such assignee, he may become entitled by the destruction of the insured property before the foreclosure of the mortgage, is applicable to the payment of the debt and as to the remainder he is the trustee of the mortgagor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Appellants counter with the argument that existing law is that the purchaser at the foreclosure sale is entitled to receive insurance proceeds. Rather than support that argument with citation to cases which stand for the proposition it asserts, after analyzing the rationale underlying the cases cited by appellees, they seek to demonstrate that the fact patterns in those cases are different from that in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Thus, appellants note that the rule enunciated by the cases cited by appellees is designed to prevent double recovery by the mortgagee and proceeds on the theory that, at a foreclosure sale, a bid in the amount of the debt extinguishes the debt and, consequently, the mortgagee\u2019s entitlement to insurance proceeds. They offer two bases upon which to distinguish this case from <em>Calvert Fire, </em>the case upon which they primarily focus, and the other cases relied upon by appellees. First, they point out, none of the cases involved a mortgage provision similar to the last sentence of paragraph six of the deed of trust \u2014 \u201cIn the event of foreclosure ... all right, title and interest ... in and to insurance policies then in force shall pass to the purchaser.\u201d Second, they maintain that there is no chance of a double recovery in this case, notwithstanding that Loyola bid more than the mortgage debt at the foreclosure sale. They reason that what Loyola bought was appraised for only $125,000, thus, the only explanation for the bid was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>that it was designed to acquire the insurance proceeds as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">As we have already seen, <em>Smith, supra, </em>involved a mortgage with the identical language to that relied upon by appellants here. Notwithstanding that language, the Court had no difficulty determining that the principal of \u201cforeclosure after loss\u201d applied; in the words of the court, \u201cAfter the loss, there was no more insurance on the property so lost under the <em>Baldwin </em>case. Hence, there was no \u2018insurance policy then in force\u2019 as to the lost mortgage property which could transfer under paragraph 7 of the mortgage.\u201d Id., 487 So.2d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Appellants\u2019 alternative rationale is equally unavailing. First, the position is inconsistent with the advice the auctioneer gave concerning insurance proceeds prior to the foreclosure sale. That advice, which was given after consultation with appellants, essentially mirrored the \u201cforeclosure after loss\u201d principal. Second, and just as important, appellants were aware, prior to the foreclosure sale, that there was an insurance claim outstanding in respect of damage to the mortgaged property. To the extent that Loyola was operating under a misconception as to the proper disposition of those insurance proceeds, it must bear the loss. <em>See Partel, Inc. v. Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>106 Ill.App.3d 962, 63 Ill.Dec. 303, 304, 437 N.E.2d 1225, 1226, <em>cert. denied, </em>91 Ill.2d 572 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In that case, prior to initiation of foreclosure proceedings, property which was subject to three mortgages had been damaged in a fire. At the time of the foreclosure sale, $51,573 in fire insurance proceeds were available, in escrow. One of the mortgagees was the successful bidder at the foreclosure sale. He bid the entire amount of his debt, plus the amount of a superior mortgage. A deficiency judgment was entered in favor of the third mortgagee. The successful bidder\u2019s motion for the turnover of the insurance proceeds was denied, the court determining that, by bidding the entire amount of his adjudicated lien, he had extinguished his debt. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>... As Margolis does not argue to the contrary, it seems clear that his bid was made with the full knowledge of the condition of the premises, of the existence of the insurance proceeds, and of the trial court\u2019s order placing the proceeds in escrow to be disbursed pursuant to further order. There also is no indication that Margolis, ... pl\u00e1ced insurance on the property, paid the premiums as an advance to Harris Bank, or sought to receive credit at the time of the sale. Moreover, at the foreclosure sale, Margolis ... bid his entire adjudicated indebtedness, and Margolis refers us to no part of the record which would suggest that he bid anything other than the fair cash value of the property and thus might be entitled to a deficiency judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">63 Ill.Dec. at 305, 437 N.E.2d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">With the exception of the lack of evidence as to the fair cash value of the property, this situation mirrors the facts <em>sub judice. </em>We do not deem the fact that the record in this case reflects that the fair value of the property was less than the amount of the successful bid is a significant difference \u2014 the property was advertised for sale \u201cas is.\u201d In any event, what the Court said in its Supplemental Opinion Upon Denial Of The Petition For Rehearing applies equally as well, if not even better, to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">We view this contention[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] to be without merit. Margolis asks the court to assume, in effect, that had he known the insurance proceeds could be applied to the mortgage debt, he would have reduced his bid by that amount. He does not, however, dispute the facts of the case; rather, it appears that he asks us to disregard them \u2014 in particular, the fact that the bid was made with the full knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the condition of the premises and of the existence of the insurance proceeds which had been escrowed pending further court order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">63 Ill.Dec. at 306-307, 437 N.E.2d at 1228-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Appellants also maintain that appellees did not timely object to the sale because their objections were lodged long after the passage of thirty days from the original report of sale. <em>See </em>Md.Rule BR6.b.2. That contention is utterly without merit. Appellees were permitted to view Loyola\u2019s bid, in an amount in excess of the amount it was owed, as having extinguished Bravos\u2019 indebtedness to Loyola and, consequently, they could assume that Loyola was not entitled to any portion of insurance proceeds, which, at the time of the sale, were well known to all parties to be a possible resource. It was only after they had been advised that this was erroneous that they had a viable objection and they made it in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">On April 4, 1988, as we have seen, the court issued two referral orders. One referred the case to the General Equity Master for hearing, report and recommendation, while the other referred appellee Goodman\u2019s claim to the auditor for a determination of its validity and priority. The hearing before the General Equity Master occurred on May 3, 1988 and concerned only the claim of appellee Bravos. Appellee Goodman was permitted to \u201cintervene\u201d in the \u201cproceeding\u201d, however, by order dated May 10, 1988. Despite that intervention, the General Equity Master\u2019s report and recommendation never addressed, probably because it was not raised, the issue raised by appellee Goodman.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">From the foregoing, appellants maintain that the court\u2019s judgment, as it pertains to appellee Goodman, is premature. It may very well be; however, given our resolution of the entitlement issue, we fail to see what standing appellants have to raise it. Once it has been determined that appellants have no interest in the insurance proceeds, how they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>are divided, as between appellees and any other of Bravos' creditors, is a matter of concern to them, not of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">.

In <em>In Re Mid-Atlantic Toyota, supra, </em>the District Court of Maryland was required to interpret a portion of a statute providing: \"The term 'State Attorney General\u2019 means the chief legal officer of a State, or any other person authorized by State law to bring actions under Section 15c of this title\u201d. It determined that the qualifying phrase \u201cauthorized by State law to bring the action\u201d modified only the phrase \u201cany other person\u201d, and not \"State Attorney General\u201d, because the former was the immediately preceding phrase and there had been no comma placed after it.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The statute at issue in <em>Sullivan v.

The Court of Appeals held, \"[i]n light of the generally recognized rule of statutory construction that a qualifying clause ordinarily is confined to the immediately preceding words or phrase \u2014 particularly in the absence of a comma before the qualifying clause \u2014 the disputed language obviously should be construed in the first instance as modifying only the phrase 'and may own real or personal property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 451, 373 A.2d 1245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">.
