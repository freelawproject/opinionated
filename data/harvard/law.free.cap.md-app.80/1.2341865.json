The owner was injured while transporting goods . on behalf of the principal contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">In resolving the issue of coverage we shall determine the following: whether the failure of a controlling shareholder and officer of a subcontracting close corporation to purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the corporation\u2019s employees acts as an election not to be covered by Maryland\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation provisions;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whether a controlling shareholder and officer of a close corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>may be a \u201cstatutory employee\u201d within the meaning of the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision of the workers\u2019 compensation laws; and, whether the limitations period applicable to workers\u2019 compensation claims is tolled when a \u201cstatutory employer,\u201d with actual notice of serious injuries sustained by an individual acting as its \u201cstatutory employee,\u201d does not file a report of injury with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The action giving rise to the foregoing questions had its genesis on or about December 22, 1986, the date the appellee, Gordon L. Myers, filed a claim with the Commission alleging that he had sustained compensable injuries while acting as an employee of the appellant, Inner Harbor Warehouse and Distribution, Inc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After hearing, the Commission disallowed Myers\u2019 claim because it determined that he was an independent contractor at the time his injuries were incurred. Upon the denial of his motion for rehearing, Myers appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. By order dated August 9, 1988, that court (Arabian, J.) granted Myers\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, ruling, <em>inter alia, </em>that Myers was the \u201cstatutory employee\u201d of Inner Harbor pursuant to Md.Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 62 (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1988 Cum.Supp.), as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Before addressing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we shall recount the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Commencing during July 1984, Inner Harbor was retained by Eluma International, U.S.A., a/k/a Eluma of North America (Eluma), to transport engine blocks manufactured by a Brazilian company, Cofap Cia Fabricadora de Pecas, a/k/a Cofap S.A. (Cofap), on an ongoing basis upon the products\u2019 arrival in the Port of Baltimore. Inner Harbor was hired to haul the engine blocks in their containers from the Port of Baltimore to Inner Harbor\u2019s warehouse facility \u2014 where the containers were to be temporarily stored. Inner Harbor received compensation per container hauled from the Port of Baltimore to the warehouse facility. As Inner Harbor did not own trucks capable of hauling the containers, it retained the services of truck owners and truck operators who hauled the containers on its behalf. Representatives of Inner Harbor admitted that performing truck transportation services was part of the regular business of Inner Harbor during the time period relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">During the relevant time period, G.K. Myers &amp; Sons, Inc., a Maryland Close Corporation, was in the business of retaining truck operators for truck transportation companies such as Inner Harbor. Myers was the President and Chief Executive Officer of G.K. Myers &amp; Sons and, along with his wife, held joint title to all of the corporation\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Between April 1984 and October 18, 1984, Myers and other drivers of G.K. Myers &amp; Sons operated trucks which hauled containers of the Brazilian engine blocks on behalf of Inner Harbor. During April 1984, Myers met with Reese Beane, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Inner Harbor, and requested that Inner Harbor provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the drivers of G.J. Myers &amp; Sons\u2019 trucks while they were hauling on behalf of Inner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Harbor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">On October 18, 1984, Myers was hauling a container of the engine blocks from a pier in the Port of Baltimore to Inner Harbor\u2019s warehouse facility. While Myers was travelling along the Russell Street ramp at or near Monroe Street in the City of Baltimore, the engine blocks sprung free, upsetting the container. As a result, the container and the truck \u2014 with Myers inside \u2014 fell over the side of the ramp and eventually landed upon a line of train tracks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Representatives of Inner Harbor were notified of the accident shortly after it occurred. At the time of the accident, G.K. Myers &amp; Sons did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">I. Scope of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">As a threshold matter, we shall discuss our role in reviewing the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">According to Md.Rule 2-501(e), summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In determining whether any factual dispute exists, even if the underlying facts are undisputed, the trial court must resolve all inferences against the moving party. <em>See Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 231, 401 A.2d 1013 (1979) <em>(Honaker II) </em>and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must also decide whether there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact, with inferences drawn in favor of the non-moving party, and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Liscombe v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 621-22, 495 A.2d 838 (1985); <em>Washington Homes v. Interstate Land Dev. Co., </em>281 Md. 712, 717-18, 382 A.2d 555 (1978) and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">II. Election</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Inner Harbor posits that the trial court erred in failing to conclude that the decision by Myers not to purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the subcontracting close corporation of which he was a controlling shareholder and officer acted as an election to be exempted from the coverage of the workers\u2019 compensation provisions as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Art. 101, \u00a7 21(b) details the individuals who are subject to the provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation laws. That section relates, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">COVERAGE OF EMPLOYEES. \u2014 The following shall constitute employees subject to the provisions of this article,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">(2) Every officer of a corporation rendering services for the corporation for monetary remuneration except: (i) an officer of a close corporation, as defined in the Corporations and Associations Article, electing not to be covered under the provisions of Section 67(4) of this article----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Art. 101, \u00a7 67(4)(ii) sets forth the procedure whereby an officer of a close corporation may elect to become exempt from coverage as an \u201cemployee\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">Any officer of a close corporation, as defined in the Corporations and Associations Article, ... may elect to become exempt from coverage as an employee under the provisions of Section 21(b) of this article. In the event of such an election, the employer shall serve upon the employer\u2019s insurance carrier and upon the Commission writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ten notice naming the persons electing not to be covered, and every officer of a close corporation shall be an employee within this article until such notice has been served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In the instant case, there is no factual dispute that Myers was an officer of a close corporation \u201crendering services for the corporation for monetary remuneration.\u201d Furthermore, it is uncontroverted that written notice naming Myers as an officer of a close corporation electing to become exempt from coverage as an \u201cemployee\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation laws was never served upon the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The above facts notwithstanding, Inner Harbor presently urges us to interpret G.K. Myers &amp; Sons\u2019 uninsured status as, <em>ipso facto, </em>an election by Myers to exempt himself from coverage as an. \u201cemployee\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation laws. Because this case reaches us in the context of a motion for summary judgment, we accept as true Inner Harbor\u2019s contention that G.K. Myers &amp; Sons\u2019 lack of workers\u2019 compensation insurance resulted directly from Myers\u2019 decision not to procure such coverage for the close corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Inner Harbor\u2019s averment raises an issue of first impression in this State. The resolution of the question requires us to discern the meaning and scope of Section 67(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">In considering the provision, it is well settled that we must ascertain and carry out the real and actual intent of the legislature. <em>See Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. 235, 245, 465 A.2d 1126 (1983); <em>State v. Loscomb, </em>291 Md. 424, 429, 435 A.2d 764 (1981). The primary source for determining that intent is the language of the statute itself. If it is clear, we need look no further. <em>Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. v. Kennedy, </em>296 Md. 528, 535, 463 A.2d 850 (1983); <em>Vallario v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>290 Md. 2, 6, 426 A.2d 1384 (1981). Thus, where statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, no construction or clarification is needed or permitted. <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 619, 458 A.2d 758 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>(1983); <em>Blum v. Blum, </em>295 Md. 135, 140, 453 A.2d 824 (1983); <em>Koyce v. State, Cent. Collection Unit, </em>289 Md. 134, 140, 422 A.2d 1017 (1980). In other words, a plainly worded statute should be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation. <em>State v. Intercontinental, Ltd., </em>302 Md. 132, 137, 486 A.2d 174 (1985); <em>Guy v. Director, </em>279 Md. 69, 72, 367 A.2d 946 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Furthermore, we are mindful that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Article is to be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as the article\u2019s provisions will permit so as to effectuate its benevolent purpose as remedial social legislation. <em>See, e.g., Lovellette v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983); <em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. 331, 335, 449 A.2d 1158 (1982); <em>Trotta v. County Car Center, </em>292 Md. 660, 663, 441 A.2d 343 (1982); <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980); <em>Wiley Mfg. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 217, 373 A.2d 613 (1977); <em>Tavel v. Bechtel Corp., </em>242 Md. 299, 303, 219 A.2d 43 (1965); <em>Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. 416, 425, 45 A.2d 79 (1945). <em>See also </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We believe the language of Section 67(4)(ii) is plainly worded and unambiguous and expresses a sensible meaning in detailing the mechanism by which an officer of a close corporation may elect not to be covered by the workers\u2019 compensation laws. The provision also clearly provides that until written notice is served according to its dictates, \u201cevery officer of a close corporation shall be an employee within this article.\u201d In light of the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that Myers did not elect io exempt himself from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">III. Myers as \u201cStatutory Employee\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Inner Harbor further contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding Myers, a controlling shareholder and officer of G.K. Myers <em>&amp; </em>Sons, a \u201cstatutory employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ee\u201d of Inner Harbor within the meaning of the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision of the workers\u2019 compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">As a means of introducing the law relevant to the present issue, we observe that the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was enacted by the General Assembly in 1914 to compensate employees who were injured in the course of their employment. Under the act, workers lost their right to bring suit against their employers for negligence, but gained the right to compensation for injuries sustained during the course of their employment, regardless of fault. <em>Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 496, 520 A.2d 717 (1987). <em>Accord Johnson v. Mountaire Farms, </em>305 Md. 246, 250, 503 A.2d 708 (1986); <em>Wood v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>260 Md. 651, 660-61, 273 A.2d 125 (1971); <em>Victory Sparkler Co. v. Francks, </em>147 Md. 368, 376-77, 128 A. 635 (1925); <em>Anderson v. Bimblich, </em>67 Md.App. 612, 616-17, 508 A.2d 1014 (1986). In return, employers lost their defenses of contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and fellow servant rule, but gained the advantage of having their liability limited. <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 496-97, 520 A.2d 717. <em>Accord Mountaire Farms, </em>305 Md. at 250, 503 A.2d 708; <em>Wood, </em>260 Md. at 660-61, 273 A.2d 125; <em>State v. Bennett Building Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 168, 140 A. 52 (1928); <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>147 Md. at 376-77, 128 A. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">First included in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act two years after its original passage in 1914, Art. 101, \u00a7 62, as presently enacted, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">When any person as a principal contractor, undertakes to execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation which he has contracted to perform and contracts with any other person as subcontractor, for the execution by or under the subcontractor, of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by the principal contractor, the principal contractor shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the execution of the work any compensation under this article which he would have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately employed by him; and where compensation is claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>from or proceedings are taken against the principal contractor, then, in the application of this article, reference to the principal contractor shall be substituted for reference to the employer, except that the amount of compensation shall be calculated with reference to the earnings of the workman under the employer by whom he is immediately employed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The purpose and scope of Section 62 has been addressed by the appellate courts of this State on numerous occasions. <em>See, e.g., Lathroum v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>309 Md. 445, 524 A.2d 1228 (1987); <em>Brady v. Ralph Parsons, supra; Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>278 Md. 453, 365 A.2d 287 (1976) <em>(Honaker I); State v. Bennett Building, supra; Travelers Indem. Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>69 Md.App. 664, 519 A.2d 760 (1987); <em>Anderson v. Bimblich, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In <em>Bennett Building, </em>the Court explained the legislative rationale of the provision. As its analysis is highly relevant to our resolution of the present issue, we shall repeat it in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">It is common practice in certain trades for one party to agree for a reward to complete a certain work or undertaking and then to enter into subcontracts with various parties providing for the execution by them respectively of specified parts of the whole work or undertaking, so that the whole or part thereof would be done by such subcontractors and their assistants. In this manner the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>principal contractor would avoid in part the responsibility for accidents happening in the carrying out of the work or undertaking. If this responsibility were so shifted upon parties too weak financially to meet it, and who had not secured compensation to their employees in one of the ways required by the statute, an injured workman, proceeding at common law or under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, would obtain neither compensation nor damages. Furthermore, difficult questions arose with reference to whether the workman was the servant of the principal contractor rather than of his immediate employer, depending largely upon who had power to hire and discharge, to direct and control the workmen, and a variety of other circumstances. In order to obviate these contingencies, and more certainly to assure the workman his contemplated compensation, the statute has imposed, under a certain state of circumstances, a liability to pay upon the principal contractor, although he might not have been held at common law the employer of the injured workman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">154 Md. at 161-62, 140 A. 52. The Court summarized the consequences of Section 62:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">The effect of this provision, when brought into operation through the designated state of circumstances, is to impose the absolute liability of an employer upon the principal contractor, when he was not in law the employer of the injured workman. The result then is that where the prescribed conditions exist, the principal contractor becomes by the act the statutory employer of any workman employed in the execution of the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">154 Md. at 162, 140 A. 52.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">In <em>Honaker </em>I, Judge Orth, writing for the Court, explicated the elements necessary to establish statutory employment as contemplated by the section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>It is manifest on the face of [Section 62], that in order to invoke its provisions there must be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">(1) a principal contractor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">(2) who has contracted to perform work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">(3) which is a part of his trade, business or occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">(4) who had contracted with any other party as a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">278 Md. at 459-60, 365 A.2d 287 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Accord Brady, </em>308 Md. at 503-04, 520 A.2d 717; <em>Coffey v. Derby Steel Co., </em>291 Md. 241, 251, 434 A.2d 564 (1981); <em>Anderson, </em>67 Md.App. at 617, 508 A.2d 1014. Elaborating upon the foregoing elements, the Court has observed that the section actually requires the existence of two contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">The first contract is between \u201cthe principal contractor and a third party whereby it is agreed that the principal contractor will execute certain work for a third party.\u201d <em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 460, 365 A.2d at 291. This has been referred to as an \u201cantecedent undertaking\u201d or \u201cprincipal contract.\u201d <em>See Warren v. Dorsey Enterprises, Inc., </em>234 Md. 574, 579, 200 A.2d 76, 78 (1964). The second contract is between the \u201cprincipal contractor and a person as subcontractor whereby the subcontractor agrees to do the whole or part of such work\u201d that the principal contractor agreed to perform for the third party. <em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 460, 365 A.2d at 291. The work covered by the second contract (i.e., subcontract) must be work which is a part of the principal contractor\u2019s trade, business or occupation. <em>See Warren, </em>234 Md. at 578, 200 A.2d at 78. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>See also Coffey, </em>291 Md. at 251-56, 434 A.2d at 570-72; <em>Honaker II, </em>285 Md. at 229-32, 401 A.2d at 1019-20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALp\"><em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 504-05 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Under the facts of the case at bar, it is uncontroverted that Inner Harbor acted as a principal contractor in agreeing to provide transportation services to a third party (Eluma). In addition, representatives of Inner Harbor admitted that the work their company agreed to perform for Eluma was a part of Inner Harbor\u2019s regular trade or business. Finally, there is no genuine factual dispute that Inner Harbor subcontracted with various trucking concerns \u2014 including G.K. Myers &amp; Sons \u2014 to do all or part of the work which Inner Harbor had agreed to perform under its agreement with Eluma. It is clear, therefore, that Inner Harbor falls within the ambit of the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision with respect to the employees of the various trucking concerns which acted as subcontractors on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Despite the foregoing, Inner Harbor attempts to avoid Section 62 liability in the present matter on the ground that Myers\u2019 status as a controlling shareholder and officer of G.K. Myers &amp; Sons precludes his being classified as a \u201cstatutory employee\u201d within the contemplation of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The issue of first impression raised by Inner Harbor\u2019s position requires that we construe Section 62. In interpreting the provision, we again recognize the general rules of statutory construction detailed <em>supra. </em>We also again observe that Section 21(b) of the workers\u2019 compensation laws generally confers \u201cemployee\u201d status upon officers of close corporations who perform services for the corporation for monetary remuneration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>In light of the foregoing, we are of the view that the pertinent language of Section 62 plainly and unambiguously expresses a legislative intent to protect every employee of any subcontractor which, for whatever reason, is too financially weak to secure compensation for its workers. We believe that such an intent unquestionably follows from the enactment of a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision which, without limitation, places the onus upon the principal contractor to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the employees of its subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">With regard to the present case, we believe that to exclude Myers from the protections of Section 62 merely because he was a controlling shareholder and officer of a subcontracting close corporation would fly in the face of the legislature\u2019s intent to afford protection to the employees of subcontractors. Consequently, we are convinced that Myers\u2019 status as a controlling shareholder and officer of one of Inner Harbor\u2019s subcontractors does not alter its burden to provide coverage. We hold, therefore, that the trial court acted correctly in concluding that Myers was a \u201cstatutory employee\u201d of Inner Harbor within the meaning of Section 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">IV. Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">As its final contention on appeal, Inner Harbor argues that, notwithstanding its \u201cstatutory employer\u201d status, Myers\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation claim is barred by the statute of limitations as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In particular, Inner Harbor contends that the trial court erred in determining that the running of the limitations period was tolled as a result of Inner Harbor\u2019s failure to file an Art. 101, \u00a7 38(b) employers\u2019 first report of injury. The crux of Inner Harbor\u2019s position on this point is that, as a Section 62 \u201cstatutory employer,\u201d it had no obligation to file a Section 38(b) report.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Initially, we observe that Art. 101, \u00a7 39(a), which details the limitations period applicable to workers\u2019 compensation claims filed in this State, provides, in pertinent part, \u201c[t]hat failure of an employee to file a claim for compensation within two years from the date of the accident shall constitute a complete bar to any claim under this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The application of the Section 39(a) limitations period, however, must be considered in light of other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Article so as to effectuate the article\u2019s benevolent purpose as remedial social legislation. <em>See, e.g., Lovelette, </em>297 Md. at 282, 465 A.2d 1141; Art. 101, \u00a7 63. In that regard, we are cognizant that Section 38(b) of the article, which, under certain circumstances, requires an employer with notice of an accident occurring to any employee to file a report with the Commission, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">REPORT OF ACCIDENT BY EMPLOYER. \u2014 Whenever an accident causing disability for a period more than three days following the happening of such accident occurs to any employee, it shall be the duty of the employer within ten (10) days after the receipt of notice of such accident, oral or written, to report such accident and injury resulting therefrom to the Commission. Such report shall state (1) the time, cause and nature of the accident and injuries, and the probable duration of the injury resulting therefrom; (2) whether the accident arose out of and in the course of the injured persons employment; (3) any other matters and rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Furthermore, and at the heart of our analysis of the present issue, we are aware that Section 38(c) of the article, which details the consequences of an employer\u2019s failure to file a Section 38(b) report with the Commission, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">EFFECT OF EMPLOYER\u2019S FAILURE TO FILE REPORT AFTER HAVING BEEN GIVEN NOTICE.\u2014 Where the employer has been given notice, or the employer, or his designated representative in the place where the injury occurred, has knowledge of any injury or death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>any employee, and the employer fails, neglects or refuses to file a report thereof, as required by the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the limitations prescribed by this article shall not begin to run against the claimant or any person entitled to comr isation until such report shall have been furnished as required by subsection (b) of this section. This section shall not apply to an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined by Section 67(3) of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Considering the foregoing provisions of the workers' compensation laws as a statutory scheme and again recognizing the rules of statutory construction set forth <em>supra, </em>we are convinced that Section 38(c) clearly and unambiguously manifests a legislative intent to toll the Section 39(a) limitations period when an employer, with notice of a serious accident occurring to any employee, fails to file a Section 38(b) report of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In the present case, we have already determined as a matter of law that Inner Harbor was the Section 62 \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of Myers. Thus, the question as significant to our resolution of the issue <em>sub judice </em>is whether the obligations and consequences which Section 38 visits upon an employer whenever an accident causing certain disabling injuries occurs to any employee, apply to a Section 62 \u201cstatutory employer\u201d whenever such an accident occurs to any \u201cstatutory employee.\u201d We believe the answer to that question turns upon a determination of the extent to which Section 62 equates a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d with any other employer under the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Thus, we must again consider that portion of Section 62 which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">[T]he principal contractor shall be liable to pay any workman employed in the execution of the work any compensation under this article which he would have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately employed by him; and where compensation is claimed from or proceedings are taken against the principal contractor, then, in the application of this article, reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>principal contractor shall be substituted for reference to the employer, except that the amount of compensation shall be calculated with reference to the earnings of the workman under the employer by whom he is immediately employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The provision was construed in the context of a related issue by the Court in <em>State v. Bennett Building, supra. </em>The claimant in that case sought to bring a third party tort action against a principal contractor under Section 38 of the workers\u2019 compensation laws on the theory that the principal contractor was \u201csome person other than the employer\u201d against which a third party tort action could be brought. As we have noted above in the context of another issue raised by Inner Harbor, the Court, in rejecting the claimant's averment, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">The effect of this provision, when brought into operation through the designated state of circumstances, is to impose the absolute liability of an employer upon the principal contractor, when he was not in law the employer of the injured workman. The result then is that where the prescribed conditions exist, the principal contractor becomes by the act the statutory employer of any workman employed in the execution of the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">154 Md. at 162, 140 A. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">In light of the foregoing, we believe that Section 62 plainly and unambiguously expresses a definite and sensible meaning in manifesting a legislative intent to treat a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d as if it were the employer of any \u201cstatutory employee\u201d for purposes of liability. We conclude, therefore, that an employer\u2019s duty to file a Section 38(b) report of injury upon receiving notice of an injury occurring to any employee, and the consequences of failing to take such action, apply with equal force to a Section 62 \u201cstatutory employer\u201d whenever an accident causing the requisite disabling injuries occurs to any \u201cstatutory employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Applying the foregoing to the instant case, it is uncontroverted that Inner Harbor had notice of Myers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>injuries immediately after the accident occurred. Furthermore, there is no dispute as to whether the accident caused disability to Myers \u201cfor a period of more than three days\u201d after it occurred. Accordingly, Inner Harbor, as the Section 62 \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of Myers, had an obligation to file a Section 38(b) report with the Commission regarding Myers\u2019 injuries. As Inner Harbor failed to file such a report, the Section 39(a) limitations period applicable to Myers\u2019 claim was tolled pursuant to Section 38(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-15\">.

This court was also asked to consider \u201cwhether Section 62 of Article 101 of the Annotated Code of Maryland required that contracts be in writing for a principal contractor/subcontractor relationship to exist.\u201d As Inner Harbor conceded on this issue during oral argument, however, we shall not consider it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\">.

Section 62 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">Where the principal contractor is liable to pay compensation under this section, he shall be entitled to indemnity from any employer, who would have been liable to pay compensation to the employee independently of this section, and shall have a cause of action therefore against such employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a workman from recovering compensation under this article from the subcontractor instead of from the contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">Whenever an employer of a subcontractor files a claim under this article against the principal contractor, the principal contractor shall have a right to join the subcontractor or any intermediate contractors as defendant or co-defendant in this case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b56-9\">.
