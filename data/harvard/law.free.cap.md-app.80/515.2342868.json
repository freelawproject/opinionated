Appellant, Joel L. Falik, is a physician who provided medical services and treatment to an employee of appellee, the Prince George\u2019s County Hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>tal and Medical Center, for an injury suffered by the employee within the scope of Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Ann.Code of Md. (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1988 Cum.Supp.) Art. 101, \u00a7 1 et seq. Appellant billed appellee $4,120 for the services. Appellee, in accordance with the fees prescribed by the <em>Guide of Medical and Surgical Fees </em>(Fee Guide), paid appellant only $1,778. Appellant petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for the balance of his fees, and the Commission denied the petition. Undaunted by that rebuff, appellant appealed to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The circuit court affirmed the Commission. It reasoned that, because the fees for medical services and treatment were subject to regulation by the Commission, the Commission did not err in its ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Section 37 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act requires that an employer provide an injured employee such medical treatment and services \u201cas may be required by the Commission.\u201d That section, in pertinent part, also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">(c) Fees and charges. \u2014 All fees and other charges for such treatment and services shall be subject to regulation by the Commission, and shall be limited to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar treatment of injured persons of a like standard of living. At least once every 2 years, the Commission shall review the allowable fees and other charges for completeness and reasonableness and shall make appropriate revisions to established guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">(e) Rules and regulations. \u2014 The Commission shall have full power to adopt rules and regulations with respect to furnishing medical, nurse, hospital services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and medicine to injured employees entitled thereto and to the payment therefor,____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Appellant contends that \u00a7 37(c) requires the Commission in every case to consider evidence of charges prevailing in the community where the medical services were rendered. Consequently, appellant posits that the circuit court erred when it affirmed the decision of the Commission. We see it differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction, of course, is to ascertain and carry out legislative intent. <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988). In that regard, the primary source of legislative intent is the language of the statute itself. <em>Id. </em>And, where the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need to go beyond the words of the statute to find its meaning. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company v. Bragg, </em>76 Md.App. 709, 716, 548 A.2d 151 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">As we see it, the meaning of \u00a7 37(c), when read, as we must read it, together with the section as a whole, is clear. The Commission is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations for all fees and other charges for medical treatment and services. <em>Holy Cross Hospital v. Nichols, </em>290 Md. 149, 153, 428 A.2d 447 (1981). While the rules and regulations must be reasonable as well as consistent with the spirit of the statute, the power to regulate, where conferred, is inherently broad. <em>See, Sullivan v. Bd. of License Commissioners, </em>293 Md. 113, 121-122, 442 A.2d 558 (1982). Indeed, illustrative of the intent to confer broad regulatory powers upon the Commission in the circumstances <em>sub judice </em>are both the grant of \u201cfull power\u201d to adopt rules and regulations, and the subjection of <em>\u201call </em>fees and charges\u201d to regulation. Moreover, under a statute markedly similar to \u00a7 37, the power to regulate has been defined to include the authority to adopt a maximum fee schedule. <em>Application of Idaho Hospital Ass\u2019n, </em>73 Idaho 320, 251 P.2d 538 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Contrary to appellant's assertion, we do not read that part of \u00a7 87(c) limiting fees and charges to those that prevail in the same community as setting a standard for the Commission to apply on a case-by-case basis. Rather, we see the limiting language as establishing a ceiling on the Commission\u2019s discretion to establish a schedule of fees and charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 61 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 926, 981 (1976) (the statutorily prescribed standard of \u00a7 87(c) is that the schedule of fees and charges set by the Commission shall correspond with those prevailing in the same community for similar treatment of injured persons of a like standard of living.) <em>See also </em>Gilbert and Humphreys, <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>(1988), \u00a7 10.3 (medical fee schedules set forth the limit for which an employer can be held liable for a particular medical treatment and service). While it is true, as appellant suggests, that the Fee Guide is intended to be flexible, we do not agree that the variation should manifest itself from community to community on a case-by-case basis. Rather, the flexibility in allowable fees should occur only in the event of \u201cextraordinary or unusual conditions or complications.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also point out that the preface to the Fee Guide makes clear that the schedule of fees and charges is statewide in application.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">We have not been referred to, and in our own research we have not found, any Maryland cases construing \u00a7 37 in the precise circumstances with which we are now faced. Decisions of the courts of other jurisdictions, however, that have considered comparable Worker\u2019s Compensation provisions, lend support to our construction of \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">North Carolina\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The pecuniary liability of the employer for medical, surgical, hospital service, nursing services, medicines, sick travel or other treatment required when ordered by the Commission, shall be limited to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar treatment of injured persons of a like standard of living ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-26 (1985). Notwithstanding that language, the Commission is empowered to adopt fee schedules fixing maximum fees which may be charged for medical services and treatment. <em>Wake Co. Hospital Sys., Inc. v. North Carolina Industrial Commission, </em>8 N.C.App. 259, 174 S.E.2d 292 (1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The fees prescribed by the Commission shall govern, except in the event special hardship cases warrant that the Commission allow fees in excess of those published. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Florida\u2019s Workers' Compensation Law limits all fees and charges for medical treatment to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar treatment of injured persons of a like standard of living. The Florida Law also provides for the adoption of a schedule of maximum charges. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 440.13(3)(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that light, the Supreme Court of Florida denied a petition for writ of certiorari to review an order of the State Industrial Commission allowing the schedule authorized fee of $2.00 for a penicillin injection, despite evidence that the charge prevailing in the community for such an injection was $3.00. <em>Shelton v. Sadler, </em>82 So.2d 883 (1955 Fla.). Similarily, in <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Southern Fla. Sanitarium and Hospital Corporation, </em>173 So.2d 131 (1965, Fla.), it was held that a hospital was not entitled to recover charges for treatment in addition to the sum allowed by the fee schedule adopted by the Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Moreover, in other jurisdictions, the authority of the Commission to adopt maximum fee schedules is not inconsistent with provisions limiting the liability of an employer to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar treatment of injured persons of a like standard of living. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 176.135, 176.136 (1988); <em>see also </em>Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 342.035 (Michie 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">In sum, we perceive no error in the Commission\u2019s decision to deny appellant\u2019s claim for fees in excess of those prescribed by the Fee Guide. The parties proceeded in the circuit court on an agreed statement of facts that averred, in part, only that the fees sought by appellant were equal to the charges then prevailing in Prince George\u2019s County for the same treatment of injured persons of like standard of living. There is no evidence of any extraordinary or unusual conditions or complications that would have warranted an allowance of fees beyond those established by the Fee Guide. Accordingly, on the facts before us, we hold that the circuit court did not err in affirming the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. Md. Rule 8-131(c); <em>Gly Construction Co. v. Davis, </em>60 Md.App. 602, 608, 483 A.2d 1330 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 288, 487 A.2d 292 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">.

The latter sentence of \u00a7 37(e), added in 1907 for the purpose of providing that the allowable fees and other charges established by the Commission shall be reviewed every two years and revised accordingly, is an additional cheek on the Commission\u2019s regulatory authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">.
