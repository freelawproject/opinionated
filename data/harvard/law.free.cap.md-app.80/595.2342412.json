Appellant requested a jury trial, and his case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Frederick County. The appellant filed a Motion to Dismiss claiming collateral estoppel based on his brother\u2019s acquittal in the District Court. The motion was denied. A jury convicted appellant of battery and he was sentenced to ninety days incarceration, all of which was suspended in favor of two years supervised probation. Appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial was denied and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Appellant presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asad\">Whether the trial judge abused his discretion by restricting the cross-examination and impeachment of the chief prosecution witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">Whether the defendant\u2019s conviction should be set aside because the state failed to disclose the existence of a prior statement by the main prosecution witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AymT\">Whether the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to grant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">Whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss based on grounds of collateral estoppel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Since our disposition of this case is based on the first issue, we will not address the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on March 24, 1988, Deputy Jay Godlove (Godlove) of the Frederick County Sheriffs Department attempted to serve process on Leland Ronald Jorgensen (Ron). Godlove, with the permission of his supervisor, contacted the law office shared by Ron and his brother, Paul, and arranged for an appointment as a prospective client. On the day of the appointment, Godlove appeared at the law office in plain clothes, posing as a potential client. Upon being escorted into a private office, Godlove identified himself, served the papers on Ron, and then left. Shortly after Godlove left the law office, Ron and Paul pursued the Deputy on the street. It is at this point the stories diverge. The Jorgensens testified that they neither touched Godlove nor gave him reason to feel threatened. Godlove testified that as he was walking up the street he turned and saw Ron and his brother running toward him. Godlove further testified that Ron grabbed the Deputy\u2019s right arm and Paul grabbed his left arm. Ron then grabbed Godlove\u2019s briefcase from under his arm. Godlove testified that he identified himself a second time and grabbed back his briefcase. Godlove then removed his handgun from its holster, brought it up, and told the brother\u2019s \u201cget back or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d At this time Godlove produced his badge, and then he and Ron walked up the street to Godlove\u2019s cruiser. Godlove drove away without arresting Ron or Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Ron told a different story. He testified that when he walked up to Godlove and asked for identification, Godlove pulled out a revolver. Additionally, Ron stated \u201cgo ahead and shoot me\u201d at which time Paul arrived and tried to \u201ccalm the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Miriam Rice, a neighbor of the Jorgensen\u2019s, testified that she heard a commotion and looked outside of her house. She stated that she did not see Godlove\u2019s briefcase being taken but did see Ron push or shove the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Ron contends here, as he argued in opening statement, that immediately after the incident his brother, Paul, called the Sheriffs Department to verify Godlove\u2019s employment. After learning that Godlove was a Deputy, Paul discussed with Captain Doxzen the possibility of filing a complaint. On March 25, 1988, the next day, Paul called Corporal Breed, Godlove\u2019s immediate supervisor, and made plans to visit the Sheriffs office to file the complaint. Later in the day, Godlove, assisted by Corporal Breed, swore out warrants for the arrest of Paul and Ron.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court did not permit Ron\u2019s foregoing contentions to be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">At Ron\u2019s trial, defense counsel was prohibited from either cross-examining or impeaching Godlove based upon the alleged bias. In addition, Ron\u2019s defense counsel was not provided with a transcribed statement by Godlove made at the Sheriff\u2019s Department regarding the alleged assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The appellant argues that the trial court committed reversible error by restricting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination and impeachment of the main prosecution witness, Jay Godlove. The State contends that the issue concerning the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the cross-examination and impeachment was not properly preserved for appeal because no proffer was made at trial. The State further posits that even if the issue were properly preserved, the evidence which the defense counsel tried to elicit from the main prosecution witness was not relevant to the assault and battery charges. In any case, the State argues, the error was harmless because the evidence was put before the jury anyway, in opening statements and from a comment made by a defense witness while testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201c \u2018It cannot seriously be doubted at this late date that the right of cross-examination is included in the right of an accused in a criminal case to confront the witnesses against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 131, 88 S.Ct. 748, 749, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968) quoting from <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). Unduly restricting cross-examination is an abuse of discretion and warrants reversal of a conviction and remand the case for a new trial. <em>Brown v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 414, 421-22, 538 A.2d 317, 320-21 (1988). However, Maryland courts have consistently held that the exclusion of evidence is ordinarily not preserved for appellate review absent a formal proffer of what the contents and relevance of the excluded testimony would have been. <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 506 A.2d 580, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 873, 107 S.Ct. 38, 93 L.Ed.2d 174 (1986). The Court in <em>Grandison </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">In the absence of a proffer, we are unable to determine whether this ruling prejudiced Grandison\u2019s case. As Judge Eldridge pointed out in his concurring opinion in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 495 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1985):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajqx\">\u201cNevertheless, assuming that the issue can be preserved by a pre-trial motion, it is settled that whenever one is complaining about a trial court\u2019s refusal to admit certain testimony, it is necessary that there be a proffer of what the evidence would have been. <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 603, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984); <em>Hooton v. Kenneth B. Mumaw P. &amp; H. Co., </em>271 Md. 565, 571, 318 A.2d 514 (1974); <em>Keys v. Keys, </em>251 Md. 247, 250, 247 A.2d 282 (1968).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">305 Md. at 742, 506 A.2d 580. This rule insures that on appeal, a trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion can be fairly and acurately assessed. <em>Waldron v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 686, 698, 491 A.2d 595, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 97, 497 A.2d 819 (1985). Proffer is not absolutely required. In <em>Waldron </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Ordinarily, the thrust of the inquiry will be revealed by the question, however, although not required, it may be supplied by proffer. When no proffer is made, the questions must clearly generate the issue-what the examiner is trying to accomplish must be obvious. Thus, in the absence of a proffer, the clarity with which the issue is generated will determine whether the court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination constitutes an abuse of discretion. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">62 Md.App. at 698, 491 A.2d 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court curtailed any probing by the defense counsel into the fact that the warrants for arrest were not issued until after an administrative complaint had been lodged against Godlove. Although defense counsel did not proffer any evidence to show the relevance of the inquiry, we hold that no such proffer was necessary. The questions to which objections were sustained, clearly generated the issue \u2014 what the examiner was trying to accomplish was obvious. The following colloquy took place during the cross-examination of Godlove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cQ: Isn\u2019t it true that you didn\u2019t decide to get a warrant against this defendant until the next____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">Ms. Hershey: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">Q: Can I finish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">The Court: Let her finish the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">Q: ... until the next day after you learned that Paul was filing a complaint against____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">Ms. Hershey: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">The Court: Objection sustained. Strike the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1z\">Q: At what point did you decide to get this warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASk\">Ms. Hershey: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-15\">The Court: Objection sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">In addition, during the direct examination of Paul Jorgensen the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-17\">\u201cQ: Did you or did someone at your direction, in fact, call the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>A: Well, my wife, Debbie, she went down to call the police and I understand there was a neighbor that also called the police. I returned back to my office after all this had happened and I also called the Sheriffs Department immediately and I confirmed that Deputy ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATG\">Ms. Hershey: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">The Court: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">Q: Did there come a time when you came into the Sheriffs Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">A: The next day, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">Ms. Hershey: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">The Court: Objection sustained. Strike the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">Q: When did you . learn that your brother was being arrested for assault and battery on Mr. Godlove?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">A: After I had been arrested the next day after I filed a complaint against the uh ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">Ms. Hershey: Objection, move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">The Court: Objection sustained. Strike the answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWm\">These discussions were preceded by the defense counsel\u2019s opening statement which defined Ron\u2019s defense to the charges of assault and battery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfdG\">Now, this is what this case is about and you\u2019ll find out that the officer did not arrest him then and there on the spot as an officer very likely would have done with assault and battery. The officer waited until the next day after there was a complaint about this behavior of pulling this gun on these two unarmed citizens. And then he went and got this warrant for assault and battery against this defendant and against his brother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">We hold that the issue was clearly presented by the questions and the opening statement, therefore, no proffer was necessary to preserve the issue for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">Next, we consider the State\u2019s contention that the issue of when the warrants were issued is not relevant. This court has held that \u201c[mjatters which affect the interest, bias, hostility, or motives of a witness ... are always relevant; and, therefore, extrinsic evidence is admissible in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>order to impeach a witness on these grounds.\u201d <em>Biggs v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 638, 645-46, 468 A.2d 669 (1983) <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 425, 474 A.2d 218 (1984). This court went on to state that \"... a witness\u2019 bias is perfectly competent to indicate that the witness has a strong motivation to lie.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, in <em>Rowe v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 486, 495, 490 A.2d 278 (1985) we held that a witness\u2019 bias is always relevant in that it may affect the weight of his testimony. In the case <em>sub judice </em>the State does not seem to contest the relevance of bias, but argues instead that allegations of police bias cannot be general, but must focus on specific personal bias regarding the particular case in order to be relevant. The State cites <em>Apple v. State, </em>190 Md. 661, 59 A.2d 509, (1948), and the facts of <em>Rowe v. State, supra. </em>These cases are inapposite. In <em>Apple </em>the Court affirmed a trial court\u2019s refusal to allow cross-examination of a police officer. The officer witnessed the assault, in a picket line, for which the defendant was being tried. On cross-examination the officer was asked if the picketed employer, \u201cwas feeding the police, giving them sandwiches and coffee down on the picket line.\u201d 190 Md. at 665, 59 A.2d 509. In affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling, the Court held that \u201c[tjhe question and the proffer were not directed to any food or drink received by the officer who was testifying, but were general in their nature, and could have had no special bearing on the credibility or bias of this particular officer.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">In <em>Rowe, supra, </em>the investigating officer in a homicide case testified in a manner which pointed out certain inconsistencies in the defendant\u2019s alibi witness\u2019 stories. The defense counsel, attempting to impeach the officer\u2019s credibility by showing bias, asked if \u201c... policemen, you in particular, receive promotions for closing out major homicides\u201d and then asked \u201c[i]s it fair to say ... that you want this jury to convict Joe Bill Rowe?\u201d 62 Md.App. at 494-95, 490 A.2d 278. The State objected to both questions and the Court sustained both objections. This Court affirmed the trial judge by holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>As in <em>Apple, </em>the \u2018promotion\u2019 question was general in nature, could have had no special bearing on the credibility or bias of the witness and seemingly was proposed to create prejudice against police in general. Policemen, we assume, like other employees, secure advancement through the performance of good work. There is nothing inherently inappropriate in that universally accepted practice. The question as articulated by defense counsel did not focus upon any specific personal bias on the part of Detective Tankersley which might have been motivated by a promise of promotion for closing out this particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Id. at 497, 490 A.2d 278. The cross-examination of Godlove focused on a personal bias on his part. The questions were specific and did have special bearing on his credibility or bias. Ron\u2019s defense to the charges was that no touching or assault had ever taken place. In order to establish this defense Ron attempted to demonstrate that no injury had occurred to Godlove and, most importantly, that Godlove had fabricated the battery charge in order to be on the offensive as a result of the administrative complaint being filed against him by Ron\u2019s brother. A conviction for assault and battery of the persons complaining about his conduct would aid Godlove in his defense against the administrative complaint. We hold that the inquiry into the timing of the administrative complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrants could indicate an ulterior motive or bias, on Godlove\u2019s part, and is relevant to the defense of Ron.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Finally, the State urges us to find the trial judge\u2019s restriction of the defense\u2019s cross-examination to be harmless error. In support of this argument the State points out the following colloquy between Ron and the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9V\">Q: In addition, all the officer\u2019s testimony is not true, is that correct, with regards to the physical contact between the two of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">A: I think he made it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Q: That\u2019s my question. That\u2019s your belief that he made it up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">A: Yes, I think he made it up in response to the complaint that my brother made the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">Q: Your Honor, ... Mr. Jorgensen, with reference to the drawing of the gun, then it\u2019s your testimony that neither you nor your brother did anything in the way of physical touching the deputy, that he was in fact walking down the street, leaving the office building, when you came out, and that without any kind of contact he drew the gun. That\u2019s your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">A: Yeah, that\u2019s my testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Furthermore, the State argues that defense counsel discussed the bias issue in his opening statement. Because the jury was apprised of this evidence and still convicted Ron, the State argues that any error would be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">An opening statement is not evidence. <em>White v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 423, 274 A.2d 671 (1971). In <em>Johnson and Walters v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 512, 520, 352 A.2d 371 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 738 (1976), this court held that if sufficient evidence on the subject at issue is otherwise admitted, the prejudice of an erroneous ruling on cross-examination may be overcome. We then held that undue restriction on the right to cross-examination was not harmless despite the fact that the same information was received into evidence in a different context. <em>Id. </em>at 521, 352 A.2d 371. We hold that the incidental reference to the complaint made in Ron\u2019s testimony and the reference in opening statement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were not sufficient to overcome the prejudice which resulted from the trial court\u2019s erroneous limitation of cross-examination. Additionally, we note that the defense counsel was barred from mentioning Godlove\u2019s motives in the closing argument. The trial court\u2019s refusal to permit this inquiry into bias effectively prevented the jury from considering Ron\u2019s explanation for Godlove\u2019s damaging testimony. The erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>restriction of cross-examination was not harmless, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We hold that the trial court erred in limiting the cross-examination of Deputy Godlove. The issue was preserved for our review because the questions clearly revealed the thrust of the inquiry. The bias or ulterior motive which appellant attempted to show was relevant to the guilt or innocence of appellant. The error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY FREDERICK COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">. Paul was acquitted in the District Court upon a finding that no battery had occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\">. Clearly, these do not carry the persuasive impact of the witness himself admitting that which appellant was attempting to prove.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
