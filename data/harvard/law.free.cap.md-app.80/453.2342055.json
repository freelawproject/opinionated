Although we must dismiss the appeal, we believe that it is imperative to state the reasons why the trial court was in error in believing that it did not have authority to stay payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. Anna Koseielski, appellee, filed a claim for Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits on April 13, 1986, claiming that she sustained an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of her employment for General Motors Corporation (GMC), appellant. On November 13, 1987, a hearing was held before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), which found in favor of the appellee. The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>mission further found that appellee was temporarily totally disabled from March 26, 1987, through the date of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">On appeal by GMC, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the order of the Commission, and found that appellee was temporarily totally disabled from March 26, 1987, through March 20, 1988. Subsequently, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commissioner issued an order pursuant to the decision of the circuit court, and also ordered the appellant to pay the appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees regarding the unsuccessful appeal to the circuit court. A hearing was held by the Commission on December 9, 1988, on the nature and extent of the disability and the recommendation of the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. On December 12, 1988, the Commission issued an Award of Compensation for permanent partial disability, and once again ordered appellant to pay appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, said payment being in addition to, and not deducted from, the appellee\u2019s Award of Compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Appellant filed an appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City from the order requiring it to pay appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant also filed a \u201cMotion for Ex Parte and Interlocutory Injunctive Relief\u201d requesting the circuit court to stay the order of the Commission. Apparently, in order to avoid the necessity for a hearing on the ex parte injunction request, on or about January 18, 1989, trial counsel entered upon a stipulation before the \u201cgeneral Master,\u201d causing the deposit of the sum of $1,354.01 into an interest-bearing account to be held by the Clerk of the Court, that sum representing the amount of the disputed counsel fee. On January 29, 1989, a hearing was held on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>appellant\u2019s motion. The trial court held that it had no authority, under Md.Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 56 (1985 Repl. Yol.) and Md. Rule B6, to grant such an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">General Motors Corporation appeals, asking us to resolve whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">1. [A]n appeal from an illegal, arbitrary and/or capricious act of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is an appeal under Maryland Annotated Code Article 101 Section 56 or under the Circuit Court\u2019s inherent power to review actions of administrative agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">2. [T]he Circuit Court of Maryland has the authority to issue a stay from an Order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission under the Court\u2019s inherent power to review actions of administrative agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">3. [T]he Order to pay the opposing party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, and the payment thereof, under Maryland Annotated Code Article 101 Section 57 is payment of compensation benefits within the meaning of <em>Montgomery County v. Lake, </em>68 Md.App. 269 [511 A.2d 541] (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">I. Dismissal of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"A6qq\">A. <em>Denial of the Stay Is Moot</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The order that brings this appeal to us effectively denied GMC\u2019s request for stay of the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and further ordered that \u201c[t]he monies deposited in the circuit court by the appellant in the amount of $1,354.01 be paid to P. Paul Cocoros, Esquire, at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, January 25, 1989____\u201d We have since learned that that sum has been paid to appellee\u2019s counsel and, thus, the actual payment to and receipt by appellee\u2019s counsel is a matter which the courts can no longer control. The \u201cstay\u201d issue is moot. We would point out, however, that the question of whether the Commission was correct in ordering counsel fee, pursuant to Art. 101, \u00a7 57, has never been decided by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and is now pending before that tribunal. Had that issue been decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>by the circuit court and thus before us on appeal, then the issue would not be moot by virtue of the mere payment of the attorney\u2019s fee. In <em>Gillespie-Linton v. Miles, </em>58 Md. App. 484, 473 A.2d 947 (1984), we held that payment of the full amount of a jury\u2019s verdict in a personal injury case did not bar the defendant's cross appeal on the ground of mootness. <em>See also Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 72, 427 A.2d 1002 (1981), where the late Judge J. Dudley Digges, speaking for the Court of Appeals, opined \u201cthat the payment or performance of a final judgment does not normally bar an appeal....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">While it is arguable that we could order the return of the fee to the Clerk of the Court pending trial on the merits of the disputed attorney\u2019s fees, the posture of the case and common sense dictates otherwise. If the appellee prevails, the monies would then, for a second time, be paid to her attorney. Additionally, because the appeal is otherwise premature, we are compelled to dismiss the appeal rather than reverse the judgments of the circuit court. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-602(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">B. <em>Denial of the Stay Is Not a Final Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The trial judge, in a sincere effort to allow appellate courts a prompt review so as to avoid a potential and conceptual unjust enrichment, certified that his order constituted a final judgment pursuant to Md. Rule 2-602(b). That rule provides that an order that adjudicates less than an entire claim is not a final judgment. Here, the claim itself has not been adjudicated, and the trial court ordered payment because it believed that it was powerless to do otherwise. The order of the circuit court was not a final judgment and should not have been certified as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In declaring its denial of injunctive relief, the trial court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">You now have a separate right to whatever the statute says is your right to appeal from a final order denying an interlocutory injunction.... If you have some right to appeal from that, then you should go up on appeal on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>issue of whether or not I\u2019ve properly denied you an injunction, thereby allowing the B6 stay to take its normal course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The denial of the stay effectively allowed the payment of the monies on deposit to appellee\u2019s counsel. As set forth earlier in this opinion, the court\u2019s order, in addition to denying the stay, provided for payment. Thus, actually and constructively, the court\u2019s order ought not be categorized as one \u201crefusing to grant an injunction,\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-303(c)(3), but rather as one for the payment of money under \u00a7 12-303(c)(5). But even if arguably it was an order for \u201cthe payment of money,\u201d because the order is not equitable in nature it is not appealable under \u00a7 12-303(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Yamaner v. Orkin, </em>310 Md. 321, 529 A.2d 361 (1987), held that an order directing the defendant to pay counsel fee as a sanction for filing a motion without substantial justification was not appealable under the Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-303(c)(5). Judge Rodowsky, speaking for the court, reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">The order appealed from cannot be one for the payment of money under Courts Article \u00a7 12-303(c)(5), whether assessed against Yamaner only, against his counsel only, or against both. The order is not equitable in nature and it does not proceed directly to the person so as to make one against whom it operates directly and personally answerable to the court for noncompliance. The court does not have available to it as a sanction for violation the sanction of imprisonment for contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"><em>Yamaner, supra, </em>at 324-25, 529 A.2d 361. <em>See also Simmons v. Perkins, </em>302 Md. 232, 486 A.2d 1192 (1985) and <em>Della Ratta v. Dixon, </em>47 Md.App. 270, 422 A.2d 409 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Here, the order is directed to the Clerk of the Court and not to GMC. We venture no opinion as to the potential result had the money not been in the hands of the court and if GMC was ordered directly to make payment. We would point out, however, that the nature of the assessed counsel fee as a sanction is practically indistinguishable from the sanctions imposed in <em>Yamaner </em>and <em>Simmons, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>II. Circuit Court\u2019s Authority to Stay the Commission\u2019s Order to Pay Counsel Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We find ourselves in the awkward position of having to decide a legal issue in an appeal that we must dismiss. A fair reading of the record tells us that the able and experienced trial judge believed that the attorney\u2019s fee would not be recoverable and that its payment fell within the ambit of Art. 101, \u00a7 56 of the Maryland Code. He stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">[A]s we have said, we think the language of our \u00a7 56(a) reflects a legislative intent to preclude \u201crecovery back\u201d upon any theory, except fraud perhaps. If we are mistaken in this regard, the General Assembly will know how to enlighten us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">The fact that now 18 years have passed and the General Assembly is faced with that Court of Appeals decision, provided with no recovery back mechanism means if you win on appeal even on the ground that the award of attorney\u2019s fees by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission even was arbitrary and capricious, that you may win a paper victory, but there is no mechanism for the restitution and that there is not supposed to be one. You are not supposed to get your money back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Obviously, the trial judge believed that by virtue of legislative enactment and subsequent appellate decision, his hands were tied and the fees were not recoverable. He may have further contemplated that since the monies could not be recovered, further proceedings might be precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">We view the law differently than did the trial judge. Because our view compels further proceedings upon the merits of the appeal in the circuit court, we shall explain why we believe that the lower court should have granted the appellant\u2019s request for the stay of the payment of attorney\u2019s fees to appellee\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">In <em>Montgomery County v. Lake, </em>68 Md.App. 269, 511 A.2d 541 (1986), Judge Rosalyn B. Bell observed for this court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>It is firmly established in Maryland that once monies are paid out on a claim, those funds are not recoverable \u201con any theory,\u201d absent fraud, even if the award is reduced or reversed on appeal. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company v. Treadwell, </em>263 Md. 430, 439, 283 A.2d 601 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><em>Id. </em>68 Md.App. at 274, 511 A.2d 541. Judge Bell further pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">A stay of payments awarded by reason of an appeal challenging the underlying award is prohibited. <em>Bayshore Industries, Inc. v. Ziats, </em>229 Md. 69, 76-77, 181 A.2d 652 (1962). The purpose behind the prohibition is that of affording day-to-day support to an injured employee and his or her dependents. <em>Id. </em>at 77 [181 A.2d 652]. Following this rationale, the Court of Appeals in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., supra, </em>held that restitution or recovery back of payments would not be permitted because \u201cit is not the intention and spirit of the [Workmen\u2019s Compensation] act to allow [an employer] to recover back money paid under an award which already has been spent by a claimant for living expenses____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\"><em>See also </em>Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>Humphreys, <em>Maryland Worker\u2019s Compensation Handbook </em>\u00a7 17.3; <em>Hoffman v. Liberty Mutual, </em>232 Md. 51, 191 A.2d 575 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Appellee contends that Md.R. B6 supports the trial judge\u2019s decision to deny the stay. That rule provides that \u201cthe Court shall not have authority to order a stay in an appeal under Article 101, section 56.\u201d The rule must be read in conjunction with its legislative counterpart. We note that the stay portion of \u00a7 56(a) provides that \u201can appeal shall not be a stay of any order of the Commission directing payment of compensation or any order or supplemental order requiring the furnishing of medical treatment.\u201d The pertinent provision of \u00a7 57 is neither \u201ccompensation,\u201d an attorney\u2019s fee to be paid from that compensation, <em>see Hoffman, supra, </em>nor medical expenses. Rather, it is a sanction to be imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>if the Commission or the court before which any pleadings for compensation or concerning an award of compensation have been brought, under this Article, determines that such proceedings have not been so brought upon reasonable ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The award of a \u00a7 57 attorney\u2019s fee in no way involves the \u201cday-to-day support to an injured employee and his or her dependents,\u201d nor has it any effect on the \u201chumanitarian policy\u201d underlying the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. It is clear that the legislative scheme of Art. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 57 does not contemplate that an attorney\u2019s fee imposed as a sanction could not be stayed or could not be the subject of recovery. Judge McWilliams observed for the Court of Appeals in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, supra, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqD9\">[w]hen the Legislature enacted the \u201cno stay\u201d provision in \u00a7 56(a) it must have foreseen the possibility, and as well the probability, that payments would be made to claimants whose awards subsequently would be vacated on appeal. That it made no provision for the restitution of those payments suggests to us that restitution was considered and rejected, and that, in lieu thereof, the disposition of appeals was expedited by giving them precedence over all cases except criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em>Id. </em>263 Md. at 437-38, 283 A.2d 601 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">It is abundantly clear that the payments to which Judge McWilliams referred were weekly compensation payments or payments related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Accordingly, we are firmly convinced that the payment of an attorney\u2019s fee, imposed pursuant to Art. 101, \u00a7 57, is not effected by the stay provision of \u00a7 56 or Md.R. B6, can be stayed, and even if not stayed, the fee can be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">III. A Viable Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Workers\u2019 compensation proceedings and their appeals were never intended to be complicated and costly. To that end, we believe that under the peculiar circumstances of the instant case, should appellant ultimately prevail, restitution ought to be available through summary proceedings within the instant case. This suggestion is not without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>precedent. As Judge Digges noted for the Court of Appeak in <em>Franzen v. Dubinok, supra,:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-3\">The substantive rights of the parties are not necessarily finally determined, and the controversy thus not rendered moot, by the satisfaction of the judgment, for if the matter is heard and reversed on appeal, the court retains the authority in the usual css to restore the parties to their former position by a judgment requiring restitution. <em>See Restatement, Restitution </em>\u00a7 74 (1987); <em>Burns v. Bines, </em>189 Md. 157 [57 A.2d 188] (1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><em>Id. </em>290 Md. at 72, 427 A.2d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Burns v. Bines, supra, </em>observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Restitution may be enforced in a new action, <em>e.g,, </em>for money had and received ... or in a summary proceeding. <em>Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, </em>139 U.S. 216, 220, 11 S.Ct. 523, 35 L.Ed. 151 (1891). <em>See also Restatement, Restitution, </em>\u00a7 74, comment <em>A, </em>comment B, illustration (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>Id. </em>189 Md. at 166, 57 A.2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Northwestern Fuel, supra, </em>in discussing restitution where a judgment was reversed for lack of jurisdiction, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">We are of the opinion that the proceeding to enforce the restitution in the cases mentioned is under the control of the court, and that all needed inquiry can be had to guide its judgment in a summary proceeding, upon motion of the parties; the only requisite being that the opposite part shall be heard so that in directing restitution no further wrong be committed. The restitution is not made to depend at all upon the question whether or not the court rendering the judgment reversed acted within or without its jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-10\"><em>Id. </em>139 U.S. at 221, 11 S.Ct. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">While ordinarily we would not, through <em>dicta, </em>state our views of the law on issues not squarely before us, we do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>here for the guidance of the trial court and for the benefit of the bench and bar in similar cases that might arise in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\">. Article 101 \u00a7 57 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">If the Commission or the court before which any proceedings for compensation or concerning an award of compensation have been brought, under this article, determines that such proceedings have not been so brought upon reasonable ground, it shall assess the whole cost of the proceedings upon the party who has so brought them, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
