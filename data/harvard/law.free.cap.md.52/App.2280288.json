J,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah1\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">William Bozman would have us reverse an order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Brizendine, J.) that effected the forfeiture of $3,950 foupd in the Bozman home during the execution of a search and seizure warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Whatever domestic tranquility existed in the Cockeysville home of William Bozman on Saturday morning, October 27, 1979, must have been shattered when three Baltimore County police officers and an unstated number of \"members of the Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration officers,\u201d all armed with a search and seizure warrant entered those premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">One of the County police officers was Detective Robert Walbrecher, then assigned to the Narcotics Division. Walbrecher acted as \"the evidence man.\u201d From the record we infer that such a person is an inventory tak\u00e9r or tally clerk. Whenever anything is seized by the police, the \"evidence man\u201d lists the identity of the item and where it was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Among the seized items listed by Walbrecher were small amounts of several proscribed controlled dangerous substances as well as paraphernalia patently used in connection with such substances. All but one of the items were seized from the \"master bedroom\u201d and an adjoining bathroom. The officers seized $1,780 from the appellant\u2019s dresser and a total of $2,170 from a safe in the bedroom and from Bozman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>wallet which was apparently found on the dresser. Walbrecher did not know in what part of the bedroom the controlled dangerous substances were found but was able to state that no controlled dangerous substances were found in the safe, the wallet, or the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The Office of Finance of Baltimore County filed a petition in the circuit court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the forfeiture of the money \"seized or captured in close proximity to [the! contraband controlled dangerous substances or controlled paraphernalia.\u201d In due time Bozman answered the petition. He asserted that the funds were his \"property\u201d; that he had never been \"charged, tried or convicted pursuant to the arrest in connection with which said funds were seized\u201d; that seizure occurred during an \"illegal\u201d search, and that a similar petition to that of the instant case was \"filed\u201d in the \"District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County\u201d and was \"voluntarily dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">When the case was tried before Judge Brizendine, Bozman did not testify and offered no evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Judge Brizendine obviously concluded that the monies were found in \"close proximity\u201d to the contraband, and he directed the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\n<em>THE ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Bozman posits two arguments to us, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">\"I. The trial judge erred in granting the appellee\u2019s forfeiture petition in the absence of proof that the forfeited money was found in close proximity to contraband controlled dangerous substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">II. The trial judged [sic] erred in granting the appellee\u2019s forfeiture petition in the absence of proof of a final disposition of related criminal proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 297, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">\"(a) <em>Property subject to forfeiture. </em>\u2014 The following shall be subject to forfeiture and no property right shall exist in them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">(6) All money or currency which shall be found in close proximity to contraband controlled dangerous substances or controlled paraphernalia or which otherwise has been used or intended for use in connection with the illegal manufacture, distribution, dispensing or possession of controlled dangerous substances or controlled paraphernalia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">This money or currency shall be deemed to be contraband of law and all rights, title and interest in and to the money or currency shall immediately vest in and to Baltimore City or the county in which it was seized, the municipal corporation, if seized by municipal authorities, or, if it was seized by State authorities, the State; and no such money or currency shall be returned to any person claiming it, or to any other person, except in the manner hereinafter provided....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The breadth of the term \"close proximity\u201d deliberately has not been defined by either Maryland appellate court. Were we to undertake a delineating of \"close proximity,\u201d it is almost a foregone conclusion that in any future searches, monies will always be found outside the area embraced by our definition. We shall not, therefore, attempt to define \"close proximity.\u201d Instead, we shall treat the term with the same deference afforded \"fraud\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \"a quantity sufficient to indicate an intent to distribute.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We liken \"close proximity\u201d to Justice Stewart\u2019s comment on pornography. We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>not define it, but we know it when we see it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In short, we shall determine \"close proximity\u201d on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\"Close proximity\u201d as used in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 297 (a) (6) must be understood with reference to the legislative purpose. Judge Digges, in <em>Prince George\u2019s County </em>v. <em>Blue Bird Cab Co., Inc., </em>263 Md. 655, 662, 284 A.2d 203, 207 (1971), observed that the Legislature\u2019s purpose in adopting the forfeiture provisions was an \"attempt not only to curtail drug traffic in this [SJtate, but to discourage such a blight from continuing in the future.\u201d In that case, the vehicle was leased from the cab company on a yearly basis at a daily rate of $16. The lessee was arrested while \"sitting in ... [the] cab outside of Central High School in Prince George\u2019s County.\u201d The police had observed the lessee conduct heroin transactions from the cab. The sales were made to high school students. The County sought to have the vehicle forfeited to the County. The trial court dismissed the petition, but the Court of Appeals held that the proscribed sale of heroin from the cab met the stricture of the forfeiture statute. Thus, Blue Bird figuratively speaking watched its cab fly away.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The forfeiture directed by section 297 (a) (6) is directed at money that either was or is intended to be a part of an illicit controlled dangerous substance, or paraphernalia dealing. While unquestionably drugs or drug paraphernalia are forfeited because their mere possession violates the criminal law of this State, the same is not true generally of monies seized on or about premises that are searched pursuant to a valid warrant. To be subject to forfeiture the monies must be derived from criminal activity. Recognizing the great degree of difficulty that would confront the prosecution if it were required to prove that monies found in a search of premises were directly attributable to proscribed activity, the General Assembly wisely eliminated that burden by declaring that monies in \"close proximity to contraband controlled danger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ous substances or controlled paraphernalia\u201d were forfeited unless, after a hearing on a petition for forfeiture, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court shall find that the monies seized were not in close proximity to contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\"Forfeiture is grounded in the legal fiction that an inanimate object can be guilty of a crime.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blue Bird Cab, </em>263 Md. at 658, 284 A.2d at 204. <em>See also United States v. United States Coin and Currency, </em>401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971). Whatever the practical effect may be, a forfeiture is not viewed in the eyes of the law to be a future or additional punishment of the individual whose property is so confiscated. Instead, the law looks upon the property as a living being and thus subject to punishment by way of forfeiture. It is, more simply stated, as if the property were a living co-defendant. <em>See Various Items of Personal Property </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U.S. 577, 581, 51 S.Ct. 282, 284, 75 L.Ed. 558, 561 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">At English common law, the prerequisite to forfeiture was a conviction. The reason the conviction was required was because forfeiture was seen as a punishment of the offender for his crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Forfeiture was not directed at the property itself. The English did not share our concept of the property\u2019s being a separate and distinct living thing, a co-defendant, or co-offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Maryland, as do most of the states, treats forfeiture as an action <em>in rem, </em>prosecuted against the property because of its connection with a crime. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blue Bird Cab, supra; see also The Palmyra, </em>25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 1, 14-15, 6 L.Ed. 531, 535-36 (1827), where Mr. Justice Story, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">\"In the contemplation of the common law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>offender\u2019s right was not devested until the conviction. But this doctrine never was applied to seizures and forfeitures, created by statute, <em>in rem, </em>cognizable on the revenue side of the Exchequer. The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offense is attached primarily to the thing; and this, whether the offense be <em>malum prohibitum, </em>or <em>malum in se. ... </em>Many cases exist, where the forfeiture for acts done attaches solely <em>in rem, </em>and there is no accompanying penalty <em>in personam. </em>Many cases exist, where there is both a forfeiture <em>in rem </em>and a personal penalty. But in neither class of cases has it ever been decided that the prosecutions were dependent upon each other. ... In the judgment of this Court, no personal conviction of the offender is necessary to enforce a forfeiture <em>in rem </em>in cases of this nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-8\"><em>See also Smith </em>v. <em>One Super Wild Cat Console Machine, </em>10 Or. App. 587, 500 P.2d 498 (1972); Annot. 3 A.L.R.2d 738 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The statute, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 297 (b), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">\"Any property subject to forfeiture under this subheading may be seized upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the property except that seizure without such process may be made when \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">(1) The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search under a search warrant or an inspection under an administrative inspection warrant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-12\">(2) The property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the State in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under this subheading;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-13\">(3) There is probable cause to believe that the property is directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-14\">(4) There is probable cause to believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>property has been used or intended to be used in violation of this subheading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">In the event of seizure pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, proceedings under subsection (d) of this section shall be instituted promptly, except all proceedings relating to money or currency, which shall be instituted within 90 days from the date of final disposition of criminal proceedings which arise out of Article 27, \u00a7 276 through \u00a7 302 inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">(i) All applications for the forfeiture of money or currency contraband shall be made by the director of finance of Baltimore City, the county treasurer,<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> municipal treasurer, or the Attorney General. The applications shall be by petition, affidavit and show cause order and shall be filed in the District Court or circuit court of the county or in the District Court of Baltimore City or a law court of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The statutory directive is that forfeiture proceedings shall be commenced within 90 days after \"final disposition of criminal proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 264, allows forfeiture of monies seized as a result of a gambling arrest. The statute mandates that forfeiture shall be commenced within 90 days of \"conviction.\u201d The appellant adroitly likens section 264 to section 297, and, while not specifically suggesting that we read the statutes to be in <em>pari materia, </em>very gently prods us in that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We think that the Legislature meant to draw, and did draw a sharp distinction between forfeitures in gambling cases and forfeitures in controlled dangerous substances matters. The requirement of a \"conviction\u201d in a gambling case is a recognization by the General Assembly that, while gambling is unlawful, it is not such a heinous offense as to dictate forfeiture absent conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Violations of the controlled dangerous substances act are treated much more severely. Patently, the members of the Legislature are fully cognizant that dealing in proscribed drugs and paraphernalia ofttimes results in crimes of violence. Addicts kill, rob, burglarize, and steal so as to obtain funds to sate their habits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Ordinarily, in a forfeiture case \"final disposition\u201d would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>occur by the entry of a final, unappealable judgment, a <em>nolle pros, </em>a stet, or a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The record before us fails to disclose what disposition was made except that, based on the testimony of the only witness produced at the trial and on the answer to the petition, we may safely infer that charges were never filed in either a State or a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The record is absolutely silent as to the reasons for the non-prosecution of the appellant, although any number of things might be inferred. We shall not attempt to enumerate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">There is no indication in the minimal record before us as to when, if ever, the \"final disposition\u201d occurred. We observe, however, that there is no statute of limitations on felony criminal offenses nor on \"penitentiary misdemeanors.\u201d Thus, the mere passage of time would not preclude the filing of charges against Bozman. <em>See Smallwood v. State, </em>51 Md. App. 463, 443 A.2d 1003 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The statute does not, in our view, require that the governmental agency affirmatively prove as part of its case that it commenced proceedings within 90 days of \"final disposition.\u201d On the contrary, the 90-day period is likened unto a statute of limitations and, as with limitations, must be specially pleaded and demonstrated. It is, in essence, an affirmative defense. Since the record in the instant case fails to show when \"final disposition\u201d occurred, if in fact it has, we are unable to say that the forfeiture was not begun within the statutory time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">At the expense of repetition, we again state that there need be no conviction, final or otherwise, in order for there to be a forfeiture. <em>The Palmyra, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\n<em>THE HOLDING IN THE INSTANT CAUSE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Judge Brizendine had before him evidence that demonstrated that monies were found in a position that by any fair standard of judgment could be said to be in \"close proximity\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>to contraband. The evidence in the instant case went one more step. The County showed that \"tally sheets with names, weights and prices on them\u201d were found on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The County was required to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blue Bird Cab Co., Inc., supra. </em>It met that test in the trial judge\u2019s view. We are unable to state that Judge Brizendine was clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086. Bozman, of course, had the right to controvert, other than through cross-examination, the evidence adduced by the County. He elected to stand or fall on the basis of the County\u2019s case. He fell before the trial court, and as far as we are concerned, he shall remain in that fallen position.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-12\">. For reasons that we fail to comprehend, the appellant did not set forth the petition in the record extract. We are, pursuant to Md. Rule 1028 b. 1. (b), permitted to dismiss the appeal on that ground. Md. Rule 1035 b (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-13\">. Indeed, Bozman did not answer the written interrogatories propounded to him by the County. Instead, he sought a protective order.
