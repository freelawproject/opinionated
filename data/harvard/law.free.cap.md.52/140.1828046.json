The record shows that the representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tions referred to in the first instruction were representations made by the plaintiff\u2019s agent, not to the defendant, nor for the purpose of being communicated to the defendant, but to a previous customer, a certain Mr. Hancock, who received them from the agent in the year 1876, and, whether influenced hy them or not, bought the fertilizer in that year, and used it with great benefit. Hancock imparted the information of his experience, as well as of the commendations of the agent, and so it was, it appears, that the defendant also, without himself ever seeing the agent, became a purchaser in 1877, through the instrumentality of the same neighbor, Hancock, whom he authorized to procure the Eureka for him. Therefore, when the jury were told that, if they found that the Eureka was bought hy the defendant upon the representation of the plaintiff\u2019s agent that the Eureka was a valuable fertilizer, they might find in that the basis of a defence, they were directly authorized to find for the defend-, ant because of his having acted upon representations which were not made to him at all, nor intended for him, but which came to him indirectly and by hearsay. How, independently of all consideration of the character of the representations themselves, it was error to direct the jury to hold the plaintiff responsible for what his agent thus said in 1876 <em>to a third party.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\">It is a well-established principle of law that preliminary representations, whatever effect they may he supposed to have in inducing the succeeding contract, do not (in the absence of fraud,) bind the party making them. It is not enough that the article \u201c was bought upon the representation; \u201d it is further necessary that, hy the intention of the parties, the representation is continued into the contract, and made an integral part of it. <em>Benjamin on Sales, sec. </em>567, <em>p. </em>497; <em>Humphreys vs. Comline, </em>8 <em>Blackf., </em>516.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\">Even where the word \u201c warranty,\u201d is used in an oral representation, it is a question to be submitted to the jury</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>whether a warranty was intended, or only an expression \u2022of opinion or high commendation. <em>Starnes vs. </em>Erwin, 10 <em>Ired., N. C., </em>226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-5\">The instruction, therefore, in omitting this essential element, and failing to require the jury to find that the representation was a part of-the contract, was erroneous and cannot be supported.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">In point of fact the representations in question could not have been intended to be part of the contract with the defendant, having been made altogether without reference to him, and to a different party, and in a previous year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">The important point is also involved in the case, whether a representation by an agent, (even if made to.the party,) that a well known fertilizer is a <em>valuable </em>fertilizer, is such a representation as justifies the purchaser in refusing to pay for it, if, upon trial, the results indicate that it was without value as a fertilizer, the article itself being just wliat it appeared and was represented to be\u2014that is of the composition, and containing the ingredients, stated. Is that such a representation as, upon the best authorities, is to be treated as equivalent to a warranty?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\"><em>Simplex commendatio non obligat, </em>is a maxim of the English law. The worth of a thing is matter of opinion, and in matters of opinion, each party must stand and actindepen dently of the other. All commerce is founded on the recognition of this doctrine. <em>Wentwork vs. Dows, </em>117 <em>Mass., </em>16; <em>Weimer vs. Clement, </em>31 <em>Penn., </em>141; <em>Whittaker vs. Eastwick, </em>15 <em>Penn., </em>232; <em>Fraley vs. Bispham, </em>10 <em>Barr, </em>320; <em>Eagan vs. Call, </em>34 <em>Penn., </em>236; <em>Prideaux vs. Bunnett, </em>1 <em>C.

The <em>narr. </em>contained the ordinary money counts, with a special count setting out the promissory note. The appellee pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and under the general issue proved that the note was given for two and one-half tons of a fertilizer called \u201c Eureka,\u201d of which the plaintiffs were manufacturers, and offered evidence tending to prove certain representations at the time of the sale, respecting the value of the fertilizer, which were claimed to amount to a warranty, and upon which the appellee relied in the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The main question is, did the Court, in the instructions given the jury, in lieu of the instructions asked by the respective parties, correctly instruct the jury as to what they must find to entitle the appellants to recover? In other words, were the elements of evidence necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>make a warranty from representations sufficiently stated in the instructions. No question of the admissibility of evidence under the pleadings, or of its legal sufficiency to support the instructions is before us under the record.</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">The rule of law is, that any affirmation of the quality of the artiole, made at the time of the sale, intended as an assurance of the fact stated, and relied on and acted on by the purchaser, will constitute an express warranty. This rule all the authorities\" lay down, and it is not thought necessary to make special citations. Whether such representations were made with the intention of securing a sale, and were relied on by the purchaser, is for the jury, to he inferred from the nature of the sale and the circumstances of the particular case. <em>Benjamin on Sales, </em>409 and 500. The simple question is, then, did the Court sufficiently instruct the jury as to what they must find to constitute a warranty P By the first instruction the Court said \u201c If the jury find from the evidence in this case, that the note, upon which this suit was brought, was given <em>for </em>the <em>fertilizer </em>called \u201c Eureka,\u201d and that the said \u201c Eureka\u201d <em>was bought upon the representation </em>of the plaintiff or his agent, that said \u201cEureka,\u201d was a valuable fertilizer; and shall also find that the said \u201cEureka,\u201d so sold to the defendant, if they find it was so sold, was valueless and worthless as a fertilizer, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d This Court does not think this instruction asserts that hare commendation is a warranty ; hut think it sufficiently instructs the jury on the matter of their inquiry. It requires them to find that the note was given \u201c upon \u201d the representations made. That the representations were the procuring means of securing the appellee\u2019s name to the note. It does not simply say, that if the note were given for the fertilizer and that certain representations were made, they must find for the defendant; hut it states that the note must he found to have been given <em>\u201cupon \u201d </em>such representations, which is the same thing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>saying in consequence of them. If that were so, and the jury found that the representations were untrue, and that the \u201cEureka\u201d was utterly valueless as stated in the instruction, the appellee was entitled to the verdict as the jury were instructed. We do not think that the jury could reasonably misunderstand the instruction as given ; and we think that it did sufficiently instruct them. If the first instruction given by the Court was justified by the proof, and we must assume that it was, then the prayers of the plaintiff were correctly rejected, because they ignored entirely the representations of the plaintiff respecting the value and virtue of the fertilizer. The second instruction given by the Court being the converse of the first was properly given.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b175-7\">(Decided 20th June, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">As to the question of evidence which was excepted to, it would seem that no objection was taken to its admissibility as evidence, but only as to the time of its production. That being wholly within the discretion of the Court, we cannot review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed loith costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
