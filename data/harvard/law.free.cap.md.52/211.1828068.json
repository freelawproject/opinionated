Jones, the trustee and garnishee, that he continued the business at 274 South Broadway, from the 1st of February,'1878, to the 12th of June following, when he sold it out at auction. It was admitted that the amount of the proceeds of sale and collections were sufficient to satisfy the judgment upon which the attachment in this case was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\"><em>First and Second </em>Exceptions.\u2014Stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\"><em>Third </em>Exception.\u2014The plaintiffs asked the Court to instruct the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The case -having been closed on both sides, the plaintiffs asked the Court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">1. That the paper-writing offered in evidence by defendant, and bearing date February 1st, 1878, purporting to be a deed of trust, is a void instrument, provided the jury find the facts stated in the second prayer of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">2. That if the jury find that the witness Kimball was indebted to the plaintiff, Martha V. Syer, the wife of the plaintiff, Robert Syer, on a promissory note for fifteen hundred dollars, dated January 6th, 1869, payable two years after date, given in evidence, the said note being-drawn to her order by her then name of Martha Y. Foley, and that said plaintiffs obtained a judgment on said note in this Court against the said Kimball, for the sum of $1635, on the fourteenth day of January, 1875, as shown by the original papers in said case given in evidence; and if the jury shall further find that said judgment is due and unpaid, and that the said Kimball was the owner of the stock of goods conveyed to Edwin- L. Jones by the bill of sale given in evidence, dated February 1st, 1878, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the amount of said judgment and interest thereon, and the plaintiffs\u2019 costs in said case of <em>Syer vs. Kimball, </em>it being conceded by the defendants in this case, that he has in his hands a sufficient sum of money, the proceeds of sale of said stock of goods, to phy the same. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">And the garnishee submitted the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">1. That the deed of trust offered in evidence, hearing date February 1st, 1878, contains no requirements for releases to creditors, nor any reservation in favor of the grantors or their families, and is therefore not invalid because of its omission to convey <em>all </em>the property of the grantors for the benefit of their creditors, nor is said deed rendered void by the discretion therein given the trustee, as to the carrying on of the business and the sale of the goods and chattels mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>2. That if the jury find the execution of the deed of trust offered in evidence, dated February 1st, 1878, and that the trustee therein named, took possession of the goods and chattels mentioned in the deed as such trustee, prior to the issue of the attachment in this case, and to the issue of any execution upon the judgment of the plaintiffs, upon which said attachment is founded, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-5\">The Court, (Brown, J.,) granted the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers and rejected those of the defendant. The defendant excepted. The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiffs for $2025.62, and judgment was rendered for the same, with interest and costs. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b243-6\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C. J., Miller, Alvey and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-7\"><em>Dennis Claude, John M. Carter </em>and <em>John Carson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-8\"><em>Alexander H. Hobbs, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b243-9\">Alvey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">If the property embraced in the assignment to Jones, of the 1st of February, 1878, really belonged to Kimball, and the assignment was void, as contended by the appellees, the latter were clearly entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">The assignment professes to be for the benefit of creditors generally, and does not exact releases from the creditors as a condition upon which they are allowed to share in the proceeds of the sales of the property assigned ; hut, by the express terms of the deed, the trustee, who is the garnishee in this case, is authorized and empowered \u201c to carry on and conduct said business <em>in his discretion, for such time as in his judgment it shall bebeneficial to do so, </em>or to sell all of said goods and stock in trade and property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>at such times, in such manner, and for such prices, as he may deem proper, </em>and apply the proceeds,\u201d &amp;c. It is obvious, the certain effect of this clause would be to hinder and delay creditors ; and as against them such provision renders the deed utterly void. It is an attempt on the part of the debtor to place his property, for an uncertain and indefinite period, beyond the reach of his creditors, and to make their rights in a great measure dependent upon the uncontrolled discretion of a trustee of the debtor\u2019s own selection. The law will tolerate no such attempt, but treats the act as a fraud upon creditors, and the instrument of conveyance as simply void as against them. The cases in this Court of the <em>American Exchange Bank vs. Inloes, Garn. of Turnbull &amp; Co., </em>7 <em>Md., </em>380; <em>Same Case, </em>11 <em>Md., </em>173, and the recent case of <em>Maughlin vs. Tyler, </em>47 <em>Md., </em>545, are, in all respects, entirely conclusive of this, and it is unnecessary to refer to other authorities upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">It was attempted to be shown by the testimony of the trustee and garnishee himself, that the discretion given him by the terms of the assignment as to the manner and time of disposing of the property, was intended to he exercised for the exclusive benefit of the creditors ; and the rejection of such evidence was the subject of the first exception taken by the appellant. But it is perfectly well settled that the deed must speak for itself, and that its obnoxious provisions cannot be aided, modified or explained, by extrinsic evidence. The cases of <em>Malcolm vs. Hodges, </em>8 <em>Md., </em>418, and <em>Inloes vs. American Exchange Bank, </em>11 <em>Md., </em>173, are conclusive of this question; and the Court below was clearly right in ruling as it did upon the offer of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">As to the second exception taken, that relates to a question of the right of set-off attempted to be set up by the garnishee as against Cleary, one of the grantors in the assignment; but that question has become wholly imma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>terial, inasmuch as, under the instruction of the Court, the jury have found that the property assigned belonged to Kimball, and not to Cleary. A debt due from Cleary to the garnishee constituted no set-off as against the claim of the appellees, upon the assumption that the property assigned, or its proceeds in the hands of the garnishee, belonged to Kimball, the judgment debtor in the attachment; and that question is definitely settled by the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b245-7\">(Decided 20th June, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Einding no error in any of the rulings excepted to, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
