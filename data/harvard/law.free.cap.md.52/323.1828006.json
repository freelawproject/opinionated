That if the jury shall find from the evidence in the cause, that the defendant appeared before the grand inquest of the State of Maryland, for the body of Baltimore County, and informed the said grand inquest that at the September term, 1814, of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, during the trial in said Court of a case in which Louisa Jane Marsh, by her next friend, John Marsh, was plaintiff, and John T. Johns, was defendant, the plaintiff, (John Marsh,) had testified under oath that a certain license to keep an ordinary in the town of Manchester, in Carroll County, in the State of Maryland, from the 1st day of May, 1812, to the 1st day of May, 1813, had heen issued to and in the name of Louisa Jane Marsh, and that he, the defendant, had heen informed since said John Marsh, the plaintiff, had so testified, that in truth and in fact said license to keep an ordinary in the town of Manchester during said period had not been granted to and in the name of Louisa Jane Marsh, and that the defendant informed the grand inquest that he wished them to investigate the matter and see if there was anything wrong about it, and that when the defendant was asked by a member of said grand inquest, whether he wished them to see whether there had heen any perjury, the defendant replied \u201cyes ; \u201d that if in addition to the above facts, the jury shall find from the evidence in the cause, that at the time the defendant so appeared before the said grand inquest and requested them to make said investigation, he acted upon such reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in believing that the fact that the plaintiff, John Marsh, had so testified, taken into connection with the. truth as to the issuing of said license to keep an ordinary in said town of Manchester, from the 1st day of May, 1812, to the 1st day of May, 1813, was a proper sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ject to be investigated by said grand inquest, in order that they might see whether the crime of perjury had or had not been committed by said John Marsh, that then there was probable cause to justify the defendant\u2019s conduct, in connection with the alleged arrest and the alleged prosecution of the plaintiff, and their verdict must he for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">And the plaintiff objected to the defendant\u2019s first, third, fourth and sixth prayers, on the ground that there was no legally sufficient evidence in the case on which to base the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">And he objected to defendant\u2019s first and fourth prayers on the ground that each put to the jury matter of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-7\">The Court (Yellott, J.) granted the plaintiff\u2019s seventh and eighth prayers which were conceded by the defendant, and overruled the defendant\u2019s first, second, fourth, fifth and fifth and a half prayers, and granted the defendant\u2019s third and sixth prayers.

The general character of the prayer made it misleading and capable of mischief. 1 <em>Am.

The fourth prayer was not only objectionable because improper in form and submitted to the jury matter of law, but the Court should have rejected it, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>defendant received the full benefit of the proposition it contained in the plaintiff\u2019s conceded prayer, and in the defendant\u2019s sixth prayer, which was granted.

They are framed upon a forced construction of a portion of the defendant\u2019s testimony segregated from the rest, and entirely ignoring the testimony of the plaintiff. <em>Winner vs. Penniman, </em>35 <em>Md., </em>163; <em>Md. Fertilizing Co. vs. Lorentz, &amp;c., </em>44 <em>Md., </em>218.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">There is no evidence in the cause whatever that Johns ever heard Marsh testify that the license was in his wife\u2019s name, hut upon the contrary, he supposed that his silence gave consent, and in the latter part of his testimony, he swears positively that when the criminal cause was tried, he did not know what Marsh had sworn to about the license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-9\">3rd. These prayers rest upon the <em>mere belief </em>of the defendant at the time, that Marsh had sworn contrary to the truth, without any regard to the <em>bona fides </em>and honesty of such belief. In a case of this kind, <em>mere belief </em>can avail the defendant nothing, unless it was honestly entertained and rested upon circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious and dispassionate man therein. Granting that Johns did hear Marsh testify as stated in the prayers, then it was for the jury to find whether, under all the circumstances surrounding the matter, a prudent and cautious \u2018man would have instigated the prosecution or gone before the Grand Jury; that feeling personally <em>\u201c </em>aggrieved,\u201d he may have given credit to weak circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>stances and a significance to the nod of a man\u2019s head, which no cautious man would have acted upon. 1 <em>Am. Leading </em>Cases, 266; <em>Walker vs. Turner, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., 377.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-5\">The defendant\u2019s fifth prayer enumerates several facts which are alleged to constitute prohahle cause; they are, in substance, that if the defendant <em>understood </em>the plaintiff to have testified to a certain fact, on the previous trial in question, and acting on that belief, instituted the prosecution against the plaintiff for perjury, such belief was prohahle cause, although the plaintiff had not, in fact, testified as the defendant had understood him to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-6\">This falls far below the definition of probable cause, omitting the <em>reasonableness </em>of ground of suspicion, the support of that reasonableness by <em>circumstances </em>sufficiently strong in themselves to have warranted a <em>cautious man </em>in believing that the plaintiff had committed perjury. <em>Straus vs. Young, </em>36 <em>Md., </em>246; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. vs. State, </em>36 <em>Md., </em>366; <em>Medcalf vs. Brooklyn L. I. Co., </em>45 <em>Md., </em>198.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-7\">The whole case was covered by the four instructions granted. The plaintiff\u2019s seventh prayer was the conceded law of the case. It imposed upon the plaintiff the burden of proving every necessary fact to sustain a case for malicious prosecution. The defendant\u2019s third prayer gave to him the full benefit of the supposed evidence, that he acted upon the advice of counsel. His sixth prayer, which was granted, placed the case fully and fairly before the jury upon the defendant\u2019s theory of the law and the facts involved. There having been a full and fair trial upon the law and the facts, there is no sufficient reason for a reversal of the Court below for any possible technical defect in its rulings. <em>Cooper vs. Utterbach, 37 Md., </em>282.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b359-8\">Alvey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ail\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">This was an action for malicious prosecution, brought by the appellee against the appellant. The rulings of the Court below, to which errors are imputed, are those by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>which, five of the seven prayers offered by the defendant for instructions to the jury were overruled. The two instructions given at the instance of the plaintiff were conceded by the defendant, and they, together with the third and sixth prayers granted on the part of the defendant, constituted all the instructions that were given to the jury. And, upon examination, it would appear that the defendant obtained, in the instructions thus given, the full benefit of all the principles of law that he could in reason ask to have applied to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">By the first of the prayers rejected, of those offered by the defendant, the Court was asked to say to the jury that their verdict must be for the defendant, unless they should find that the defendant was actuated by malice, and also that be acted without reasonable and probable cause, in instituting the criminal proceeding against the plaintiff. Now, however correct in principle this proposition may be, in its abstract form, and as offered in this prayer, it could hardly have been a safe guide for the jury. It is doubtless true, and not at all controverted by the plaintiff, that, in order to maintain the action, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show that he had been prosecuted by or at the instigation of the defendant, and that such prosecution was instituted maliciously, and without probable cause. These ingredients were essential to the right of action, and if they were not found to co-exist the action was not maintainable. And while the malice necessary to the right of recovery may not be deduced as a necessary legal conclusion from a mere act, irrespective of the motive with which the act was done, yet, any motive other than that of instituting the prosecution for the purpose of bringing the party to justice, is a malicious motive on the part of the person who acts under the influence of it. As was accurately stated by Mr. Justice \u00cd*aeke, afterwards Baron Paeice, in the case of <em>Mitchell vs. Jenkins, </em>5 <em>B. &amp; Ad., </em>594, \u201c the term <em>\u2018 </em>malice/ in this form of action, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>to be considered in the sense of sjfite or hatred against an individual, but of <em>malus animus, </em>and as denoting that the party is actuated by improper and indirect motives.\u201d If, for example, a prosecution is initiated upon weak \u00e1nd unsubstantial ground for purposes of annoyance, or of frightening and coercing the party prosecuted into the settlement of a demand, the surrender of goods, or for the accomplishment of any other object, aside from the apparent object of the prosecution and the vindication of public justice, the party who puts the criminal law in motion under such circumstances lays himself open to the charge of being actuated by malice. Such motives are indirect and improper, and for the gratification of which the criminal law should not be made the instrument. <em>Add. on Torts, pp. </em>594, 613; 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. </em>453. Taking then the term \u201c malice\u201d in the sense as here explained, it is quite obvious the prayer of the defendant was too abstract in form, and would not have enlightened the jury as to what constituted malice in the sense of that term as applied to this action; but the jury would have been at liberty to adopt their own notion as to the extent and meaning of t\u00edre term. Without any instruction at all upon the subject, explaining the sense in which the term should be applied, the jury would most likely take it in its popular and restricted sense of personal enmity, and desire of revenge. Of this, however, the defendant could not complain. But the prayer.is defective in another particular. It required the jury to find, as a condition upon which they could render a verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendant had acted without reasonable and probable cause in instituting the criminal proceeding. Now, while it is perfectly well settled, that if there be reasonable or probable cause, to the knowledge and honest belief of the defendant, no malice, however flagrant or distinctly proved, will make the defendant liable, yet the question as to what does or does not amount to probable cause is not one to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>submitted to the finding and conclusions of the jury. That question is one compounded of law and fact; and while the jury are required to find whether the facts alleged in support of the presence or absence of probable cause, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, really exist, it is for the Court to determine whether, upon the facts so found, there be probable cause or the want of it. <em>Boyd vs. Cross, </em>35 Md., 194; <em>Cooper vs. Utterbach, </em>37 <em>Md., </em>283, 317; <em>Stansbury vs. Fogle, </em>37 <em>Md., </em>386; 1 <em>Tayl. Ev., p. </em>40, and cases there cited. In view of this well established principle, the prayer was properly rejected, even if it had been free from all other objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Then, as to the second prayer of the defendant, also rejected. What has been said in considering the first prayer, in respect to the question of malice, equally applies to this. By this prayer, the Court was requested to instruct the jury, that if they should find that the defend-, ant was not actuated by malice in instituting the prosecucution, their verdict should be for him. This result was provided for in the prayer offered by the plaintiff, which was conceded by the defendant, and upon which there is and can be no question raised on this appeal. By that prayer, the jury were instructed that it was competent for them to infer malice from the want of probable cause as therein defined, if the existence of malice was not negatived by the proof before them; and it was only in the event of finding the existence of malice, that the verdict could be found for the plaintiff according to the instruction. There was, therefore, no occasion for the instruction asked for by the second prayer, unless it had furnished the jury with an explanation of the sense in which the term \u201cmalice\u201d should have been applied. But that, as we have seen, it failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">It being conceded that the defendant got the full benefit of his fourth prayer, which was rejected, in his sixth prayer, which was granted, a reversal is not claimed, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>could it be, for any supposed error in rejecting tbe fourth prayer. And passing over the fourth prayer, we come to the fifth, which was also rejected. This prayer presented the question as to what facts, if found by the jury, would constitute probable cause. By this prayer,.the Court was asked to instruct the jury, that if they found that the defendant understood the plaintiff to swear contrary to the fact in regard to the license, and, acting upon that belief, he laid the charge before the grand jury, that those facts constituted probable cause, notwithstanding such belief was founded wholly in misapprehension or mistake in point of fact. The Court below was certainly right in declining to affirm this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Probable cause, according to the definition adopted by this Court, is a reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves, to warrant a cautious man in believing that the accused was guilty. <em>Boyd vs. </em>Gross, 35 <em>Md., </em>197; <em>Cooper vs. Utterbach, </em>37 <em>Md., </em>282, 318. It .is very true, probable cause does not depend on the actual state of the case, in point of fact, as it may turn out upon legal investigation. It is made to depend upon knowledge of facts and circumstances which were sufficient to induce the defendant, or any reasonable person, to believe the truth of the accusation made against the plaintiff, and that such knowledge and belief existed in the mind of the defendant at the time the charge was made or being prosecuted, and were, in good faith, the reason and inducement for his putting the law in motion. <em>Delegal vs. Highley, </em>3 <em>Bing. N. C., </em>950; <em>McWilliams vs. Hoban, </em>42 <em>Md., </em>57; 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. </em>455. Mere belief that cause existed, however sincere that belief may have been, is not sufficient; for, as said by Judge Cooley, one may believe on suspicion and suspect without cause, or his belief may proceed from some mental peculiarity of his own; there must he such grounds of belief, founded upon the actual knowledge of facts, as would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>influence the mind of a reasonable person, and nothing-short of this can justify a serious and formal criminal charge against another. <em>Cooley on Torts, </em>182. The defendant here was the defendant in the cause in which it was supposed the plaintiff had committed perjury. He was present in Court and heard the testimony, and he was therefore not liable to he misled or imposed upon by any mere report of what occurred. As witness for himself in this case he has stated wh\u00e1t he understood the plaintiff\u2019s testimony to have been on the occasion referred to. He says \u201c that when the plaintiff was called as a witness he stated that he was carrying on business as agent for his wife; that Mr. McIntosh, the counsel, then said, \u2018then the license is in your wife\u2019s nameand that Marsh made no reply, hut bowed his head, and he, defendant, supposed that silence gave consent; that Marsh did not deny that the license was in his wife\u2019s name, and that he, defendant, paid no more attention to what was said, and thinks he has given the substance of Marsh\u2019s testimony.\u201d Having himself heard this testimony, assuming that he is correct in his recollection of it, it was not, to say the least of it, a charitable construction, and one that a discreet, careful man would readily adopt, to conclude, on learning that the license was not in the name of the wife, that Marsh had committed wilful and corrupt perjury. But if we assume, as the prayer does, that Marsh, the plaintiff, swore, or meant to he understood as swearing, at the trial referred to, that the license in question had been issued in his own name, and not that of his wife, there is no ground whatever for saying that there was probable cause to the knowledge and belief of the defendant. Even if there were circumstances of suspicion in the mind of the defendant which might have been readily removed or explained, by reasonable and proper inquiry, and there was no inquiry made, such circumstances cannot be made the ground for showing the exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ence of probable cause. <em>Perryman vs. Lister, L. Rep., </em>3 <em>Exch., </em>197, <em>Exch. Ch.; S. C., 4 L. Rep., H. L., </em>521; <em>Add. on Torts, </em>592. However confident or strong therefore the belief of the defendant may have been in regard to the existence of probable cause for the prosecution, if that belief was induced by his own negligence, or from error or mistake as to the real state of the facts, without just cause of suspicion furnished by the plaintiff, the proof of probable cause must fail. <em>Merriam vs. Mitchell, </em>13 <em>Me., </em>439; 1 <em>Am. L. Cas., (3rd Ed.,) </em>221; 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. </em>455. The prayer proceeds upon the concession that the defendant, in initiating the prosecution against the plaintiff, acted upon a mistake or misapprehension of the facts, and that the real fact was the reverse of what the defendant represented it to be. It is insisted, however, inasmuch as the defendant at the time believed in the truth of the state of case as he presented it, it therefore constituted probable cause. But, in regard to such proposition, both reason and authority are conclusive against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The prayer Ho. 5-| contains the same enumeration of facts as prayer Ho. 5, and asked that the Court would instruct the jury, that those facts, if believed, were evidence <em>tending </em>to prove the absence of malice on the part of the defendant, even though it might be found that the plaintiff swore that the license had heen taken out in his own name, and not that of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Prayers of this character, merely calling attention to and emphasizing certain items of proof as <em>tending </em>to prove certain facts, have been repeatedly condemned by this Court as being liable to abuse, and as calculated to mislead the jury. The Court in ruling the evidence admissible, on a general offer, allows it to be considered and weighed for all the legitimate purposes of the case; and its force and bearing as means of proving or disproving any particular fact in contest is exclusively for the jury. If a prayer of this character could be entertained in respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>to one fact or circumstance, it could be in respect to any other in the case, down to the remotest and the most minute; and if in respect to circumstances in support of any particular fact, it would he proper so to instruct in respect to all opposing or adverse facts and circumstances. This would lead to manifest abuse. The refusal of such prayers was approved by this Court in the cases of <em>Hurtt vs. Woodland, </em>24 <em>Md., </em>394, and <em>Mason vs. Poulson, </em>40 <em>Md., </em>355, and we can see no good reason why we should depart from the rule of practice thus sanctioned.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b366-7\">(Decided 15th July, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Upon the whole, we find nothing in anjr of the rulings appealed from that requires a reversal, and we must therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
