Such being the fact alleged by the replication, the Court in considering the demurrer could not look to the statute laws of Ohio for evidence to support the demurrer. <em>Ritchie\u2019s Case, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\">If the defendant were not served with process, the' judgment against him as far as this State is concerned, is simply void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">The Court erred in permitting the defendant to read in evidence certain printed matter from two volumes, purporting to be the Revised Statutes of Ohio, of a general nature. The object of this evidence was to prove that according to the laws of Ohio, a writ of summons in a suit, could be legally served by leaving the same in the usual place of residence of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">Article 37, sec. 47, of the Maryland Code, provides tb at \u201c public or private statutes * * * of any State * * may be read in evidence from any printed volume purporting to contain the statutes of the said * * State.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-9\">These two volumes do not profess to contain all the statutes, or the particular statutes of any one session, but only statutes of a general nature. The books on their face have the appearance of being a private codification, and they contain no internal evidence of having been published by authority. Though they contain the words <em>\u201c </em>published for the State of Ohio,\u201d by an Act passed March 16, 1860, the Act does not appear in the volumes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-10\">The volumes contemplated by Article 37, sec. 47, of our Code, are such as contain the statutes of a particular session of the Legislature, or a codification of the laws which has. been adopted by the Legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-11\">The alleged judgment has no binding force in this Court, because the defendant was not personally served with process. D\u2019<em>Arcey vs. Ketchum, </em>11 <em>How., </em>174; <em>Webster vs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>Reid, </em>11 <em>How., </em>459, 460; <em>Nations vs. Johnson. </em>24 <em>How., </em>195; <em>Weaver vs. Boggs, </em>38 <em>Md. </em>261; <em>Mayhew vs. Thatcher, </em>6 <em>Wheaton, </em>129; <em>Lincoln vs. Sower, </em>2 <em>McLean, </em>473; <em>Westewelt vs. Lewis &amp; Sooker, </em>2 <em>McLean, </em>511.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-5\">It is claimed that a judgment where there has heen no personal service is good, if the defendant be a resident of the State where judgment is rendered, and the law of that State makes other process sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-6\">The Court said in <em>Webster vs. Reid, </em>that a judgment recovered without personal service is a nullity whether the defendant he a resident or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">This Court held in <em>Weaver vs. Boggs, </em>that whether a foreign judgment recovered without personal service is binding or not, must he determined by the circumstances of each case as it arises. If there ever was a case where the judgment should he held not binding, this is that one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\">The transcript is not properly certified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-9\">The prayers of the plaintiffs should have been granted \u2022and the prayer of the defendant rejected. The only evidence that the cause of action in both suits is the same, is in an admission of one of the plaintiffs, as testified to by Mr. Schmucker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-10\">Parol testimony as laid down in <em>Whitehurst vs. Rogers, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>517, 518, is often necessary to show that causes of \u2022action are the same. But this must he taken with certain limitations. If suit he brought to recover for goods bargained and sold, and after judgment a second suit he brought for goods bargained and sold, it is proper to show that the goods mentioned are the same in both cases. But if the second suit he brought for money lent, then, even if the previous case for goods bargained and sold went by default, it would he incompetent to show that the suit for goods sold and the suit for money lent were on the same cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-11\">The suit in Ohio was on an account stated, and the suit here is on money paid for, and for money lent to, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>fendant by Wagner and Scbryver, as well as on accounts stated. In this case we claim nothing on the count of accounts stated. How then can the cases be the same?' A judgment by default was recovered when the defendant-owed nothing. He knew he owed nothing and could have caused the judgment to be stricken out. He must take the consequences of that judgment as of any other judgment by default. The admission of Schryver might bind him if he were sole plaintiff, but it being an admission beyond the scope of his authority as a partner, it cannot, bind the firm.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-5\"><em>Samuel D. Schmucker, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-6\">The Court below was right in sustaining the demurrer to the first, second and fourth replications to the defendant\u2019s third plea, because the first replication tendered no-issue of fact, but attempted to put in issue, to be tried by a jury, mere matters of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-7\">The second replication is bad, because it is vague, argumentative and uncertain, and also, because it relies upon the pendency of a proceeding, <em>i. e. </em>a motion to strike out-the judgment instituted subsequent to final judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-8\">The Ohio judgment would have been a good bar to the-present suit, even if an appeal were now pending from that judgment. <em>Bank of North America vs. Wheeler, </em>28 <em>Conn., </em>433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-9\">The second replication is also bad, because it attempts to put in issue the propriety of the action of the Ohio-Judge in overruling the motion to strike out the judgment rendered there\u2014a matter which it was not competent for the Court below to review.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">The fourth replication is bad, because the defendant was under no obligation to keep the plaintiffs advised in the-law of their case, either in Ohio or here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-11\">The appellants, by entering into the agreement at the trial to waive all errors in pleading, acquiesced in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>action of the Court in sustaining the demurrer to the replications.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-5\">The appellee was plainly entitled to read in evidence the portions of the statute law of Ohio offered in evidence by him from the edition of \u201c the Revised Statutes of Ohio\u201d used at the trial below. The Code, article 87, section 47, provides that the statutes of any State may be read in evidence from <em>any printed volume purporting to contain the statutes of such State. </em>The volume of Ohio statutes used at the trial below clearly comes within the requirements of the Code, for upon its very title page appear the words: \u201cPublished for the State of Ohio, and distributed to its officers under the Act of the General Assembly, passed March 16, 1860.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-6\">The objections offered by the appellants in the Court below to the admission in evidence of the transcript of the record of the Ohio judgment, and set forth in the third bill of exceptions, were not tenable. There can be no question that the Ohio judgment, if founded upon the same cause of action as that relied upon by the appellants as the foundation of the present suit, would have merged that cause of action, and would form a complete bar to the present suit. <em>Bank of U. S. vs. Merchants\u2019 Bank, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>415; <em>Whitehurst vs. Rogers, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>503-514, 515.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-7\">It does not appear from the Ohio record that the defendant was personally served with process in the case in which the judgment was rendered against him in that State; but it does appear from the transcript of that record, and the evidence in the case below, that the process in the Ohio case was left at the residence of the defendant, <em>in accordance with the method prescribed by the laws of Ohio for the service of summons in such cases, </em>and that the defendant was, at the time of the institution of that suit, and had, for many years prior thereto, been, a resident of the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>It is well settled that a judgment <em>against a citizen of the State where rendered, </em>even without personal service of process, if the defendant he summoned according to the laws of that State, merges the cause of action, and is valid and conclusive everywhere, and will sustain an action in another State upon the record, or will form a bar to a new suit upon the original cause of action. <em>Freeman on Judgments, sec. </em>221; <em>Henderson vs. Standiford, </em>105 <em>Mass., </em>504-6, <em>Beisenthal vs. Williams, </em>1 <em>Duv., (Ky.,) </em>329, 331; <em>Black vs. Black, 4 Bradf, </em>174, 208-9; <em>Fullerton vs. Horton, </em>11 <em>Vermont, </em>425-427; <em>Buford vs. Pugh, </em>13 <em>Arkansas, </em>33, 35; <em>Weaver vs. Boggs, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>260.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">The transcript of the Ohio record was a full and complete copy of the entire proceedings in the case up to final judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-6\">If the Court here he satisfied that the Ohio Court rendering the judgment in question had jurisdiction over the defendant personally, in accordance with the laws of Ohio, then it was not competent for the Court below to inquire into the regularity of the proceedings in the Ohio Court intervening between service of process and rendition of judgment; but further, if the successive steps of the case in Ohio are inquirable into, then the record shows that all of those steps were taken according to the laws of Ohio. <em>State, use of Bruner vs. Ramsburg, </em>43 <em>Md., </em>334-5; <em>Anderson vs. Fry, </em>6 <em>Ind., </em>76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">The record of the Ohio j udgment was properly certified, both under the Revised Statutes of the United States, ch. 17, sec. 905, and under the provisions of the Code, Art. 37, sec. 35. The fact that the clerk did not sign his full Christian name to the certificate was not material. In the case of <em>Knapp vs. Abell, </em>10 <em>Allen Rep., </em>the signature of the clerk to the certificate was \u201cM. Chamberlain, Clerk;\u201d and in the case of <em>Harper vs. Nichol, </em>13 <em>Texas, </em>152, the clerk signed \u201cWm. T. Avery, Clerk;\u201d and in both cases the record was held to have been properly certified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The certificate of the Judge to the transcript, following that of the clerk, that the attestation of the clerk <em>is in due form </em>and <em>by the proper </em>officer, is conclusive as to the regularity of the clerk's signature. <em>Freeman on Judgments, sec. </em>412; <em>Regan vs. McCormick, </em>4 <em>Harr., (Del.,) </em>435; <em>Grover vs. Grover, </em>30 <em>Mo., </em>400, 403; <em>Ferguson vs. Harwood, </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>408.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">The appellants\u2019 first prayer was properly rejected by the Court below, because it is at variance with the doctrine plainly laid down by the Court of Appeals in numerous cases, in which it is declared that to make a judgment in a prior suit between the same parties a bar to a second suit, it is only necessary that the cause of action in the two suits should be <em>virtually </em>and <em>substantially </em>the same; and this virtual identity of the cause of action in the two suits need not appear of record, but may be established by parol testimony, either under the <em>general issue, </em>or a special plea setting up the prior judgment as a bar. The form of action in the two causes need not be the same; it is sufficient if the subject-matter of the suits be substantially the same. <em>Whitehurst vs. Rogers, 38 Md., 503, </em>514, 515; <em>State, use of Bruner vs. Ramsburg, </em>43 <em>Md., </em>325, 334.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">The second prayer of the appellants was properly rejected by the Court below, because it was shown that at the institution of the suit, and at the time of the making of the admission by Scliryver to the appellee\u2019s attorney as to the identity of the causes of action in the two suits, the appellants were co-partners, and that they continued to be such up to the time of the trial below. It was a plain case of an admission of a member of an existing firm relative to a matter of partnership concern. 1 <em>Greenleaf on Evidence, secs. </em>172, 174, 177; <em>Doremus vs. McCormick, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">The prayer of the appellee which was granted by the Court below, correctly states the law of the case in accordance with the principles laid down by the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>in the cases of <em>Whitehurst vs. Rogers, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>514, 515 and <em>State, use of Bruner vs. Ramsburg, </em>43 <em>Md., </em>325, 334.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b102-5\">Robinson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The appellants instituted a <em>non-resident attachment </em>suit, against the appellee, and caused the writ to he laid in the-hands of sundry persons as garnishees, against whom suits, were docketed in the usual form.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The appellee, defendant helow, appeared to the short, note case, and pleaded</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">1st. Not indebted as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">2nd. That he did not promise as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">3rd. That prior to the institution of this suit, the plaintiffs had recovered a judgment against the defendant, for the same cause of action in the Court of Common Pleas,, for the County of Ross, in the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The plaintiffs joined issue on the first and second pleas,, and filed four replications to the third plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">The defendant joined issued on the third replication,, and demurred to the first, second and fourth replications.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">In these replications the plaintiffs allege that the judgment relied on in the defendant\u2019s pleas, is invalid, because a motion was filed by the defendant to set it aside, on the ground that he was not indebted to the plaintiffs, and also because he had not been served with process; and. that for the purpose of pleading the alleged judgment in bar in this suit, the defendant fraudulently consented to-have the said motion overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">The question then presented by the demurrer, is, whether these facts are a sufficient answer to the defendant\u2019s pleas ?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">Nowit is well settled that a judgment recovered against a defendant in another State, is a har to a suit brought upon the same cause of action in this State. <em>Bank of U. S. vs. Merchants\u2019 Bank, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>415; <em>Whitehurst vs. Rogers, </em>38 <em>Md, </em>503-515; 2 <em>American Leading Cases, </em>617.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>And when it is relied on as a plea in bar, the only question open for inquiry is, whether the Court in which the judgment was rendered had jurisdiction of the person or subject-matter. See cases collated in 2 <em>American Leading Ca</em>ses, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The judgment is conclusive as to the merits of the controversy. 2 <em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, </em>679, 841; 2 <em>American Leading Cases, </em>612.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The fact then, that the defendant filed a motion to set aside the judgment in the Court in which it was rendered, and the grounds on which the motion was based, are quite immaterial so long as the judgment stands between the parties. If the plaintiffs had a judgment against the-defendant in Ohio, for the same cause of action which they are prosecuting here, they certainly have no reason to complain, that the defendant agreed to have his motion to strike out the judgment overruled. Be that as it may, the motion in no manner affects the validity of the judgment, and constitutes no sufficient answer to the defendant\u2019s plea, and the demurrer was therefore properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The next question presented by the record is, whether-the judgment offered in evidence is a valid judgment against the defendant ?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">It does not appear from the face of the judgment that personal process was served upon the defendant, but it does appear that a written notice was left at his place of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">It is essential, of course, to the validity of every judgment, that the parties to he hound should have notice of some kind, either, <em>actual </em>or <em>constructive. </em>Every one is entitled to his day in Court, and to the right of being heard before a judgment of any kind is rendered against him. But it is not always necessary that personal process shall he served upon him. Each State has the right to prescribe by law how its citizens shall be brought into its Courts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>And whatever conflict there may he in some of the earlier cases on the subject, we think it is now well settled, that if process he served upon the defendant, according to the laws of the State of which he is a resident, and judgment he afterwards rendered against him, such a judgment is as binding between the parties, in this State, when relied on as a bar to the prosecution of a second suit, upon the same cause of action, as it is in the State where it was rendered. <em>Price vs. Hickok, </em>39 <em>Vermont, </em>292; <em>McRae vs. Walton, </em>13 <em>Pick., </em>52; <em>Pooman vs. Crane, </em>1 <em>Wright, (Ohio,) </em>347; <em>Joiner vs. Hill, S. C., </em>439; <em>Hunt vs. Lyle, </em>8 <em>Yerger, </em>142; <em>Green vs. Sarmiento, </em>1 <em>Pet. C. C., </em>74; <em>Rangely vs. Webster, </em>11 <em>N. H, </em>299.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">If so, the question then is, whether the service of the process in this case was in conformity with the statute law -of Ohio? To prove this, the defendant offered to read in \u25a0evidence as statute laws of that State, from a hook in two volumes published in 1860, entitled \u00a3:The Revised Statutes of the State of Ohio,\u201d of a general nature, in force August 1st, 1860, collated by Joseph R. Swan, with notes of the decisions of the Supreme Court by Leander J. Critchfield, and upon the title page of which appeared the following words in printing: Published for the State of Ohio, and distributed to its officers, under the Act of the General Assembly, passed March 16th, 1860;\u201d to the reading of which the plaintiffs objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Article 37, sec. 47, of the Code provides \u201cthat public or-private statutes of any State may he read in evidence from any printed volume purporting to contain the statutes of the said State.\u201d The hook from which the defendant proposed to read, not only purports to contain the stathtes of Ohio, hut upon the title page pirrports to have been \u00a3\u00a3 published for the State of Ohio, and distributed to its officers, under the Act of the General Assembly, passed March 16th, 1860.\u201d It is a volume, therefore, strictly within the meaning of the Code, and was therefore admissible in evidence.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b105-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>(Decided 19th June, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The record of the Ohio judgment was properly certified hoth under the Revised Statutes of the United States, ch. 17, sec. 905, and under the provisions of the Code, Art. 37, sec. 35. The Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas certifies, under the seal of the Court, that it is a true copy of the record, and the Presiding Judge of said Court certifies to the official character of the Clerk, and the Clerk certifies, under the seal of the Court, to the official character of the Judge. It was not necessary that the Clerk should sign his full Christian name to the certificate. The signature of \u201cE. W. Pearson, Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas of Ross County, Ohio,\u201d was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">There was no error in refusing the plaintiffs\u2019 first prayer. In order to make a judgment in a prior suit between the same parties a bar to a second suit, it is only necessary to prove that the subject-matter of the two suits is substantially the same. The fact that the forms of action in the two cases are different, does not affect the question, provided the matter in controversy be the same. <em>Whitehurst vs. Rogers, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>503; <em>State, use of Bruner vs. Ramsburg, </em>43 <em>Md., </em>325.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The second prayer was also properly refused. By it, the Court was requested to instruct the jury that the admission of one of the plaintiffs, that the causes of action in this suit and in the Ohio judgment, offered in evidence, are the same, was not binding upon the other plaintiff. The plaintiff's were co-partners, and continued to be up to the trial below, and the admission of one member of the firm relative to a matter of partnership concern was binding upon the other partner. 1 <em>Greenleaf Ev., </em>172, 174, 177; <em>Doremus vs. McCormick, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>63.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">It follows from what we have said, that there was no error in granting the defendant\u2019s prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The judgment below will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
