L. living in Westminster, Maryland, sent to B. &amp; Co., of Baltimore, a telegram dated April 27th, 1878, in the following words: \u201cyou may draw on me for seven hundred dollars.\u201d The same was received about two o\u2019clock p. m. the same day, being Saturday. On the Monday following, April 29th, B. <em>&amp; </em>Co. drew their draft in favor of themselves on E. L. for $700, payable at sight. On the day of its date, the draft endorsed by B. &amp; Co. was received by the F. Bank of Baltimore, and the amount thereof placed to the credit of the drawers upon the faith of the telegram and the authority thereby given, the same being shown to said Bank. The draft was sent to a Bank in Westminster for collection, and on the 7th day of May, 1878, was presented to E. L., who refused to pay the same, and it was protested for non-payment. In an action by the F. Bank against E. L. upon said draft, it was Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-7\">1st. That the telegram of April' 27th, cannot be deemed and treated as an acceptance of the draft.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-8\">2nd. That the suit could not be maintained as an action upon an accepted draft, nor could the plaintiff recover upon the general money counts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-9\">The declaration did not allege an acceptance by the defendant, actual or implied, but the ground of the action as there stated was that the defendant authorized B. &amp; Co., to draw a draft on him for $700, and promised that he would pay the said sum to the holder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>draft on the presentation thereof to him the defendant. It then alleged that in pursuance of said authority, B. <em>&amp; </em>Co. drew the draft payable at sight, that the same was endorsed by B. &amp; Co., and passed to the plaintiff for value, and was received by the plaintiff upon the faith of the authority given to B. &amp; Co., by the defendant. It further alleged the presentation of the draft to the defendant, and his refusal to pay the same. Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-5\">1st. That this did not constitute a count upon an accepted draft, but for the breach by the defendant of his contract to accept and pay a draft drawn on him by his authority; and was sufficient, and substantially averred a breach by the defendant of his implied promise to accept and pay the draft according to its tenor and effect.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-6\">2nd. That the telegram must be construed as an authority to draw \u2022 the draft payable at sight.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-8\">8rd. That such an authority implies a promise to accept the draft upon presentation, and to pay it at maturity, that is to say, at the expiration of the days of grace, viz., three days after sight.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-9\">4th.

And it was admitted that said draft had been presented to defendant, as stated in said protest, and payment thereof was refused by defendant; that defendant resided in Westminster, and Arthur P.

The cause was argued by agreement of counsel, before Bartol, C.

Maulsby, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">The Court determined that the plaintiff below could not, under any state of facts, recover, on the ground that the telegram did not authorize the drawing of the draft at <em>sight; </em>and that the doctrine stated in <em>Coolidge vs. Payson, </em>2 <em>Wheaton, </em>75, does not apply to sight drafts, but only to drafts payable on demand, or at a fixed number of days after: sight. This was the only question intended by the Court, as \u25a0 announced from the bench, to be embodied in the Court\u2019s instruction, given in lieu of the defendant\u2019s prayers; and the instruction, as contained in the record, \u25a0correctly represents the intention of the distinguished \u2022Judge who prepared it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">This view of the Court was founded on a supposed report of the case in 1 <em>Story\u2019s C. C. R., </em>22, contained in a note to the <em>Amer. Ed. of Byles on Bills, </em>252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">On an examination of that case, it will be found that no such question was decided. The report in the note to \u25a0Byles gave only so much of the opinion of Judge Story as was <em>obiter dictum, </em>and there ended. And the <em>dicta </em>of that Judge touched, not the question of a draft payable at sight, but that of drafts payable at a fixed number of days after sight. And all his reasonings applied only to the latter class of drafts. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-8\">The doctrine stated in 2 <em>Wheaton, </em>is, \u201c that a letter written within a reasonable time before or after the date of a bill of exchange, describing it in terms not to be mistaken, and promising to accept it, is, if shown to the person who afterwards takes the bill on the credit of the letter, a virtual acceptance, binding the person who makes the promise.\u201d And the reason of the doctrine is, that \u2022such a letter \u201cgives credit to the. bill, and may induce a third person to take it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The same doctrine is affirmed in <em>Townsley vs. Sumrall,. 2 Peters, </em>180, and again, by this Court in <em>Lewis vs. Kramer and Rahn, </em>8 <em>Md., </em>265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">There is no difference in authority or principle, between a draft payable at sight, and on demand. Sight and demand are, in substance, identical.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">If the first exception shall he necessary to he considered, the same case in 2 <em>Peters </em>is authority for the reversal of the ruling of the Court in that exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">The question of presentment, notice, protest, &amp;c., have-nothing to do with the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">The ground of the action is the appellant\u2019s promise to-accept, and identical therewith to pay; the promise .accrues to any person who shall take the draft to be drawn on tbe credit of the appellant\u2019s promise.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-9\"><em>Charles B. Roberts, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">The telegram contains no description of any draft that could, by possibility, have been drawn. It is so general in its terms that'there is an entire absence of all reasonable certainty, and did not furnish to the appellant any justifiable excuse for its action in discounting said draft. <em>Ulster County Bank vs. McFarlin, </em>3 <em>Denio, </em>553; <em>Rees, et al. vs. War</em>wick; 2 <em>Starkie, </em>411; <em>Coolidge vs. Payson, 2 Wheaton, </em>66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-11\">The draft was not drawn until the 29th of April, 1818, (and must he presumed to have been issued when dated, <em>Roscoe\u2019s Nisi Prius, </em>363,) and was not, therefore, in existence when the telegram was sent by appellee, on 27th of April, 1818, to A. P. B. &amp; Co., and having been drawn payable \u201c <em>at sight,\u201d </em>(and not \u201c after date,\u201d) is not in law an acceptance, and created no such liability as is sought to be enforced in the cause. <em>Wildes vs. Savage, </em>1 <em>Story,. </em>22; <em>Russell vs. Wiggin, </em>2 <em>Story, </em>213.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b304-12\">Bartol, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">This suit was brought by the appellant against the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>pellee. The facts of the case were admitted, and so far as material may be thus stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The appellee, living in Westminster, Maryland, sent to Baer &amp; Co., of Baltimore, the following <em>telegram:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">Westminster, Md., April 27, 1878.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">To A. P. Baer &amp; Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">7 Cheapside, Baltimore:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u201c You may draw on me for seven hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201cEdward Lynch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">The same was received about 2 o\u2019clock p. m. the same day, being Saturday. On the Monday following Baer &amp; Co. drew their draft on the appellee as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">($700.) Baltimore, April 29, 1878.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">\u201c At sight, pay to the order of ourselves, seven hundred dollars, value received, and charge the same to account of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">Arthur P. Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">To Edward Lynch, Esq.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-16\">Westminster, Md.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">On the day of its date, the draft endorsed by Arthur P. Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co., was received by the appellant, and the amount thereof placed to the credit of the drawers, upon the faith of the <em>telegram </em>and the authority thereby given, the same being shown to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">The draft was sent to a Bank in Westminster for collection, and on the 7th day of May, 1878, was presented to the appellee, who refused to pay the same, whereupon it was protested for non-payment. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">Upon this state of facts, the Circuit Court instructed the jury \u201c that if they find that the draft was never presented to the defendant for acceptance, and that there was no acceptance of the same by him otherwise than that to be inferred, or implied fr.om the telegram; and that he refused to pay the same when presented to him for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>purpose, on the 7th of May, 1878, then the plaintiff is. not entitled to recover under the pleadings in this cause, even though the jury may find the telegram was sent by the defendant and received by Baer &amp; <em>Go., </em>and that- the plaintiff knew of the telegram and received the draft and credited the firm of Baer <em>&amp; Go., </em>with the amount thereof, on the faith of the telegram, and of the authority thereby given by the defendant to said firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">To the granting of this instruction, and also to the refusal of the prayer offered by the plaintiff, the latter excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">.The plaintiff\u2019s prayer need not now be particularly noticed, as the questions for our consideration arise upon the Court\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">And,y?reL Was the telegram equivalent to an accept^ anee of the draft, entitling the plaintiff to maintain a suit thereon, as on an accepted hill ?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">It was decided by the Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge vs. Payson, </em>2 <em>Wheaton, </em>66, (affirming <em>S. C., </em>2 <em>Gallison, </em>233,) <em>\u201c </em>that a letter written within a reasonable time before or after a bill of exchange is drawn, describing it in terms not to be mistaken, and promising to accept, is if shown to one who takes the bill on the credit of the letter, a virtual acceptance binding the person who makes the promise.\u201d That decision was based upon the cases of <em>Pillans &amp; Rose vs. Von Mierop &amp; Hopkins, </em>3 <em>Burr., </em>1663; <em>Pierson vs. Dunlop, Cowper, </em>571, and <em>Mason vs. Hunt, </em>1 <em>Doug., </em>296, decided by Lord Mansfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u25a0 It would seem that this is not the law in England at this time, as appears from the opinions of the eminent counsel, <em>Sir Wm. Follett, Sir John </em>Bayley, <em>Sir Frederick Pollock </em>and <em>Mr. M. D. Hill, in </em>2 <em>Story, C. C. R., </em>219, 220, and from the case of <em>Bank of Ireland vs. Archer, </em>11 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>384 m.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">, But the rule laid down in <em>Coolidge vs. Payson </em>was after-wards re-asserted in <em>Shimmelpenick, et al. vs. Bayard, et al.,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>1 <em>Peters, </em>264, 288, and in <em>Boyce &amp; Henry vs. Edwards, </em>4 <em>Peters, </em>111, 121. It was recognized and approved by this Court in <em>Lewis vs. Kramer &amp; Rahn, </em>3 <em>Md., </em>289, and seems to be well established in this country, by the general current of judicial decisions, many of which are cited in <em>Hare &amp; Wallis\u2019 </em>note to the case of <em>Bank of Ireland vs. Archer, </em>11 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>390, <em>(Am. Ed.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The rule was laid down in <em>Coolidge vs. Payson </em>with great strictness and precision. To construe a promise to accept as equivalent to an actual acceptance, it must be one \u201c describing the bill in terms not to be mistaken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In <em>Boyce &amp; Henry vs. Edwards, supra, </em>it was said that \u201c Courts have latterly leaned very much against extending the doctrine of implied acceptances, so as to sustain an action upon the hill,\u201d and in the same-case it was said that \u201c the rule laid down in <em>Coolidge vs. Payson </em>requires the authority to draw, to point to the specific bill or hills to which it is intended to he applied, in order that the party who takes the bill may not be mistaken in its application ; \u201d or in the words of Chief Justice Shaw, the authority to draw, or the promise to accept, ought <em>\u201c </em>specifically to describe or designate the bill, so as to identify it, and distinguish it from all others,\u201d in order to bring it within the American \"cases. <em>Carnagie, &amp;c., vs. Morrison, &amp;c., </em>2 <em>Metcalf, </em>406.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">We refer also to <em>Wildes vs. Savage, </em>1 <em>Story, </em>22.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Upon the authorities we think it very clear that the telegram of April 27th cannot be deemed and treated as an acceptance of the draft.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The telegram does not point to or designate the draft; only the amount for which Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co. were authorized to draw is mentioned, hut in all other respects the telegram is silent, not specifying on what time the draft is to be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">\u2022 In <em>Wildes vs. Savage, 1 Story, </em>22, the learned Judg\u00e9 said that the rule laid down in <em>Coolidge vs. Payson </em>has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>never been held to apply to a bill drawn <em>at </em>sight, or <em>after </em>sight; and assigns very satisfactory reasons why a promise to accept a draft of that kind cannot he deemed or treated as an actual acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We hold, therefore, that this suit cannot he maintained as an action upon an accepted draft, and for the same reason the appellant is not entitled to recover upon the general money counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The instruction of the Circuit Court refers to the pleadings, this requires us to examine them and to determine the nature and ground of the present suit. This depends upon the construction to he put upon the first count in the <em>narr. </em>If it is to be understood as declaring upon an acceptance of the draft by the appellee, it is clear from what has been said, that the plaintiff cannot recover upon it. But is that the true intent and meaning of the count ?</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">It does not allege an acceptance by the defendant actual or implied, but the ground of the action, as there stated, is that the defendant authorized Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co. to draw a draft on him for $100, and promised that he would pay the said sum to the holder of the draft on the presentation thereof to him, the defendant. It then alleges that in pursuance of said authority, Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co. drew the draft, payable at sight; that the same was endorsed by Baer &amp; Co., and passed to the plaintiff for value, and was received by the plaintiff upon the faith of the authority given to Baer &amp; Co. by the defendant. It further alleges the presentation of the draft to the defendant and his refusal to pay the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">This is not a count upon an accepted draft, hut for the breach by the defendant of his contract to accept and pay a draft, drawn on him by his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The declaration would be more technically accurate, if it had averred in terms, the refusal of the appellee to accept the draft when it was presented, and his failure to pay the same at maturity; but we think it is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>and substantially avers a breach by the appellee of his implied promise to accept and pay the draft according to its tenor and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The telegram authorized Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co. to draw on the defendant for $700. The authority did not specify or limit the terms of the draft, or the time upon which it was to he drawn. It is an authority without condition or qualification. There is no evidence of any commercial usage, or other testimony showing that such an authority imports that the draft shall be drawn payable at or after any particular time; nor is there any reason for saying that it did not authorize a draft payable at sight, this is left to the discretion or convenience of Baer &amp; Co., and as the defendant did not impose any limitation or restriction in this respect, we think it must he construed as an authority' to draw the draft in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Such an authority implies a promise to accept the draft upon presentation, and to pay it at maturity, that is to say, at the expiration of the days of grace, viz., three days after sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Now the question arises, has the plaintiff a right of action for the breach of that promise ? The only objection that could he urged to the plaintiff's right to sue, would arise from the supposed want of privity between it and the defendant. The promise was made to Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co. , not to the plaintiff. But this objection cannot he supported. It has often been decided that such an authority to draw and promise to accept and pay, inures to the benefit of any <em>bona fide </em>holder of the bill who takes it on the faith of the promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In such case the import and meaning of the promise is that it is not made exclusively to the drawer of the hill, but is a promise made to any person into whose hands the bill may come <em>bona fide </em>for value; that the same shall he accepted and paid according to its tenor and effect; and such person may maintain an action for the breach of the promise.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b310-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>(Decided 15th July, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u25a0 This question was ably considered and decided by Judge Story in <em>Russell, &amp;c. vs. Wiggin, </em>2 <em>Story, </em>213, and. by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in <em>Carnagie vs. Morrison, </em>2 <em>Metcalf, </em>381, where the subject is treated with great ability in the opinion of Ch. J. Shaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The doctrine of the liability of a party, giving authority to draw, to any <em>bona fide </em>holder of the bill drawn'pursuant to such authority, lies at the foundation of the law governing <em>\u201c </em>letters of credit <em>\u201d </em>in the commercial world, and is well considered in the two cases last cited.</p>\n<p id=\"ARm\">In this case the plaintiff was a holder of the draft for <em>Value; Swift vs. Tyson, </em>16 <em>Pet., </em>1; <em>Maitland vs. the Citizens\u2019 National Bank, </em>40 <em>Md., </em>540, and is not affected byr the state of accounts between Baer &amp; Co. and the defendant; the evidence mentioned in the <em>first bill of exceptions </em>was therefore immaterial, and ought to have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">There is no evidence of fraud, collusion or bad faith on the part of Baer <em>&amp; </em>Co. and the plaintiff, in respect to.the endorsement and delivery of the draft; nor is there -any ground for imputing laches to the plaintiff in presenting the draft for acceptance. ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">For the reasons stated, we think the Circuit Court erred in giving its instruction to the jury, and that the plaintiff\u2019s prayer ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\n<em>new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
