On the 11th the plaintiff took possession under a bill of sale, of the granite blocks quarried by Clegg; and on the next day called on the defendants, to ascertain the number of blocks that had been delivered, and proposed to deliver the balance, when he was informed by them that they did not then want them, that they had no use for them.

The defendants pleaded, for a first plea, that they never were indebted as alleged, and for a second plea, that they did not promise as alleged, and for an additional plea, that heretofore, to wit, on the 21st day of September, 1877, James W. Offutt obtained a judgment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, against James Clegg, in and for the sum of $360.67, (three hundred and sixty dollars, sixty-seven cents, with interest from date and costs of suit,) and that subsequently, to wit, upon the 21st day of September, 1877, at the instance of the said James Clegg, there issued out of this Court an attachment upon said judgment, in accordance with the Act of Assembly, in and for such cases made and provided, to recover the said sum aforesaid of $360 and TVo as aforesaid, and costs of the said suit, which attachment was laid in the hands of the defendants on the 22nd day of September, 1877 ; and that subsequently on September 18th, 1877, a certain Andrew Logan obtained also in the said Circuit Court of Baltimore County, a pertain other judgment against the said James Clegg, in and for the sum of twelve hundred and fifty-one dollars and eighty-eight cents, with interest and costs, <em>upon </em>the 18th day of September, 1877; that the said Andrew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Logan, on the 26th day of November, (?) 1877, in accordance-with the Act of Assembly in and for such cases made and provided, caused an attachment to issue from this honorable Court upon the said judgments last aforesaid, for the recovery of the said sums last aforesaid, and costs of said attachment; which attachment was laid in the hands of these defendants on the 27th day of September, 1877; and the defendants in fact say, that the said attachments upon the said judgments so as aforesaid, were and are-issued to recover condemnation of the sum of money supposed and declared by the plaintiff to he due unto himself,, upon the eighth count in his said declaration contained,, from these defendants; and these defendants say, that in-fact they are not otherwise in anywise indebted to the said plaintiff, than in respect of the said sum sought to he recovered under the said eighth count aforesaid, without this, that they are in anywise, and for any sum of money whatsoever, indebted unto the plaintiff upon the said declaration aforesaid, and that the said attachments are in fact levied to recover condemnation by the said James Offutt and Andrew Logan, creditors of the said James Clegg, of' the same sum of money, for the recovery of which as aforesaid the said plaintiff hath declared in his said count, number eight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">The plaintiff demurred to the additional plea, and the-Court sustained the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">Exception:\u2014The Court (Dobbin, J.,) instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">If the jury shall find the execution by Clegg of the order given in evidence, and the acceptance thereof by the defendants written thereunder, and shall further find that, the whole number of blocks were delivered and accepted by the defendants, and that the defendants afterwards, refused to pay for them, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">And the defendants offered the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">1.

The case was tried and the verdict and judgment rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>upon the <em>eighth count, </em>which declares upon the order and acceptance following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Granite, <em>Aug. 28th, </em>1877.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">Messrs. Gill &amp; McMahon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">Gent:\u2014Please pay Wm. E. Weller or order, two hundred dollars, on Sept. 10th and your note for hal. due on forty thousand Belgian paving blocks, at forty-eight dollars pr. thousand, James Clegg agreeing to deliver you forty or more thousand blocks, on the line of your road <em>on cars, </em>or the place called the <em>Summit.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">JAMES CLEGG.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cWe accept this order when the blocks <em>is </em>delivered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">GILL &amp; McMAHOK\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">It appeared in evidence that the appellants were contractors for paving West Palis Avenue, in Baltimore, for which they required Belgian blocks, and contracted with Clegg to deliver them. The appellee held a hill of sale of Clegg\u2019s property, and consented to the contract made by the latter with the appellants, provided the payment of the price for the blocks should be secured to him, hence the order was drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">It further appeared in evidence that 38,300 blocks were delivered by Clegg and received by the appellants before the 10th of September.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">On the 11th, Weller took possession under his hill of sale of the granite blocks quarried by Clegg, and next day called on the appellants to ascertain the number of blocks that had been delivered and proposed to deliver the balance, when he was informed by the appellants \u201cthat they did not now want them, that they had no use for them.\u201d It may he inferred from the evidence that their contract for paving had been broken up; McMahon testified that Weller had taken it away from them, which however was denied by Weller in his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The appellee directed his men to-deliver at the <em>\u201cSummit\u201d </em>the remaining 1700 blocks, which was done four or five days thereafter; the appellants refused to receive them, their workmen told Weller\u2019s men not to unload the wagons, and tried to prevent them from doing so; the .1700 blocks were \u201cdumped\u201d out upon the ground, there being no cars there at the time in which to put them.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Evidence was offered that the appellee demanded payment and was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The exception of the appellants was taken to the ruling of the Superior Court upon the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">There can be no doubt of the correctness of the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury considered by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">It is free from objection, provided there was evidence in the case to support it, and that cannot be denied or questioned on this appeal, as no special exception was taken to it in the Court below on that ground. We cannot therefore reverse on this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The defence rests upon the proposition that the acceptance of the order was conditional, and binding on the appellants only in the event that the whole number of 40,000 Relgian blocks should be delivered by the <em>10th day of September, </em>and in our opinion this is the true meaning and construction to be given to the acceptance. This appears from the fact that the 10th day of September, was the time fixed for the payment of $200 in cash and for giving the promissory note for the balance. The character of the work in which the appellants were engaged, the purposes for which they wanted the blocks, and the other evidence in the cause supports this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">There being no privity of contract between the appellants and appellee, and the whole right and claim of the latter being based upon the order and acceptance, it follows that if the condition was not performed by the delivery of the blocks before the 10th day of September, no right of action could arise. The appellants might have waived a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>compliance with the condition, and have received the blocks after the day named; but in this record there is no evidence of such waiver, nor of the acceptance by them of the 1700 blocks, attempted to be delivered by the appellee after the 10th of September, consequently the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>prayers of the appellants ought to have been granted.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b43-12\">(Decided 19th June, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">It was not error to refuse their <em>fourth </em>prayer, as it was shown by the testimony of Weller, admitted without exception, that the note mentioned in the acceptance was to be a note at sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Their <em>eighth </em>and <em>ninth </em>prayers were also properly refused ; the <em>eighth </em>because the failure to give the note could not of itself defeat the action; and in our opinion there was sufficient evidence, to he submitted to the jury, of a demand by the appellee, and a refusal by the appellants to pay the money or give the note. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Their <em>first </em>and <em>seventh </em>prayers were also properly refused because too general, in omitting to state any point upon which the evidence was insufficient. Here there was not a total failure of evidence. <em>Hatton vs. McClish, </em>6 <em>Md., </em>407; <em>Warner vs. Hardy, </em>6 <em>Md., </em>540, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">With respect to the demurrer to the <em>third </em>or additional plea, the Superior Court was clearly right in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Being of opinion there was error in refusing the defendants\u2019 <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>prayers, the judgment will be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\n<em>new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
