D. 1878, the plaintiff was greatly injured and hurt, by reason of the falling of a brick out of the said wall and upon his head, <em>he being then and there </em>temporarily, and for a necessary purpose of bodily convenience seated within the doorway of the said house, and upon the sill of said door, the said sill constituting a step leading into said house from the aforesaid public highway, with his head projecting beyond the line of the wall of the aforesaid house, in the position which might and could have been occupied by that of a passer-by, and upon the said street, lawfully using the same for purposes of travel, and not having remained in the said posture an unreasonable time, nor in anywise molested or interfered with the inhabitants of the said house, nor been directed or warned to depart therefrom. Whereby, to wit: by reason of the falling of the said brick upon his head, the plaintiff has been permanently injured, and rendered unfit to earn his livelihood by labor, and has been put to great expense in and about endeavoring to be cured of his said injuries, and was for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>long space of time hindered and prevented from attending to his lawful affairs, and suffered great pain of body and anxiety of mind. And the said plaintiff expressly avers, that his said injury was caused solely by the dilapidated and ruinous state of the wall aforesaid, so as aforesaid allowed and permitted by the said defendants, imjiroperly and contrary to their duty in the premises, and by reason of no other matter or thing whatsoever, and especially by reason of no fault or negligence on his, the said plaintiff\u2019s part, thereunto contributing; and the plaintiff claims $10,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">The <em>narr. </em>as originally drawn contained in lieu of the averment, beginning \u201che being then and there temporarily,\u201d the statement, \u201che being then and there lawfully in front of the wall aforesaid.\u201d .The proof on the part of the plaintiff showed that he had seated himself upon the sill of the door leading into the defendants\u2019 house on Hillen street (there being no projecting steps) for the purpose of adjusting his shoe, and almost immediately after assuming this posture, and while leaning forward, with his head projecting beyond the front line of the wall, he was struct by the brict which inflicted the injury. The defendants\u2019 counsel, all the evidence for both sides being in, claimed that a variance was caused by the word \u201clawfully,\u201d applied to a person whom they charged to he technically a trespasser. The Court was inclined to sustain this position, and the plaintiff amended his <em>narr </em>so as to contain a full statement of the facts developed by his evidence upon this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">To the amended <em>narr. </em>the defendants demurred.

B., </em>420, 421; <em>Wharton on Neg., see. </em>346.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">And since the plaintiff has been greatly damaged in consequence of this illegal act, and \u201chy reason of no other matter or thing whatsover,\u201d his right to recover for this injury would seem to he clear even if the <em>narr. </em>showed him to have been a trespasser. <em>Owings vs. Jones, 9 Md., </em>108; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. vs. Mulligan, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>486; <em>B. &amp; O. R.

It would surely he monstrous to hold that one using the public highway in front of a wall which has been suffered to become a man-trap, would he disentitled to recover for an injury occasioned by this grave breach of legal duty, because he happened to have his hand or foot, or an end of his garment within the building line of the defendants; and this plaintiff\u2019s case is, upon the demurrer\u2019s admissions, to the full as meritorious as any of those supposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">The demurrer was sustained by the Court below mainly on the authority of the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Maenner vs. Carroll, et al., </em>(the <em>decision </em>was conceded to he distinguishable,) on <em>p. </em>213 of 46 <em>Md., </em>where this Court says : \u201c * * * * Any individual who complains of the manner in which a defendant may have used his own land, should show with certainty and precision both the right of the plaintiff, and the duty of the defendant, and in what manner such right and duty have been violated.\u201d And again, \u201c * * * * * having no right to he on the lot * * * * * the injury which the plaintiff suffered ***** must he attributed exclusively to his own fault.\u201d Neither the letter nor the spirit of this language applies to the present case. The <em>duty </em>of the defendant, the violation of which is complained of, was the duty to \u201c take care that \u201d their <em>\u201c </em>fixed property \u201d should he \u201c so used and managed that other persons shall not he injured.\u201d (30 Md., 205.) The <em>right </em>of the plaintiff, was the right of exemption from dangers arising from the neglect of this duty. The' plaintiff\u2019s injury in this case cannot possibly <em>\u201c </em>he attributed exclusively to his own fault,\u201d when the <em>narr. </em>avers and the demurrer admits that it <em>\u201c </em>was caused * * * * * especially by reason of no fault ***** on his * * * part.\u201d But without dwelling upon these verbal criticisms, it is submitted that the language of <em>Maenner vs. Carroll, et al., </em>is to he construed with reference to the facts of that case, and cannot he invoked to sustain a doctrine at variance not only with the previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>decisions of this Court, <em>Irwin vs. Sprigg, </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>200; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. vs. Mulligan, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>568; but with the overwhelming weight of judicial authority upon the subject. The judgment of the Court below should be reversed and the cause remanded, that the defendants may plead over to the amended <em>narr.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-5\"><em>Arthur Geo. Brown </em>and <em>John Carson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">The declaration fails to state a sufficient cause of action. It shows that the appellant was injured while he <em>toas trespassing </em>on the property of the appellees. He was not a traveller, passing along Hillen street, but an intruder, who had seated himself uninvited \u201cwithin the door-way of the said house, and upon the sill of said door, the said sill constituting a step leading into said house from the aforesaid public highway.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">As this Court remarked, in <em>Maenner vs. Carroll, et al., </em>46 <em>Md., </em>212, \u201cTo constitute a good cause of action, in a case of this nature, there should be stated <em>a right </em>on the part of the plaintiff, <em>a duty </em>on the part of the defendants in respect to that right, <em>and a breach </em>of that duty by the defendants, whereby the plaintiff has suffered injury. Here there is nothing of the sort shown.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">After alleging that the wall of the appellees\u2019 house \u201c was a source of peril to all persons lawfully passing upon and using the said street,\u201d which allegation is that of a public nuisance, giving of itself no private right, the declaration proceeds to show that the appellant was not passing or otherwise lawfully using the public street, but was injured when he was not upon the street at all, but while he was sitting on the door sill, <em>i. e., </em>upon and within the wall of the appellees\u2019 house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\">There is no statement of a right, nor of a duty in respect of that right, nor of a breach of that duty. \u201cThere is no positive right alleged; and without such right the action cannot be maintained.\u201d <em>Maenner vs. Carroll, et al., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>46 <em>Md., </em>217; <em>Gantret vs. Egerton, </em>2 <em>Com.

Law, </em>460.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">The declaration is fatally defective in form and substance, and the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">In addition to the decision of this Court in <em>Maenner vs. Oarroll, et at, </em>which was regarded by the Court below and by the appellees as decisive of this case, and upon which appellees now confidently rely, they refer to the following authorities, which show that for such an injury as is complained of in the declaration, there is no liability to a trespasser, or to a person present by mere sufferance. <em>Pittsburg, F. W. and Chicago R. R. vs. Bingham, </em>29 <em>Ohio State, </em>364\u20145, 367-8-9,373; <em>Gillis vs. Penn. R. R., </em>59 <em>Penn. State, </em>129, 141, 143; <em>Nicholson vs. Erie Rwy.

It is admitted that at the time of the injury, he was sitting, uninvited, within the limits of the appellees\u2019 house, and was therefore, to that extent a trespasser. He was not in fact, and could not be considered in law, at one and the same moment of time, a traveller on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>highway, as regards his head, and a trespasser as regards the rest of his person. He was not a traveller at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-5\">But even if the appellant had not been sitting where he was, but had been injured by a falling brick while he was wholly upon the sidewalk in front of the appellees\u2019 house, under the circumstances set forth in the declaration, he could not have recovered. <em>Reg. vs. Pratt, </em>4 <em>E. &amp; B., </em>860, (82 <em>E.

But the question is, whether the facts set out in the appellant\u2019s <em>narr. </em>do not show a case of right violated, and of duty neglected, and of injury resulting from that neglect of duty?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The obligation of the common and civil law, \u201csic <em>utere tuo ut non alienum Icedas,\u201d </em>as recognized by the cases before cited, imposed upon the defendants the duty of keeping their premises in such \u00abrepair, that persons lawfully using the street and premises, should do so without injury. Travellers on a street, have not only the right to pass, but to stop and rest on necessary and reasonable occasions, so that they do not obstruct the street or doorways or wantonly injure them.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">A ruined or dilapidated wall is as much a nuisance, if it imperils the safety of passengers or travellers on a public highway, as a ditch or a pit-fall dug by its side. It is immaterial whether the injury results from falling debris, or descending into an open area.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>A special injury, from a public nuisance, is a conceded ground of action to the party hurt. \u201cTwo things!\u2019 says Lord Ellenborough \u201c must concur to support this action, an obstruction in the road by the fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid it on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Butterfield vs. Forrester, </em>11 <em>East, </em>60.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">If, however the injury be such as could not have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care, or was wantonly caused by the defendant, it would seem that the plaintiff, though negligent, is entitled to recover. <em>Bridge vs. The G. J. R. Co., </em>3 <em>M. &amp; W., </em>244; <em>Angell on Highways, </em>347, and authorities in note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Highways, are but easements over the land, leaving the fee in the owner of the adjacent soil, subject to the public' servitudes. The person in whom the fee of the road is, may maintain trespass, or ejectment, or waste for the invasion of his rights. Yet, the traveller has corresponding privileges in the adjacent soil. A passenger on a public highway, may go \u201c <em>extra viam </em>\u201d if it be impassable. <em>Douglas R., </em>745; 3 <em>Stephens\u2019 N. P., Title, Way, </em>2768; 2 <em>Black. Com., note </em>26 <em>by Christian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The principle of this rule must extend to all other cases of necessity, which may overtake a traveller or passenger in a public thoroughfare, whether they arise from the state of the road; from persons, vehicles or property driven or carried over it, or from the personal wants of the passenger. He cannot stop in the highway, for that would impede others, and expose himself and them to danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Self-preservation, as well as public convenience, must justify, or make lawful, a temporary use of a fence, wall, or door-sill, binding on the highway,, in cases of accident, or sudden sickness, or personal infirmity, not delaying longer than absolute necessity requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">This appears negatively, from what was said by Willard, J., in the case of <em>Adams vs. Rivers, </em>11 <em>Barbour, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>390, cited in <em>Angell on Highways. </em>Trespass was brought by the adjoining owner, against a person who came upon the sidewalk, and there remained abusing him and refusing to depart. The learned Judge said, <em>\u201c </em>the defendant committed a trespass while standing on the sidewalk by the plaintiff\u2019s lot, where he lived, and using towards him abusive language. While so engaged, he was not using the highway for the purpose for which it was designed, but was a trespasser. He stood there but about five minutes. It was not shown that he stopped on the sidewalk for a justifiable cause; on the contrary, it was rendered probable, that it - was for a base and wicked purpose. It was, therefore, a trespass.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b256-9\">(Decided 20th June, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">. The <em>\u201clocus in quo\u201d </em>in that case, was the sidewalk, itself a part of the highway, hut the right of action arose from its being used for an unlawful purpose. The alleged <em>\u201c locus in quo,\u201d </em>in this case, is partly in the highway, and partly on the property of the adjoining owner, the head of the plaintiff, which was injured, being within the lines of the highway, as alleged, and the body resting for a lawful purpose on the door-sill. He was not a trespasser <em>\u201cquoad hoc; </em>\u201d if he had remained in. that position longer than necessary against the owner\u2019s will, he might have become so.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We think the amended <em>narr. </em>set out a good cause of action, and, that the demurrer thereto should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\n<em>new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
