And for the further purpose of enabling the Court to apply the said .guaranty to its proper subject by reference to the surrounding facts and circumstances. And for the further purpose of proving the real consideration of the said guaranty between the parties thereto. And also for the purpose of enabling the Court to determine whether or not the said guaranty was a continuing guaranty.

Lazear and its result, and their promise to procure such a guaranty, which the Board approved and accepted, and requested Mr. Spence to see the Messrs. Lazear Brothers and ask them to see Mr. Mickle, the cashier of the plaintiff, who would prepare such a paper, which Mr. Spence accordingly did; that James Lazear, one of the firm, accordingly saw Mr. Mickle, who gave him the guaranty here offered in evidence, which he took to the defendant, who asked whether it was to the same effect as the guaranty above mentioned, given to the Western Bank, <em>i. </em>e., to guarantee payment of paper discounted by the Bank for Lazear Brothers, to which said James Lazear, in good faith and so believing, answered in the affirmative, whereupon the said defendant, in like good faith and so believing, signed the said guaranty, without reading the same; that said James Lazear took the said guaranty to Mr. Mickle, and delivered it to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>saying to him, that it was of course understood between them, that said paper guaranteed nothing hut the paper signed by, or endorsed by Lazear Brothers, and discounted by the Bank for them, to which Mr. Mickle replied, <em>\u201c </em>That\u2019s all; \u201d and said Lazear delivered the guaranty to him accordingly with that common understanding between them, so expressed and recognized by both, and not otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\"><em>\u201c </em>This evidence is offered to show, not merely the subject of the said guaranty, and apply the language of the guaranty to such subject, and for the other purposes named in the defendant\u2019s offer of evidence, heretofore made and rejected, hut. also to show that the guaranty as offered and construed by the plaintiff, was not the contract or guaranty of the defendant, and that the use attempted to he made of it, by the plaintiff in this action, and for the purposes of recovering therein upon or to the extent of the notes offered in evidence, would he a fraud on the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">But the Court on the plaintiff\u2019s objection, excluded all proof as to the matters and things contained in the said offer, except the portions included within brackets; to this ruling of the Court, and the exclusion of the proffered proof the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\"><em>Third </em>Exception.\u2014The appellant further offered in evidence an account furnished to him by the appellee, showing the amount of interest charged to the firm of Lazear Brothers by the appellee from September 13th, 1869, to September 9th, 1812, which was offered for the purpose of proving, in connection with other evidence given or to he given, that the appellee knowingly and unlawfully charged to, and reserved, received and took from Lazear Brothers, a rate of interest greater than that allowed by the law of the State of Maryland, in violation of Revised Statutes of the United States, Title lxii, sections 5191 and 5198. The claim of the appellant and the purpose of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>evidence being to establish that the appellant was entitled to have the whole of said interest credited for his benefit, to the said Lazear Brothers, in account between them and the appellee, or to recoup, or set-off the same on their behalf, and for his benefit against the appellee\u2019s demand in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">But the appellee objected to the admissibility of said offer or any part thereof, and the objection was sustained by the Court.

The word <em>negotiate, </em>simply means that the Bank had the power <em>to sell </em>that to which it had acquired title by a discounting in the regular course of its business. The power \u201cto negotiate\u201d a bill or note, is the power to <em>endorse </em>and <em>deliver it </em>to another, so that the right of action thereon shall pass to the endorser or holder.

It provides that they \u201c may take, receive, reserve and charge on any <em>loan </em>or <em>discount </em>made, or upon any <em>note, bill of exchange, </em>or <em>other evidences of debt,\u201d </em>such interest as is allowed by the local law. Where there is no rate so prescribed, they are allowed to \u201ctake, receive, reserve or charge a rate not exceeding <em>seven per centum, </em>and such interest may be taken in advance, reckoning the days for which the <em>note, bill </em>or <em>other evidences of debt </em>has to run. And the <em>purchase, discount </em>or <em>sale </em>of a <em>bona fide bill of exchange, </em>payable at another place than the place of such <em>purchase, discount </em>or <em>sale, </em>at not more than the current rate of exchange for sight drafts, in addition to the interest, shall not be considered as taking or receiving a greater rate of interest.\u201d It is impossible to deny that a plain distinction is here drawn between purchasing and discounting commercial paper, and that while the power to purchase bills of exchange is specifically recognized, the power to purchase promissory notes is as conspicuously withheld. Coupling this with the power conferred by section 5136, to <em>discount </em>promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange alike, and the additional power to <em>\u201cbuy </em>exchange,\u201d but not to buy notes, the inference seems irresistible, that the purchase of bills was meant to be allo'wed by section 5136, and the purchase of notes was not, and that section 5191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>was deliberately and carefully drawn, to carry out this distinction and accommodate the rule of interest to tbe differing conditions which it involves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-5\">The Bank not having the power to purchase notes, acquired no title to, and cannot maintain an action upon the note in question. <em>N.

The Court helow plainly erred in instructing the jury that the appellee was entitled to recover, even although they should find that the notes sued on as guaranteed, had not in fact been discounted by the appellee on the faith of the guaranty. This ruling the Court arrived at, by reversing its previous instruction to the contrary, embraced in the appellant\u2019s fourteenth prayer, and by modifying the appellee\u2019s own first prayer, in which it was conceded, that there could he no recovery, unless the notes had heen discounted by the Bank, <em>\u201c </em>looking to the said guaranty, and on the faith thereof.\u201d The doctrine thus sanctioned is at war with the rudimental principles of the law of guaranty. The fact that the thing done and constituting the ground of action, was done on the faith of the guaranty, is the only consideration in cases like the present, which makes the guaranty obligatory and the guarantor bound. If the thing done was not done on the faith of the guaranty, then the guaranty plainly was no part of the consideration for which it was done, nothing passed from the plaintiff in consideration of tbe defendant\u2019s guaranty; he lost nothing, and parted with nothing on account of it or by reason of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-7\">This is illustrated by the very form of a declaration upon guarantees. 1 <em>Harris\u2019 Entries, </em>241, 245; 1 <em>Evans\u2019 Harris, </em>219; 4 <em>Robinson\u2019s Practice, </em>389 to 392, 398.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-8\">And it is the <em>rationale </em>of the received doctrine that a guaranty of an existing debt, which was not created at the defendant\u2019s request .or upon his responsibility, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>void, unless supported by some new consideration. <em>De Colyar on Prin. and Surety, </em>25; <em>Standley vs. Miles, </em>86 <em>Miss., </em>434; 1 <em>Chitty on Contracts, </em>62, 740.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-5\">It will be found to be the universal doctrine in both the Federal and State Courts. 1 <em>Chitty on Contracts,. </em>(11<em>th Amer.

The Court below was right in rejecting this evidence. The language of the guaranty is clear and unequivocal. It extends to and covers <em>\u201call liabilities </em>to said Bank, of Lazear Bros., now existing, or which may hereafter arise; \u201d * * * <em>\u201call paper </em>that may be held by the Bank of Lazear Bros., either as drawers or endorsers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-10\">The principal purpose of the offer was obviously to contradict the written contract, and substitute for the stipulations which it contains others entirely different; to prove, in direct contradiction of its langirage, that the guaranty did not cover \u201call liabilities,\u201d \u201call paper,\u201d but only extended to a particular class of liability or paper; viz., liability incurred on discounts, and paper discounted for the direct benefit and account of Lazear Bros.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>It is clear that there was no latent ambiguity in the case when the evidence was offered; and it is equally clear, that the excluded evidence does not show or create one.

The sections 5197 and 5198 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the offer makes reference, authorize the party who has paid usurious interest to a National Bank, or his legal representatives, to recover twice the amount of interest paid, ' provided the suit is brought within two years. This remedy is exclusive of all others. To the claim now set set up hy the defendant it is a sufficient answer to say that no suit was brought within the two years. Besides this, no person can sue under the statute, except the party who has paid the usurious interest, and with him it is optional for two years only, whether, having borrowed money at an agreed rate of interest, and having honestly paid the debt, he will seek to recover against the hank the statutory penalty for a contract which he himself had willingly entered into. That which is to he recovered in such a suit is a penalty, and even where two years limitation does not bar, as it does in this case, it could scarcely he maintained that a claim to penalty for past usury in other transactions could he recouped or set off in an action to recover against the drawer of certain notes. However this may be, clearly the plaintiff does not owe the defendant anything upon the evidence in this case ; and, therefore, there is nothing to he recouped or set off hy him. Further, recoupment is an equitable doctrine, and would not apply to a statutory penalty, and it is also confined to claims arising out of the same transaction, and therefore, would not extend to the claim in this case, which has no connection with the causes of action sued upon. <em>Abbott vs. Gatch, </em>13 <em>Md., </em>314; <em>Wiley vs. </em>Starbuck, 44 <em>Ind., </em>298; <em>La Farge vs. Halsey, </em>4 <em>Abbott Pr., </em>397; <em>St. Louis Perpetual Ins.

The construction which', hy these prayers, the jury is authorized, upon their views of the parol evidence in the cause, to give to the written paper, changes and contradicts the plain and unambiguous meaning of the paper itself. The law does not permit either Court or jury to give such effect to parol evidence. There would he an end of this rule, if what was meant and intended hy a written contract was left to he found by a jury upon such parol proof as the parties might bring before them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">The defendant\u2019s second, third, fifth, fifth-and-a-half, eighth, ninth and tenth prayers relate to the effect of usury on the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">The second, third, eighth, ninth and tenth, are all open to the objection that they leave it to the jury to interpolate a new term into the contract, by finding that it was intended to cover or not to cover usurious transactions, when the written contract itself covers all paper and all liabilities, without making any such distinction or limitation. Whether the contract applied to usurious discounts, was a question for the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">Of the seven notes offered in evidence by the plaintiff, six were discounted for Schurtz &amp; Co., and the usurious interest was paid by them. The seventh note was <em>purchased </em>from Winchester &amp; Son, according to the view on the part of the appellant, and not discounted at all; and no question of usury could, in that event, arise upon it. The appellee contends, however, that it was in fact discounted for Lazear Brothers, and is to be so treated and regarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-8\">The fifth prayer asks <em>the Court </em>to say that the guaranty, properly construed, does not apply to these usurious transactions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-9\">. Prayer five-arid-a-half asks the Court to say that there was no evidence in the cause that defendant contemplated or knew of the usurious transactions, and that without such evidence the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>All these prayers seem to be founded on one or the \u2022other of the two propositions, that the guaranty, if valid, \u25a0could not protect or be applied to usurious transactions ; \u2022or, that if the guarant3r was given for the purpose of covering such transactions, it was illegal and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">Each of these propositions is, upon principle and authority, vitally erroneous, and the Court below properly rejected these prayers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-6\">1. The usury did not make void the notes usuriously \u25a0discounted, or the contract of the defendant to be liable upon them as the endorser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\">Sections 5191 and 5198 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, do not make a usurious contract void, but provide specific penalties for the infraction of their provisions ; the penalty where usurious interest has been actually received by the National Bank, as in this case, being the right conferred on the party who has paid the interest to recover back twice its amount; provided the suit be, brought within two j'ears.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-8\">Where the statute has not declared the contract void, and has fixed a specific penalty for usury, the Courts cannot inflict a greater penalty by debarring recovery, and thus forfeiting the whole debt. <em>Wiley vs. Starbuck, </em>44 <em>Ind., </em>298; <em>Fleckner vs. U.

The penalty of twice the amount of the usurious interest can, under the terms of the statute, only be recovered by the party who has paid that interest, or his legal representatives. This would be so held by the Courts, even if the language of the statute was not so \u25a0specific, because the person paying the usury is the party injured, and, therefore, rightly entitled to the remedy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>This being the only forfeiture imposed, if the party entitled to it does not deem it right or proper to sue, no one else who may be liable on the note usuriously discounted, as endorser, drawer or otherwise, has any right to impeach the note on the ground of usury. It is good as to all the world.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">The liability of the defendant was, by the terms of the guaranty, that of an endorser; but whether his surety-ship was by means of endorsement or guaranty, if he intended that the paper guaranteed should not be usuriously discounted, he should have so stipulated. In the absence of such a stipulation, even in the case of discounts for Lazear Brothers, they were left at liberty to make their' own terms as to interest. In the case of the six notes discounted usuriously for Schurtz <em>&amp; </em>Co., manifestly the rate of interest did not concern the defendant. <em>National Bank vs. </em>Garlinghouse, 22 <em>Ohio, </em>492; <em>Selser vs. Brock, </em>3 <em>Ohio St., </em>302; <em>Hough vs. Horsey, </em>36 Md., 181\u2014185; <em>Smith vs. Exchange Bank, &amp;c., </em>26 <em>Ohio, </em>141.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">The proposition asserted in the defendant\u2019s seventh prayer is that if the note was obtained by purchase, and not by discount, the bank could not recover on it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-7\">Mr. Taylor proves that this note was presented to the Board of Directors, and was purchased or discounted by their order\u2014that the Board did not consider paper offered by brokers, until the offering of customers was disposed of, and that then, if the Bank had unemployed funds, it sometimes invested them in outside paper\u2014that it never bought or discounted a note from a broker, except when there was more money on hand than was employed in discounting the regular offering of customers. Mr. Taylor also proved that at the time of buying or discounting this note he had an impression, he believed, that it was for the benefit of Lazear Brothers, and that they were getting the proceeds of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Winchester proves that Winchester &amp; Son, brokers, tendered and sold the note to the plaintiff for the drawers, who received the proceeds of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">1. Even then, if the jury should find that Lazear Brothers did not direct the brokers to offer the note at the National Union Bank, and did not know that it was so offered, still the brokers were their agents, to negotiate the paper, and, without disclosing their principals, obtained the money on the note for them. Of course, if Lazear Brothers had, themselves, offered the note, and got the money, less the discount, it would have been a discounting .of the note in the strictest sense of that term. If they did the same thing by their agent, and ratified his act by receiving and keeping the money, it was equally in law and fact, a discount of the note for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-6\">If, then, it he conceded, for the purposes of the argument, that section 5136 of the Revised Statutes did not give the Bank power to purchase the note, yet this transaction upon the facts referred to was authorized, because Lazear Brothers were, in truth, the borrowers of the money upon their own note, and it was, in fact, discounted for them. The prayer, therefore, which utterly ignored these facts, was properly rejected. It would he a most unjust and unreasonable construction of section 5136 of the-Statutes, and a violation of the plain principles of. the law of agency, to hold that <em>Lazear Brothers </em>could get from the Bank the money for their own note, less the discount, and then he permitted to refuse payment of it, because their agent in the matter did not disclose his principal, and the Bank, therefore, although it believed, yet did not positively know, that the money was obtained for them when it took the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-7\">2. The words of the Statute, \u201cby discounting and negotiating promissory notes,\u201d do not necessarily mean discounting only for a party to the note, hut may reasonably include discounting for any holder of such paper. But if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>this he not so, and there he no express authority to <em>buy </em>promissory notes, as part of the general business of hanking, yet it would seem to be clear, that as a power necessarily incidental to that business, which includes the receipt of deposits, the National Banks have the right, when the regular business of banking leaves a surplus of money on hand unemployed, instead of .letting that surplus lie idle, to invest it temporarily in promissory notes, if such investment shall be deemed advisable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">3. But even if the purchase of a promissory note is, under all circumstances, in contravention, of section 5136 of the Statutes, the note is not thereby made void, and the right of recovery upon it defeated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">In construing these general public Statutes, the rule is to look for the intention of Congress, and to give such construction as will best carry that intention into effect. Now, the National Banks are agencies and instrumentalities of the United States Government; they hold its bonds; they obtain from it notes for their circulation, &amp;c.; and the Government, as well as the public, has an interest in their soundness and stability. The Statute is an invitation to those who have capital, to subscribe as stockholders, and create these institutions, and it aims to promote and protect the interests of the Government, the public, and the stockholders. In view of this, it is not possible to suppose that Congress intended that the purchase of a note by a Bank should make the note void and defeat recovery upon it. Such a construction would indict a direct loss and injury upon the stockholders and the Bank, and, to that extent, injuriously affect the soundness of the Bank, and the interests of the Government and the public therein ; and would promote and protect the interest of no one, except the debtor, who seeks to avoid payment of an honest debt. If Congress had intended to visit the Banks with such a penalty, it would have said so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-7\">It may be added that the money having been, given for the note by the Bank, the contract was an executed one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>and the Bank would, therefore, be entitled to recover. <em>Gold Mining Co. vs. Nat.

If it is, then the fourteenth prayer of the defendant was properly rejected. It may he observed that the last clause in the prayer, in reference to interest, was inserted with the view of putting the prayer in a form that would leave no question for controversy, and not because the counsel for the plaintiff were of the opinion that the law required them to make that concession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">At the trial of the cause, it was expressly proved by Mr. Taylor, the President of the Union Bank, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>notes offered in evidence were discounted on the faith of the guaranty, and there was no evidence to the contrary. The fourteenth prayer of the defendant was, therefore, upon this ground, properly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">The paper sued upon in this case was not a letter of credit or an offer to guaranty, but was, by its terms and upon its face, an absolute guaranty. It had been accepted by the Bank. This was so found by the jury, to whom the question of acceptance was submitted by the prayer, (perhaps unnecessarily,) and, in fact, was not denied by the defendant, who paid that portion of the claim against him, which fell within the guaranty as he construed it. The contract between the parties was thus complete. \"What are its terms? It guarantees <em>\u201call liabilities to said Bank, of Lazear Brothers,\u201d </em>to the extent of $25,000, and goes on to say, <em>\u201c </em>I hereby holding myself liable to the Bank to that extent, <em>for all paper that may he held hy the Bank, of Lazear Bros., either as drawers or endorsers,\u201d &amp;c. </em>Obviously, this is a general guaranty, limited only in amount. It is not of liabilities incurred or paper acquired in a particular way, or for a specified purpose, but of all liabilities\u2014of all paper held by the Bank. When, therefore, the Bank, having accepted the guaranty, proved that it discounted the notes offered in evidence, and was still the holder of them unpaid, it brought itself within the clear and express terms of the contract; and the guaranty attached. To require it to prove affirmatively, in order to make out its case, that each note had been discounted on the faith of the guaranty, would be to interpolate a new term into the contract, inconsistent with, and contradictory of, its express provisions: The very least effect which can be given to the language of the guaranty is to relieve the Bank from the offering of such proof. <em>Mason vs. Prichard, </em>2 <em>Camp., </em>486; 12 <em>East, </em>227; <em>Merle vs. Wells, </em>2 <em>Camp., </em>413; <em>Martin vs. Wright, </em>6 <em>Ad. &amp; Ell., N.

Every guaranty of future transactions, impliedly requests that such transactions shall take place. To guaranty to a merchant the cost of goods thereafter to be supplied by him to a third person, impliedly requests that goods shall be supplied, and if he accepts the guaranty and supplies the goods, the law presumes that he supplied them under, and in ' pursuance of, the request. The same rule applies to the case of a guaranty to a Bank of paper of a third person which may be thereafter held by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">The acceptance of the guaranty, and the performance of the act for which it calls, sufficiently prove the averment that the plaintiff confided in the promise of the guarantor. <em>Douglas vs. Reynolds, </em>7 <em>Peters, </em>126; <em>Caton vs. Shaw &amp; Tiffany, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">The guaranty in this case was a formal one, absolute on its face, and had also been accepted.

The rule is very well settled that parol evidence is not admissible to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from the terms of a written instrument. Where parties have entered into a written agreement, it is only reasonable to supj&gt;ose that they have introduced into the written instrument every reasonable and material term and circumstance; and, consequently, all parol testimony of conversations made by either of them, whether before or after, or at the time of the completion of the contract, will be rejected. 2 <em>Taylor\u2019s Ev., sec. </em>1035; 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. </em>275; <em>McElderry vs. Shipley, </em>2 <em>Md., </em>25. All oral negotiations or stipulations between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the parties, preceding or accompanying the execution of a written instrument, are regarded as merged in it, and the written instrument is treated as the exclusive medium of ascertaining the agreement of the parties to it. <em>Bladen, vs. Wells, </em>30 <em>Md., </em>581. This rule should be more rigidly enforced in a case like the one now under consideration, where the Statute of Frauds requires the contract to be in writing to make it valid. Where that Statute requires the contract to be in writing, it cannot be partly in writing and partly in parol. <em>Frank vs. Miller, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>460; <em>Moale vs. Buchanan, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>322.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">But it was contended by the counsel of the appellant, that the parol evidence, offered in this case and rejected by the Superior Court, was admissible for the purpose of raising and explaining a latent ambiguity in the guaranty; that is, that there was more than one class of paper, held by the Bank, to which the contract of guaranty might be applied, and that the parol evidence was admissible to show that the parties intended it to apply to and cover only such paper as should be discounted by the Bank <em>for the benefit </em>of Lazear Brothers. Such evidence would have been a palpable contradiction of the plain language of the guaranty, for by its very terms it covers all liabilities of said Lazear Brothers existing at the date of the execution of the contract, or. which might thereafter arise, to the extent of twenty-five thousand dollars, and, to that extent <em>all </em>paper that might be held by the Bank upon which Lazear Brothers were either drawers or indorsers. There is no obscurity or ambiguity in the language employed, nor any uncertainty as to the subject-matter upon which the contract was intended to operate. The guaranty in plain and express language is made to apply to <em>all paper, </em>either drawn or endorsed by Lazear Brothers and held by the Bank, without any distinction as to whether it was discounted for the benefit of themselves or some other party. In other words, the evidence which was objected to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ruled out, could have had no other effect than to limit and restrict the terms of the guaranty, and to show that the language used in it did not mean what it clearly and plainly expressed. The admission of such parol evidence would he a violation of the rule, to which we have adverted, and, therefore, there was no error in refusing its admission for the purpose for which it was offered, or in rejecting the appellant\u2019s prayers numbered one, one-and-a-half, and four.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It was contended, that the guaranty is void, because usurious interest was demanded and received hy the Bank upon the notes now held hy it, and the non-payment of which is the foundation of this suit. The United States Banking Law authorizes Banks, organized under its provisions, to receive the same rate of interest that is allowed hy the laws of the States in which such institutions are located, and no more, and provides that, if more is demanded and received, the whole interest shall he forfeited or that twice the amount of interest so paid may he recovered hy the person paying it, or his legal representatives, provided suit for that purpose he brought within two years from the date of the usurious transaction. See ch. 3, secs. 5197 and 5198 U. S. Revised Statutes. There is no provision, however, declaring an usurious contract void. While, as a general rule, contracts, which are in violation of the common or statute law, are void, yet this rule does not apply to cases like the present. In most of the States there are laws regulating the rate of interest, and yet we have been referred to no case, and have found none, in which a contract has been declared void, hy reason of the fact, that a greater interest than that allowed hy law, has been received under it, unless the law itself has provided, that the taking of illegal interest shall render the contract void. This Court, in the case of <em>Lester vs. The Howard </em>Bank, enforced the contract, notwithstanding the Bank had made the loan to Purvis, its President, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>violation of the terms of its charter, and in that case this Court said, \u201c cases are to he found, arising under contracts made in violation of a statute, in the application to which of the general rule, Courts have been governed by the plain and obvious purposes of the law; and, in such, it has been repeatedly held, that an action would lie against a party receiving money under such a contract, upon a promise implied by law to refund it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In the case of <em>Fleckner vs. U. S. Bank, </em>8 <em>Wheat., </em>355, Mr. Justice Stoey, in delivering the opinion of the Court, says: \u201cThe taking of interest by the Bank beyond the sum authorized by the charter, would, doubtless, be a violation of its charter, for which a remedy might be applied by the Government; but as the Act of Congress does not declare, that it shall avoid the contract, it is not perceived how the original defendant could avail himself of this ground to defeat a recovery.\u201d See also <em>Bandel vs. Isaac, </em>13 <em>Md., </em>224, to same effeet.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">We think it very clear, that the demand and receipt by the Bank of usurious interest upon the notes, offered in evidence, does not avoid the contract between the appellant and the appellee. There was therefore no error in the refusal to grant the third, fifth, fifth and a half, eighth, ninth and tenth prayers of the appellant, nor in refusing his motion to withdraw from the jury the notes which had been offered in evidence subject to exception. But it was also contended, that the usurious interest, received by the Bank upon the discount of paper, upon which Lazear Brothers were drawers or endorsers, should be recouped or set off against the amount of the notes offered in evidence. It must be borne in mind, that none of the paper of Lazear Brothers discounted by the Bank, was discounted for the benefit of the appellant, and that none of the usurious interest, taken by the Bank, was paid by him. 'It was paid by Lazear Brothers and Schurtz <em>&amp; </em>Co., and they, and not the appellant, have been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>sufferers by tbe exaction of illegal interest. If tbe notes had been discounted at the rate of interest prescribed by law, the appellant would have been in no better situation than he is now, for, if bound at all, he would have been liable for the amount of the notes, with legal interest thereon from the date of their maturity to the time of the trial of the case. But it has been frequently held that no one, except the party, who has paid it, can recover the usurious interest paid. <em>Smith vs. Exchange Bank of Pittsburg, </em>26 <em>Ohio State Peps., </em>152; <em>Scott vs. Leary, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>395; and <em>Hough vs. Horsey, </em>36 <em>Md., </em>184. It will be found too that sec. 5198 of the Banking Act, gives the remedy in such cases to the party, who has paid the usurious interest, and to his legal representatives, provided, they bring suit to recover it back within two years from the date of the usurious transaction. It was optional with the parties, who paid it to the appellee, to institute proceedings for that purpose or not, and they have not thought proper to do so within that time and they are, therefore, now without remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The Superior Court of Baltimore City was, therefore right in excluding from the consideration of the jury the statement, of the interest paid, as' set out in the third exception, and in rejecting the appellant\u2019s twelfth prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The appellant\u2019s seventh prayer is based upon the theory, that the note of Lazear Brothers for five thousand dollars, dated June 22nd, 1872, which was obtained by the appellee from Winchester &amp; Son, note and bill brokers, was not <em>discounted </em>but purchased; that such purchase was not authorized by the Banking Act, and, consequently, that the appellee obtained no title to the note, and was not entitled to recover upon it. Sub-sec. seven of the Act enumerates the powers which are conferred upon institutions, organized under the law, and provides that such institutions \u201cshall have, all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking; by dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>counting and negotiating promissory notes,- drafts, bills of exchange and other evidences of debt; by receiving deposits; by <em>buying and selling exchange, coin </em>and bullion; by loaning money on personal security; and by obtaining, issuing and circulating notes according to the provisions of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">A corporation has no other powers than such as are specifically granted, or such as are necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the powers expressly granted. This rule of law is so well settled that we need refer to no other case than that of <em>Weckler vs. First National </em>Bank, 42 <em>Md., </em>591. The only power to <em>buy </em>and <em>sell, </em>with which National Banks are clothed, is the authority given by chap. 1, sec. 5131, sub-secs. 1, 2, 3 and 4, to purchase real estate for the special purposes and under-the circumstances therein stated. The Act plainly shows that it was the intention of Congress to so limit and restrict National Banks, as to prevent them from exacting and receiving a greater rate of interest than is authorized by the laws of the States, within which such institutions may be respectively located, and to prohibit them from becoming buyers and sellers of promissory notes. The evidence shows that Winchester and Son, note and bill brokers, were employed by Lazear Brothers to sell the note of June 22, 1812, to any purchasers willing to buy, and that it was sold to the appellee, over the counter of its banking house, at nine per cent, discount, for Lazear Brothers, the drawers, who received the proceeds of sale. None of the Bank officers were informed that the Winchesters were acting for Lazear Brothers, nor were the latter told to whom the note had been sold. The note was sold to the Bank on the eighth day of July, 1812. The President of the Bank testified that the note in question was purchased by order of the Board of Directors, and that he had an impression, he believed, that Lazear Brothers were to get the proceeds of it. He further proved that, after the cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tomers of the Bank were served, it sometimes invested its surplus proceeds in notes. We are of opinion that this transaction was an out and out purchase by the Bank, and that such purchase was without authority, and that the Bank acquired no title to the note and cannot recover thereon in this suit. While we do not mean that a Rational Bank may not invest its surplus <em>capital </em>in notes, we are of opinion that it has no authority to use such surplus funds, as may remain on hand from day to day, for the purpose of buying notes. <em>National Bank of Rochester vs. Pearson, Thompson's Bank Cases, </em>637; <em>Farmers and Mechanics\u2019 Bank vs. Baldwin, </em>23 <em>Minnesota, </em>198. If any other construction were given to such a transaction as this, the intention of Congress to prohibit Rational Banks from buying and selling notes would be entirely defeated, and those institutions would be at perfect liberty to decline making discounts for their customers, and after-wards to buy up the very paper, which had been offered for discount and refused, at such price as the Bank might choose to give. The note of the 22nd June, 1872, for five thousand dollars was acquired by the appellee by <em>purchase </em>without authority to make such purchase, and it is not, therefore, entitled to the note and cannot recover upon it, and the appellant\u2019s seventh prayer ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The guaranty of the appellant is shown to have been executed by him and accepted by the appellee, and the subsequent discounting of paper, of which Lazear Brothers were drawers, or which they had endorsed, furnishes <em>prima facie </em>evidence that such discounts were made upon the faith of the guaranty. But such <em>prima facie </em>evidence may be rebutted by other proof offered by the guarantor, or by facts and circumstances put in evidence by the appellee. Whether the money was parted with by the appellee on the faith of the guaranty or 'otherwise, is a question exclusively for the determination of the jury, and there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>some facts and circumstances appearing in the evidence, as contained in the record, which, should \u25a0 have been submitted to the consideration of the jury, whose duty it is to determine to what weight, if any, they are entitled. We are of opinion, therefore, that there was error in rejecting the appellant\u2019s fourteenth prayer. It follows from what we have said that there was also error in granting the appellee\u2019s modified prayer, because it permitted the jury to find for the appellee the amount of the five thousand dollar note, after deducting the usurious interest received upon it, and also because it took from the jury the question whether the money obtained from the appellee had been loaned upon the faith of the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The sixth and thirteenth prayers of the appellant were waived, or abandoned at the argument of the case, and we need not refer to them further than to say, that we think there was no error in rejecting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">As there was error in rejecting the seventh and fourteenth prayers of the appellant, and in granting the modified prayer of the appellee, the judgment appealed from will be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\n<em>neiu trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">(Decided 19th June, 1879.)</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b154-10\">Alvey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A05\">delivered the following dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">I cannot agree with the majority of the Court in their conclusion as to the want of power in the Bank to acquire title to the note of $5000, obtained from Winchester <em>&amp; </em>Son. . That note was made and endorsed by Lazear Brothers, and was negotiated by Winchester &amp; Son as agents of the makers, long before the note matured. Whether the Bank knew at the time of the negotiation that the money advanced upon the note was for the makers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>and endorsers of the paper, is a question, I think, quite immaterial. If Lazear Brothers had presented the paper in person and obtained the money upon the terms upon which the brokers obtained it, there would then have been no question as to the legality of the title acquired by the Bank; that, it is conceded, would have been a discount. But it is contended, and it is so held in the opinion of the majority of this Court, that, as the note was obtained from Winchester &amp; Son, hill brokers, without disclosure at the time from them that the money was for the benefit of the makers of the note, therefore it was a purchase of the note, as contradistinguished from a discount, and that the transaction was <em>ultra </em>vires, and consequently no title to the note was transferred to the Bank. To this proposition I cannot assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">This question, of course, depends upon the jn\u2019oper construction of certain provisions of the Rational Bank Act, under which the appellee was organized. The general purpose of its organization was \u201cfor carrying on the business of hanking.\u201d By the terms of the Rational Bank Act, <em>(U. S. Rev. St., sec. </em>5136,) the Bank is clothed with all the powers, except such as are expressly prohibited, usually given to and exercised by hanking corporations. It is expressly authorized to exercise <em>\u201c </em>all such incidental powers as shall he necessary to carry on the business of hanking; by discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, hills of exchange, and other evidences of debt; by receiving deposits ; by buying and selling exchange, coin and bullion ; by loaning money on personal security, and by obtaining, issuing and circulating notes.\u201d Besides the things thus enumerated which the Bank is in terms authorized to do, there are many other things that it may do, under the general power to carry on the business of hanking. There is no express power given, for instance, to certify checks, or to collect notes, checks, or hills of exchange, for account of customers or correspondents ; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>jet we know that such transactions constitute a large portion of the legitimate business of banking. It does not follow, therefore, that everything is prohibited that is not expressly authorized. By <em>sec. </em>5197, <em>U. S. Rev. Sts., </em>it is provided that any banking association \u201c may take, receive, reserve, and charge on any <em>loan or discount </em>made, or upon any note, bill of exchange, or other evidences of debt, interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, etc., where the Bank is located, and no more,\u201d etc. This latter provision is under the title, <em>\u201c </em>Regulation of the Banking Business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Now, without invoking the aid of any implied power possessed by the Bank, to enable it to carry on the banking business, it is expressly authorized, as we have seen, to discount and negotiate promissory notes. What, then, is the meaning of the word \u201c negotiate,\u201d according to its ordinary acceptation among business men ? According to the most approved lexicographers, its meaning is <em>\u201c </em>to transfer, to sell, to pass, <em>to procure by mutual intercourse and agreement with another, </em>to arrange for, to settle by dealing and management.\u201d Webster\u2019s <em>Die.; Worcester\u2019s Die. </em>This term would seem to be comprehensive enough for all the requirements of the case; but, by allowing the full meaning to the more exact and important term, <em>\u201c </em>discount,\u201d all doubt whatever would seem to be removed. To discount is to deduct a sum of money from the debt in consideration of its being paid before the usual or stipulated time for payment. In the case of <em>Fleckner vs. Bank U. S., </em>8 <em>Wheat., </em>350, Judge Story, in delivering the opinion of the Court, having occasion to define a discount by the Bank, said: \u201c Nothing can be clearer than that, by the language of the commercial world, and the settled practice of Banks, a discount by a Bank means, <em>ex vi termini, </em>a deduction or drawback made upon its advances or loans of money, upon negotiable paper, or other evidences of debt, payable at a future day, which are transferred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Rank. We must suppose that the Legislature used the language in this, its appropriate sense ; and if we depart from this settled construction, there is none other which can be adopted, which would not defeat the great objects for which the charter was granted, and make it, as to the stockholders, a mere mockery.\u201d Purchase may be by way of discount, equally as a loan may be made by that means. When the party receiving the proceeds of the paper discounted is himself either maker or endorser, and the discount is made on his responsibility, he receives the money as a loan, for he is bound to return it; but if he is in no way bound on the paper, he receives the money as an advance, and as a consideration for the transfer of the paper. Both transactions are, according to the established practice and usage of Banks, discounts, though the latter is in effect a purchase by the Bank. The act of discounting simply has reference to the deduction from the face amount of the paper for the time it has to run to maturity, and the rate of that deduction; but whether the transaction amounts to a loan or to a purchase on the part of the Bank, depends upon other facts and condition of things. This idea of restricting the pow.er of discounting to a transaction in which money is actually loaned upon the credit of the party passing the paper, it seems to me, is novel, and, I am sure, is contrary to the received understanding of the commercial community, and the established practice and usage of Banks. Suppose the payee of a promissory note payable to order takes it to a Bank and procures the money on it, less the rate of discount, upon endorsement without recourse; would that not be strictly a discount within the meaning of the law, notwithstanding it would not be a loan upon the responsibility of the party obtaining the money? Such a transaction would not be a loan at all, according to the correct meaning of the term; and yet if it be a discount, according to the modes and usages of banking, why should not any third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>party holding paper payable to bearer, or endorsed in blank, be able to negotiate that paper -with the Bank, by way of' discount, and transfer a good title to the Bank, notwithstanding his name might not appear upon the paper, or he incur any liability in respect to it ? I cannot, I must confess,' perceive the reason for the distinction that has been made in this case. It should he recollected that it is not. the rate of discount, with reference to which the parties deal, that determines the question of the validity of the transfer of the paper, or the title of the Bank, though the latter may have exacted and received more than the lawful rate of discount. All the business of the National Banks is done under the restrictions prescribed by the Act of Congress; and the rate of discount is expressly prescribed, among the various regulations contained in the Act for the government of the banking business ; and for taking, receiving, or charging any greater rate of interest or discount than is by the Act allowed, the Bank subjects itself to the penalties prescribed by see. 5198, <em>of the Revised' Statutes ; </em>hut the title to the paper is not thereby affected. However the transaction here involved might be characterized if it were between individuals\u2014whether it be called shaving or otherwise\u2014as a bank transaction, if the Bank exacted a greater deduction from the face value of the' paper than the law allowed, it was excessive discount, for which it incurred the penalties of the Statute; but the' transfer of the paper vested a good title in the Bank. \u25a0 And as by the opinion of the majority of the Court it is declared that the Bank acquired no title to the note in question, and is therefore not entitled to recover on it, I must respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion, though I concur in the conclusions as to the other portions of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>After the announcement of the foregoing decision, the appellee, hy its counsel, applied to the Court for a re-hearing of the question presented hy the seventh prayer of the appellant, as to the right of the appellee to recover on the note of Lazear Brothers for $5000, dated the 22nd of June, 1812. The Court, in response to this application, directed a re-argument on notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Rotes were filed on hehalf of the appellee hy <em>John N. Steele </em>and <em>I. Nevett Steele, </em>and on hehalf of the appellant by <em>T. Alex. Seth, R. Stockett Mathews </em>and <em>S. Teackle Wallis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Bartol, C. J. and Bowie, Brent, G-rason, Miller, Alvey and Irvins, J., participated in the decision on the re-argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Grason, J., delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">This case was argued and decided hy this Court at the April term, 1819, and is now before us again upon a re-argument granted upon the motion of the appellee. The re-argument- was asked only upon the appellant\u2019s seventh prayer, which was based upon the theory that the note of Lazear Brothers for five thousand dollars, dated June 22nd, 1812, which was obtained hy the appellee from Winchester &amp; Son, note and bill brokers, was not <em>discounted </em>hut pm,rchased; that such purchase was not authorized hy the Banking Act, and, consequently, that the appellee acquired no title to the note, and could not recover upon it. This question was most thoroughly and ably discussed hy the counsel of the respective parties, arid after a very careful consideration of the case, it was held that the appellee acquired the note in question hy <em>purchase, </em>and not by <em>discount, </em>that such purchase was not authorized hy the Banking Act, and that the appellee acquired no title to the note and could not recover upon it. This question has again been very fully argued upon notes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>filed by the counsel of the respective parties, and has again been carefully considered, and a&gt; majority of the Court concur in the opinion, heretofore filed in the case, and in the conclusions therein reached.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b160-8\">(Decided 1st July, 1880.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The judgment appealed from, will, therefore, he reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>and</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\n<em>neio trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Note.\u2014The Reporter is requested to state, that Chief Judge Bartol, who concurred in the opinion of the majority first rendered, entertaining doubts as to the correctness of the decision upon the question presented by the appellant\u2019s <em>seventh prayer, </em>requested a re-argument of that question; and upon the final disposition of the case after the re-argument, concurred in the views expressed by Judge Alvisy in his dissenting opinion.
