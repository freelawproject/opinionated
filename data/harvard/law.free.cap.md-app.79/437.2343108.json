Dr. Hooper discharged the firm in 1981. Soon thereafter, Gill &amp; Sippel claimed that $5,400.00 was owing in unpaid legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">According to Dr. Hooper, Gill threatened that he would take certain actions if the outstanding portion of the bill was not paid. Dr. Hooper alleged that Gill claimed that he would inform the Attorney General\u2019s Office that a witness their office had previously interviewed lied during questioning, and that, if questioned further, the witness could aid the State in the criminal prosecution of Dr. Hooper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, Gill &amp; Sippel sued Dr. Hooper for the additional attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted Gill &amp; Sippel\u2019s motion for judgment in the full amount, and Dr. Hooper appealed. A settlement was reached while the appeal was pending,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in consideration of which the firm obtained a General Mutual Release from Dr. Hooper of all claims and causes of action known and unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The medicaid fraud case against Dr. Hooper was dismissed because the State could not prove a <em>prima facie </em>case. Thereafter, Dr. Hooper unsuccessfully sued the then Attorney General of Maryland and others. During dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>covery proceedings in that particular case, a memorandum was found indicating that Gill had carried out his threat to relay information to the prosecutor. According to the memorandum, the prosecutor was prompted by Gill\u2019s revelation to re-interview the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">As a result of what he learned during discovery, Dr. Hooper filed the instant action against Gill, et al., in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Messitte, J.), alleging tortious and contractual breach of fiduciary duties, a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and fraud. Dr. Hooper also sought an equitable opening of the judgment in the already settled attorney\u2019s fee suit. Judge Messitte granted Gill\u2019s Motion For Judgment as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims, entered summary judgment in favor of Gill on both the fraud and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 allegations, and further granted Gill\u2019s motion to strike the claim seeking an equitable opening of the satisfied judgment. Aggrieved by the actions of the circuit court, Dr. Hooper has journeyed here where he raises four issues; namely, whether the trial judge erred in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">(1) excluding the expert testimony of Abraham Dash and in turn granting Gill\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the tortious and contractual breach of fiduciary duty counts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">(2) granting summary judgment in favor of Gill on the fraud claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">(3) refusing to open and re-litigate the judgment in the fee suit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">(4) granting Summary Judgment in favor of Gill on the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">The allegations involving tortious and contractual breach of fiduciary duty focus on alleged legal malpractice. In order to establish a cause of action against an attorney for legal malpractice, a plaintiff must prove: \u201c(1) the attorney\u2019s employment; (2) his neglect of a reasonable duty; and (3) loss to the client proximately caused by that neglect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>duty.\u201d <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 128, 492 A.2d 618 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Expert testimony is necessary in a legal malpractice case to establish the existence of a breach of a reasonable legal duty, except in that class of cases \u201cwhere the common knowledge or experience of laymen is extensive enough to recognize or infer negligence from the facts.\u201d <em>Central Cab Co. v. Clarke, </em>259 Md. 542, 551, 270 A.2d 662 (1970); <em>Fishow v. Simpson, </em>55 Md.App. 312, 318-319, 462 A.2d 540 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Dr. Hooper sought to introduce the expert testimony of Professor Abraham Dash in an attempt to establish Gill\u2019s tortious and contractual breach of fiduciary duty. Professor Dash advised the court that he was not qualified to testify as an expert as to whether Gill\u2019s disclosure to the Assistant Attorney General was a breach of the civil standard of care for an attorney. Dash stated that his expertise was limited to the attorneys\u2019 Code of Professional Responsibility. Nevertheless, Dr. Hooper\u2019s counsel claimed that he was going to rely on Dash\u2019s testimony to establish causes of action for breach of contract and tortious breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Judge Messitte precluded Dash\u2019s testimony and granted Gill\u2019s Motion For Judgment. The court reasoned that Dr. Hooper was required to establish, through expert testimony, that Gill\u2019s action was a breach of fiduciary duty as a matter of law and not merely a breach of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Dr. Hooper contends that the trial judge erred in making that determination. He asserts that the Code of Professional Responsibility provisions pertaining to an attorney\u2019s fiduciary duty simply codify the common law. On that premise Dr. Hooper argues that expert testimony was not required, and that Gill was liable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Maryland Rule 1230 currently contains a statement that the Rules of Professional Conduct do \u201cnot give rise to a cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No similar provision was embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility in effect in 1981. <em>See </em>then Md.Rule 1230; Appendix F.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Maryland appellate courts do not appear to have previously decided whether an attorney\u2019s violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility gives rise to a civil cause of action for damages. Decisions from other jurisdictions, however, are instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">There appear to be at least three ways that courts have disposed of suits brought against attorneys for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">1. <em>The General Rule </em>\u2014 No <em>Cause of action. </em>This method holds that violation of the Code does not give rise to a civil cause of action. It has been adopted by the overwhelming majority of courts. <em>See Noble v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>33 Cal.App.3d 654, 109 Cal.Rptr. 269 (1973); <em>Bickel v. Mackie, </em>447 F.Supp. 1376 (N.D.Iowa 1978); <em>Brody v. Ruby, </em>267 N.W.2d 902 (Iowa 1978); <em>Hill v. Willmott, </em>561 S.W.2d 331 (Ky.App.1978); <em>Drago v. Buonaguria, </em>46 N.Y.2d 778, 413 N.Y.S.2d 910, 386 N.E.2d 821 (1978); <em>Bud Godfrey Pontiac, Inc. v. Roloff </em>291 Or. 318, 630 P.2d 840 (1981); <em>Martin v. Trevino, </em>578 S.W.2d 763 (Tex.Civ.App.1978); <em>Ayyildiz v. Kidd, </em>220 Va. 1080, 266 S.E.2d 108 (1980). The basis for this rule, as stated by the Supreme Court of Oregon in <em>Bud Godfrey Pontiac, Inc., </em>630 P.2d at 848, is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u201c(a) The statute or Code of Professional Responsibility was not intended to create a private cause of action. On the contrary, the sole intended remedy for a violation of such a statute or code is the imposition of discipline by disbarment, suspension or reprimand of the offending attorney. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Trevino, supra, </em>at 770; <em>Bickel v. Mackie, supra, </em>at 1383; <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. Elgin Coal, Inc., </em>[358 F.Supp. 17 (E.D. Tenn.1972)] at 22; <em>Hill v. Willmott, supra, </em>at 333-34, and <em>Noble v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>109 Cal.Rptr. at 271-72. <em>See also Brody v. Ruby, </em>... at 907-08; <em>Spencer v. Burglass, ... </em>[337 So.2d 596 (La.App.1976) ] at 600-01, and <em>Tingle v. Arnold, Cate &amp; Allen, ... </em>[129 Ga.App. 134], 199 S.E.2d [260] at 263.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(b) Other remedies, such as malicious prosecution, adequately protect the public from harassment or abuse by unprofessional lawyers. <em>See, e.g., Nelson v. Miller, ... </em>[227 Kan. 271], 607 P.2d [438] at 451, and <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. Elgin Coal, Inc., </em>... at 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">(c) To expose attorneys to actions for damages for breach of ethical duties imposed by such statutes and codes would be contrary to the \u2018obvious public interest\u2019 in affording every citizen \u2018the utmost freedom of access to the courts.\u2019 <em>See, e.g., Lyddon v. Shaw, </em>... [56 Ill.App.3d 815], 14 Ill.Dec. [489] at 494, 372 N.E.2d [685] at 690, and <em>Hill v. Willmott, supra, </em>at 334. <em>See also Brody v. Ruby, supra, </em>at 907.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">2. <em>The Michigan Rule </em>\u2014 Violation <em>Rebuttable Evidence of Malpractice. </em>This particular method holds that violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility constitutes rebut-table evidence of malpractice. Michigan seems to be the only State that has adopted that manner of dealing with suits brought against attorneys for violations of the Code. <em>Lipton v. Boesky, </em>110 Mich.App. 589, 313 N.W.2d 163 (1981). <em>See also Sawabini v. Desenberg, </em>143 Mich.App. 373, 372 N.W.2d 559 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">3. <em>The Massachusetts Rule </em>\u2014 Violation <em>No Cause of Action But Evidence of Negligence. </em>This resolution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>problem was espoused by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Fishman v. Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 487 N.E.2d 1377, 1381 (1986). Insofar as we have been able to determine, Massachusetts is the sole advocate of this particular treatment of civil actions against attorneys for Code violations. The court likened a violation of a Code provision to the violation of a statute, <em>i.e., </em>liquor law, workers\u2019 compensation, and building codes. 487 N.E.2d at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Although we have, via <em>dicta, </em>articulated the threefold methods by which courts have thus far dealt with civil suits based on violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility, we need not and do not decide what course Maryland will steer in these controversies. Our reason for declining to answer the specific question is that the issue is simply not viable because Dr. Hooper failed to prove any damages. His allegations, if true, fit squarely within the ambit of the Latin phrase: <em>injuria absque damno </em>(injury or wrong without damage).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The facts show that at the time Gill spoke with the Assistant Attorney General relative to the witness\u2019s allegedly incomplete statement an indictment had already been returned against Dr. Hooper. Thus, the information supplied by Gill did not contribute to the obtaining of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The errant witness, although apparently re-interviewed, was not called to testify at the trial of Dr. Hooper on the medicaid fraud indictment. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that whatever information the State may have learned as a result of the re-interview of the witness did not contribute to the State\u2019s case against the doctor. Even if it did, there nevertheless remains the one overriding factor in our analysis \u2014 the singular fact that Dr. Hooper was acquitted of the medicaid fraud charge. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">As this case reaches us, it is apparent from the record that no damage to Dr. Hooper was proven to have occurred as the result of Gill\u2019s alleged breach of confidentiality. Since there were no damages, there can be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>There is, of course, the claim to be made that, even though actual damages were not shown, the doctor is nevertheless entitled to nominal damages as a result of the breach of confidence. We turn that contention aside because the amount recoverable, if actionable, is absolutely <em>de minimis </em>in view of the costs in judicial time of retrial on the sole issue of nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Dr. Hooper next contends that he was entitled to a return of the money he paid in settlement of the attorney fee suit because Gill fraudulently obtained the General Mutual Release. In the circuit court Dr. Hooper argued that the alleged breach of duty would have been a defense to Gill\u2019s suit for the fee. Judge Messitte disagreed. Since the disclosure by Gill did not cause any damage to Dr. Hooper, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling. Proof of compensatory damage directly resulting from an act is a necessary element of a cause of action grounded in fraud. <em>Schwartzbeck v. Loving Chevrolet, </em>27 Md.App. 139, 339 A.2d 700 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Dr. Hooper also avers that Gill\u2019s failure to disclose his communication to the prosecutor concerning the allegedly evasive witness constituted fraud and invalidated the release that was signed in the settlement of the fee dispute litigation. Judge Messitte, however, did not decide the issue, and we do not because it is not properly before us. Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Judge Messitte ruled that, in order to prevail on the fraud count, Dr. Hooper needed to establish that: (a) he would not have settled the fee suit and executed the General Release if he had known of Gill\u2019s revelation to the prosecutor, and (b) he would have prevailed on appeal of the fee suit to this Court based solely on the record. The circuit court held that Dr. Hooper would not have prevailed on his appeal based solely on the record and, therefore, entered summary judgment in favor of Gill. We cannot say that Judge Messitte was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">To reopen the satisfied judgment in the fee case, Dr. Hooper filed a petition for a Writ of Error <em>Coram </em>Nobis<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. The petition was denied. This Court in <em>Hooper v. Gill &amp; Sippel, </em>Per Curiam, No. 474, Sept. Term, 1988, filed December 8, 1988, affirmed the denial of writ on the ground that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion since the relief sought in the petition/motion was identical to the relief requested in this case. There, we observed that during oral argument Dr. Hooper\u2019s counsel conceded that, for purposes of that case, there was no difference between Md. Rule 2-535(b) and the Writ of Error <em>Coram Nobis. </em>Rule 2-535(b) provides: \u201c(b) <em>Fraud, Mistake, Irregularity. </em>\u2014 On motion of any party filed at any time, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that fraud did occur, it most certainly took place after Dr. Hooper had discharged Gill and the latter\u2019s legal services were terminated. Gill was entitled to be paid compensation. The post-professional services fraud would not be a defense to a suit for the fees. Judge Messitte did not err in denying the doctor\u2019s petition for a Writ of Error <em>Coram Nobis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYn\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">In its pretrial rulings the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Gill on Dr. Hooper\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. The court found that Dr. Hooper did not establish that Gill acted in concert with the Attorney General\u2019s Office. Hence, Gill could not have acted \u201cunder color of state law\u201d since he held no State office. Because he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>not act \u201cunder color of state law,\u201d there can be no recovery under the federal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">. Gill disputes that the conversation occurred, although through counsel he admitted that he did in fact disclose information to an Assistant Attorney General. According to what we were told on oral argument. Gill possessed for \"several months\" the knowledge of the witness\u2019s allegedly incomplete statement. Disclosure apparently came only after Dr. Hooper refused to pay the additional $5,400.00 although Gill denied that nonpayment motivated his revealing the matter to the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">. The action was instituted in the District Court of Maryland for Montgomery County but removed to the circuit court pursuant to Dr. Hooper\u2019s jury trial demand. Although appellees originally sought $5,000, the jurisdictional limit of the District Court, upon the removal of the case to the circuit court, they amended their claim to $5,400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\">. We were informed that the matter was settled for $4,400.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. In light of our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to determine whether expert testimony is required concerning an ethical violation. <em>But see Fishman v. Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 487 N.E.2d 1377, 1381-82 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\">.
