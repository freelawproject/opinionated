BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">Lawrence Leggett, Jr., appellant, was convicted, following a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, of first degree murder and wearing and carrying a dangerous and deadly weapon. He was sentenced, for the murder conviction, to life imprisonment without benefit of parole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>pursuant to Maryland Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 643B <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to a concurrent three year sentence for the weapon\u2019s charge. He has appealed those judgments, presenting two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">1. Did the trial court erroneously limit appellant\u2019s cross-examination by prohibiting questioning on submission of appellant\u2019s blood sample for DMA questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">2. Did the trial court err in sentencing appellant to a term of life imprisonment without parole pursuant to Maryland Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">v 1</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Prior to trial, the State obtained a court order permitting the DMA testing of appellant\u2019s blood to determine if it matched semen samples obtained from the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although two continuances were obtained pending the test results, when the results were finally received, they were inconclusive. The State, therefore, decided not to adduce evidence concerning the test and moved, <em>in limine, </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>prohibit the defense from doing so on cross-examination. Concluding that a Frye-Reed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> analysis to establish the general acceptance in the scientific community of evidence of DNA testing is prerequisite to the admission of such evidence, the trial judge granted the motion <em>in limine. </em>This was done over appellant\u2019s objection. Appellant urged that the grant of the motion would unduly restrict his cross-examination. He also contended that, in any event, the <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis is inappropriate when all that is sought to be elicited is the fact that tests were conducted by the State and that those tests then were not used by the State.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He relied upon <em>Eley v. State, </em>288 Md. 548, 419 A.2d 384 (1980) and <em>Spell v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 323, 431 A.2d 752 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">He-makes the same arguments on appeal. He fares no better here than he did below.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The State did not contend that the victim had been forceably raped or that it was the fact that appellant and the victim had engaged in sexual relations that ultimately led to the victim\u2019s death. Thus, the only relevance of the DNA testing would have been to establish whether appellant had contact with the victim, through sexual relations, within a short time of the victim\u2019s death. Such evidence, even if proved, would not prove the further fact that appellant killed the victim. Conversely, the evidence that it was someone other than appellant who engaged in sexual relations with the victim would not tend to prove that appellant did not kill the victim. Thus, it appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>DNA testing results, even had they been conclusive, though relevant, would have been largely immaterial in this case. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 643, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Under the circumstances, neither <em>Eley/Spell, </em>nor the fact that appellant is not seeking to introduce expert testimony based upon DNA testing, can assist appellant. The Court of Appeals made clear in <em>Eley </em>that the defense could urge, through argument, that the jury draw an adverse inference from the State\u2019s failure to produce certain evidence \u201cwhere there is <em>unexplained </em>silence concerning a routine and reliable method of identification especially in a case where the identification testimony is at least subject to some question\u201d. (Emphasis in original) 288 Md. at 555, 419 A.2d 384. Thus, a prerequisite to such an argument would appear to be that the test or method be \u201croutine and reliable\u201d. In this case, not only is the DNA testing not a material \u201cmethod of identification\u201d because it would not prove or disprove criminal agency, but there is nothing in the record to suggest that DNA testing is \u201creliable\u201d. It is certainly not \u201croutine\u201d. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in excluding the argument sought to be made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Appellant contends that he is entitled to a remand for resentencing because the trial court failed to exercise its discretion, pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c), to impose a sentence other than life without parole. He submits that the trial court declined to impose an alternative sentence because it believed that it had no authority to do so. He argues, therefore, that he was illegally sentenced. More particularly, his argument is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">[he] was not sentenced under either \u00a7 643B(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u00a7 412(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, either of which would clearly mandate life without parole. He did not fit the requirements for application of the former section and the State failed to provide proper notice for application of the latter. Under \u00a7 643B(c), appellant could have been sentenced to a term allowed by law, life no portions suspended with the first 25 years of the sentence to be served without parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1t\">He relies upon <em>Williamson v. State, </em>284 Md. 212, 395 A.2d 496 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">When presented with this argument, the trial court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">The only exception contained in (c) is that in accordance with the provisions of art. 31B, \u00a7 11 which deals with release from Patuxent Institution, no part of the sentence may be suspended nor shall the person be eligible for parole. I am satisfied that that sentence or that proviso indicates to this Court that it refers to the sentence to be imposed in this case. The sentence is life imprisonment and my reading is that except for release from Patuxent Institution under \u00a7 11 of art. 31B, that the defendant shall not be eligible for parole for that life sentence. In this case, given that interpretation or that construction of the provision, it is the judgment of Court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>defendant in this case be sentenced to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction for the balance of his natural life and that sentence is to be without the possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is patent that the trial court did not refuse or fail to exercise discretion and further that it was correct in its interpretation of the statute. That this is so is demonstrated by reference to <em>Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 498 A.2d 666 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>308 Md. 208, 517 A.2d 1105 (1986). There, this Court was called upon to interpret \u00a7 643B(c) in the context of a first degree sexual offense conviction. The question presented was whether a defendant, convicted of that offense, and sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 643B(c) had to be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. We answered the question in the negative. Chief Judge Gilbert, writing for the Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">First degree sexual offenses are punishable by imprisonment \u201cfor no more than the period of his natural life.\u201d Maryland Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 464(b). While that section unambiguously prescribes a maximum penalty, it clearly does not require the imposition of a specific minimum punishment. It is possible, therefore, that a sentencing judge could, under \u00a7 464(b), impose an absolute minimum sentence and even suspend that. In any event, the point we stress is that \u00a7 464 contains no prescribed minimum sentence. It is precisely that type of statute that \u00a7 643B(c) was designed to meet. When \u00a7 643B(c) is applicable, the sentencing judge must impose a sentence of at least 25 years imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, and the judge may not suspend any portion of the term. Section 643B(c) prescribes a legislatively mandated <em>minimum </em>sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">We illustrate what the legislature intended \u00a7 643B(c) to accomplish. If an accused is convicted of robbery, the maximum penalty under the statute is ten years imprisonment. Maryland Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 486. Without the enactment of \u00a7 643B(c), any subsequent conviction could result, at most, in a ten year sentence. Section 643B(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>when applicable, would, assuming compliance with the prior incarceration provision, dictate a sentence of 25 years, not merely ten years. Section 643B(c) enhances the punishment meted to habitual or repeat offenders. (Emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">64 Md.App. at 662, 498 A.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The Court went on to point out that, since, in the case of first degree sexual offense, the maximum penalty that could be imposed was life imprisonment, it was within the discretion of the court to determine whether it would impose \u00a7 643B(c)\u2019s statutorily mandated minimum sentence or life imprisonment, \u00a7 464(b)\u2019s maximum sentence. The situation is far different in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In this case, \u201cthe term allowed by law\u201d is life imprisonment. Consequently, the trial court was required to sentence appellant to life imprisonment. Moreover, since \u201cneither the sentence nor any part of it may be suspended, and the person shall not be eligible for parole ... \u201d, the court could only have imposed the sentence it did. From this, it follows that the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\">.

It is unnecessary that we set out in detail the facts surrounding the murder. Suffice it to say that the victim was discovered dead on the second floor landing of the apartment house in which appellant resided and that appellant was connected to the victim by his suspicious behavior when speaking with the police; spots of blood on his face and a stain on his boots; the presence of blood in his apartment; a woman\u2019s footprint and bootprint on his rug, which was rolled back; and an item of clothing belonging to the victim which was discovered in the trash in appellant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">. <em>Frye v.
