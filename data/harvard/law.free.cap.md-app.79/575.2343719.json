Levitt, individually and trading as Levitt\u2019s Investments, brought suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Howard E. Mirsky and Richard E. Kramer, the appellant, individually and trading as Commerce Credit, a partnership, and 20-20 Ltd., a corporation in which Mirsky and Kramer were principals. Appellee alleged that during the years 1980 through 1983 the individual defendants, acting as mortgage brokers under the style of Commerce Credit or 20-20 Ltd., persuaded him to invest money in loans which they had arranged for their customers. The defendants were to collect the monthly payments from customers, deduct a charge for handling, and remit the balance to the appellee for each loan. Kramer, a member of the Maryland Bar, prepared the deeds of trust securing the loans and conducted the settlements on the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Pursuant to this arrangement, appellee funded six secured loans in the aggregate principal amount of $174,100. Mirsky and Kramer (and in one instance Mirsky alone) were named the trustees in the deeds executed by the borrowers to secure these loans. In September of 1983, Mirsky and Kramer visited the appellee and advised him that they had misappropriated certain funds which they had collected on his behalf on some of the loans. They explained their defalcation on their need for money because of business reversals and assured him that he would eventually be paid in full. Appellee subsequently learned that all six of the loans that he had funded in the aggregate principal amount of $174,100 had been repaid by the borrowers to Mirsky and Kramer who had appropriated the money to their own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In his complaint filed on November 5, 1984, appellee asserted claims for breach of contract and conversion. He sought compensatory and punitive damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mirsky failed to plead to the complaint and a default judgment was entered against him on June 3, 1985, for $116,816.68 in compensatory damages and $10,000 in punitive damages. The appellant, in answering the amended complaint, generally denied liability in addition to raising certain specific defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">A jury trial was held on May 10 and 11, 1988, before Judge J. William Hinkel. At the end of the appellee\u2019s case, Judge Hinkel granted appellee\u2019s motion for judgment as to appellant\u2019s liability. The issue of damages was sent to the jury. The jury returned verdicts of $198,539.50 in compensatory damages and $162,500.00 in punitive damages, plus interest and costs. The court entered judgments on those verdicts against appellant and 20-20 Ltd.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal ensued. Appellant poses four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">1. Whether the trial judge erred in rulings regarding the effect of Kramer\u2019s having declined pretrial discovery on Fifth Amendment grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">2. Whether the trial court erred in withdrawing the issue of liability from the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">3. Whether the trial judge erred in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">4. Whether the trial court erred in denying Kramer\u2019s motions challenging the amended complaint, the more definite statement thereof and the addendum thereto as being grossly duplicitous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Appellant responded to appellee\u2019s request for admissions pursuant to Rule 2-424(a) by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>[Appellant] objects to said Request for Admissions and to each and every matter if [sic] which an admission is therein requested because said Request for Admissions and said matters and each of them place him in a position where any response which he undertakes to make thereto may tend to incriminate him. Hence, to call upon him to respond to said Request for Admissions and said matters and each of them is to violate his constitutional rights, including those under the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Appellant filed similar responses objecting to appellee\u2019s interrogatories<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and motions to produce documents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s motion to compel this discovery over appellant\u2019s objections on grounds of self-incrimination was denied after a hearing by Judge Leonard S. Jacobson.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">At trial appellee\u2019s counsel asked that he be able to read appellee\u2019s requests for admissions to the jury as having been admitted by the appellant. He argued that since appellant neither admitted nor denied the admissions, Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>2-424(b) required that they shall be deemed admitted and conclusively established. Over appellant\u2019s objection Judge Hinkel agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">The assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination is available. And obviously Judge Jacobson did not compel a party to respond after having asserted that right. That gives the defendant in this case the protection afforded by the Consitutional [sic]. But it does not protect him from the rules of civil procedure which provide that where an admission is requested and it\u2019s neither admitted nor denied it shall be taken as admitted. He has received his constitutional protection, yet by having failed to respond they shall be deemed as admitted. And that\u2019s my ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The trial judge said further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">I am not prepared to state that he [Kramer] cannot produce any evidence, but I am prepared to rule that he cannot offer evidence that would contradict the admissions that I have just ruled upon. And I am not going to bar him from taking the stand if he wishes to take the stand and testify. But not permit him to testify contrary to the admissions that he\u2019s already .made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Appellee\u2019s counsel then proceeded to read the requests for admissions to the jury. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">Members of the jury, I am about to read the requests for admissions. And these are admitted as being true by the Defendant, Richard Kramer. You were a partner with Howard E. Mirsky, trading as Commerce Credit, a Maryland General Partnership; that\u2019s admitted. You were a principal in 20-20 Limited, a Maryland Corporation; that\u2019s admitted. You were in business as a mortgage broker and as such received commissions, fees in connection with loans; that\u2019s admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">That you held yourself out to the general public as mortgage brokers, by either advertising or soliciting investors; that you or Howard E. Mirsky solicited Michael A. Levitt as an investor; that you guaranteed personally the repayment of all loans; that you entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>contract with Michael A. Levitt and as such Levitt advanced monies to you; that you further contracted to handle legal matters in connection with the loans, you advised the Plaintiff on each transaction; you received monies for the plaintiff and were to deposit them in your escrow account; that you received full payoffs on loans mentioned in Paragraph 7 of the complaint; that you made payments to the Plaintiff on these loans until September the 19th, 1983 despite having received full payoffs; that you did not record Deeds of Trust on the Hansson, LaBerge, Thomas and Webb loans; that you received or deducted funds for transfer tax for Hansson, LaBerge, Thomas and Webb loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">That you stole, defalcated, appropriated or converted funds entrusted to you while you were a member of the Maryland Bar; that you have not repaid any of the monies\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">That you have not repaid any of the monies which you took, stole or misappropriated or defalcated; that the monies of Michael A. Levitt were used by you to purchase stocks, personal property, bonds, securities or to gamble; that you have failed to return all the monies mentioned in Paragraph 7 of the complaint; that you have deposited monies belonging to Levitt in accounts in banks in names other than your own or in accounts or numbers in foreign banks wherein you have an interest; that you co-mingled Levitt\u2019s monies or monies due Levitt with that of your own; that you failed to give Levitt an accounting of funds for which you were escrowee or trustee or for [sic] which you were holding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In addition to offering that evidence, appellee testified and called four witnesses to establish that each of the six loans in question had been fully repaid by the borrowers to appellant and Mirsky, as trustees for the appellee, and that appellant and Mirsky had appropriated those receipts. Mir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>sky was also called as a- witness by appellee but refused to answer any questions on self-incrimination grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">After resting his case, appellee moved <em>in limine </em>that appellant be prevented from calling any witnesses to testify to the transactions in issue because of his refusal to name persons possessing personal knowledge of those transactions in response to appellee\u2019s interrogatories. The only witness that appellant wished to call was his father who, he proffered, would have testified that appellant was absent from the Baltimore area from \u201cthe late summer of 1982 until July or thereabouts in 1983.\u201d His stated purpose for calling that witness was \u201cto show [appellant] wasn\u2019t around for a period of time during which many of these transactions testified to apparently were supposed to have occurred.\u201d The motion <em>in limine </em>was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Appellant argues that the trial judge erred in allowing appellee\u2019s requests for admissions to be deemed admitted and read to the jury. We agree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Though by its terms applicable only in criminal proceedings, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination has long been held to be properly asserted by parties or witnesses in civil proceedings. <em>McCarthy v. Arndstein, </em>266 U.S. 34, 40, 45 S.Ct. 16, 17, 69 L.Ed. 158 (1924). The privilege may be invoked by anyone whose statements could incriminate him, either by directly admitting the commission of illegal acts or by relating information which would \u201cfurnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant.\u201d <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486-87, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818-19, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). The privilege protects persons \u201cagainst being forced to make incriminating disclosures at any stage of the proceeding if they could not be compelled to make such disclosures as a witness at trial.\u201d <em>National Acceptance Co. of America v. Bathalter, </em>705 F.2d 924, 927 (7th Cir.1983). It therefore applies not only at trial, but at the discovery stage as well. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973); <em>United States v. Kordel, </em>397 U.S. 1, 7, 90 S.Ct. 763, 766, 25 L.Ed.2d 1 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>although at the time appellant was served with the requests for admissions, he was not under indictment or faced with a criminal prosecution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or disciplinary action,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he could reasonably fear that the information gained from his admissions might furnish a basis for such charges. Judge Jacobson denied appellee\u2019s motion to compel discovery thereby acknowledging appellant\u2019s right to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At trial, however, Judge Hinkel interpreted appellant\u2019s assertion of his privilege as noncompliance with Rule 2-424(b) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request or within 15 days after the date on which that party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is required, whichever is later, the party to whom the request is directed files a response signed by the party or the party\u2019s attorney. As to each matter of which an admission is requested, <em>the response shall specify an objection, or shall admit or deny the matter, </em>or shall set forth in detail the reason why the respondent cannot truthfully admit or deny it. <em>The reasons for any objection shall be stated. </em>A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and deny or qualify the remainder. A respondent may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless the respondent states that after reasonable inquiry the information known or readily obtainable by the respondent is insufficient to enable the respondent to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission is requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request but the party may, subject to the provisions of section (e) of this Rule, deny the matter or set forth reasons for not being able to admit or deny it. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The trial judge ruled that since appellant did not admit or deny the requests for admissions presented by appellee, those statements were deemed admitted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Rule 2-424(b) clearly states that in responding to a request for admissions, a party must specify an objection, admit or deny the matter. Appellant did in fact comply with this directive. Specifically, appellant <em>objected </em>to the requests for admissions and asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege as the <em>reason </em>for his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Furthermore, \u201cthe Fifth Amendment protection against compelled self-incrimination would be meaningless and hoi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>low if the objective sought through the asking of the question could be achieved as well by a refusal to answer as by the answer itself.\u201d <em>Mayo v. Ford, </em>184 A.2d 38, 40 (D.C.Mun.App.1962), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>191 A.2d 603 (D.C.App.1963). Thus, appellant\u2019s objection and refusal to respond to the requests for admissions could not be considered evidence of the truth of the matters stated therein. <em>Id. </em>The issue then becomes: what effect does appellant\u2019s claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege have on the subsequent litigation of the civil case against him?</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976), the Supreme Court addressed the question of whether a prison inmate\u2019s refusal to testify at a prison disciplinary hearing could be used against him. The Court held that a disciplinary hearing is a civil action and that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them: the Amendment \u2018does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a <em>party to a civil cause.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 318, 96 S.Ct. at 1558, <em>quoting, </em>8 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2272(e), p. 439 (McNaughton rev. 1961) (Emphasis in original). The Court, however, noted that an \u201cinmate\u2019s silence in and of itself is insufficient to support an adverse decision by the Disciplinary Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 96 S.Ct. at 1557. Although Justice Brennan dissented from the majority opinion in <em>Baxter, </em>he agreed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">In a civil suit involving only private parties, no party brings to the battle the awesome powers of the government, and therefore to permit an adverse inference to be drawn from exercise of the privilege does not implicate the policy considerations underlying the privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In evaluating <em>Baxter, </em>one commentator writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">Hence, the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Baxter </em>establish that an invoking in a civil case may constitutionally lead to an adverse inference against the invoker and may be the subject of comment by opposing counsel. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>long as the invoking and any attendant inference do not constitute the sole basis for the judgment against the invoker, no constitutional objection is warranted. Whether the Constitution would permit the granting of a default judgment against a defendant for his invoking in a civil case, however, is less clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Heidt, The Conjurer\u2019s Circle \u2014 The Fifth Amendment Privilege in Civil Cases, 91 <em>Yale L.J. </em>1062, 1113 (1982). In <em>Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. 801, 808 n. 5, 97 S.Ct. 2132, 2137, n. 5, 53 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977), the Supreme Court described its ruling in <em>Baxter.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\"><em>Baxter </em>did no more than permit an inference to be drawn in a civil case from a party\u2019s refusal to testify. Respondent\u2019s silence in <em>Baxter </em>was only one of a number of factors to be considered by the finder of fact in assessing a penalty, and was given no more probative value than the facts of the case warranted____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\"><em>Baxter </em>suggests that three criteria must be met before the Court will permit an inference to be drawn against a person exercising his privilege against self incrimination. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">1. the action must be a civil action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">2. the party seeking to draw the inference must have established a <em>prima facie </em>case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">3. the person must be a party and not a mere witness. Moxham, A Comment Upon the Effect of Exercise of One\u2019s Fifth Amendment Privilege in Civil Litigation, 12 <em>New England Law Review </em>265, 267 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">In <em>National Acceptance Co. of America v. Bathalter, supra, </em>705 F.2d at 932, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held \u201c.. .in the light of <em>Baxter, </em>that even in a civil case a judgment imposing liability cannot rest solely upon a privileged refusal to admit or deny at the pleading stage.\u201d The Court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the defendant\u2019s claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege in his answer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint constituted an admission to the allegations therein. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The \u201ccost\u201d to a defendant of treating his claim of privilege in his answer as an admission is at least that plaintiff is excused from presenting proof of his averment and defendant is subjected without more, to an adverse judgment on that issue. We think <em>Baxter </em>indicates that this is too great a cost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In the instant case, it would have been constitutionally permissible under <em>Baxter </em>for the trial judge to have allowed appellee to read the requests for admissions to the jury. The court should then have instructed the jury that appellant objected to answering these requests relying on his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and that they may, but need not,' draw an adverse inference from appellant\u2019s assertion of his privilege that his answers to the requests would have been adverse to his interests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Cokely v. Cokely, </em>469 So.2d 635, 637 (Ala.Civ.App.1985); <em>Chaffin, Inc. v. Wallain, </em>689 P.2d 684, 688 (Colo. App.1984); <em>Asplin v. Mueller, </em>687 P.2d 1329, 1331 (Colo. App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\u201cBut if a party is free to shield himself with the privilege during discovery, while having the full benefit of his testimony at trial, the whole process of discovery could be seriously hampered.\u201d 8 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>\u00a7 2018 Supp. at 63 (1970, 1988 Supp.). (Footnote omitted.) Judge Hinkel was therefore correct in ruling that appellant should be precluded from testifying at trial as to the matters raised in appellee\u2019s request for admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">In <em>Schwaber v. Schwaber, </em>Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, <em>The Daily Record, </em>January 29, 1968, the late Judge J. Gilbert Prendergast addressed a similar issue. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Schwaber, </em>the wife sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery. At his pre-trial deposition, the husband refused to answer any questions on the ground that such answers would tend to incriminate him. Judge Prendergast opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAQ\">... The issue presented involves the consequences which the invocation of a privilege produces. The wife\u2019s counsel insists that the court should enter a decree <em>pro confesso </em>against him or at least strike out that portion of his answer in which he submitted an unverified denial of the charge of adultery. Defendant husband contends that the only sanction which can be invoked is that the husband may not hereafter testify at the trial of this case as to his alleged adultery. This court agrees with the latter contention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">For the reasons cited, the court rules that the defendant-husband had a constitutional right to refuse to answer questions pertaining to his adultery, but that he cannot hereafter testify as to any matters touching on the charge of adultery which the wife had made. The court cannot strike his pleading or enter a decree <em>pro confesso </em>against him because of his refusal to answer the questions put to him in his deposition, nor can he be precluded from offering the testimony of any other persons to rebut the charge of adultery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We adopt this reasoning and hold that when a defendant in a civil action pleads his privilege against self-incrimination in response to discovery requests, he is prohibited from testifying at trial on matters pertaining to these requests. <em>See Meyer v. Second Judicial District Court, Etc., </em>95 Nev. 176, 591 P.2d 259, 263 (1979); <em>A &amp; M Records, Inc. v. Heilman, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 554, 566, 142 Cal.Rptr. 390 (1977); <em>Costanza v. Costanza, </em>66 N.J. 63, 328 A.2d 230, 232 (1974). He is not precluded, however, from producing independent witnesses to prove any defenses raised if he complies with the appropriate discovery rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In the instant case, appellant did not so comply. As mentioned, <em>supra, </em>appellant asserted his privilege in response to appellee\u2019s interrogatory requesting the names of people with personal knowledge of any facts material to this case. While he is free to assert his privilege, appellant cannot use this privilege as a means to hide witnesses until trial. Allowing any witnesses to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf would have been an unfair surprise to the appellee. The trial judge is vested with a large measure of discretion in applying sanctions for failure to adhere to the discovery rules. <em>Klein v. Weiss, </em>284 Md. 36, 56, 395 A.2d 126 (1978). We hold that Judge Hinkel did not abuse that discretion in refusing to permit appellant\u2019s father to testify in appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Because of the erroneous characterization of appellant\u2019s objection to the request for admissions on the ground of self-incrimination, we shall vacate the judgments for compensatory and punitive damages and remand the case for a new trial on damages alone. We will not, however, disturb the court\u2019s determination that appellant is liable to appellee for the reasons we explain in answering appellant\u2019s second contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">When a motion for judgment pursuant to Rule 2-519 is made in a jury trial, the court must view the evidence and all inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. The motion may only be granted when the evidence, so viewed, permits only one conclusion to be drawn therefrom. <em>Impala Platinum Limited v. Impala Sales (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 327, 389 A.2d 887 (1978). The properly admitted uncontroverted evidence in the instant case established, as a matter of law, that appellant had breached his duty to deliver money to the appellee which he had collected as appellee\u2019s agent and trustee. It further established that appellant had misappropriated those collections made on appellee\u2019s behalf. Under these circumstances the trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s motion for judgment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the close of all the evidence on appellee\u2019s claims of breach of contract and conversion. The improperly admitted evidence of appellant\u2019s \u201cadmissions\u201d did not detract in any way from the evidence properly before the court or the issue of appellee\u2019s liability to appellant. As to that issue, the improper admission of that evidence was harmless. <em>Harris v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 310, 319-20, 529 A.2d 356 (1987); <em>Smith v. Warbasse, </em>71 Md.App. 625, 634-35, 526 A.2d 991 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Appellant properly asserts that proof of actual malice is a prerequisite to the recovery of punitive damages where the plaintiff is suing for a tort which arose out of a contractual relationship. <em>Miller Building Supply v. Rosen, </em>305 Md. 341, 348, 503 A.2d 1344 (1986); <em>H &amp; R Block, Inc. v. Testerman, </em>275 Md. 36, 47, 338 A.2d 48 (1975); <em>New Summit Associates v. Nistle, </em>73 Md.App. 351, 364, 533 A.2d 1350 (1987). He is incorrect, however, in his contention that there was insufficient evidence of actual malice to submit to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Actual (or express) malice has been described as \u201cthe performance of an act without legal justification or excuse, but with an evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, the purpose being to deliberately and willfully injure the plaintiff.\u201d H <em>&amp; R Block, Inc. v. Testerman, supra, </em>275 Md. at 43, 338 A.2d 48. There was ample evidence that appellant\u2019s conversion of appellee\u2019s funds was without legal justification or excuse, done with an evil motive with the purpose of deliberately and willfully injuring appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Finally, we find absolutely no merit in appellant\u2019s assertion that appellee\u2019s amended complaint was \u201cduplicitous.\u201d As we noted at the outset, appellant pleaded alternative claims of breach of contract and conversion. Such alternative presentation of claims is expressly permitted by Rule 2-303(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>JUDGMENT FOR COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES VACATED, CASE REMANDED FOR NEW TRIAL AS TO DAMAGES ONLY.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">COSTS TO BE PAID THREE-FOURTHS BY APPELLANT AND ONE-FOURTH BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\">.

The Fifth Amendment provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cNo person .. .shall be compelled in any criminal proceeding to be a witness against himself.\u201d The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was deemed incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus made applicable to the states in 1964. <em>Malloy v.

Article 22 provides \"[t]hat no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case.\u201d It is well settled that this Article is in <em>pari materia </em>with the privilege against compelled self-incrimination protected by the Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution and that it should receive a like construction. <em>Richardson v.

Appellee\u2019s interrogatories pursuant to Rule 2-421 sought specific information relative to the six loan transactions which formed the bases for the action.

There was no suggestion at trial that appellant\u2019s asserted risk of incrimination was unwarranted, or that his prosecution might be barred by limitations or for any other reason. <em>See </em>Gilbert &amp; Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law: Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 38.10 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">. Appellant is a member of the Maryland Bar. In <em>Spevack </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967), the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege is applicable to avoid self-incrimination in disciplinary proceedings. <em>Cf.

Rule 2-424(d) states in pertinent part \u201c.. .Any admission made by a party under this Rule is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission for any other purpose, nor may it be used against that party in any other proceeding.\u201d This Maryland Rule is textually identical to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 36(b). We may therefore review interpretations of that rule for guidance. <em>Bartell v. Bartell, </em>278 Md. 12, 18, 357 A.2d 343 (1976). In discussing FRCP 36(b) Wright &amp; Miller explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">At one time there were casual expressions in some cases that the privilege against self-incrimination did not apply to requests for admissions since Rule 36(b) provides that admissions under that rule may not be used in other proceeding[s]. This overlooked the possibility that the admission, though not usable itself, might be a link in an incriminating chain or provide a lead to other usable evidence. Thus, that older view is now regarded as \u201cclearly untenable\u201d and the privilege recognized under Rule 36. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">8 C. Wright &amp; A.
