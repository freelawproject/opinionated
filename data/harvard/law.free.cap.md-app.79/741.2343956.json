In order to avoid striking the phantom vehicle head-on, the Appellee turned his truck to the right, striking a dirt embankment, which caused his vehicle to overturn and injure the Appellee. At no time did the phantom vehicle and the Appellee\u2019s truck come into contact with one another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-13\">At the time of the accident, Appellee was working within the scope of his employment at Doughtie\u2019s Foods, Inc., and was operating an employer-provided vehicle that was insured by the Appellant, Royal Insurance Company of America (Royal). Under the terms of the uninsured motorist endorsement of the commercial vehicle insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>policy issued to Doughtie\u2019s Foods, Inc., by Appellant Royal, the Appellee is an insured of the Appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">A complaint was filed by Bernard Austin, appellee, against Royal Insurance Company of America (\u201cRoyal Insurance\u201d), appellant, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County after Royal Insurance denied coverage to Austin under the Uninsured Motorist provision of a commercial vehicle insurance policy owned by Doughtie Foods, Inc. (Austin\u2019s employer). Both Austin and Royal Insurance moved for summary judgment. By order dated June 14, 1988, the trial court denied both parties\u2019 motions. On June 22,1988, a consent judgment was entered by the trial court. Both parties signed the agreement through their attorneys. The agreement contained a provision that purportedly preserved Royal Insurance\u2019s \u201cright to appeal the Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">On appeal, Royal Insurance argues that the lower court erred in refusing to grant its motion for summary judgment. It argues that because Austin\u2019s vehicle was run off the road by a \u201cphantom vehicle\u201d that did not come into physical contact with Austin\u2019s truck, Austin is not covered by the terms of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist provision. Further, Royal Insurance argues, contrary to the trial court\u2019s order denying its motion for summary judgment, that such an exclusion is not void as against the public policy of Maryland because the insurance policy involved is a commercial one, not a personal insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\n<em>Appealability of Consent Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_F\">Preliminarily, although neither party raises the point, we must examine whether we may properly exercise jurisdiction in this case. It is a well-settled proposition in Maryland that consent decrees are not appealable. <em>See Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 68, 427 A.2d 1002 (1981); <em>First Federated Commodity Trust Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>272 Md. 329, 332, 322 A.2d 539 (1974); <em>Mercantile Trust Co. v. Schloss, </em>165 Md. 18, 24, 166 A. 599 (1933); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Barron, </em>19 Md.App. 348, 349, 311 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>453 (1973). Perceiving no pertinent difference between consent decrees in equity and consent judgments at law, this court has applied the same rule to the latter. <em>See Casson v. Joyce, </em>28 Md.App. 634, 639, 346 A.2d 683 (1975). The reasoning behind this jurisdictional bar is that an appeal from consensual rulings is patently inconsistent with the intent of such voluntary rulings expeditiously to resolve legal disputes. <em>See generally Franzen, supra, </em>290 Md. at 68-69, 427 A.2d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">This case, however, is different than the cases cited above in a material respect. A stipulation in the consent order in this case allows appellant to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment and to seek certiorari in the Court of Appeals. In the posture of the case before us, this stipulation leads us to the conclusion that the order below was not a <em>true </em>consent judgment as to both liability and damages, but it was, at most, a stipulation as to damages should Royal Insurance\u2019s bout in the appellate arena be unsuccessful. As such, we do not think the labelling of the order as a \u201cConsent Judgment\u201d should, under these circumstances, preclude appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This has been the view taken in other jurisdictions examining similar consensual agreements. <em>See e.g., Checker Van Lines v. Siltek Int\u2019l, Ltd., </em>169 N.J.Super. 102, 404 A.2d 333 (Ct., App.Div.1979) <em>(per curiam); Messina v. Lufthansa German Airlines, </em>64 A.D.2d 890, 408 N.Y.S.2d 109 (App.Div.1978); <em>IFG Leasing Co. v. Snyder, </em>77 Or.App. 374, 713 P.2d 630 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\n<em>Construction of \u201cHit and Run\u201d Provision in Insurance Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Doughtie Foods\u2019 insurance policy with Royal Insurance provides that Royal Insurance \u201cwill pay all sums the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>insured<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d Additionally, the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">4. \u201cUninsured motor vehicle\u201d means a land motor vehicle or trailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">* * * 5}! * He</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">d. Which is a hit-and-run vehicle and neither the driver nor owner can be identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The term \u201chit and run vehicle\u201d is not further defined anywhere else in the policy. No extraneous evidence as to its meaning is before this court. Royal Insurance contends that as a matter of law the term excludes from coverage accidents where, no contact between the insured\u2019s vehicle and the second vehicle or \u201cphantom vehicle\u201d takes place. Austin contends that the term can be reasonably interpreted to include unknown drivers who do not come into physical contact with the insured\u2019s vehicle but, nevertheless, cause the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">In our exhaustive review of the law we have been unable to uncover any cases where a court has been faced with interpreting the phrase \u201chit and run vehicle\u201d in an insurance policy where the policy does not include some express qualifying language excluding from coverage \u201cnon-contact\u201d accidents. We have, however, reviewed numerous decisions where courts have been required to interpret the phrase \u201chit and run\u201d in statutes mandating uninsured motorist coverage. In nearly all of the cases, the issue involved is whether an insurance policy that expressly excludes from coverage accidents that occur without physical contact between the vehicles involved is void as against public policy because it provides less than the minimum coverage under a statute that requires coverage in undefined \u201chit and run\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>situations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Although a few courts have held that the undefined statutory term \u201chit and run\u201d clearly requires insurance coverage only in physical contact situations, <em>see, e.g., Lemke v. Kenilworth Ins. Co., </em>109 Ill.2d 350, 94 Ill.Dec. 66, 487 N.E.2d 943 (1985); <em>Grace v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>197 Neb. 118, 246 N.W.2d 874 (1976); <em>Hendricks v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>5 N.C.App. 181, 167 S.E.2d 876 (1969); <em>Hayne v. Progressive Northern Ins. Co., </em>115 Wis.2d 68, 339 N.W.2d 588 (1983), the vast majority of the cases interpret the inclusion of the phrase \u201chit and run\u201d in the statute as requiring insurance coverage even in non-physical contact situations. <em>See e.g., Abramowicz v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>369 A.2d 691 (Del.Super. 1977); <em>Lanzo v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>524 A.2d 47 (Me.1987); <em>Surrey v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>384 Mass. 171, 424 N.E.2d 234 (1981); <em>Halseth v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>268 N.W.2d 730 (Minn.1978); <em>Soule v. Stuyvesant Ins. Co., </em>116 N.H. 595, 364 A.2d 883 (1976); <em>Biggs v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>569 P.2d 430 (Okl.1977); <em>Pin Pin H. Su v. Kemper Ins. Co., Etc., </em>431 A.2d 416 (R.I.1981); <em>Clark v. Regent Ins. Co., </em>270 N.W.2d 26 (S.D.1978) <em>Marakis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>765 P.2d 882 (Utah 1988); <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Novak, </em>83 Wash.2d 576, 520 P.2d 1368 (1974) (en banc). Representative of the reasoning behind the decisions in the latter cases is <em>Marakis, supra, </em>wherein the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Other courts which have upheld the physical contact requirement have done so based on the premise that the term \u201chit and run\u201d is synonymous with physical contact. Such a rigid construction is unmindful of various other uses of the term that do not necessitate physical contact. Beginning in an area which predates the automobile, the term \u201chit and run\u201d continues to be used in the sport of baseball. In baseball parlance, the term denotes a play in which a base runner starts for the next base as the pitcher starts to pitch and the batter attempts to hit the ball; in military operations, the term is ascribed to small military units or troops which take quick, specific action rather than permanent engagement; and in the field of commerce, the terms is used to describe a type of merchandising. In each instance, the applicability of the term does not hinge on the successful completion of the play (whether the batter hit the ball), the operation, or the sale. Similarly, the term \u201chit and run\u201d aptly includes characterization of an accident which is caused without physical contact by one who leaves the accident scene without identifying him or herself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Id. 765 P.2d at 884. In <em>Pin Pin H. Su, supra, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">In interpreting the language \u201chit and run\u201d, we believe, as did the Supreme Court of Washington, that the term is merely a shorthand colloquial expression that is designed to describe a motorist who has caused, or contributed by his negligence to, an accident and flees the scene without being identified. Thus, there is no inherent connotation that physical contact is an essential part of its definition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arp\"><em>Id. </em>431 A.2d at 419. We agree that the term \u201chit and run\u201d has developed a lexical common-place meaning wholly separate from the mere word \u201chit.\u201d The term should be read to include all accidents caused by one who \u201cflees the scene without being identified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">At worst, Austin has shown that the Royal Insurance policy is ambiguous as to whether \u201chit and run\u201d includes accidents caused by another without any physical contact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>In the absence of extrinsic evidence, ambiguity in an insurance policy is generally construed against the drafter of the policy. <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. House, </em>315 Md. 328, 340-41, 554 A.2d 404 (1989); <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 405, 488 A.2d 486 (1985); <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Marks Rental, </em>288 Md. 428, 435, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980); <em>General Accident Fire &amp; Ins. Corp. v. Perry, </em>75 Md.App. 503, 509, 541 A.2d 1340 (1988). We hold that the trial court did not err in denying Royal Insurance\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of our ruling above, we need not address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">. We do note that Royal Insurance has only reserved the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s order denying its motion for summary judgment. Thus, if <em>any </em>material fact exists as to Austin\u2019s exclusion from policy coverage, the consent judgment will become wholly enforceable, barring Royal Insurance from any further right to appellate review that it may have otherwise possessed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\">. It is not contested that Austin is an \"insured\u201d under the terms of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. Some statutes contain express provisions either including or excluding non-physical contact situations within the definition of \"hit and run\u201d in the uninsured motorist statute. Still other statutes, including Maryland\u2019s statute, do not include the term \"hit and run\u201d at all. The term being examined in these statutes to determine whether coverage is required is \"uninsured motorist.\u201d Under the circumstances <em>sub judice, </em>the most persuasive analyses are ones where the statute being interpreted contains the undefined phrase \u201chit and run.\" For an extensive examination of these different types of uninsured motorist statutory provisions, see <em>No Fault &amp; Uninsured Motorist Automobile Insurance, </em>\u00a7 26.200 (Matthew Bender 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. Our affirmance is not based on the trial court\u2019s conclusion that such an exclusion is void as being against the policy behind Maryland\u2019s uninsured motorist statute. Rather, we do not think that issue should have been addressed by the trial court, because absent further contractual or statutory definition, the term \"hit and run\u201d includes non-contact accidents and further, the policy itself was at least sufficiently ambiguous as to whether \u201chit and run\u201d included non-physical contact accidents to deny Royal Insurance\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
