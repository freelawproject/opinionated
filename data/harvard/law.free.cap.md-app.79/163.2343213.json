He was sentenced to a total of fifty years imprisonment. Appellant now queries whether the court erred in admitting his statement purportedly obtained in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On April 14, 1986, Officer Nelson Parker learned that a suspect, shot during the commission of a crime, was receiving treatment in a Baltimore County hospital. Because the circumstances of that crime were similar to others Officer Parker was investigating, he attempted to interview the suspect. The officer\u2019s effort was in vain, however, as the suspect, appellant herein, declined to discuss the matter, claiming that his lawyer instructed him not to speak with anyone. Officer Parker left his telephone number in case appellant or Ms attorney should decide to contact him.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Later that day, Officer Parker received a call from someone, apparently appellant\u2019s counsel. The attorney thanked Officer Parker for not interviewing his client and added that he would \u201chave to deny any interview.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Officer Parker\u2019s next contact with appellant occurred on July 18, 1986. At that time, appellant was in the Baltimore County Detention Center, under arrest for these crimes. The officer intended to serve appellant with warrants in two other cases and interview Mm on all the pending matters, including the instant charges. Before commencing the interview, Officer Parker advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave Mm an opportunity to call his lawyer. Appellant stated he understood his rights and did not need to speak with counsel. Appellant then waived his rights, and the interrogation commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>During the course of their conversation, appellant made an inculpatory statement which is an issue in this appeal. Appellant now claims that his statement is inadmissible under the dictates of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Preliminarily, we note that the Fifth Amendment issue was not raised below. As the transcript of the suppression hearing indicates, appellant\u2019s motion was based solely on the Sixth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, at first when I anticipated this, I thought the problem, as did [defense counsel], was much more complex than I really believe it is now. I think primarily there are two directions that this argument could take; a Fifth Amendment argument and a Sixth Amendment argument. I think that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">THE COURT: Excuse me. I don\u2019t think we have a Fifth Amendment problem. The problem is the Sixth Amendment. I don\u2019t know if [defense counsel] would agree, but there\u2019s no Fifth Amendment problem that I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaO\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that\u2019s a correct position, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In light of this exchange, we exercise our discretion and decline to address the Fifth Amendment issue. Maryland Rule 8-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">In <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-485, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1884-85, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), the Supreme Court ruled that an accused person in custody who has \u201cexpressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges or conversations with the police.\u201d The Court, in <em>Solem v. Stumes, </em>465 U.S. 638, 641, 104 S.Ct. 1338, 1340, 79 L.Ed.2d 579 (1984), reiterated the <em>Edwards </em>bright-line rule that \u201conce a suspect has invoked the right to counsel, any subsequent conversation must be initiated by him.\u201d This rule was found equally applicable to Sixth Amendment situations in <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 636, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 1411, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The Sixth Amendment right to counsel guarantees the assistance of an attorney at post-arraignment interrogations. <em>Jackson, 475 </em>U.S. at 629, 106 S.Ct. at 1407. This is true because the arraignment \u201csignals \u2018the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings\u2019 and thus the attachment of the Sixth Amendment, <em>United States v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 187, 188, 81 L.Ed.2d 146, 104 S.Ct. 2292 [2297] (1984); thereafter, government efforts to elicit information from the accused, including interrogation, represent \u2018critical stages\u2019 at which the Sixth Amendment applies.\u201d (citations omitted.) <em>Jackson, 475 </em>U.S. at 629-630, 106 S.Ct. at 1407.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Brown was arraigned on June 30, 1986. The docket entries reflect that Brown informed the court he retained counsel, \u201cMr. R. Walker.\u201d On the same day, Roland Walker entered his appearance on behalf of appellant. Certainly the State was aware of Brown\u2019s desire to be represented by counsel and his assertion that he had, in fact, already hired an attorney. This was confirmed by counsel\u2019s entry of appearance. These facts reveal two key occurrences on June 30, 1986; the commencement of adversary judicial proceedings triggering appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Whether the interrogating officer was aware of what transpired during the arraignment is inconsequential. \u201cOne set of state actors (the police) may not claim ignorance of [a defendant\u2019s] unequivocal request for counsel to another state actor (the court).\u201d <em>Jackson, 475 </em>U.S. at 634, 106 S.Ct. at 1410. Simply phrased, the police are responsible to know of and respond to such a request. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 106 S.Ct. at 1410. This is also true of the officer questioning Brown on July 18, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Once a defendant requests a lawyer, subsequent advisement of constitutional rights followed by acquiescence in police-initiated questioning cannot establish a valid waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. at 635, 106 S.Ct. at 1410. \u201cJust as written waivers are insufficient to justify police initiated interrogations after the request for counsel in a Fifth Amendment analysis, so too are they insufficient to justify police initiated interrogations after the request for counsel in a Sixth Amendment analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Brown\u2019s oral waiver was likewise insufficient.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">In <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 51 L.Ed.2d 424, 97 S.Ct. 1232 (1977). Where, as in <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 12 L.Ed.2d 246, 84 S.Ct. 1199 (1964), the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had accrued, the Court held that a valid waiver of counsel rights should not be inferred from the mere response by the accused to overt or more subtle forms of interrogation or other efforts to elicit incriminating information. In <em>Massiah </em>and <em>Brewer, </em>counsel had been engaged or appointed and the admissions in question were elicited in his absence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ5\"><em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. at 484 n. 8, 101 S.Ct. at 1885 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The State likens the scenario here to that in <em>Michigan v. Mosely, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975). In <em>Mosely, </em>the defendant was arrested for robbery and was interrogated after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. When Mosely declined to answer any questions, the conversation ceased. Approximately two hours later, a different officer approached Mosely about his involvement in a murder. At that time, Mosely was not under arrest.for the murder. The second officer again informed Mosely of his Mirandaf rights prior to questioning. During their conversation, Mosely gave a statement implicating himself in the homicide. That statement was the subject of a motion to suppress during the murder trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Supreme Court held that the statement was admissible. Noteworthy was the fact that Mosely received <em>Mi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>randa </em>warnings before each period of questioning. The Court also pointed to the time lapse between the sessions. Of special significance, however, was the fact that the second officer questioned Mosely about the homicide. The second crime was unrelated to the first, and the officer in no way attempted to resume interrogation on the robbery or persuade Mosely to reconsider his position. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">This is not a case, therefore, where the police failed to honor a decision of a person in custody to cut off questioning, either by refusing to discontinue the interrogation upon request or by persisting in repeated efforts to wear down his resistance and make him change his mind. In contrast to such practices, the police here immediately ceased the interrogation, resumed questioning only after the passage of a significant period of time and the provision of a fresh set of warnings, and restricted the second interrogation to a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><em>Michigan v. Mosely, </em>423 U.S. at 105-106, 96 S.Ct. at 327-328.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Mosely </em>is inapposite to the instant case. We are faced with police-initiated questioning violative of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Under these facts, the court erred in admitting Brown\u2019s July 18, 1986 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Alternatively, the State claims that such error was harmless. The Court of Appeals, in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), enunciated the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">We conclude that when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility \u2014 that the evidence complained of whether errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We are not so convinced. While the victim\u2019s identification of Brown coupled with her identification of a sawed-off shotgun recovered from Brown as the one used during the crime are compelling, we are not satisfied that there exists no \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that Brown\u2019s statement may have contributed to the guilty verdict. Consequently, a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">. The right to counsel does not hinge on appellant\u2019s request for a lawyer. Instead, his request is \"an extremely important fact in considering the validity of a subsequent waiver in response to police-initiated interrogation.\" <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. at 633, 106 S.Ct. at 1409.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
