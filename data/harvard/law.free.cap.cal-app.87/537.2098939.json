Under the provisions of section 6 (b) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation etc. Act of 1917 (Stats. 1919, p. 912, and Stats. 1923, p. 376), the employer is responsible for this misconduct if Doble was \u201can executive or managing officer or general superintendent thereof.\u201d According to the rule established by the decision of the supreme court in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>199 Cal. 420 [249 Pac. 849], it seems necessary to hold that Doble was a \u201cmanaging officer\u201d of the employer within the meaning of the language used in said section 6 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">For this reason the petition for a writ of review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Houser, J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Petitioner\u2019s application to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on February 9, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
