The three accusations relate to the same time and the same dental office and all charge that W. M. Cohn, an unlicensed person, was manager thereof. The evidence herein is substantially the same as in the other cases, but in addition thereto a witness for the prosecution testified in this ease that \u201cthere was a sign down in the entrance to the building\u201d on which Cohn\u2019s name was listed as \u201csuperintendent\u201d or \u201csuperintendent of the laboratory, \u2019 \u2019 he did not know which. If Cohn\u2019s name appeared thereon as \u201csuperintendent of the laboratory\u201d it was consistent with the testimony given by the same witness that Cohn was in fact superintendent of the laboratory.  When a witness states that he does not know which of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>inconsistent things is true it cannot be inferred therefrom that either the one or the other is the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The demurrer to the petition is overruled and the order suspending petitioner\u2019s license to practice dentistry is annulled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
