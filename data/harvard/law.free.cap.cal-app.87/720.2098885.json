The appeal is taken on a separate typewritten transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">The contract called the plaintiff\u2019s assignors to procure the acceptance of defendant\u2019s proposal to exchange real properties. Written acceptance of this proposal was procured by them on November 19, 1920. Defendant\u2019s obligation to pay for the services became fixed as of that date and, as the amount was determined by the contract, interest should have been allowed from that time. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Bekins, </em>186 Cal. 389, 399 [199 Pac. 767] ; Civ. Code, see. 3287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">The judgment is modified by adding after the word \u201caction\u201d in the last line thereof the following: and interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>on said sum of $3,000 from November 19, 1920, at the rate of 7% per annum.\u201d Appellant to have his costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Koford, P.
