The general anesthetic used was nitrous oxide gas, considered to be the safest general anesthetic. The evidence shows further that the employer and employee consulted the Georgia Casualty Company officials at Los Angeles, and were instructed by their agents and employees to have the employee undergo the treatment at the hands of such surgeons and at the time and place of such treatment, which said treatment resulted in his death. There is no evidence that the administration of the anesthetic could reasonably have been avoided. Under the circumstances as shown, it appears that the original injury was a continuing operative cause of the employee\u2019s death, and that the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tion of the anesthetic was not an independent and separately operating cause of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">The application for compensation was filed in the names of the four applicants \u201cby their attorney-in-fact, D. Chung.\u201d The petitioner alleges that the Commission was without jurisdiction over the matter in controversy in this, that no application for compensation was filed \u201cby any party in interest, his attorney, or other representative authorized in writing,\u201d as required by section 17 (a) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance and Safety Act of 1917 as amended (Stats. 1919, p. 918). That section provides, in the phraseology last above quoted, for the filing of the application in writing for an award of compensation in the cases covered by the statute. Among other things, it further provides that \u201cthere shall be but one cause of action for each transaction coming within the provisions of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u201cWhen a claim for any portion of the benefits prescribed by the act has reached the point where it is necessary or expedient to submit the matter to the decision of the Industrial Accident Commission, the whole subject matter of the controversy, including the further claims of the applicant, <em>or of any and all other persons, </em>should be thereby submitted to the jurisdiction of the commission for a complete determination, provided, of course, that all claims relating to the transaction be presented within the life of the continuing jurisdiction of the commission.\u201d <em>(Great W. P. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>196 Cal. 593, 603 [238 Pac. 662].)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Section 60 (a) of the act provides for a very liberal plan of procedure in matters before the Commission and declares that \u201cno informality in any proceeding . . . shall invalidate any order, decision, award . . . made, approved or confirmed by the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The evidence produced before the Commission includes a letter written by Mrs. Shin to D. Chung before he filed the application with the Commission, in which letter she refers to her deceased brother and to his dependents (apparently including herself), and to the \u201cindustrial accident insurance,\u201d and states to Chung that she hopes he will do all he can to bring' about the best result.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The Commission treated this letter as written authority to Chung to file the application on behalf of at least one interested party, namely, the sister of the deceased. Respondent Commission contends that the application so made on behalf of the sister was sufficient to bring before the Commission the subject matter of the proceeding, and that under the provisions of the statute it was authorized to consider the rights of the other dependents, inasmuch as it would be necessary to bring them in before a complete determination of the matter could be had. Respondents further contend that, since Mrs. Shin was in good faith claiming to be a dependent of the deceased, the fact that her cl aim to be such dependent was not allowed does not deprive the Commission of the same jurisdiction over the proceeding, with respect to the other claims, that the Commission would have had if the claim on behalf of Mrs. Shin that she was a dependent of the deceased had been allowed. We are of the opinion that these contentions of respondent are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
