There was also sufficient evidence to properly infer that the refusal to issue the withdrawal card which the employee requested was an artifice employed by the union to enforce the payment of union fines assessed for failure to attend union meetings. There is also sufficient evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the employer knew of the union\u2019s actions, although the union requested . the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>ployee\u2019s discharge only on the ground of his failure to pay <em>dues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The right to refrain from union activities is a privilege guaranteed to an employee. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157.
