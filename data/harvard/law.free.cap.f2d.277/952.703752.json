Posner, Inc-, (hereinafter \u201cPosner\u201d) filed an application for the registration of the following mark for a \u201cPressing Cream for the Hair\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-25\">POSNER\u2019S</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adf\">e</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arq\">r</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJs\">i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajf\">a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYdO\">n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaK\">o</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar2\">b</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajb\">e</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-26\">The description of the goods in the application was later amended to read, \u201cA hair treatment kit consisting of a pressing cream, a cosmetic scalp cream and a cream curl.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Use of the mark since-January 1954 was alleged. The registration was opposed by Daggett &amp; Rams-dell, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cD &amp; R\u201d), as owner of the registered trademark, \u201cDebonair,\u201d for \u201cAfter shaving Lotions, Hair Tonics and Perfumes, Cologne, Deodorants and Talcum,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asserting that Pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>ner\u2019s proposed mark so resembles its own registered mark as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board unanimously decided on December 17, 1958, that \u201cConsidering the differences between both the marks and goods involved, it is concluded that confusion in trade would not be likely.\u201d Accordingly, the opposition was dismissed and this appeal was taken pursuant to Section 21 of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Posner has urged upon this court that its product is so substantially different in its composition and use from those of the opposer that no confusion as to origin could possibly arise in the mind of the public, no matter how similar the marks may be. Posner asserts that its product is designed for use by Negro women to remove kinks from their hair and must be used in connection with a heavy comb and a hot curling iron. It was admitted at oral argument, however, that its creams are not sold exclusively in kits with the necessary equipment for application. Therefore, one would have to read the directions in order to discover that the heavy comb and curling iron were necessary. Furthermore, Posner\u2019s Cosmetic Scalp Cream does not require this unique equipment for application. Also, neither trademark indicates that the goods on which it appears are for use by members of one sex rather than the other. Under these circumstances, it does not appear to this court that Posner\u2019s goods are so different from D &amp; R\u2019s Cream Hair Lotion that confusion is improbable for this reason alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The applicant also argues that confusion is improbable, irrespective of similarity of marks, because its product is sold exclusively through stores while D &amp; R\u2019s products are only sold door-to-door by the Fuller Brush Company. Neither party is restricted by its registration or application to a particular channel of trade, however. Under these circumstances, the present sales methods are not conclusive in this type of proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was pointed out in In re Fleet-Wing Corporation, 188 F.2d 476, 478, 38 CCPA 1039, where it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">\u201cThe emphasis placed by appellant on the environment of sales is not appropriate because the application for registration does not limit sales in any particular manner or to any particular stores or stations and it is well established that sales methods are subject to change at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">Thus, it is clear that the final resolution of this dispute hinges on whether or not the marks in question differ sufficiently so that, when applied to the parties\u2019 products, it is not likely that purchasers will be confused. D &amp; R asserts that it is improper to give any weight to the addition of the surname \u201cPosner\u2019s\u201d to the fanciful mark \u201cebonaire\u201d in determining the question of confusing similarity to its own mark, \u201cDebonair,\u201d citing Menendez v. Holt, 1888, 128 U.S. 514, 9 S.Ct. 143, 32 L.Ed. 526.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This decision has not been construed as absolutely prohibiting consideration of a surname on the issue of similarity. Instead, the courts state that it is proper to consider the entire mark, including the surname, but recognize that parts of a mark may be more dominant than others in the sense that they are more likely to remain in the public\u2019s mind and are, therefore, entitled to more weight in deciding the likelihood of confusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>This clearly represents the approach taken in Celanese Corp. of America v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., 154 F.2d 143, 33 CCPA 857, on which opposer relies, as is indicated by the following language appearing at page 145 of 154 F.2d, at page 860 of 33 CCPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-4\">\u201cIt is a matter of common knowl-. edge that in the purchase of goods people generally do not stop to scrutinize marks nor retain a vivid recollection of their diversified features. Each of the contested marks, therefore, is to be considered in its entirety and viewed as the general public would view and remember it in making a purchase of the merchandise to which it is attached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">In applying this principle in the Celanese case, this court decided that, \u201cwhile trade-marks must be considered as a whole in determining the question of similarity, and while the name \u2018Du Pont\u2019 may be more conspicuous in appellee\u2019s mark than \u2018Clar-apel,\u2019 nevertheless the public in making purchases of the goods would be likely to remember and use the word \u2018Clar-apel\u2019 as indicating origin of the goods. For that reason, \u2018Clar-apel\u2019 must be regarded as the dominant portion of appellee\u2019s mark.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We then concluded that \u201cClar-apel\u201d and \u201cClarifoil\u201d were so similar that confusion in the mind of the public was likely to result if they were used concurrently in the sale of substantially identical goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">On several other occasions various courts have disregarded the surname in a trademark because it was determined that the rest of the mark was dominant. See California Prune &amp; Apricot Growers Association v. Dobry Flour Mills, Inc., 101 F.2d 838, 26 CCPA 910; Ambassador East, Inc. v. Orsatti, Inc., 3 Cir., 1958, 257 F.2d 79; Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 602.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand, in a number of instances the surname has been found to be the dominant part of the mai'k, or at least significant (and perhaps no less dominant than the rest of it), and has, accordingly, been considered by the courts in determining the issue of the likelihood of confusion. YardMan, Inc. v. Savage Arms Corp., 220 F.2d 782, 42 CCPA 862; Best &amp; Co. v. Miller, 2 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 374; New Yorker Hotel Corporation v. Pusateri, D.C.W.D.Mo.1949, 87 F.Supp. 294. Thus, it is apparent that a surname can be a significant or co-equal portion of a trademark and must not always be totally disregarded in deciding a question of confusing similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">This court is not prepared to say that there is some magic in a fanciful word such as \u201cebonaire\u201d which causes it to stick in the public\u2019s mind any more than \u201cPosner\u2019s\u201d or \u201cPosner\u2019s ebonaire\u201d under all possible circumstances. Each case must be decided on its own facts. In this case it is noted that, while \u201cebonaire\u201d is printed in larger letters than \u201cPosner\u2019s\u201d in applicant\u2019s trademark, the former is written with each letter higher than the preceding one in an ascending manner and is, consequently, difficult to read, whereas the latter is written on a horizontal line and, because it appears first and requires less effort to read, is more likely to come to the purchaser\u2019s attention first. Under these circumstances, it would appear that the \u201cPosner\u2019s\u201d portion of the mark is at least as likely to remain in the public\u2019s mind as \u201cebonaire.\u201d Since the mark must be considered in its entirety, this court has no difficulty in concluding that likelihood of confusion in the mind of the public is remote, although the goods are of similar descriptive qualities. We are reassured in our judgment by the fact that it is in accord with the unanimous decision of the three members of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Cf. Rex Shoe Company v. Juvenile Shoe Corp. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>America, 273 F.2d 179, 180, 47 CCPA 750; Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 49 F.2d 842, 843, 18 CCPA 1386. The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissing the opposition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-18\">. The appropriateness of the use of the word \u201ckit\u201d has been questioned by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (R-63, fn. 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1004-28\">. Reg. No. 538,612, issued February 27, 1951. There is also evidence that \u201cDebonair\u201d was used on a \u201cHair Cream Lotion\u201d and a \u201cDandruff Control Hair Dressing\u201d (R-53).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3052(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">. Posner's contention, which is not supported by the record (R-16, 20-22), that Fuller does not sell in Negro neighborhoods is subject to this same infirmity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">. The only question presently before this court is the registrability of the mark \u201cPosner\u2019s ebonaire\u201d as shown on the application (R-9). We are not concerned with any variations on that mark. Posner\u2019s right to use \u201cebonaire\u201d alone, as it has done on its labels (R-5), is for another forum to consider at another time. See Smith v. Tobacco By-Products &amp; Chemical Corp., 243 F.2d 188, 190, 44 CCPA 880.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">. Celanese Corp. of America v. E. I.

Corp., 111 F.2d 481, 27 COPA 1189, where the same principle was applied but no surname was involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1007-5\">RICH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8k\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">I agree with the result reached in Judge VAN DUSEN\u2019S opinion. I also agree with Judge MARTIN\u2019S view that the trademark significance of the mark sought to be registered resides primarily in the word \u201cebonaire,\u201d yet I am without doubt that confusion is not likely to result from the concurrent use of applicant\u2019s mark and \u201cDebonair,\u201d taking into account, as the statute requires, both the marks and the involved goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Particularly in the present case do I feel that the outcome depends on the facts which, as usual, are not \u201con all fours\u201d with any other case I know of, contrary to opposer\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">The factor which chiefly influences me is the <em>meaning </em>attributable to the marks. We are not dealing with marks which are \u201carbitrary\u201d in the sense of not stimulating any ideas at all in the minds of the beholders. \u201cDebonair\u201d is one of the several spellings of a common English word with a French origin and flavor. The portion \u201cebonaire\u201d of applicant\u2019s mark is one of those hybrids which, when contemplated as it would be, in connection with the goods to which it is applied, is clearly calculated to stimulate thoughts. Thus each is pregnant with meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">\u201cDebonair\u201d is a word which I think would mean something fairly definite to anyone sufficiently literate to comprehend a movie, and that would include most everyone. It connotes a person who is affable and courteous, graceful and gay. As applied to toiletries it is suggestive of aids to the creation of such a personality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">The portion \u201cebonaire\u201d applied to applicant\u2019s hair pressing cream or hair straightening kits is a sort of anglicized version of the Chinese ideogram. It is inescapable that as used it is a play on the word \u201cebony,\u201d which Negroes have taken to themselves in several connections, and applicant\u2019s goods go primarily to the Negro market. The suffix \u201c-aire\u201d is a common one. Why it was used I have no way of knowing but I will assume, arguendo, that it was coupled with \u201cebon\u201d to suggest the word \u201cdebonaire.\u201d If that was the purpose, I think there is only a 50% chance the idea would get across because of the many other uses of \u201c-aire.\u201d Considering the market for the goods, I believe the predominant impression is bound, in any case, to be <em>ebony, </em>with a fancy ending, like those used in the names of cars and real estate developments. Appellant says the mark \u201csuggests a debonaire negro.\u201d That is good advocacy, but to the public I think \u201cebonaire\u201d would suggest, rather, a product <em>for </em>negroes. \u201cDebonair\u201d carries no such suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">Let me illustrate my point by expanding the field. Suppose we had the following trademarks: Yvonneaire, Devonair, Ebonaire, and Debonair. While it can be said they all sound somewhat alike and some of them even look alike, each is dominated by or is a name or word which has meaning, conveys an idea, and hence raises associations in the mind of the public. The first suggests a French girl, the second English countryside, the third (when used on a product sold primarily to Negroes) ebony or the Negro race, and the last is simply a word with its own meaning, which is quite different from the meanings suggested by the other three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">It is my opinion that even though purchasers of applicant\u2019s products should sense in its mark the suggestion of the common <em>tvord </em>\u201cdebonaire,\u201d they would not for that reason be confused and think that there was a relationship, with respect to origin, with other toiletries sold under the trademark \u201cDebonair.\u201d This is because of the predominant suggestion of \u201cebony\u201d in applicant\u2019s mark and its unique relationship to the products on which it is used. The primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>meanings engendered by perception of applicant\u2019s and opposer\u2019s marks, according to my view of the matter, are poles apart and I think that is enough to preclude confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">For these reasons I agree with the decision to affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1008-5\">MARTIN, Judge, with whom SMITH, Judge, joins</author>\n<p id=\"AV8\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Although applicant\u2019s mark includes \u201cPosner\u2019s\u201d I believe that the trademark significance to the public would reside in \u201cebonaire\u201d and there is sufficient similarity between \u201cebonaire\u201d and \u201cDebonair\u201d to raise some doubt in my mind as to the likelihood of confusion. Therefore, I would <em>reverse </em>the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
