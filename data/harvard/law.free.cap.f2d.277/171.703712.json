The opposition was based on a number of prior registrations of the trademark \u201cActo,\u201d owned by appellant, and on prior use of that mark on petroleum sulphonates for various industrial purposes. It is not disputed that appellant\u2019s registrations and use of the \u201cActo\u201d mark preceded any use of \u201cActo-Vate\u201d by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">While appellee\u2019s evidence indicates that it applies the mark only to a specific composition used in laundering, and appellee has requested leave to amend its application to limit the goods to \u201csequestering agents for use as adjuncts to detergents in laundering operations,\u201d the application is not now so limited and we must therefore consider it as embracing \u201cwater softeners\u201d generally, that being the present designation of the goods to which the \u201cActo-Vate\u201d mark is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">Appellant\u2019s registrations include petroleum sulphonates and other products to which the \u201cActo\u201d mark is applied, and for which a wide variety of uses are stated in the registrations, but none of them makes reference to use as a water softener nor, in our opinion, to any use closely related to water softening. Accordingly, the registrations are not so pertinent to appellee\u2019s application as is the evidence of actual use, in which reference is made to water softening.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Appellant\u2019s evidence shows that it has marketed under its \u201cActo\u201d mark petroleum sulphonates which it has recommended for a wide variety of uses including \u201cwater treatment\u201d and \u201csoftener (industrial water).\u201d There is no evidence, however, that any \u201cActo\u201d product has been sold for use, by itself, as a water softener; rather, as stated by the board, they appear to have been sold \u201cfor use as ingredients in the manufacture of a wide variety of chemical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>compounds including industrial water softeners, and preparations for dry cleaning and laundering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The record indicates that \u201cActo\u201d sulphonates are normally sold in large quantities and are used by the purchasers as ingredients of other products which they either use themselves or sell under some other name. Applicant\u2019s water softener, on the other hand, is sold in relatively smaller quantities and exclusively to laundries. It is true that trade practices may vary in the future, but we agree with the board that opposer\u2019s \u201cActo\u201d products, so far as they have water softening properties, are essentially ingredients in the manufacture of various products, whereas water softeners <em>per se </em>would usually be sold to the ultimate consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">It is conceivable that the same purchaser might buy both an \u201cActo\u201d sulphonate and \u201cActo-Yate\u201d water softener, but that would certainly not be expected to occur in many instances. Such a purchaser, moreover, would in all probability be a discriminating one since he would be buying specialized products in a technical field and, at least in the case of the \u201cActo\u201d product, he would probably be buying in comparatively large volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">It is also to be noted that the marks are not identical and that \u201cActo,\u201d which is the part common to them, is not purely arbitrary but is suggestive of action or activation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Upon consideration of all the circumstances of this case, including the specfic differences in the goods, the methods of marketing, and the marks themselves, we agree with the board that sale of the goods of the parties under their respective marks would not be likely to cause confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act (Trademark Act of 1946), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Appellant also contends that appellee should be denied registration because of its failure to produce its president, one E. F. Drew, as a witness upon demand of appellant. It appears that Drew was abroad when the demand was made, and that appellee offered to consent to a postponement of the completion of appellant\u2019s testimony until his return if advised as to the nature of the testimony expected, and if such testimony appeared proper and necessary. Apparently appellant did not seek such a postponement. In our opinion those circumstances are not grounds for refusing registration of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
