After the court\u2019s refusal to allow a temporary restraint of the construction, both sides moved for summary judgment. In granting the defense motion and denying that of plaintiffs, Chief Judge Wright held that the restrictions urged by appellants were not binding on the land involved. His opinion fully covers the issue and does, we think, soundly and fairly decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed. 177 F.Supp. 491.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
