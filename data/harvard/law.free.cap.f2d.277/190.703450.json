An opposition to that registration was filed by Brewster Food Service, owner of the registered mark \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for use on shelled and salted nuts. That opposition was sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board which found that \u201cSchnaps\u201d, when applied to the goods of appellant, was likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers. This appeal is from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Both parties took testimony. The evidence shows that the goods sold by the parties under the respective marks are salted redskin peanuts having a sweetened coating. Each sells its peanuts in cellophane bags, primarily in a ten cent size, through the same channels, jobbers and route men, for ultimate sale to the tavern trade. It has been shown that the parties\u2019 peanuts are usually purchased by patrons of taverns for consumption on the premises with various forms of liquid refreshment. The evidence also establishes that appellant knew of appellee\u2019s use of \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d on packages of sweetened nuts prior to the time it adopted its mark, and that the \u201cSchnaps\u201d nuts package, besides the mark, has the figure of a glass of beer and the phrase \u201c \u2018So Good With Beer\u2019 \u201d on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The board found that the marks neither looked nor sounded alike, and that \u201cschnaps,\u201d unlike beer, means a strong liquor. However, it stated that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201c * * * the mark \u2018Schnaps,\u2019 as used in conjunction with the word nuts, conveys the same general commercial impression as \u2018Beer Nuts,\u2019 that is to say, nuts intended to be consumed with alcoholic beverages. In addition, applicant features the slogan \u2018So Good With Beer\u2019 and the representation of a glass of beer on its packages of \u2018Schnaps\u2019 nuts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">For those reasons the board concluded that there was a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d of confusion, mistake or purchaser deception within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The board dismissed certain testimony whch tends to show that \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d is the common descriptive name for salted redskin peanuts as being, if anything, \u201ca localism restricted to certain small town areas in Wisconsin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Appellant argues that such testimony should not have <em>been </em>summarily dismissed, contending that the confusion, if any, which may exist is engendered by appellee\u2019s use of \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d as a mark and is <em>nob </em>due to any confusion between the marks of the parties. Appellant also asserts that the marks are sufficiently different to preclude likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">It is appellee\u2019s position that the marks are confusingly similar because they convey the same impression. In support of its position, appellee alleges that \u201cschnaps\u201d is sometimes used synonymously with beer by the \u201ccommon man,\u201d points out that the goods are substantially identical, and argues that the goods are cheap items quickly sold for immediate consumption. Appellee further asserts that appellant has deliberately designed its package and mark to cause confusion, and that the evidence shows actual confusion. Appellee maintains that we may not consider evidence which may tend to show that its mark is descriptive or generic, and that in any event the evidence that \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d may be descriptive is merely a localism. Finally, appellee reminds us that if any doubt as to confusion should arise in our minds, in accordance with well established principles, that doubt must be resolved against the newcomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">The goods are identical as is the class of purchasers of the merchandise. \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d and \u201cSchnaps\u201d nuts are different in sound, appearance and meaning. The only similarity resides in the suggestiveness of the use of the goods, i. e., to eat the nuts when imbibing beer or liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\"> Obviously it was the purpose of both parties to employ words that are suggestive of the use of the merchandise. In doing so appellee necessarily foreclosed the possibility of obtaining the scope of protection that a purely arbitrary mark would deserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">Appellee\u2019s testimony that one of the partners in the firm was sold packages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>of \u201cSchnaps\u201d nuts when requesting \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d in various taverns in the common trade area of the parties merely shows that appellee, in adopting a word which is highly suggestive to the trade to which it was catering, ran the risk of having similar merchandise sold by others for the same purpose to the same trade offered to the witness when he requested \u201cBeer Nuts.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We do not believe that confusion as to scource is the significant factor in this case. Rather, it appears to us that the dominant feature of this controversy is the lack of trademark significance inherent in \u201cBeer Nuts.\u201d We believe this to be so irrespective of the fact that appellee has sold 20 million bags of its nuts having \u201cBeer Nuts\u201d thereon and has advertised its mark in various trade journals.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Furthermore, if we permitted appellee to prevail here, we would be saying, in effect, that no one else could sell this type of merchandise employing a trademark suggestive of the most appealing use of the goods. We do not believe that appellee\u2019s mark warrants such protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellee has cited Hancock v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of New Jersey, Etc., 203 F.2d 737, 40 CCPA 931, in support of its contention. There the marks \u201cCyclone\u201d and \u201cTornado,\u201d used on wire fencing and similar articles, were held to be confusingly similar. We believe that case is distinguishable from the one at bar. This court held that \u201cCyclone\u201d and \u201cTornado\u201d as used on the respective merchandise were essentially arbitrary and that they had identical dictionary meanings. Here \u201cSchnaps\u201d and \u201cBeer\u201d do not have similar dictionary meanings nor are they entirely arbitrary terms as applied to nuts intended for sale in taverns to be eaten with drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">For the above reasons we reverse the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-27\">. Application Serial No. 692,483, filed August 4, 1955, first use alleged October 20, 1954, first use in commerce alleged January 5,1955.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-29\">.

The memoranda which the witness made following his visits to the taverns indicate that of the 21 he entered, in 20 of them he asked for \u201cBeer nuts\u201d, and in the other there is no indication of what was requested. When testifying, the witness stated that \u201cIn each of these calls I asked for Beer Nut peanuts.\u201d At least once in his testimony, however, the witness stated that upon entering one of the taverns he \u201casked for Beer Nuts.\u201d Since he testified that the memoranda- were made \u201cafter each call in the taverns,\u201d they are probably more accurate recollections of what was requested than is the testimony given more than three months later.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
