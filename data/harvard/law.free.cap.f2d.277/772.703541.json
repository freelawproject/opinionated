The decision and order are reported in 123 N.L.R.B. 109, where the facts are set forth in more detail than is necessary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The respondent Employers\u2019 Council is an employer association and the collective bargaining agent of eight member employers, each of which operated food stores at Great Falls, Montana. These employers, through the Council, had a collective bargaining agreement with Local 57 of the Retail Clerks International Association which was exclusive bargain-mg representative of the respondents\u2019 grocery clerks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement expired by its terms on March 31, 1957, but was continued in effect by mutual agreement of the parties. Bargaining sessions, looking to a new agreement, began on February 22, 1957, and continued until April 12, when the Council submitted a \u201cfinal proposal\u201d. This the Union rejected and voted to strike one employer member, \u2014 the respondent Buttrey. When picketing of Buttrey\u2019s stores began, the remaining employers locked out their employees represented by the Union, stating that they did so \u201cto preserve their interest in group bargaining, as guaranteed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">The Board agreed with respondent\u2019s contention that this lockout, so initiated, was properly privileged under the decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U.S. 87, 77 S.Ct. 643, 1 L.Ed.2d 676. Said the Board: \u201cThe parties agree that Respondents\u2019 purpose in locking out their nonstriking employees was only to protect the multi-employer unit from the disintegration threatened by the Union\u2019s tactic of calling a \u2018whipsaw\u2019 strike against one employer member in support of demands against all. Such a strike threat \u2018per se, constitutes the type of economic operative problem at the plants of the non-struck employers which legally justifies their resort to a temporary lockout of employees.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>This initial lockout was followed by-other action of these employers, and that further action is what the Board held improper. It came about in the following manner: when the Union voted to strike Buttrey it plainly anticipated that a lockout might follow; so it instructed its members that in case of such a lockout all locked-out employees should register with the Montana Employment Service for other jobs in order to qualify for unemployment compensation. Under the Montana law a claimant who so qualified would be entitled to payments from the unemployment compensation fund of $32 per week for a period of 22 weeks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The strike and lockout began on Saturday, April 13. On Monday following, April 15, most of the locked out employees applied to the Montana Unemployment Compensation Commission for unemployment benefits. The respondents protested to the Commission against payments to these employees. The Montana law denies benefits to a claimant whose unemployment \u201cis due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute\u201d at the place of his last employment (subject to certain exceptions not here relevant). Also a claimant is disqualified for any week in which he has received employment exceeding an eight-hour day and wages exceeding $15. Respondents, in their protest to the Commission, asserted these employee^ were involved in a work stoppage because of a labor dispute, within the meaning of the law\u2019s disqualifying clause. But apparently to make sure that no benefit payments would be made, each employer, on April 17, called his employees to return to work on April 19, at a specified hour, and to work on April 19 and 20 until each had earned $16 in that week. In like manner they were called to work on two days in the succeeding week to earn another $16.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">When these employees requested guidance from the Union, they were urged to comply with the employers\u2019 call to work, and when they did so, on April 19, they were kept on until such time, on April 20, as their earnings reached $16. Then they were released. The same thing happened during the following week, when each employee was permitted to earn $16 on April 26 and April 27. On April 27, a new contract was concluded and reemployment then became regular and the so-called intermittent lockout terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The Board by a vote of three to two, held that thus locking out their recalled employees \u201cwas a manipulation of tenure and terms of employment which infringed upon the collective bargaining rights of these employees and tended to discourage support of the Union and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>certed activity for mutual aid or protection in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">In one respect the situation here was anomalous; for as the record shows, when the claims of these employees for unemployment compensation were ultimately determined, a month after the strike was over, the Montana Commission denied them, holding that the work stoppage existed because of a labor dispute at Respondents\u2019 stores. This means that at no time were the employees entitled to the claimed benefits. So the net result of the recall of the employees was that they were able to earn $16 each week \u2014 just $16 more than they would have had had the original lockout been maintained without interruption. If the recall device was intended as an economic weapon, actually, to the extent of $16 a week, it operated as an economic aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We consider first the asserted violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3), that Respondent\u2019s conduct here had amounted to a practice \u201cby discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d The primary question here is, where is there discrimination? The Board\u2019s decision furnishes no</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">answer to this question, \u2014 it is not there discussed or even noticed. The employers\u2019 action in recalling their employees, and then releasing them was, as the Board\u2019s decision discloses, in no sense selective, \u2014 it operated as to all employees; none were preferred; none were excluded; all were treated alike. As the Board put it, each employer \u201crequested its employees to report to work at specified hours.\u201d On April 20 \u201cas soon as each recalled employee had earned a total of $16, he was again released by his employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">\u201cThe language of \u00a7 8(a) (3) is not ambiguous. The unfair labor practice is for an employer to encourage or discourage membership by means of discrimination. Thus this section does not outlaw all encouragement or discouragement of membership in labor organizations; only such as is accomplished by discrimination is prohibited.\u201d Radio Officers etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 347 U.S. 17, 42, 74 S.Ct. 323, 337, 98 L.Ed. 455. Whether the conduct of these employers violated some other section of the Act is something we shall have occasion to consider later in this opinion. But so far as \u00a7 8(a) (3) is concerned, to treat this conduct as discretionary action under that section finds no basis in reason or in precedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>There is no suggestion in this case that the respondent employers were hostile to the Union as such. The stipulation shows that this same Employers\u2019 Council had recognized and dealt with the Union since 1948 as the authorized representative of their employees. In this respect the case is like National Labor Relations Board v. Adkins Transfer Co., 6 Cir., 226 F.2d 324, 328, where the court noted: \u201cRespondent had no feeling against the labor union. All of his employees were already members of the union, and his relations with them and the union were friendly and cooperative.\u201d This case bears no resemblance to that of an employer who seeks to destroy or hamper a union as such by encouraging a company union, or undercutting the union by unilateral action granting wage increases, or otherwise undertaking to make union organization impossible or difficult.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find no \u00a7 8(a) (3) violation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Nor can we find any basis in law for the finding of a violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) or of \u00a7 7 to which it refers. In view of National Labor Relations Board v. Truck Drivers Union, supra, the Board necessarily held the original lockout lawful and proper. But when the Board proceeded to hold that the employers\u2019 subsequent conduct, designed to make the lockout, and its normal results fully effective, was unlawful, we think it assumed to exercise a power which it did not have.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For until some millenium arrives when contests between the employer and his employees can be settled by some process of adjudication, it must be recognized that \u201ccollective bargaining is a brute contest of economic power somewhat masked by polite manners and voluminous statistics.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Insurance Agents Union, 361 U.S. 477, 489, 80 S.Ct. 419, 4 L.Ed.2d 454.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">\u201cThe presence of economic weapons in reserve, and their actual exercise on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized. * * * [T]he truth of the matter is that at the present statutory stage of our national labor relations policy, the two factors \u2014 \u25a0 necessity for good-faith bargaining between the parties, and the availability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>economic pressure devices to each to make the other party incline to agree on one\u2019s terms \u2014 exist side by side. * * * But as we have developed, the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception to some policy of completely academic discussion enjoined by the Act; it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents, supra, 361 U.S. at page 489, 80 S.Ct. at page 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">It is true that the language just quoted was used in a case in which a union was charged with a refusal to bargain in good faith. (A similar charge against the respondents here was rejected by the Board.) But the Court\u2019s recognition of the place of the use of economic pressure by either party to a labor dispute is just as authoritative here. It was here pointed out that when the Board in that case sought to hold that the union\u2019s economically harassing tactics, a sort of sit-down, slow-down, were unlawful it was \u201cfunctioning as an arbiter of the sort of economic weapons the parties can use in seeking to gain acceptance of their bargaining demands. It has sought to introduce some standard of properly \u2018balanced\u2019 bargaining power, or some new distinction of justifiable and unjustifiable, proper and \u2018abusive\u2019 economic weapons into the collective bargaining duty imposed by the Act.\u201d (361 U.S. at page 497, 80 S.Ct. at page 431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In recognizing the propriety of the lockout, the Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Truck Drivers Union, supra, 353 U.S. at page 93, 77 S.Ct. at page 646, noted that the employers were permitted to resort to it \u201cas an economic weapon.\u201d By that economic weapon the employers undertook to see that the union members who were proposing to pick them off one at a time by the \u201cwhipsaw\u201d tactics were denied the opportunity to collect wages while they were doing this. Here, when the Board undertook to say that this economic weapon could not be made fully effective in the manner the respondents undertook to do, the Board was \u201cpicking and choosing which economic devices of labor and management shall be branded as unlawful.\u201d As the Court said of the Insurance Agents Union, \u201cthe activities here involved have never been specifically outlawed by Congress.\u201d (361 U.S. at page 498, 80 S.Ct. at page 431.) The Board here was moving \u201cinto a new area of regulation which Congress had not committed to it.\u201d (361 U.S. at page 499, 80 S.Ct. at page 433.) It was none of the business of the Board \u201cto define through its processes what economic sanctions might be permitted negotiating parties in an \u2018ideal\u2019 or \u2018balanced\u2019 state of collective bargaining.\u201d (361 U.S. at page 500, 80 S.Ct. at page 433.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Enforcement is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">. The relevant provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended (61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.), are as follows: \u201cRights of Employees Sec. 7.

The stipulation described the respondents\u2019 efforts to prevent payment of benefits as follows: \u201cThe Respondents, taking note of prior decisions of the Montana Unemployment Compensation Commission, admittedly then sought ways and means of curtailing what they thought to be an unprincipled use of the Montana State Unemployment Compensation Fund. Being advised that a direct protest and a definitive appeal would take from weeks to years and that compensation might nevertheless be paid pending the appeal, they sought means of effectively preventing payment of unemployment compensation to the locked out employees pending an appeal. They concluded that an offer of partial reemployment which would extend longer than one shift and would permit the locked out employees to earn $16 per week would have three consequences, any one of which would disqualify the locked out employees from receiving unemployment benefits:</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">1. If the Union directed the employees not to return to work, they would become strikers and would clearly not be entitled to benefits under prior decisions of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">2. If the employees individually declined offered employment, they would disqualify themselves for benefits under the provision of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">3. If they returned to work for $16 per week, they disqualified themselves from benefits under the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b827-6\">. What sort of employer action does constitute discrimination which tends to discourage union membership is illustrated by the following cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">1.

The Board\u2019s theory is apparently suggested by that portion of its decision, above quoted, which states that respondents\u2019 action \u201ctended to discourage support of the Union.\u201d This proves too much. It might equally be said that any stand taken by an employer which effectively blocks a Union\u2019s demands was one which \u201ctended to discourage support of the Union.\u201d An employer who holds on for a wage cut when the union demands a raise, or who succeeds in filling with new recruits all places vacated by strikers, (see National Labor Relations Board v. Mackay Co., 304 U.S. 333, 58 S.Ct. 904, 82 L.Ed. 1381), would just as fully \u201cdiscourage support of the union\u201d, but no one would suggest that the Board could dictate a suspension of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">We distinguish, as this court did in Leonard v. National Labor Relations Board, 9 Cir., 205 F.2d 355, 358, cases like N.L.R.B. v. Somerset Classics, 2 Cir., 193 F.2d 613, where the lockout is used to block initial efforts to unionize the plant.
