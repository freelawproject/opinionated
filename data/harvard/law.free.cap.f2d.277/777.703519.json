The value of the amount in controversy is substantially less than $5,000 and it is abundantly clear that the federal constitutional question seasonably raised below is wholly without any substance whatever and is utterly frivolous. See Romero v. People of Puerto Rico, 1 Cir., 1950, 182 F.2d 864, 867, and cases cited, and see also Figueroa v. People of Puerto Rico, 1 Cir., 1956, 232 F.2d 615, 617, 618. The trial court issued a pretrial order and notified the parties thereof requiring them to serve each other fifteen days before the date set for trial with a list containing the documentary and oral evidence they would submit at the hearing and warned them \u201cthat in default thereof, they will be unable to introduce said evidence.\u201d The plaintiff-appellee complied with the order; the defendant-appellant, it says by inadvertence, did not. No argument is necessary to show that the defendant-appellant was not deprived of his day in court by the trial court\u2019s insistence that its pretrial order be obeyed. At the most all that is presented is a question of local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">An order will be entered dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
