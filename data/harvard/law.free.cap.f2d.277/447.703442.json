Appellant instituted a libel in admiralty against the appellee to recover expenditures made for maintenance and cure following a shipboard accident. Appellant recovered a judgment, which said judgment was paid and satisfied. In his first amended libel appellant alleges that he became disabled as a result of an accident which occurred on September 18, 1954, and that appellee had the obligation to pay the libelant maintenance at the rate of $8.00 per day, totaling $56.00, and \u201con September 27, 1954 there arose a claim for double penalty of $16.00 per day for maintenance due at $8.00 per day\u201d which continued \u201cuntil said wages due are paid as is provided in 46 U.S.C.A. [\u00a7] 596\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">The only question presented to the district court, and to this Court, is whether maintenance payments are to be considered as wages under the provisions of Title 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 596, and therefore subject to the double penalty in the event of nonpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">The district court dismissed appellant\u2019s action on the ground that maintenance is not wages and that non-payment thereof does not subject appellee to the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>We agree. See Robinson v. Swayne &amp; Hoyt, Ltd., D.C., 33 F.Supp. 93; Norris \u201cThe Law of Seamen,\u201d Volume 2, section 574, page 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
