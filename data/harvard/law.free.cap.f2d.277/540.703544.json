BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b592-26\">The only difficulty about this case is how one so simple could have become so snarled up. See Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Browning-Ferris Machinery Co., 5 Cir., 227 F.2d 804, 806. A libel in rem is filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>and the vessel seized. Without stipulation for value, costs, or a writ of release from the warrant of seizure, the ship, of foreign registry, sails merrily on her way. A default decree is entered and on a hearing ostensibly to fix the amount, the Judge decides the merits, holds no lien ever arose, and dismisses the libel. A writ of restitution is issued and a marshal\u2019s fee is assessed for executing the writ respecting a vessel long since vanished commanding restoration to those who took her away.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The whole thing started very simply. Libelant, a printing company, filed a libel in rem against the British M/V Allen\u2019s Cay. The <em>libel </em>alleged, under oath as required, that the printing company \u201cdid furnish and supply to the * * * Allen\u2019s Cay * * * certain printing material which was contracted for by the master of the vessel * * * Carl Stewart.\u201d Invoices, incorporated by reference, were annexed as exhibits and the amount due was specified to be $986.-09. On the face of the verified libel, this stated a valid claim for a maritime lien. The materials supplied were of a kind which could come within \u201cother necessaries\u201d of the Maritime Lien Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 971. See Atlantic Steamer Supply Co. v. The SS Tradewind, D.C.D.Md.1957, 153 F.Supp. 354, 1957 A.M.C. 2196. They were ordered by one \u2014 the master of the vessel \u2014 whom the statute designates as a person \u201cpresumed to have authority from the owner to procure * * * other necessaries for the vessel.\u201d 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 972. And until there is a proper denial with supporting proof to the contrary, the presumption is that the goods were furnished on the credit of the vessel. Findley v. Lanasa, 5 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 907; Point Landing, Inc. V. Alabama Drydock &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 861, 867, 1959 A.M.C. 148, 156-157.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">While the M/V Allen\u2019s Cay was still under the marshal\u2019s arrest, Carl Stewart, named in the libel as master, attempted as a self-described Claimant to file a so-called exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">Stewart, however, had not filed a sworn claim as required showing how or in what capacity it would \u201cclaim\u201d the vessel or on whose behalf,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither had he filed any stipulations either for costs or to abide decree. The District Judge declined to permit the filing of this ambiguous paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">Long after time for filing claim or answer and subsequent to the publication of the monition, libelant moved for the entry of a default decree. The Court on February 17, 1959, entered a default decree in the customary form<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ordering a further hearing to be held \u201cat which time the libelant is required to offer proof of the amount due to the libelant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">Then came the hearing on the amount of the claim. Confusion was now even more compounded. The vessel had left. There was still no sworn claim, stipulation for costs or to abide decree or writ of release. The hearing was convoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>pursuant to a default decree still outstanding and not then, or ever, attacked. Yet appearing was an attorney asserting to act as proctor on behalf of this same Carl Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The Court over protest of libelant permitted cross examination of libelant\u2019s witness by this proctor acting as friend-of-Stewart, not friend-of-the-court. This cross examination, reflected by like legal arguments in the appellee\u2019s brief before us, was not the least concerned with the dollar amount. The whole emphasis was to prove that the master (Stewart) did not order the printed material and they were not delivered to the vessel, but were rather delivered to an advertising agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We do not evaluate that evidence as it bore on these contentions, for these were matters foreclosed by the default decree. We would merely mention that in those contentions and the proof developed to support them, the case has another one of its curious peculiarities so characteristic of it generally. The facts, it was asserted, would show that the Allen\u2019s Cay was under charter with Stewart as the master. The printing was ordered from libelant by an advertising agency. But Stewart\u2019s deposition, offered on that point by libelant, was emphatic that Stewart had authorized the advertising agency to procure these printed materials. There was no effort to show that by the terms of the charter party between owner and charterer, neither the charterer nor Stewart as the charterer\u2019s master had authority to incur liens. Nor was there any suggestion, either then or since, that Stewart as master lacked authority. As master, he was one with presumed authority under 46 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 972, and even though \u201cappointed by a charterer\u201d he had like authority under \u00a7 973.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The duty of inquiry, Tampa Ship Repair &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Esso Export Corp., 5 Cir., 1956, 237 F.2d 506, 1957 A.M.C. 102, presupposes that inquiry would have revealed lack of authority. No such evidence was offered and, on the contrary, Stewart was emphatic that what the advertising agent did in procuring the printing was authorized. The act was the master\u2019s as much as though he had to put in the order himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">But the simple short of it is that such questions had been foreclosed by the default decree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe default of itself establishes the libelant\u2019s right to recover * * 2 Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7 317 at 422 (6 Ed.) We need not determine whether the Court might, or could have set it aside, or what showing would have been required to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>So long as it stood \u2014 and it still stands\u2014 the libelant was not required to offer further proof on the existence and validity of the maritime lien. The sole question libelant should have been required to meet was the <em>amount. </em>The libel was essentially one for a stated account, and this question was then the simple one of the amount of the invoices less any payments or credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">This is not to urge a procedural strictness so out of character with the liberal approach of the admiralty. What occurred here proves its substantial wisdom. What was thought to be a simple inquiry into dollars to be charged and dollars paid turned into a general investigation of circumstances surrounding the whole transaction, much of it involving the actions and authority of a person (Stewart) no longer within the United States, and hence unavailable either for investigation or as a witness. Fundamental fairness required that if such issues were still lurking undetermined in the case, libelant should have had a reasonable warning so that available evidence could be marshaled.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The libelant came prepared, as it was entitled to do, to make a limited showing. It made that. With the default decree then, and still, outstanding, the District Court was required on that showing to enter a decree for libelant. The action of the Court in entering a further decree of dismissal was erroneous and must be vacated with a decree here rendered for the libelant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">. It contained two grounds: (1) libelant corporation was not a Florida corporation and presumably had no right to maintain a suit; (2) the matters were non-maritime in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\">.

Benedict points out the substantive importance of this. \u201cAll parties who thus intervene to defend the suit are bound, in the first <em>place, to </em>make their claim to the property, or, in other words, to state their interest in it, that the court and the libelant may know whether, and to what extent, they have a right to defend the suit, for it is quite as important to the cause of justice that the libelant\u2019s rights should not be impaired by the unauthorized meddling of those who have no interest as that the claimant\u2019s rights should not be impaired by not allowing him to defend them in his own name.\u201d 2 Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7 324 at 436.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-19\">.
