The order of dismissal of the eighth cause of action was based on the ground \u201cthat the tort upon which the eighth cause of action is based is not a maritime tort\u201d and thus \u201cnot within the admiralty jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The appellant appealed to this Court from said order of dismissal in respect to the first, second, third and eighth causes of action. The trial court\u2019s order of dismissal was affirmed March 24, 1958, and rehearing was denied April 21, 1958. Clinton v. International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots of America, Inc., 9 Cir., 254 F.2d 370. In connection with the eighth cause of action, this Court stated at page 372:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201cThe eighth cause of action, against Joshua Hendy and Pacific Far East Lines, alleges the initiation of a potential tort \u2014 that of interference with appellant\u2019s contractual relation with Local 90. There is no allegation that the tort was <em>committed </em>upon navigable waters, therefore, no maritime tort sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the admiralty court is alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201cThe court below did not have jurisdiction of the action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">After the lapse of more than one year, and on July 29, 1959, appellant moved the district court to amend the order dismissing the eighth cause of action \u201cto allow an Second Amended Libel of the Eighth Cause of Action which will be properly alleged as a maritime tort under the Admiralty Extension Act, \u201846 U.S.C.A. 740\u2019.\u201d [sic] On July 30, 1959 appellant lodged with the clerk of the District Court proposed second amended libel. The District Court denied appellant\u2019s motion for amendment to the order dismissing the eighth cause of action, and ordered stricken from the files the proposed second amended libel. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The matter of amending a pleading in admiralty as to substance is within the discretion of the district court. Admiralty Rule No. 23, 28 U.S. C.A. We find no abuse of discretion by the district court. The orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
