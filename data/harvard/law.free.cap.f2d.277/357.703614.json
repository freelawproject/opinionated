Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act provides that \u201cNo objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission in [an]- application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r(b). In an application for rehearing, petitioners urged that the orders would subject petitioners to severe economic hardship and would give El Paso Natural Gas Company a \u201cwindfall\u201d. This was an appeal to the Commission\u2019s discretion. Petitioners did not contend, before the Commission, that it would be abusing its discretion or acting illegally if it denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">But petitioners now urge that (1) the Commission \u201cacted capriciously and arbitrarily and hence illegally by allowing Petitioners\u2019 rate changes to become effective on the date of their filing while refusing to allow them to become effective on the dates provided in Petitioners\u2019 contracts with El Paso Natural Gas Company\u201d, and (2) the Commission \u201cwas legally bound and erroneously refused to vindicate Petitioners\u2019 legal, equitable and contractual rights to recover the value of gas sold and delivered by them to El Paso Natural Gas Company.\u201d Since these objections were not urged before the Commission in an application for rehearing, and petitioners have not shown \u201creasonable ground for failure\u201d to urge them before the Commission, we cannot consider them. The petition for review must therefore be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Federal Power Commission v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 348 U.S. 492, 497-500, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583; Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 164, 251 F.2d 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
