This judgment acknowledged a Workman\u2019s Compensation lien in the amount of $7,241.33 in favor of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation insurance carrier, which had paid that amount in workmen compensation benefits and funeral expenses, as provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Comp.Laws Mich.1948, \u00a7 411.1 et seq. This amount was impounded in Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-19\">In an exchange of letters between the compensation insurance carrier and appellant\u2019s attorney before the action was filed, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company agreed to refrain from entering the action in the District Court through its own attorneys, and \u201cwould receive fully our compensation interest as evident at the time of such case settlement.\u201d It was not a party to the action. Following the settlement it insisted upon receiving the full $7,241.33 without reduction by reason of any of the expenses of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-20\">Appellant thereupon moved in the District Court action for an apportionment of the expenses of recovery, including attorney fees, in the total amount of $13,980.22 between her and the compensation insurance carrier, which motion the District Judge overruled. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-21\">The District Judge pointed out that the compensation insurance carrier was not a party of record in the recovery action, and since the appellant had agreed that the carrier would receive its full compensation interest, the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>had no valid claim under the provisions of Section 15, Michigan Statutes Annotated, 17.189, Comp.Laws Mich.Supp. 1956, \u00a7 413.15, for an apportionment of the expenses of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">We agree with the ruling of the District Judge. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
