The opposition was based on appellant\u2019s ownership of registration No. 386,227 for \u201cProm\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>as a trademark for collars, and on use by appellant of that mark on wing collars intended for formal wear. No question is raised as to appellant\u2019s priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">In reversing the decision of the Examiner of Interferences the Assistant Commissioner held that \u201cin view of the manner of use of \u2018Prom\u2019 by opposer and of the highly suggestive nature of the word when used on dinner jackets and winged collars, it is concluded that purchaser confusion of the type contemplated by the statute is highly improbable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVL\">The single issue here is: Does appellee\u2019s mark when applied to its goods so resemble appellant\u2019s mark that there is a likelihood of purchaser confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d) ?</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">The goods of the parties are generally similar in nature, both being articles of men\u2019s wearing apparel, but this fact is not alone a sufficient basis for sustaining an opposition. We must compare the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound and meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">The word \u201cprom,\u201d a contraction of the word \u201cpromenade,\u201d refers to a ball or dance, usually given by a particular group or class of students at a college, high school, etc. Used on articles of wearing apparel as a trademark, the word \u201cProm\u201d is suggestive of the intended use of the goods at a \u201cprom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">When the word \u201cProm\u201d is combined with the word \u201cPlaid\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>as in appellee\u2019s mark, the combined words suggest an article made of plaid for use at a prom and as such may be both descriptive of such articles, and suggestive of their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">We find, therefore, that the marks \u201cProm\u201d and \u201cProm Plaid\u201d have in common only the suggestive word \u201cprom\u201d which is not a sufficient basis for sustaining the opposition. The marks, taken in their entireties neither look nor sound alike nor do they convey the same meaning to a purchaser. For the foregoing reasons, we <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, did not participate in the decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-10\">. As pointed out in appellant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-11\">The term Plaid is a word of art and a generic term in the textile industry meaning, as stated in Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged, (1956) \u201c * * * any fabric with a woven or printed design imitating a tartan pattern or similarly cross-barred; as, a stock of Scottish plaids.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
