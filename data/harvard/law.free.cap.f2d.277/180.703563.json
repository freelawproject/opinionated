The opposition was based on appellant\u2019s prior use and registration of the marks \u201cSaf-I-Duo,\u201d \u201cSaf-I-Shield,\u201d \u201cSaf-I-Spec,\u201d \u201cSaf-I-Flex,\u201d \u201cSaf-IChem,\u201d \u201cSaf-I-Weld,\u201d \u201cSaf-I-Lens,\u201d \u201cSaf-I-Glare,\u201d and \u201cSaf-I-Spectacle,\u201d primarily for use on industrial safety equipment to protect the head and eyes, such as face shields, goggles, welder\u2019s helmets, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Since priority is not disputed and the goods of the parties are quite similar, the issue is whether concurrent use of the marks by the respective parties would result in a likelihood of confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The board was of the opinion the marks differ substantially in sound, appearance, and significance; that in view of those differences coupled with its belief that the products of the parties would ordinarily be purchased with care, confusion would not be likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We agree with the board. \u201cSafelite\u201d differs substantially from each of appellant\u2019s \u201cSaf-I-\u201d marks. Even if appellant\u2019s marks be considered as a family, as appellant urges, there would be no reason to think that \u201cSafelite\u201d was a member of that family, since, as pointed out by the board, \u201cThe family characteristic of opposer\u2019s marks is \u201cSaf-I\u201d and applicant\u2019s mark does not involve an appropriation thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Appellant stresses in its brief here its \u201cOptilite\u201d mark, which was not mentioned by the board. That mark clearly is not confusingly similar to applicant\u2019s \u201cSafelite\u201d mark, and the \u201clite\u201d portion which is the only feature common to the two marks, is suggestive as applied to optical goods. We do not think the public would be likely to make any such association of the \u201clite\u201d portion of \u201cOptilite\u201d with the \u201cSaf-I\u201d portion of appellant\u2019s other marks as to result in confusion with \u201cSafelite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
