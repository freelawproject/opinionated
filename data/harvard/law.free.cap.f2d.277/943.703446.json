The opposition was based upon The Green Shoe Manufacturing Company\u2019s prior registrations of \u201cStrideRite\u201d as a trademark for shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-19\">It has come to our attention that subsequent to the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s decision in this case, the United States District <em>Court </em>for the Southern District of New York, in The Green Shoe Manufacturing Co. v. National Shoes Inc., Civil Action 147-215, entered a consent judgment on September 10, 1959, holding that appellee\u2019s mark \u201cStride Well\u201d infringes upon appellant\u2019s registered marks; that the court permanently enjoined appellee from using its said mark; and that subsequent to that judgment, appellee filed in the Patent Office a formal abandonment of the application involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-20\">In view of those facts, it is thought that this case should be further consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ered by the Patent Office prior to a decision by this court, and accordingly the case is remanded to the Patent Office for consideration of the matters stated above, and for such further action, if any, as may be considered proper in view thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
