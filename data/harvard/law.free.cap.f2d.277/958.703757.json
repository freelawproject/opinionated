The basis of the motion is Trade-Mark Rule 2.126, 15 U.S.C.A.Appendix, which provides that the allegation of dates of use in an application for registration cannot be used as evidence in behalf of the applicant. That rule is not in point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>here since the applicant (appellee) does not seek to rely on such allegations. The pertinent Trade-Mark Rule here is Rule 2.122 which provides that the file of an application against which a notice of opposition is filed forms \u201cpart of the record of the proceeding without any action by the parties, and may be referred to for any relevant and competent purpose.\u201d In view of that provision, appellee\u2019s application is a proper part of the record here. Indeed, since the opposition proceeding was directed against appellee\u2019s application, it is difficult to see how that proceeding could be reviewed here if the application were stricken from the record. Appellant\u2019s motion to correct the record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">Appellant\u2019s priority is not disputed. The marks \u201cClamco\u201d and \u201cCameo\u201d are obviously quite similar. The board held, however, that the differences between the goods of the parties were such that concurrent use of their respective marks thereon would not be likely to result in confusion of purchasers within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Appellant\u2019s registration covers packaging equipment including \u201cheat sealers\u201d and, therefore, is evidently directed to packaging with heat-sealable material; the record shows that appellant manufactures equipment of that type.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Appellee\u2019s application covers \u201cpaper wrappering machinery.\u201d Funk and Wagnall\u2019s Dictionary defines the verb \u201cwrapper\u201d as meaning \u201cTo furnish with a wrapper,\u201d while the definition given by Webster is \u201cTo provide with a wrapper.\u201d On the basis of those definitions it would appear that \u201cpaper wrappering machinery\u201d includes machinery for providing articles with paper wrappers, or in other words, packaging them in paper. That the application contemplates such a meaning is confirmed by appellee\u2019s admission in its answer to the notice of opposition that \u201cit is using its mark Cameo for wrappering and packaging machinery.\u201d Therefore, on the basis of the statements in appellant\u2019s registration and appellee\u2019s application it appears that the two cover closely related goods which might well be expected to emanate from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The board found that the record contains no explanation as to the meaning of \u201cpaper wrappering machinery,\u201d and apparently placed the burden of showing what was meant by that term on appellant. However, since the term was first used by appellee, who has advanced no evidence as to its meaning, it would seem proper to give it the dictionary interpretation which, as above noted, includes packaging machinery. We are unable to agree with the board that because appellee\u2019s application includes several types of machinery in the field of printing and binding, its \u201cpaper wrappering material\u201d should be construed as limited to those fields. This is especially true in view of appellee\u2019s admission, above referred to, that it is using its mark on packaging machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">The board also seems to have given weight to the fact that much of the equipment sold by appellant is of a relatively small hand-operated type. However, that is not controlling since neither the application nor the registration is in any way limited to the size or manner of operation of the machinery. See Intercontinental Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Continental Motors Corp., 230 F.2d 621, 43 CCPA 841, and General Shoe Corp. v. Lerner Bros. Mfg. Co., Inc., 254 F.2d 154, 45 CCPA 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">In our opinion at least some of the goods of the parties are so similar that concurrent use by the parties of their respective marks would be likely to result in confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
