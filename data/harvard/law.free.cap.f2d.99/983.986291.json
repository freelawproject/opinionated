Appellee alleged use of its mark as early as 1886. Among the certificates of registration cited is one of January 31, 1893, and another of January 31, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>Both parties took testimony and we are confronted with quite a voluminous record. Much of the testimony on behalf of appellee is directed to the matter of showing confusion actually to have occurred and this question is argued pro and con in the' briefs.. It was the view of the Examiner of Interferences that such testimony, so far as this case is concerned, was not material on the right of registration. As we interpret the decision of the commissioner, he concurred in this view. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQJi\">\u201cBoth parties took testimony and have filed elaborate briefs. However, the issue to be determined is too simple to require extended discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-4\">\u201c* * * The determinative question presented on appeal is whether these two trade-marks so nearly resemble each other that their concurrent use on such goods would be likely to confuse the public or to deceive purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">We concur in the view so expressed as to the simplicity of the issue to be determined. Indeed, the brief on behalf of appellant, while arguing other questions which under some circumstances might be regarded as pertinent in the case, states: \u201cThe only question in this case is whether there is such similarity between appellant\u2019s composite trade-mark, which consists of the words \u2018King Kola\u2019 and the representation of a crown, and appellee\u2019s trademark \u2018Coca-Cola\u2019 that is calculated to deceive the ordinary purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">We are clearly of the opinion that the word portion of appellant\u2019s proposed mark constitutes its dominant feature. When the nature of the merchandise to which it is applied is considered, it is difficult to conceive of a purchaser giving the slightest consideration or thought to the symbol embraced in the representation of a crown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">In the case of Steinreich v. Coca Cola Co., 67 F.2d 498, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 722, cited in the decision of the commissioner in the instant case, this court affirmed the concurring decisions of the tribunals of the Patent Office, holding \u201cVera-Coca\u201d to be confusingly similar with \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d citing and discussing other cases in which there had been conflicts between \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d and other marks, as well as cases involving other conflicting words. The brief on behalf of appellee here brings to our attention numerous other cg.ses where its mark has been involved in either registration or unfair competition cases, but it does not seem necessary to review those cases here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">We concur in the view that there is such a similarity between the marks that confusion would likely result from their use on products having the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">BLAND, Associate Judge, took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">LENROOT, Associate Judge, concurs in the conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
