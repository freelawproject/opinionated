The trial court denied a similar application for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis and certified that in his opinion the assignments of error and brief in support thereof are so frivolous in their nature as to show that petitioner\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith and that \u201cthe court so finds and certifies\u201d. The statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 832, upon which the application to proceed in forma pauperis is based provides that authority may be given under the circumstances set forth in the act \u201cunless the trial court shall certify in writing that in the opinion of the court such appeal or writ of error is not taken in good faith.\u201d The right to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is entirely statutory. Kinney v. Plymouth Rock Squab Co., 236 U.S. 43, 35 S.Ct. 236, 59 L.Ed. 457. In the absence of express statutory authority this court has no right to allow a party to prosecute an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>appeal in forma pauperis. Bradford v. Southern Ry. Co., 195 U.S. 243, 25 S.Ct. 55, 49 L.Ed. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">While the language of the statute denying the right to proceed in forma pauperis in the teeth of such a certificate by the trial judge is clear on the face of the statute, it may be added that on March 8, 1938, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in Matter of Wragg, Farm Debtor, 95 F.2d 252, denied an application to proceed in forma pauperis under such \u2022circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
