The judgment was entered in appellee\u2019s favor in an action brought by him pursuant to \u00a7 3226 of the Revised Statutes, \u00cd7 Stat. 257, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1672-1673, and \u00a7 24(5) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(5), for the recovery of Federal income taxes and interest for the calendar years of 1924 and 1925, which taxes and interest were paid to appellant in his capacity as Collector of Internal Revenue for the Sixth District of California. On March 13, 1931, claims for refund of said income taxes and interest were filed by appellee with the Commissioner and thereafter, on May 27, 1931, said claims were rejected, whereupon this action was commenced December 9, 1931. The case was tried by the court without a jury, trial by jury having been expressly waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-23\">The evidence consists of a stipulation of facts and of testimony given by the appellant. The pertinent facts thus established are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-24\">In 1920 a trust known as Wilshire Crest Syndicate (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSyndicate\u201d) was created by a declaratiori of trust, of which the Title Insurance and Trust Company was the trustee. This trust was organized for the purpose of subdividing a tract of land in the City of Los Angeles. The Syndicate was in existence at all times subsequent to the year 1920, to and including the year 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">On September 1, 1920, the Syndicate acquired, for the purpose of subdivision and resale at a profit, a tract of land known as Wilshire Crest Tract. Thereafter the tract was subdivided and sale of the lots therein, the taxability of the profit from the sale of which is here in controversy, was accomplished in the years 1922 and 1923. More than 25 per centum and less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>than the total sale price of \u00bbach of the lots was paid in the year of their sale, purchase contracts being taken for the balance. Each of these contracts had a readily realizable market value equal to 30 per centum of the face amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">At the time of the organization of the trust, appellee acquired an 18/300ths beneficial interest therein, and held the same continuously from that time through and including the years 1924 and 1925 here involved. Appellee acquired and held this interest for profit. Appellee at no time personally gave his attention to the business of selling real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Subsequent to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1928 the Title Insurance and Trust Company, as trustee of said Syndicate, elected under the provisions of \u00a7 704(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the. Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 880, to have the Syndicate taxed as a trust and not as an association.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">Appellee filed Federal income tax returns for the years 1922, 1923, 1924 and 1925 and reported therein as income taxable at capital gain rates the amounts distributed to him from the Syndicate. Taxes were paid on these amounts. Subsequently, deficiencies were assessed and collected from appellee by reason of the denial of the advantage to him of such capital gain rate. These deficiencies together with interest thereon were paid to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">The sole question presented on this appeal is whether appellee is entitled to have the income which he received from the Syndicate in 1924 and 1925 .taxed at the rate for capital gains rather than at the rate for ordinary net gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-18\">Section 208<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Revenue Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>1924, 43 Stat. 262, 263, which contains the provisions applicable here, allows a taxpayer to have the tax computed on his capital net gain at the rate of 12% per centum. The same section provides the method for computation of the tax. Subsection (a) (5) of \u00a7 208 defines \u201ccapital net gain\u201d as the excess of the total amount of capital gains over the sum of certain specified deductible items. By \u00a7 208(a) (1) the term \u201ccapital gain\u201d means \u201ctaxable gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets consummated after December 31, 1921.\u201d In \u00a7 208(a) (8) the term \u201ccapital assets\u201d is defined as \u201cproperty held by the taxpayer for more than two years * * * but does not include * * * property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale in the course of his trade or business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Appellant urges two principal arguments in support of <em>his </em>position that the income derived by taxpayer from the sale of the property in question was not a \u201ccapital gain\u201d and that consequently, contrary to the holding of the District Court, taxpayer was not entitled to the advantage of the capital gain tax rate. Both attacks are directed at the conclusion of the District Court that the property involved was a \u201ccapital asset\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 208(a) (8). It is first asserted that there is a failure of proof that appellee held the land for more than two years before the sale thereof. It is argued that because legal title to the land sold was in the Syndicate the land was not held by appellee. Appellant\u2019s second contention is, that even if it be assumed that the land was \u201cheld\u201d by appellee, it still cannot be treated as a \u201ccapital asset\u201d since it has not been shown that it was not held by him \u201cprimarily for sale in the course of his trade or business.\u201d The argument is that since the Syndicate was in the business of selling the tract of land as to which it held title its activities in this regard should be imputed to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We need not decide whether the taxpayer was the \u201cholder\u201d of the property since we are in agreement with appellant that even if it be so assumed the judgment must nevertheless be reversed. This court has previously held in Richards v. Commissioner, 9 Cir. 1936, 81 F.2d 369, 106 A. L.R. 249, a case involving a factual situation similar to that here present, that the beneficiary of a trust was engaged in the business of selling real estate within the broad definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d approved by the Supreme Court in Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., 242 U.S. 503, 515, 37 S. Ct. 201, 204, 61 L.Ed. 460,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> although, as was stipulated, \u201cthe petitioner, himself, [had] never taken part in the subdivision or the sale of the lots in the subdivisions * * [page 371.] We think that the decision in the Richards Case was correct and see no reason for departing from its authority. The personal attention which a taxpayer gives to a business is certainly not decisive as to whether a resulting profit is ordinary income or capital gain. One may conduct a business through others, his agents, representatives, or employers. The business is nonetheless his because he chooses to let others hear all of the burdens of management. Appellee takes an illogical position when he argues, as he must, that the property was \u201cheld\u201d by him rather than by the trust, while in the same breath rejecting the notion that the subdivision, improvement and sale of his property, at his expense, constituted any business of his. If we are to disregard the trust entity in order to consider the beneficiary as the \u201cholder\u201d of the property, it is likewise to be disregarded in determining to whom the activities of subdivision, improvement and sale of the property should be attributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">However, even if the business of subdivision and sale of the property is to be considered as that of the trust rather than that of the beneficiaries, nonetheless the profit here involved cannot be considered a capital gain in the hands of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\"> Section 208(e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 263, and Regulation 65, Art. 1653,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> promulgated under authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of this section, extend to the beneficiary of a trust the benefit of the capital gains rate where the income distributed is capital gain to the trust. It has been\u2019 held in construing this section that though under the terms of the trust and the law of the state, income is distributable to a beneficiary only as a dividend on the trust corpus, it nevertheless is a capital gain to the beneficiary if in fact it results from the conversion of a capital asset. Letts v. Commissioner, 30 B.T.A. 800, affirmed, 9 Cir. 1936, 84 F.2d 760; McNaghten v. United States, Ct.Cl. 1937, 17 F.Supp. 509. Conversely, we think that where income is \u201cordinary income\u201d to a trust it retains the same character on distribution to the beneficiary, at least in a case such as this, where, under the provisions of \u00a7 704(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Revenue Act of 1928, the income is taxable to the beneficiary whether distributed to him or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The case of Phipps v. Commissioner, 2 Cir. 1931, 54 F.2d 469, is not in conflict with the present holding, the decision in that case being based on the conclusion that in the years in which the sales were made there had been no activity sufficient to amount to a \u201cbusiness\u201d within the meaning of the statute. In the case of Pope v. Commissioner, 6 Cir. 1935, 77 F.2d 599, it does not appear that the precise point here involved was presented'to the court, but insofar as that decision may be in conflict with our own we refuse to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Alj\"> \u201c(b) For the purpose of the Revenue Act of 1926 and prior Revenue Acts, a trust shall, at the option of the trustee exercised within one year after the enactment of this Act, be considered as a trust the income of which is taxable (whether distributed or not) to the beneficiaries, and not as an association, if such trust (1) had a single trustee, and (2) was created and operated for the sole purpose of liquidating real property as a single venture (with such powers of administration as are incidental thereto, including the acquisition, improvement, conservation,, division, and sale of such property), distributing the proceeds therefrom in due course to or for the benefit -of the beneficiaries, and discharging indebtedness secured by the trust property, and (3) has not made a return for the taxable year as an association.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> \u201cSec. 208.
