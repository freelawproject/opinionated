The petitioners were convicted in a state court of Wisconsin of the crime of murder and were sentenced to life imprisoument in the Wisconsin State Prison, The person against whom the alleged crime was committed was a licensed trader on what is known as the Bad River Indian Reservation, the alleged crime having been committed within the confines of that reservation. The reservation had been set aside under the terms of a treaty with the Federal Government as a reservation for the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and particularly \u201cfor the La Pointe band, and such other Indians as may see fit to settle with them.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> -</p>\n<p id=\"AV3\">Jt js phe contention of the petitioners, appellees, that jurisdiction to try petitioners for \u00bfe commission of the alleged crime was exclusively with the proper federal court; that the trial in the state court and the judgment rendered therein were a nuljjty and; consequently, that the petitioners were being held in prison unlawfully by the respondent-appellant, Warden of the Wisconsin State Prison. The foregoing propositions rest upon the assumption that Petitioners are Indian wards of the United Government and that by force of the laws of the Unded Sfte? the aUeg.ed crlme <em>^ </em>\u201cgmzable onI7 f a district court o\u00ed thc Untlted Stat\u201c\u00ab and,tllat the P.e' titioners are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">Congress has enacted that \u201cAll Indians committing against the person or property another Indian or othei pel son any of the following crimes, namely, murder * * * on and within a\u00fcy Indian reserVation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government * * * shall be subject to the same laws, tried in the same courts, and in the same manner, and be subject to the same penalties as are all otiler Pers\u00abns committing any of the above crimes withm the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIb\">+. The_ trial judge considered the jurisdictl0nal ^es \u00fcgation to be limited to the narrow ?uestl\u00b0n of what jurisdictional test was to be made under the ioregomg act; and jn his memorandum opinion aptly states the question thus: \u201cWho is an Indian within the meaning of that Act?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A77\">The respondent, appellant here; urges that neither of the petitioners is an Indian within the meaning of Section 548, supra, and that both, therefore, were subject to the criminal laws of the state of Wisconsin, even though the crime was committed by them on an Indian reservation. As to petitioner Pero the respondent urges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that by force of congressional enactment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pero had been made subject to the criminal laws of Wisconsin and was no longer under federal guardianship. Pero was a full-blood Chippewa Indian and respondent assumes that prior to the commission of the alleged crime Pero had been allotted lands under a \u201ctrust patent.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is a written instrument or certificate, issued to an allottee, which declares that the United States will hold the allotted land for a designated period, usually 25 years, m trust for the sole use and benefit of the allottee, or, m case of his death for the use of his heirs; and the certificate further declares that at the expiration of the trust period <em>,1 </em>tt 1 , -n <em>\u00b11 1 </em>j x the United States will convey the land to the allottee or to his heirs, m fee discharged of the trust and free of all charge .s , \u00ab j \u2022\u2022 \u2022 * or incumbrance. And it is the position oi , - , - . f <em>,.r. </em>respondent that the issuance of a certificate of competency not only freed Pero of restrictions on his power to alienate the allotted land, but also freed him from the guardianship of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"AJW\">. .... , As to petitioner Moore respondent contends that he was not an Indian for the purposes of federal jurisdiction because he had not been enrolled with any Indian tribe or on any reservation. Although Moore was not enrolled, he resided on the reservation and maintained tribal relations .. T .. - TT. - with the Indians thereon. His mother was <em>\u00a3 </em>11 i~i j j t j* * ^ . a full-blooded Indian of the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewas.

Rufus,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Wisconsin Supreme Court overruled its prior decision and held that such crimes were exclusively within the federal jurisdiction. The effeet of this holding is that by the law of Wisconsin the state court was without power to try the petitioners for the alleged offense if they were Indians within the meaning of Section 548, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AmY\">Tbe federal statute which ives federal CQUrts exdusive jurisdiction 0VSer tbe crime .Q tion wben committed b an Indian Qn an Indian reservation does not define \u201eIndian\u201e for ^ of tbe act And f <em>A , </em>,\u25a0 x we have not been cited to any section of a federal ac and we haye be\u00bfn unable find whicb ts t0 ive a defini_ ,. <em>\u00a3 !u </em>, _ f\u00edT i- <em>\u00bb \u00a3 </em>r tion of the term f Indian for purposes of . . . . . , jurisdiction m criminal causes,</p>\n<p id=\"AHu\">_ In the case of United States v.

It is but just, then, that they should be classed as Indians, and have all of the rights of the Indian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A408\">in Vezina v. United States <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the daughter of a half to three-fourths Chippewa woman and a while man was held to be by blood a member of the Fond du Lac Band of the Chippewas of Lake Superior, the court thereby overruling the action of the Department of Indian Affairs in refusing enrollment and allotment to the daughter, And in Sully, et al. v. United States,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> where one-eighth bloods were involved the court stated that the persons were of sufficient Indian blood to substantially handicap them in the struggle for existence, and held that they were Indians and were entitled to be enrolled as such.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtS\">In Doe ex dem. Lafontaine v. Avalina,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it was necessary for the court to construe a statute which forbade devises of land by Indians to persons other than Indians, except by consent of the state. The particular question was whether a three-eighths blood \u201cIndian\u201d was an Indian within the meaning of the statute. The person involved had been treated as an Indian by both whites and Indians, and spoke the language of the Indians: and her habits and mode of living were those of the Indians about her. The court discussed the tests of \u201cpreponderance of blood\u201d and of \u201cthe habits of the person\u201d; and suggested that, the purpose of the act was to protect Indians from the fraud of their neighbors and that the act should be construed for their benefit. The court held that the person was an Indian for the purposes of the statute. The Indiana court adopted what may be said to be the test of a subsiantial amount of Indian blood plus an actual racial status as an Indian. In the in-slant case petitioner Moore was an Indian under the three tests: (1) preponderance of blood, (2) habits of the person, and (3) substantial amount o\u00ed Indian blood plus a racial status in fact as an Indian,</p>\n<p id=\"ASC\">Many congressional acts relating to Indians have recognized both full-bloods and mixed-bloods as Indians for purposes of the acts. Of special significance for the present question is the treaty relating to the Chippewas of Lake Superior<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (of which Moore is a member if he is an Indian), in which the mixed-bloods were expressly mentioned, and it was recognized therein that a mixed-blood could be a member of the Chippewas. The treaty contains the following, art. 2, subd. <em>7: </em>\u201cEach * * * person over twenty-one years of age at the present time of the mixed bloods, belonging to the Chippewas of Lake Superior * * <em>*</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">We are convinced that the overwhelming weight of authority, both judicial and statutory, requires the conclusion that a child of an Indian mother and half-blood father, where both parents are recognized as Indians and maintain tribal relations, who himself lives on the reservation and maintains tribal relations and is recognized as an Indian, is to be considered an Indian within the protection of the federal guardian-ward relationship and within the meaning of \u201cIndian\u201d as used in the jurisdictional statute in question. The lack of enrollment in the case of Moore is not determinative of status. Only Indians are entitled to be enrolled for the purpose of receiving allotment and the fact of enrollment would be evidence that the enrollee is an Indian. But the refusal of the Department of Interior to enroll a certain Indian as a member of a certain tribe is not necessarily an administrative determination that the person is not an Indian, Moore\u2019s mother failed to be enrolled as a St. Croix Indian because she was too young, \u2014 not because she was not an In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>dian. She failed to be placed upon the Bad River Reservation rolls because at the time the roll was made her mother was away. And when Moore\u2019s, mother sought to have him enrolled on the Bad River Reservation rolls the enrolling officer refused to enroll him because \u201cher children belonged to the St. Croix Lost Band.\u201d Obviously a refusal of the enrolling agent to enroll Moore on the ground that he belonged to the \u201cSt. Croix Lost Band\u2019\u2019 cannot be taken as evidence that Moore is not an Indian. On the contrary it is evidence that he is an Indian.</p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">In view of the foregoing we conclude that petitioner Moore is an Indian within the meaning of Section 548, supra. And it follows both under the law of Wisconsin as announced by the Supreme Court of that state in State of Wisconsin v. Rufus, supra, as well as under the law of the United States, that the Circuit Court-of Ash-land County, Wisconsin, was without jurisdiction to hear and pronounce judgment in the cause of State of Wisconsin vs. Paul Moore, and that petitioner is being unlawfully detained in the Wisconsin State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"AHt\">Pero is admittedly a full-blood Indian, but respondent urges that he ceased to be subject to the laws of the United States when he received a certificate of competency from the Department of the Interior in 1920. The correctness of this proposition depends upon the construction of certain Federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">The congressional act, under which respondent assumes that Pero became an allottee and which declares the procedure, by force of which an allottee could become emancipated from the guardianship of the United States and become subject to the laws of Wisconsin, was enacted in 1887 and commonly k\u00f1own as the General Allotment Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This act, as amended in 1906,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to allot lands to Indians on reservations by issuing to the allottee a \u201ctrust patent,\u201d by the terms of which the United States agrees to hold the designated tract of land in trust for the allottee during a trust period of twenty-five years.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The \u201ctrust patent\u201d obligates the United States to convey the allotted land to the allottee by patent in fee simple at the expiration of the trust period; and the act declares that \u201cat the expiration of the trust period and when the lands have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee, * * * then each and every allottee * * * shall be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the State or Territory in which they may reside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AGR\">The act further provides for United States citizenship for Indians to whom allotments are made under the act and who receive patents in fee simple \u201cunder the provisions of this Act.\u201d The act contains a. proviso which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion, to issue a patent in fee simple to any allottee whenever the Secretary is satisfied that the allottee \u201cis competent and capable of managing his or her affairs\u201d; and it is further provided that \u201cthereafter all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed and said land shall not be liable to the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to the issuing of such patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APN\">In addition to the foregoing the act contains the following specific jurisdictional proviso: \u201cThat until the issuance of fee-simple patents all allottees to whom trust patents sha.ll be issued shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"ABH\">Pero was a reservation Indian and if he was allotted land under a trust patent in accordance with the terms of the General Allotment Act, as assumed by respondent, it is clear that he is still under the excluSlve jurisdiction of the United States by f\u00b0rce of that Act, unless at the expiration the trust period the allotted land was conveyed to him by a fee simple .patent, record discloses that the trust period expired prior to the date of the corn-mission of the alleged crime; but it is unquestioned that the Secretary of the Interior has not at any time conveyed the allotted land to Pero by a patent in fee simPo-</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">As stated above the only procedure by which Pero, as an allottee under the General Allotment Act, could have been freed from the \u201cexclusive jurisdiction of the United States\u201d was by a conveyance by the United States of the allotted land by a patent in fee simple at the expiration of the trust period. But the respondent urges that the failure to convey as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tlie General Allotment Statute is cured by the fact that a certificate of competency was issued to Pero under a later statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To evaluate the merit of this contention it is necessary to consider the scope and purpose of this later act and its relation to pertinent sections of the earlier statute under which respondent assumes that Pero received his allotment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Section 372 of 25 U.S.C.A. is included in \u201cAn act to provide for determining the heirs of deceased Indians, for the disposition and sale of allotments of deceased Indians, for the leasing of allotments, and for other purposes.\u201d The section authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion, to issue a certificate of competency, upon application therefor, to any Indian \u201cto whom a patent in fee containing restrictions on alienation has been or may hereafter be issued\u201d; and the issuance of \u201csuch certificate\u201d is declared to have the effect \u201cof removing the restrictions on alienation contained in such patent.\u201d Upon the receipt of a certificate of competency an owner under \u201ca patent in fee containing restrictions on alienation\u201d became in legal effect an owner in fee simple. But the application of the act is restricted to Indians who hold land under a fee simple patent with restrictions on alienation, and the sole declared purpose and legal effect of the issuance of the certificate of competency is to remove the restrictions <em>on </em>alienation contained in such patent. No language of the act purports to affect the personal status of the patentee in his relation to his tribe, or to the United States. And there is no intention to free the patentees from the jurisdiction of the United States. The act does not purport to amend the earlier General Allotment Act and there is no inconsistency between them. But assuming that the issuance of a certificate of competency under Sec. 372 to the holder of a restricted fee simple patent makes him, in law, an owner under a patent in fee simple, then such owner may become a citizen of the United States undcr Act May 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 182, 25 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 349, since the latter section declares that \u201cevery Indian born within the territorial limits of the United States to whom allotments shall have been made and who has received a patent in fee simple under the provisions of this Act, or under any law or treaty\u201d shall be \u201ca citizen of the United States\u201d and be entitled \u201cto all the rights, privileges, and immunities of such citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">It is important to note, however, that Section 349 distinguishes between the legal consequences of the receipt of a patent in fee simple by a trust allottee under the act of 1887 and the receipt by an allottee of a patent in fee simple \u201cunder any law or treaty.\u201d In the former case the allottee acquires United States citizenship and is made \u201csubject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the State\u201d in which he may reside; but in the latter case the only consequence is that the patentee becomes a citizen of the United States.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, the issuance of a certificate of competency under Section 372 has no legal consequence except in connection with a previously issued patent in fee simple with restrictions on alienation, and the language of the statute limits the legal consequences to the removal of \u201cthe restrictions on alienation contained in such patent.\u201d But in the instant case, assuming that Pero is an allottee under a trust patent and not a holder of a patent in fee simple, the Secretary of the Interior had no authority under Section 372 to issue him a certificate of competency for the purpose of removing restrictions on alienation. The only source of authority of the Secretary of the Interi- or to deal with Pero as a trust-patent allot-tee was conferred by the act of 1887 as amended, and no provision of this act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to substitute a certificate of competency for the authorized patent in fee simple. In fact there is no authorization to issue a certificate of competency to a trust patentee for any purpose. And in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>of express statutory authorization the only possible ground for a judicial holding that the issuance of a certificate of competency under Section 372 dispenses with the necessity of the issuance of a patent in fee' simple under Section 349 would be that the difference is in form only and that the congressional policy and intent under the act of 1887 is given effect by the issuance of the certificate of competency under the act of 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The scope and expressed purpose of the Act of 1910 is narrow and definitely stated. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to issue a certificate of competency to any Indian (\u201cor in case of his death to his. heirs\u201d) to whom a patent in fee containing restrictions on alienation has been, or may be issued. \u201cAnd such certificate shall have the effect of removing the restrictions on alienation contained in such patent.\u201d Since the effect of removing the restrictions on a restricted patent in fee is to put the holder in the condition of one who has received a patent in fee simple \u201cunder any law or treaty\u201d it would follow that if Pero had been the holder of a patent in fee with restrictions the issuance of the certificate of competency would have entitled him to United States citizenship under Section 349. But even in that case, under the holding in United States v. Celestine, supra, he would not have been freed from the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. That is a legal consequence which can be attached only by express declaration of Congress, and Congress did not so provide in either the act of 1887 or 1910. But Pero, if in fact a trust patent allottee under the General Allotment Act, could not be affected by any legal consequences attached by the Act of 1910 to the issuance'of a certificate of competency to the holder of a patent in fee with restrictions on alienation; and, consequently, no provision of the act of 1887,-as amended, can become effective as to Pero merely by reason of action by the Secretary of the Interior performed in accordance with, and by the authority of, the provisions of the act of 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The certificate of competency which was issued in 1920 purports to be \u201cby virtue of the power and authority vested\u201d in the first .assistant to the Secretary of the Interior by Section 1 of the Act of Congress of June 25, 1910, 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 372; and the certificate purports to invest Pero \u201cwith full power and authority to sell and convey any and all lands above described.\u201d Also the certificate recites that Pero had been found to be fully compete\u00f1t and capable of transacting his own business and caring for his own individual affairs. Section 349 of title 25 of the United States Code, 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 349, does not authorize the issuance of a certificate of competency to a trust allottee and, consequently, does not attach any legal consequences to such action. It does, however, require the Secretary of the Interior to be Satisfied that any Indian allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs befofe the Secretary is authorized to issue to the allottee a patent in fee simple. Assuming that the issuance of the certificate of competency under Section 372 can be accepted as conclusive evidence of the exercise of discretion required of the Secretary of the Interior by Section 349, it was still necessary for the Secretary to issue a patent in fee simple in order to free Pero from the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Since Congress expressly provided that the Secretary of the Interior should first be satisfied that a trust allot-tee was competent and capable of managing his own affairs as a condition precedent to the issuance of patent in fee simple, it would seem to be doing violence to legislative intent for this court to substitute a certificate of competency for both the determination of competency and the final and essential act of issuing the patent in fee simple. And special force is added to the foregoing since the issuance of a patent in fee simple by the Secretary is not mandatory upon his being satisfied that a trust allottee is competent and capable of managing his own affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">But even if we should consider the issuance of the fee simple patent to be a mere formality, we are met with the obvious intent of Congress, to treat this formality as a necessary condition precedent to the release of a trust allottee from the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. We cannot disregard designated -formality in construing and applying acts of Congress when it is clearly the intent of Congress that legal consequences be attached to the form rather than to the substance. It is not an uncommon legislative device to attach legal consequences to a formality on the assumption that the performance of the required formality is the best assurance that proper consideration has been given to matters of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>But, as a matter of substance, we are confronted with the further difficulty that an exercise of the discretion contemplated in Section 372 does not involve the same considerations as the exercise of discretion by the Secretary of the Interior under Section 349. We must assume that when the Assistant Secretary of the Interior, in the exercise of his discretion, issued the certificate of competency he considered only the legal consequences which are attached by the provisions of Section 372 under which he issued the certificate. And as pointed out above the only legal consequence contemplated was the removal of restrictions on alienation. The Secretary was not required to consider the serious consequences of emancipation of Pero from the jurisdiction of the United States either as they affected Pero or as they would give effect to the policy of the United States. The foregoing necessarily would not have been present to the mind of the Secretary of the Interior if he had been intending to exercise his discretion to issue a certificate of competency to an Indian, to whom a patent in fee containing restrictions on alienation had been issued. But under Section 349 it is obvious that the Secretary of the Interior in exercising his discretion to issue a patent in fee simple to a trust allottee ought to be satisfied not only that the allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs, but also that it would be to the best interest of the allottee for the allottee to become emancipated from the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and become subject to the laws of the state in which he resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">But apart from the foregoing we are bound by the clearly expressed intent of Congress that \u201cuntil the issuance of fee-simple patents all allottees to whom trust patents shall be issued shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d We cannot hold that the certificate of competency, which obviously was mistakenly issued under the Act of 1910, if Pero was a trust allottee, satisfies the definitely expressed requirement of another act of Congress that there be not only a determination of competency, but also the formal issuance of a patent in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In the foregoing discussion we have accepted respondent\u2019s assumption that Pero was the holder of a trust patent under the General Allotment Act of 1887 as amended in 1906. Petitioners do not directly question respondent\u2019s assumption. But the record of agreed statement of facts shows only that Pero held an allotment of land as a \u201crestricted allotment\u201d; that such allotments \u201cwere not subject to conveyance by the owners without permission of the Indian Department or the Federal Government of the United States;\u201d .that Pero had received a \u201ccertificate of competency\u201d under the Act of 1910 which recited that all restrictions had been removed from Pero\u2019s land. The foregoing describe a patent in fee with restrictions more accurately than a \u201ctrust patent\u201d; and the Assistant Secretary of the Interior evidently thought that Pero held under a patent in fee with restrictions on alienation, since he issued a certificate of competency under the Act of 1910, which as pointed out above, was authorized only for holders of patents in fee with restrictions <em>on </em>alienation. And if, as the foregoing facts indicate, Pero was an allottee under a restricted patent in fee, the certificate of competency properly was issued under the act of 1910, but at the most could have had the legal effect of removing restrictions on alienation by force of the act of 1910 and of making Pero a citizen of the United States by force of the act of 1887.*<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">We conclude that the District Court did not err in holding that petitioners Moore and Pero are under the'exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and that jurisdiction over them in connection with the alleged offense was exclusively in the Federal District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of Wisconsin is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-27\"> Treaty of Sept. 30, 1854, 10 Stat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A6y\"> 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 548.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-64\"> 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 372.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ANX\"> 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AXj\"> State v.
