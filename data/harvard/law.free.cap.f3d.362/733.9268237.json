Rainey appeals the district court\u2019s determination, upon remand, that a 1987 Florida conviction for attempted arson is a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e), and the court\u2019s subsequent imposition of an armed-career-criminal enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. On appeal, Rainey argues that attempted arson is neither an \u201cenumerated offense\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), nor a \u201cqualifying offense\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. Rainey argues that his actions did not constitute arson because he burned only his own clothing because of bedbugs and as an act of protest protected by the First Amendment. He asserts that the district court failed to notice this evidence by not examining the charging document. Rainey contends that, had the court reviewed the document, it could not have classified his offense as arson because no evidence of intentional harm to any person or structure existed. Finally, Rainey argues that the terms \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as used in the Sentencing Guidelines, and \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) are not interchangeable. Thus, Rainey contends that the fact that he was convicted of a crime of violence does not necessitate a finding that he also committed a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1346 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1089, 123 S.Ct. 707, 154 L.Ed.2d 634 (2002). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular offense constitutes a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>286 F.3d 1324, 1325 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 892, 123 S.Ct. 160, 154 L.Ed.2d 157 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Section 924(e) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">(1) In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony ..., such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">(B) [T]he term \u201cviolent felony\u201d means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), (e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">Section 4B1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \u201c[a] defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is an armed career criminal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a). Section 4B1.4 incorporates by reference the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2), but also provides that the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2) is not identical to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, comment, (n.l). Section 4B1.2 provides a definition for \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d a term used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender guideline, that is virtually identical to \u00a7 924(e)\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The only difference in the two definitions is that \u00a7 4B1.2 states \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d not just \u201cburglary.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Florida law, at the time of Rainey\u2019s attempted arson conviction, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhF\">(1) Any person who willfully and unlawfully, by fire or explosion, damages or causes to be damaged: (a) Any dwelling, whether occupied or not, or its contents; [or] (b) Any structure, or contents thereof, where persons are normally present, such as: jails, prisons, or detention centers ... is guilty of arson in the first degree, which constitutes a felony of the first degree....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Fla.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 806.01(2) (1987). Florida law also provided that if a defendant was convicted of an attempt to commit a first degree felony, he would be guilty of a second degree felony and that if he was convicted of an attempt to commit a second degree felony, he would be guilty of a third degree felony. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 777.04(4)(b), (c) (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court held that, when determining whether a particular offense is a violent felony, \u00a7 924(e) \u201cgenerally requires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,\u201d not to the particular facts of the defendant\u2019s conviction. 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">We have not addressed the issue of whether an attempt to commit an enumerated felony under \u00a7 924(e) constitutes a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). However, two of our prior decisions provide helpful guidance. In <em>Wilkerson, </em>the defendant received an armed-career-criminal enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 924(e), due in part to a prior Florida conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery. <em>Wilkerson, </em>286 F.3d at 1325. We first noted that we had determined in a previous decision that robbery itself is a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) because it presents a serious risk of physical injury to another. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>57 F.3d 1012, 1017-18 (11th Cir.1995)). We then held that \u201ca conspiracy that has as its object the offense of robbery likewise presents such a risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant argued that because Florida law did not require an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, the offense did not constitute a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>We disagreed, noting that \u201c[w]hen one reaches an agreement with a co-conspirator to commit a robbery, and formulates the intent to commit the robbery, his conduct presents at least a potential risk of physical injury within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">In <em>United States v. Mendoza-Cecelia, </em>963 F.2d 1467, 1479 (11th Cir.1992), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Coleman v. Singletary, </em>30 F.3d 1420 (11th Cir.1994), we held that attempted arson is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined under \u00a7 4B1.2. In reaching this decision, we noted that arson is an enumerated offense in the definition of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 provides that attempts to commit the enumerated felonies are also crimes of violence. <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l). While the terms \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201cviolent felony\u201d are not interchangeable, <em>Mendoza-Cecelia </em>provides helpful guidance because the definitions for both terms are virtually identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) enumerates arson as a violent felony. Following the reasoning of <em>Wilkerson </em>and <em>Mendoza-Cecelia, </em>we conclude that attempted arson should also be considered a violent felony. Attempt, like conspiracy, presents the potential risk of physical injury to another. Because attempted arson presents a serious potential risk of injury to another person, we hold that the district court correctly concluded that it is a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). As such, we affirm Rainey\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
