This was a motion to dismiss this appeal, so restored to the docket, upon affidavits explaining respondent\u2019s failure to appear, and setting forth the facts upon which the appeal should be dismissed. But the court refused the motion, no facts being stated, except such as accrued prior to the order restoring the case to the docket, at which time the respondent had his opportunity to present these facts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
