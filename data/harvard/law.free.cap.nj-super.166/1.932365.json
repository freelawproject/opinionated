A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AvL\">Plaintiff brought this action against her son Ralph Biddle and her son\u2019s former wife Patricia Biddle to impose an equitable lien based on an alleged purchase money resulting trust upon Ralph and Patricia\u2019s former marital residence in Little Silver. Ralph defaulted. On the day of trial prior to the presentation of testimony Patricia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>successfully moved to dismiss the complaint and plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Plaintiff advanced money to her son Ralph and his then wife Patricia for nse as payment on a lot and a home subsequently built thereon. Plaintiff claims that the advance was a loan and that she, Ralph and Patricia agreed that she was to have an equitable interest in the property and was to be paid a sum proportionate to her contribution (57%) if it was ever sold. Patricia contends the advance was an unconditional gift. Legal title was held by Ralph and Patricia as tenants by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">When Patricia and Ralph Biddle litigated their divorce action, plaintiff moved to intervene therein in order to assert her claim to an interest in the property. She apparently contended that her interest should be considered when the matrimonial judge determined the value of the property and the subject of equitable distribution. Her motion was denied and no appeal or motion for leave to appeal therefrom was taken. At the trial of the divorce action Ralph apparently argued that plaintiff\u2019s lien claim reduced the value of the premises subject to equitable distribution and increased the debts he and his wife owed. Plaintiff testified in the divorce action in support of her lien claim. The divorce judgment expressly awarded Patricia full title to the premises \u201cfree and clear of any alleged liens by Ralph T. Biddle and Anna M. Biddle against the title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The divorce judgment was never appealed. Four months after entry of that judgment plaintiff filed this action asserting her claim to a lien on the premises. The trial judge granted Patricia\u2019s motion to dismiss this action, concluding that the judgment in the divorce action barred relitigation of plaintiff\u2019s claim. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"> Generally, adjudication of an issue or claim does not, by operation of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, bar a person not a party or privy to a party to the prior action from seeking another adjudication of the issue or claim because every person is entitled to his day in court. <em>Brunetti v. New Milford, </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>576, 587 (1975) ; <em>Bd. of Directors, Ajax, etc., v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Princeton, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>456, 463 (1960); <em>Lehigh Zinc and Iron Co. v. N. J. Zin, and Iron Co., </em>55 <em>N. J. L. </em>350, 357 (E. &amp; A. 1893): Restatement, <em>Judgments </em>2d (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1975), \u00a7 78(3) at 2; 46 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Judgments, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 518-519 at 669-673. Here Ralph Biddle could not be plaintiff\u2019s privy by operation of law because his legal ownership interest in the land, a tenancy by the entirety, conflicted with plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>Bd. of Directors, Ajax, etc., supra </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>at 463. Plaintiff plainly was not a party to the divorce action. However, Patricia argued, and the trial judge found, that plaintiff\u2019s alleged participation in the divorce action and Ealph\u2019s assertion of her claim as part of his case established that plaintiff actually consented to adjudication of her claim therein, received her day in court, and was bound by the divorce judgment notwithstanding her non-joinder as a party to that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Defendant\u2019s contentions suggest several possible theories that might bar plaintiff from bringing this action. Plaintiff may have expressly or impliedly authorized her son to prosecute the claim in her behalf, making him her representative in fact and binding her to the adjudication. <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1975), \u00a7 85(1) (b) at 56, and comment (b) thereto at 59-60; 50 <em>C. J. S. Judgments </em>\u00a7 776(a) at 306; 46 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Judgments, </em>\u00a7 538 at 694-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>695; see <em>Lyon v. Stanford, </em>42 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>411, 414-415 (E. &amp; A. 1886). Plaintiff may have controlled or substantially participated in control of the presentation of her claim to the extent that she was a real party, not a nominal party, and therefore should be barred from relitigation. <em>Petersen v. Preferred Accident Ins. Co., </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>180, 183 (E. &amp; A. 1935); <em>Ludy v. Larsen, </em>78 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>237, 242 \u2014 243 (E. &amp; A. 1911); <em>Lyon v. Stanford, supra </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>at 414; <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1975), \u00a7 83 at 44; 46 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Judgments, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 535-537 at 688-694; 50 <em>C. J. S. Judgments </em>\u00a7\u00a7 782-783 at 317-320, \u00a7\u00a7 785-786 at 321-322. Possibly plaintiff actually did submit her claim for adjudication notwithstanding the denial of her motion to intervene. <em>Miller v. Headley, </em>109 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>436, 433-444 (Ch. 1932), aff\u2019d <em>o.b. </em>112 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>89 (E. &amp; A. 1933); <em>Lake v. Weaver, </em>80 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>395, 401 (Ch. 1912), aff\u2019d o.b. 80 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>554 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A. 1912); <em>Sbarbero v. Miller, </em>72 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>248, 254 (Ch. 1907), aff\u2019d o.b. 74 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>453 (E. &amp; A. 1908); 50 <em>C. J. S. Judgments </em>\u00a7 784 at 320. Indeed, the trial judge on the motion to dismiss found that Ralph had advanced plaintiff\u2019s claim on her behalf and that she had participated to the full extent possible as if her motion to intervene had been granted. However, the judge\u2019s conclusions could only have been the result of speculation because Patricia did not provide him with an adequate record to make any factual findings with respect to her contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">It was incumbent upon Patricia as the party asserting a bar by judgment, to present to the judge so much of the record of the divorce proceeding as was necessary to support her contention that plaintiff should have been bound by the judgment. See <em>State v. Ebron, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>207, 215-217 (1972); <em>Robinson-Shore Develop. Co. v. Gallagher, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>59, 68 (1958); <em>Knutsen v. Brown, </em>96 <em>N. J. Super. </em>229, 234-237 (App. Div. 1967). Patricia only supplied the trial judge with a copy of the matrimonial judge\u2019s short written opinion and the divorce judgment. No transcripts of the trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>depositions or the motion to intervene were provided. The available record showed only that Ealph had raised the question of plaintiff\u2019s lien, that he and the plaintiff had testified and that the judge did not find them credible. The opinion provided that if plaintiff was to be repaid anything, Ealph should pay her, but did not conclude that a particular debt did or did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"> Plainly participation in a trial as a witness does not, without more, bind one to the determination therein, <em>State v. Redinger, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>41, 46 (1973); <em>Bacon v. Fay, </em>63 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>411 (Ch. 1902), nor does a mere familial relationship to a party in the action. See <em>Rizzi v. Pohan, </em>102 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>239 (E. &amp; A. 1928). Furthermore, a person who has unsuccessfully attempted to intervene in an action prior to entry of judgment is not bound as to the claims adjudicated therein unless he is thereafter represented by one who is a party. 46 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Judgments, </em>\u00a7 530 at 680; 50 <em>C. J. S. Judgments </em>\u00a7 781 at 317; <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1975), \u00a7 78, Reporter\u2019s Note at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Nothing in this record demonstrates the extent of plaintiff\u2019s participation in the presentation of her claim at the divorce trial or her submission to that forum. The record shows only that plaintiff was a witness in the prior proceeding. Accordingly, the trial judge should not have granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on the record presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Our review of the remarks and conclusions of the trial judge persuades us that he has in effect given his opinion on the substantive merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim. On remand the cause should be heard by a different trial judge. <em>R. </em>1:12-1 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Eeversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The record does not reveal the ultimate disposition with respect to Ralph Biddle. By virtue of the divorce judgment between him and Patricia, she was awarded full title to the premises in question. Plaintiff disavowed any intention to seek money damages from Ralph at present and sought a voluntary dismissal as to him. The judge denied it, but stated he would \u201ccertify\u201d the dismissal as to Patricia as a final judgment, presumably under <em>R. </em>4:42-2. No order under <em>R. </em>4:42-2 or dismissal or other resolution as to Ralph appears in the record. This is therefore an appeal from an interlocutory order. Nonetheless, we grant leave to appeal <em>mino wo tunc </em>and consider the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
