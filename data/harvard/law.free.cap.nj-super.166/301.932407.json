A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">Defendant was indicted for the felony-murder of Graham Manning, the robbery from him of $61 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and possession of a dangerous knife. A two-day trial before Judge Loftus in June 1976 resulted in a mistrial on the court\u2019s own motion. Thereafter defendant was tried before Judge Loftus and a jury in October 1976 and found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was denied. Defendant appeals, contending that (1) his inculpatory statement was improperly admitted into evidence; (2) he was entitled to a second <em>Miranda </em>hearing at the retrial; (3) his counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Arnold was improperly restricted; and (4) the trial judge committed plain error in not charging the jury on second degree murder <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The State contended that defendant killed Manning during the course of a robbery in the men\u2019s room of Jordan\u2019s Lounge in Newark on February 20, 1976. Defendant contended that his brother-in-law Eonda, who was in his company that evening, was the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">At the <em>Miranda </em>hearing held before the aborted initial trial in June 1976 the State produced the testimony of Detectives Clark and Arnold and Officer Martinez to support its contention that the confession was voluntary and was taken after full <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given four times and bilingo ally. Defendant did not testify or offer any proof at the <em>Miranda </em>hearing. The trial judge found that defendant, who admitted an 11th grade education during the questioning, gave a fully voluntary inculpatory statement after the appropriate warnings were given and waived in writing. The trial judge\u2019s conclusions were fully supported by the evidence. The trial judge found that defendant was \u201cwell versed\u201d in English but nonetheless was provided with the bilingual interpreter, Martinez, to assist his understanding of the written confession and insure its accuracy. She also found that \u201cthe <em>Miranda </em>warnings were properly given to Mr. Lopez, once at the scene, once at 11:30, once at 2:25 in English, and then finally, 4:15 in Spanish. I further find that he did knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>As to voluntariness the trial judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">There\u2019s nothing in the record in any way, that would, in any way indicate that any police brutality was employed here. There\u2019s nothing to indicate there was any undue pressure put on Mr. Lopez to give the statement. There\u2019s nothing to indicate that there was any physical violence employed against him. Nothing to indicate that there was any threats employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The judge noted that the \u201conly slight fact\u201d in the record was that defendant broke down and cried. This she found to be a normal nervous reaction to his admission of what had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Defendant now contends that it was reversible error for the trial judge not to afford him a second <em>Miranda </em>hearing at the retrial. This argument was first raised at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial. Defendant never requested a <em>Miranda </em>hearing before or during the retrial. Indeed, at the new trial motion hearing Judge Loftus observed that defendant\u2019s trial counsel signed a pretrial order which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">6. Is voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statement in issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avt\">Yes \u2014 Miranda hearing already heard \u2014 law of the case applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">It is true that in <em>State v. Hale, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>407 (App. Div. 1974), this court held that in the event of a retrial a second <em>Miranda </em>hearing was appropriate. Since the <em>Miranda </em>hearing is part of the actual trial, and is not considered a pretrial proceeding, as is, for example, a motion to suppress evidence under <em>R. </em>3:5-7(a), the so-called Taw of the case\u201d doctrine is not strictly applicable to the retrial. As we noted in <em>Hale, </em>\u201cThe State and defendant were returned to their original positions as if there had not been a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413. However, we do not view Hale. as mandating a new trial in this situation. Any error below was, if not actually invited, condoned by trial counsel\u2019s acquiescence in the pretrial stipulation that the <em>Miranda </em>hearing, conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>as part of the initial aborted trial, governed the subsequent proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Nor has defendant suffered any deprivation by such technical error. In <em>State v. Miller, </em>67 <em>N. J. </em>229 (1975), and <em>State v. Kelly, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>283 (1972), our Supreme Court confronted situations where the trial judges failed to conduct any hearings on the voluntariness or legality of defendant\u2019s statements but in all other respects the convictions were affirmable. Eather than reversing for a new trial the Supreme Court remanded the matters to the trial judges for <em>Kvid. B. </em>8(3) hearings. In the event the statements were found to be involuntary, or in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>the judgments would be reversed and new trials held; if they were not, the convictions stood, subject to appellate review of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In the present case defendant has received his constitutional entitlement. His inculpatory statement has been found admissible by a factfinder other than his trial jury. In <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 <em>U. S. </em>368, 84 <em>S. Ct. </em>1774, 12 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 908 (1964), the United States Supreme Court held that the procedures for threshold rulings on the constitutional admissibility of inculpatory statements must \u201cbe fully adequate to insure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession, including the resolution of disputed facts upon which the voluntariness issue may depend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391. The high court further stated that \u201cwhether the trial judge, another judge, or another jury, but not the convicting jury, fully resolves the issue of voluntariness is not a matter of concern here * * * [t]he States are free to allocate functions between judge and jury as they see fit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at fn. 19. There was no constitutional compulsion that the independent hearing be an integral part of the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Defendant did testify at the retrial in support of his contention that his brother-in-law Eonda was the culprit. Defendant also claimed that he confessed only because Eonda threatened to harm defendant\u2019s wife and that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>not given the proper warnings. At defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial Judge Loftns reviewed defendant\u2019s trial testimony pertinent to the legality of the inculpatory statement admitted into evidence in the State\u2019s case. In view of defendant\u2019s belated claim, she made the following additional specific findings relevant to voluntariness and the <em>Miranda </em>warnings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">*\u25a0 * * xhe Court heard and observed Mr. Lopez when he was on the stand testifying with regard to the statement. Mr. Lopez indicated he didn\u2019t read the paper which was S-8 and that he couldn\u2019t read English and that Mr. Orantes had told him to sign it. He testified that Mr. Martinez who was the detective who spoke Spanish had never been brought into the room and never did in fact read the questions or anyway translate the questions to him or translate answers to him. He indicated that all the questions and the answers were made up by the police department. So I certainly had an opportunity to consider his position with regard to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. I have reviewed my notes thereto and I have reviewed my notes with regard to the original hearing under <em>Miranda </em>\u2014 original hearing. Detectives Clark and Arnold and Martinez testified with regard to the very specific times that they did certain actions, the very specific procedure they engaged in certain actions and the original finding that I made with regard to that case are hereby incorporated in what I am just discussing. But there is no question that after having observed those three detectives testifying I concluded at that time that they were truthful, their testimony clearly indicated that Mr. Martinez was brought in and did in fact read the questions and the answers to Mr. Lopez in Spanish, had an opportunity to observe Mr. Martinez at the original hearing and find his testimony truthful. I don\u2019t believe Mr. Lopez\u2019s testimony when he says that Mr. Martinez was not in there and did not read the questions to him. I don\u2019t believe Mr. Lopez\u2019s testimony that all the answers were made up by the Newark Police Department, nor do I believe Mr. Lopez\u2019 testimony that Ronda Orantes threatened him and said if he didn\u2019t sign it, the paper, he would get his wife. I had a full opportunity to observe Mr. Lopez during the trial and just even limiting myself to the area of his testimony relating to the <em>Miranda </em>warning I find his testimony was incredible. So therefore, even assuming for the purpose of argument that I should have held a <em>Miranda </em>hearing, I hereby put on the record that taking into consideration Mr. Lopez\u2019 testimony as well as the testimony of Detective Clark and Arnold and Martinez that in fact, Mr. Lopez was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings in accordance with <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. <em>S. </em>436, 86 S. <em>Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 694 I further find that he knowingly and intelligently waived those rights and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>find that he voluntarily did make a <em>statement to the </em>police on the day in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">If the trial judge had been impressed by defendant\u2019s trial testimony that the confession was gained involuntarily and without warnings, she was then free to grant defendant a new trial, and she no doubt would have done so. Her findings that defendant\u2019s contentions were groundless are well supported by the evidence. Since these findings were independent of the general verdict and made by a different factfinder than the convicting jury they are independently \u25a0reviewable and satisfy the due process standards articulated in <em>Jackson v. Denno, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel does not suggest any additional proofs which the trial judge might possibly have considered on an <em>Evid. B. </em>8(3) hearing on the admissibility of defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement, nor does our review of the substantial record of both trials suggest any. There is therefore no necessity for a remand, as in <em>Stale v. Miller, </em>and <em>State v. Kelly, supra. </em>The trial court heard all testimony relevant to the admissibility of the inculpatory statement and ruled firmly and conclusively against defendant. He was entitled to no more under the Federal Constitution or under our State procedures. <em>Evid. R. </em>8(3); <em>State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>250 (1972). Any error was technical at best and clearly incapable of producing an unjust result, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, because we are able on appellate review to make a \u201cfull and reliable determination\u201d of the due process conditions for admissibility ruled upon by the trial judge. <em>Jackson v. Denno, supra, </em>378 <em>U. S. </em>at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge improperly restricted the cross-examination of Detective Arnold concerning \u2019the police\u2019s initial suspicion of Eonda. Arnold did testify that Eonda was initially detained as a suspect. The <em>voir dire </em>testimony clearly established the lack of substance in defendant\u2019s theory that a \u201cdeal\u201d had been struck between Eonda and the police. Hnder the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>circumstances the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in limiting Arnold\u2019s cross-examination. <em>State v. </em>Petillo, 61 <em>N. J. </em>165, 169 (1972), <em>cert. </em>den. 410 <em>U. S. </em>945, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>1373, 35 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 611 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Nor do we find any merit in defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge committed \u201cplain error\u201d in not, on her own motion, charging the jury on second degree murder. The case was clearly tried by both sides on an \u201call or nothing theory.\u201d At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial his defense counsel admitted to trying the case solely on a felony-murder theory and attempting to convince the jury that Ronda, not defendant, committed the robbery-murder. Counsel\u2019s summation was presented solely on that basis. There is no scintilla of evidence in the record to suggest any theory other than murder during the course of a robbery. The victim\u2019s wallet and paper currency were missing when his body was found. In defendant\u2019s statement he admitted stabbing the elderly victim several times when he struggled in resistance to defendant\u2019s knifepoint demand for money. There was no other tenable theory of homicide than robbery-murder. <em>State v. Harper, </em>128 <em>N. J. Super. </em>270 (App. Div. 1974), certif. den. 65 <em>N. J. </em>574 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
