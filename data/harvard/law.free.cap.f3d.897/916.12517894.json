Facebook allows users to connect with each other by establishing \"friend\" relationships and posting items to a personal feed that can be viewed by the user's friends. That evening, one of Ross's Facebook friends posted an image\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (or meme) that showed a number of different firearms below the title \"Why I need a gun.\" Above each type of gun was an explanation of what the gun could be used for-e.g., above a shotgun: \"This one for burglars &amp; home invasions\"; above a rifle with a scope: \"This one for putting food on the table\"; and above an assault rifle: \"This one for self-defense against enemies foreign &amp; domestic, for preservation of freedom &amp; liberty, and to prevent government atrocities.\" Ross interpreted this post as advocating against gun control measures. Ross, an advocate in favor of gun control measures, commented on the post: \"Which one do I need to shoot up a kindergarten?\" Ross then logged off Facebook and went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The post (including Ross's comment) was soon deleted, but not before a cousin of the person who originally posted the meme took a screenshot of it. The cousin then forwarded the screenshot to a yet another person, a mutual cousin, without any annotation or additional commentary. That individual, in turn, shared it with her husband-Ryan Medlin, a member of the City of Jackson Police Department. Around 5:30 p.m. on January 26, 2015, Medlin, who was off duty at the time, forwarded the screenshot to two other members of the Jackson Police Department, Anthony Henson and Toby Freeman. Henson and Freeman were off duty as well, but they followed up on the post when they arrived at work. Freeman, a member of the investigation division, determined that James Ross had authored the comment and that he worked at the Casey's gas station in Fruitland, Missouri. None of the officers conducted any additional investigation into either Ross or the post before Henson and Freeman drove to Casey's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meanwhile, Ross had started his shift at Casey's at 2 p.m. on January 26. Henson and Freeman arrived between 7 and 8 p.m. Ross was in the kitchen with three other employees when one of the officers asked to speak with him. Ross did not know the person was a police officer (he was not in uniform) and assumed he was a customer. When Ross walked out of the kitchen, the officers immediately arrested him. One of the officers told him they were there because of a post on the internet, but neither officer asked Ross any questions about the post or his comment. Nor did they ask Ross any questions about his interest in, or ownership of, firearms. Unprompted, however, Ross told the officers that his comment on Facebook was not serious, that it was meant to be a joke, and that he was willing \"to clear this up right here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ross was placed in handcuffs and escorted out of the store to a police car in full view of his co-workers. Once Ross was in the car, the officers read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and took him to the police station. At the station, Ross was questioned by Medlin. Ross wrote out a statement explaining what he meant by his comment on the post. He was then interviewed-wherein Ross was able to further explain what happened. According to Ross, several officers at the station told him they did not think the case was likely to go any further than the prosecuting attorney's office. However, Ross was not allowed to leave. He was held at the Jackson Police Station until the next day, during which time he was served with a warrant for \"Peace Disturbance.\" The next day, he was transferred to the Cape Girardeau County Jail where he was held for another two to three days, until he bonded out by paying $1000 in cash. At some point during that period, Ross was formally charged with the class B misdemeanor of \"Peace Disturbance\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20574.010\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 574.010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(c) (2015). On April 7, 2015, the charges against Ross were formally dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2015, Ross filed a lawsuit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that the officers had violated his constitutional rights under the First and Fourth Amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After discovery, based on the undisputed facts, both parties moved for\n   summary judgment. The district court granted the officers summary judgment, reasoning that they were entitled to qualified immunity because the rights that Ross asserted had not been clearly established at the time that they were violated. Ross appeals the district court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Qualified immunity is designed to shield officers from liability when they engage in conduct that is not clearly outside the realm of what the Constitution permits. As the Supreme Court has said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Qualified immunity attaches when an official's conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. While th[e] Court's case law does not require a case directly on point for a right to be clearly established, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate. In other words, immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    White v.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ross, the officers saw the comment, discovered where Ross worked, and then went to his job site with the sole intent of placing him under arrest. Ross tried to explain what was meant by his comment and provide the officers with more context about the post, but the officers did not give him that opportunity until after he was booked at the police station.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11622104\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/646/#p650\">\n    173 F.3d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An officer contemplating an arrest is not free to disregard plainly exculpatory evidence ...\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duffie v.

And, after interviewing Ross,\n   officers indicated that they did not think the charges would stick, i.e., they did not believe he had truly made a \"terrorist threat.\" Ross was nonetheless charged and held in custody for several days until he was able to post bail. In sum, it is beyond debate that-had the officers engaged in minimal further investigation-the only reasonable conclusion was that Ross had not violated \u00a7 574.115.1(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to the officers based on qualified immunity and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The district court also granted summary judgment to the City on Ross's claim for municipal liability.
