ICE initiated the investigation after the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (\"MCSO\"), under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, conducted illegal raids of two restaurants and the home of Bret Frimmel, owner of Frimmel Management. MCSO later e-mailed a Shift Summary to ICE and also issued press releases revealing the results of the raids. We\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the petition for review\n   <strong>\n    , REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the ALJ's ruling that ICE's evidence in the civil proceedings should not be suppressed pursuant to the exclusionary rule,\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the judgment, and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. State Court Suppresses MCSO's Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 17, 2013, MCSO, under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, raided two Uncle Sam's restaurant locations, where Frimmel Management leased employees, and the home of Bret Frimmel, owner of Frimmel Management. MCSO deputies seized employment records based on suspicion that the restaurants hired people who committed identity theft and forgery to obtain employment at Uncle Sam's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State of Arizona then prosecuted Frimmel for violating Arizona's identity theft laws. At an evidentiary hearing, the Maricopa County Superior Court found that eight omissions and distortions in the affidavits that supported the search warrant for the raids were \"unreasonable and reckless.\" After reforming the affidavits, the state court held that there was no probable cause to support the warrants and dismissed the criminal charges against Frimmel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ICE Audit of Frimmel and Administrative Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 18, 2013, the day after MCSO conducted the raids, MCSO sent various ICE officials, including ICE Auditor Ryan Miller, a Shift Summary reporting the results of the unlawful search. On July 17, 2013 and July 18, 2013, MCSO issued a press release publicizing the raids and stated that \"[n]ine of the suspects have had ICE holds placed on them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 9, 2013, ICE served Frimmel with a Notice of Inspection and an Immigration Enforcement Subpoena. The Immigration Enforcement Subpoena requested\n   that Frimmel provide the original Employer Verification Forms I-9 for all current and former employees, copies of any identity and employment authorization documents attached to the employees' Forms I-9, a list of all employees receiving wages from August 9, 2010 to the date of the Notice of Inspection, and other related employee and business records. Bret Frimmel submitted a stack of Forms I-9 to ICE on August 12, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This investigation resulted in ICE filing a complaint with the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (\"OCAHO\"), alleging that Frimmel Management violated various provisions of \u00a7 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(1)(B) and its corresponding regulations. ICE Auditor Ryan Miller stated that the audit of Frimmel was \"initiated based [on] information generated from local television news channels and local news internet websites.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Frimmel attempted to depose the employees at ICE who received the Shift Summary to determine why MCSO sent its Shift Summary to ICE. The Government then moved for a protective order. Over Frimmel's objections, the ALJ issued that protective order, reasoning that the effects of ICE receiving this e-mail were immaterial because Frimmel's identity was not suppressible. The ALJ further ruled that whether Frimmel came to the attention of ICE auditors \"as a result of an allegedly unlawful police action perpetrated by MCSO is irrelevant to the case filed with OCAHO.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ALJ's Summary Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 25, 2016, the Government filed a Motion for Summary Decision. Frimmel opposed that motion, arguing that the Government's material evidence must be suppressed under fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A second ALJ then issued a Final Decision and Order on October 14, 2016 that substantially incorporated the reasoning in the first ALJ's protective order. The ALJ first ruled that Frimmel's identity was not suppressible. The ALJ further found that \"[t]here is no evidence to suggest that Auditor Miller failed to carry out this investigation in accordance with DHS guidelines or that he relied on evidence directly obtained from MCSO's unlawful conduct,\" and therefore concluded that Frimmel did not establish that ICE's evidence \"constitutes fruit of the poisonous tree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ALJ went on to reason that even assuming the evidence was fruit, it was too attenuated from MCSO's unlawful conduct because ICE obtained its evidence \"as a direct result of an independent investigation carried out by ICE's [Homeland Security Investigations Unit], an entity wholly separate from MCSO. The ALJ then determined that Frimmel \"failed to show that suppression of the challenged evidence would satisfy the exclusionary rule's primary goal of deterring future unlawful police conduct\" because the \"OCAHO proceeding is not within the 'zone of primary interest' of the MCSO [deputies], who sought criminal convictions based on Arizona's identity theft laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Frimmel petitioned for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review de novo the ALJ's conclusions of law, including whether the exclusionary rule applies in a civil proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mester Mfg.

As the Second Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   in order to decide whether application of the exclusionary sanction is likely to have a significant deterrent effect, the key question is whether the particular challenged use of the evidence is one that the seizing officials were likely to have had an interest in at the time-whether it was within their predictable contemplation and, if so, whether it was likely to have motivated them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Tirado v. C.I.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1469644\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/689/307/#p311\">\n    689 F.2d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (2d Cir. 1982). We have held that the zone of primary interest test is satisfied where there the agency conducting the illegal search had a \"preexisting agreement-either implicit or explicit\"-to share information with a second agency.\n   <em>\n    Grimes v.

But an agreement is not required. Where, as here, the law enforcement agency conducting the unlawful search both has a policy of sharing information with another law enforcement agency and shares the information for the purpose of spurring the second agency to initiate an investigation and enforcement action, the latter enforcement action falls within the initial agency's zone of primary interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, we cannot say whether there was an actual agreement-explicit or implicit-between MCSO and ICE. There may well have been, but the ALJ's discovery rulings prevented Frimmel from developing that evidence. The record nonetheless shows that MCSO had a policy of sharing information with ICE, and the only reasonable inference is that MCSO shared this information for the purposes of spurring ICE enforcement action. The record shows that the day after MCSO's raid, MCSO sent three ICE agents an e-mail with the Shift Summary of the raid, including the names of employees arrested for alleged identity theft. As the ALJ noted, \"[ICE] Auditor Miller also received an MCSO Shift Summary in January 2014, describing the arrests of Mr. Frimmel and Uncle Sam's general manager, Lisa Norton, for violating Arizona's identity theft laws.\" We thus hold that the exclusionary rule would serve to deter MCSO from Fourth Amendment violations \"by the probability that illegally obtained evidence will not be useful to [ICE], even in a civil proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639980\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/286/#p290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the petition for review,\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the ALJ's ruling that ICE's evidence should not be suppressed pursuant to the exclusionary rule,\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the judgment, and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
