We conclude that, under the principle of Separation of Powers and in consideration of the Spending Clause, which vests exclusive power to Congress to impose conditions on federal grants, the Executive Branch may not refuse to disperse the federal grants in question without congressional authorization. Because Congress has not acted, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to the City and County of San Francisco and the County of Santa Clara (collectively, the \"Counties\"). However, given the absence of specific findings underlying the nationwide application of the injunction, we vacate the nationwide injunction and remand for reconsideration and further findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.

Moreover, the obligation is an affirmative one, meaning that failure to act may be an abdication of the President's constitutional role.

Application of the test demonstrates that this case is not ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First: As already noted, the Executive Order is not directed at the Counties. It is directed to the Attorney General and the Secretary. Moreover, while it does direct those officials to \"ensure\" that a law-\u00a7 1373-is complied with, it also tells them that whatever they do in that regard must be \"consistent with law.\" And neither the Attorney General nor the Secretary has threatened to take actions that do not adhere to that admonition. That is quite different from executive orders that direct the executive's subordinates to take certain actions, but do not caution that those actions must be taken within the confines of existing law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v.

The district court suggested that the admonition would render the Executive Order legally meaningless, but that is a disingenuous reading of it. It is not meaningless to announce to executive officers and, indeed, the nation, that a statute-here \u00a7 1373 -will be enforced even if enforcement has been somewhat lax in the past. And the Counties certainly do not assert that they have violated or intend to violate \u00a7 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In short, the Counties have not met the concrete-plan element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Second: The terms of the Executive Order itself and the Formal Memorandum show that there is no threat to enforce the Executive Order in a manner that takes away (or denies) funding to the Counties in the improper manner that the Counties seem to fear. That is, neither the Executive Order itself, nor any actions taken under it, by creation of regulations or otherwise, have subtended that threat. Rather, whatever the President, or others, might wish for in order to achieve what they deem to be a more perfect polity, the Executive Order recognizes their limits in achieving that. Nothing they have said or done threatens the possible illegal horrors conjured up by the Counties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sacks v. Office of Foreign Assets Control\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775795\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/764/#p774\">\n    466 F.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (9th Cir. 2006). And, after all, it is the Executive Order itself that is under attack here. It does not direct that any illegal conduct be undertaken. This factor does not support ripeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Third: There is no enforcement history regarding the Executive Order. San Francisco suggests that the factor is, therefore, neutral. Quite the contrary. What it does demonstrate is that the Counties' rush to litigate caused them to bring this facial attack on the Executive Order before the timeline allowed their case to reach the ripeness stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Therefore, in my view this matter is not ripe and the district court should have eschewed jurisdiction, as should we.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   (2) While I am of the opinion that we should not opine on the merits at this point, because the majority does, I must say a few words. To a large extent, the defect in the district court's issuance of an injunction was caused by its failure to accord\n   the Executive Order a fair enough reading. That resulted in its abusing its discretion when it issued the injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaVine v. Blaine Sch.

Unfortunately, the district court did not follow those rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   What the Counties argued for and what the district court did was to shunt aside short but clear and extraordinarily important wording in the Executive Order. The introductory sentence of section 9 of the Executive Order merely stated that it was executive branch policy that \u00a7 1373 be followed \"to the fullest extent of the law,\" and lest that be seen as too expansive, the body of section 9(a) directed that any actions taken by the Attorney General or the Secretary were to be taken \"to the extent consistent with law\" and not otherwise. To brush those words aside as implausible, or boilerplate, or even as words that would render the Executive Order meaningless was just to say that the plain language of the Executive Order should be ignored in favor of comments made dehors the order itself, none of which have resulted in the taking of any illegal action pursuant to the order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is not the proper way to deal with plain language-it is, instead, an attempt to rewrite the Executive Order itself and then to enjoin use of the newly written version.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   And if there is ambiguity in certain parts of the Executive Order, it is not at all ambiguous in its use of the restrictive\n   language.
