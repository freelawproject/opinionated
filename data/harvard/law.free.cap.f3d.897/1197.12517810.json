We conclude that to the extent the complaint alleges negligence by VA healthcare employees (defined as medical professionals and related support staff listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207316\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ), we have jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the extent we do have jurisdiction, the claims are barred by the FTCA's statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Felisa Tunac, the surviving spouse of Randy Tunac, brought suit against the United States pursuant to the FTCA, for wrongful death and negligent malpractice. According to the complaint, Randy Tunac began a six-month deployment with the U.S. Navy in 1995. Before completing his deployment, he was diagnosed with lupus nephritis, otherwise known as kidney inflammation, and was medically retired from the military. After retirement, Randy Tunac continued to receive treatment for lupus at the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona, but saw a private physician for separate cardiological issues. In 2009, Randy Tunac's private physician ordered him to make an appointment immediately at the VA medical center after his blood test showed signs of kidney failure. Randy Tunac promptly contacted the VA medical center, but was told that it could not schedule him for an appointment until October or November 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Randy Tunac was finally seen at the medical center on December 2, 2009. A biopsy of his kidney confirmed that he had reached end-stage kidney disease, necessitating dialysis. However, the VA could not schedule dialysis immediately, and set his next appointment for December 30, 2009. Seven days before his appointment, Randy Tunac collapsed at work and was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced brain-dead on arrival. Randy Tunac passed away on December 27, 2009 from respiratory failure stemming from renal failure. On January 14, 2010, the VA medical center sent a letter addressed to Randy Tunac notifying him that his active lupus nephritis required immediate treatment or would result in \"end stage kidney disease and even death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2014, Randy Tunac's widow, Felisa Tunac, saw media reports that gross mismanagement and unacceptable wait times at the Hayden VA Medical Center were contributing to otherwise preventable veteran deaths. After further investigation, she learned that an internal audit of the VA's operations confirmed the VA's negligence in follow-up, care coordination, quality, and continuity of care for its veteran patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Felisa Tunac filed an administrative claim with the VA on April 17, 2015. After the VA denied her claim on October 8, 2015, she brought this action in district court. Her complaint includes two counts: wrongful death and negligence/medical malpractice. For the first count, the complaint alleges that the VA and its employees caused Randy Tunac's death by failing to provide him with \"adequate follow-up care and treatment to monitor Randy's\n   condition and identify any potential relapses or adverse changes to his health\"; \"[f]ailing to schedule Randy for immediate (or even timely) treatment after the deterioration of his condition, as evidenced by his blood work in 2009\"; and \"[f]ailing to schedule Randy for immediate dialysis after the results of his kidney biopsy in December 2009.\" The complaint alleges that the United States and the VA are liable for the acts and omissions of the employees pursuant to the FTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the second count, the complaint alleges that the employees and the VA breached their duty to Randy Tunac \"to provide him with timely, quality healthcare.\" Again, the complaint alleges that the United States and the VA are liable for the acts and omissions of the employees pursuant to the FTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The VA filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the VJRA deprived the district court of jurisdiction over Felisa Tunac's claims, because they related to benefits decisions. The VJRA bars a district court from hearing claims relating to the provision of benefits to veterans.\n   <em>\n    Veterans for Common Sense v.

Nonetheless, after reviewing Ninth Circuit and out-of-circuit precedent, the district court concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear certain aspects of Felisa Tunac's claims. The district court then dismissed Tunac's claims as untimely because she filed her administrative claim nearly five years after the claims accrued. Tunac timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[A] federal court generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first determining that it has jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Sinochem Int'l Co. v.

In brief, within a few years after Congress established the VA in 1930, it enacted legislation precluding judicial review of the VA's benefits decisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1025\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1025\">\n    at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, the complaint alleges that the VA and its employees \"caused Randy's death through their wrongful acts and neglect,\" specifically by \"[f]ailing to provide Randy with adequate follow-up care and treatment to monitor Randy's condition and identify any potential relapses or adverse changes to his health.\" Again, it is reasonable to read this allegation as referring to negligence by medical professionals, as generally they are responsible for monitoring a patient's condition and providing follow-up care and treatment.

In contrast, Tunac was aware that her husband's prognosis called for prompt intervention, and therefore knew or should have known that the VA's failure to provide timely treatment caused his death. There is no evidence that Tunac relied on inaccurate statements by a medical professional regarding the cause of her husband's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, Tunac's claim accrued, at the latest, when she received the January 10, 2010 letter from the Hayden VA Medical Center explaining the consequences of delayed treatment of Randy Tunac's condition. Because the two-year statute of limitations had long run when Tunac filed her administrative claim in April 2015, Tunac's claims are barred by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Tunac contends that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because the VA concealed its negligent practices that caused delays in treatment across the Phoenix VA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"To establish that equitable tolling applies,\" a plaintiff must show, among other things, that \"fraudulent conduct by the defendant result[ed] in concealment of the operative facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed.

As the previous discussion makes clear, any alleged concealment by the VA of a widespread problem regarding delayed treatment did not result in concealment of the operative facts-that the VA delayed Randy's treatment, possibly causing his death.
