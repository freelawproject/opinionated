Cook (\"Cook\"), Mocksville Town Manager Christine W. Bralley (\"Bralley\"), and the Town of Mocksville (\"the Town,\" and collectively with Cook and Bralley, \"Defendants\"), alleging several claims related to Defendants' termination of Plaintiffs' employment. At the conclusion of trial, a jury found Defendants liable to Plaintiffs under both state and federal law, awarded Plaintiffs approximately $1.4 million in compensatory damages, and recommended that the district court further award Plaintiffs approximately $2.6 million in front pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a series of post-trial rulings, the district court awarded Plaintiffs substantially less front pay than the jury had recommended and held that governmental immunity limited the Town's aggregate liability\n   for damages. Plaintiffs appeal both rulings, as well as the district court's pre-trial dismissal of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims against the Town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court's conclusion that the Town's insurance policy covered only $1 million of the aggregate damages awarded to Plaintiffs. We also reverse the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims against the Town. But we conclude that the district court properly disposed of Plaintiffs' remaining claims. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs Kenneth L. Hunter, Rick A. Donathan, and Jerry D. Medlin worked at Mocksville PD for several years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout their tenure with Mocksville PD, Plaintiffs received numerous awards and commendations. After Cook became Mocksville PD's Administrative Chief of Police, Plaintiffs developed concerns about his personal conduct and management of Mocksville PD. Plaintiffs initially voiced their concerns to Bralley; however, they noticed no marked improvement in Cook's behavior thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 14, 2011, Plaintiffs used a disposable cell phone to contact the North Carolina Office of the Governor (the \"Governor's Office\") and report what they viewed as corruption and misconduct within Mocksville PD. The Governor's Office relayed Plaintiffs' concerns to the State Bureau of Investigation (\"SBI\") for further inquiry. A week later, Plaintiffs noticed a local SBI Agent at Mocksville PD and subsequently received a call from that agent on the disposable phone. Plaintiffs did not return the call and, out of fear of retaliation, disposed of the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' efforts to remain anonymous, Cook and Bralley eventually identified Plaintiffs as the anonymous callers. Thereafter, Cook and Bralley consulted with the Town's attorney to determine whether they could lawfully terminate Plaintiffs. After being advised that they could do so lawfully, Cook and Bralley terminated Plaintiffs from Mocksville PD on December 29, 2011. Plaintiffs' termination letters stated that they were fired for myriad misdeeds, including \"[i]nsubordinat[ion],\" \"[a]ttitude,\" and \"conduct unbecoming a[n] [o]fficer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 2381, 2415, 2420. However, prior to Plaintiffs' terminations, none had received any performance-related discipline, and \"[t]heir written service records were essentially unblemished.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Additionally, this \"was the first time that then-Chief Cook had ever terminated an officer,\" notwithstanding the fact that other officers previously had engaged in misconduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184163\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/750/#p754\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184163\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/750/#p754\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2012, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the Town, Cook, and Bralley. In their complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that they were (1) terminated in retaliation for exercising their free speech rights under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) denied their rights to free speech, guaranteed by Sections 1 and 14 of Article 1 of the North Carolina Constitution ; and (3) wrongfully discharged against public policy, in violation of North Carolina state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2013, the district court granted partial summary judgment to Defendants on all of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims. In a memorandum opinion explaining its decision, the district court first concluded that qualified immunity shielded Cook and Bralley from suit. The district court further concluded that Plaintiffs' terminations could not fairly be attributed to the Town for purposes of municipal liability under Section 1983 because Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that either Cook or Bralley possessed \"final policymaking authority\" to set employment policy for the Town.\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Jan. 22, 2014). And the district court reserved judgment on the question of whether Plaintiffs could properly pursue their free speech claims under the North Carolina Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2014, the district court reversed its grant of summary judgment to Cook and Bralley on Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims, instead concluding that neither defendant was entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Hunter v. Town of Mocksville\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:12-cv-333,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20881136\">\n    2014 WL 881136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (M.D.N.C.

This Court affirmed the district court's holding that neither Cook nor Bralley was entitled to qualified immunity, but concluded that we lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the district court's interlocutory order dismissing Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims against the Town.\n   <em>\n    Hunter v. Town of Mocksville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233845\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/389/#p400\">\n    789 F.3d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400-03 (4th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a nine-day trial, a jury returned a verdict for Plaintiffs on their First Amendment claims against Cook and Bralley, as well as a verdict for Plaintiffs on their state-law wrongful-discharge claims against the Town. The jury found all Defendants liable to Plaintiffs for approximately $1.4 million in compensatory damages, and awarded Plaintiffs an aggregate total of $60,000 in punitive damages to be paid specifically by Cook and Bralley. The jury also returned an advisory verdict recommending that Defendants pay Plaintiffs approximately $2.6 million in front pay. Soon thereafter, Plaintiffs moved for the entry of judgment and equitable relief in the form of reinstatement or, alternatively, the jury-recommended front-pay awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 12, 2016, the district court entered judgment on the verdicts, granting Plaintiffs the compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury.\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184163\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/750/#p754\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d at 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court also partially granted Plaintiffs' requests for equitable relief. In particular, the district court denied Plaintiffs' requests for reinstatement but granted Plaintiffs front pay in lieu of reinstatement. However, the district court's front-pay award amounted to an aggregate total of approximately $600,000-roughly one-fourth of the amount recommended by the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently,\n   two plaintiffs-Donathan and Medlin-moved for the district court to reconsider its grant of equitable relief in the form of front pay and instead award them reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 21, 2017, the district court issued several dispositive rulings. First, the district court addressed Donathan and Medlin's motion to reconsider its decision to award front pay in lieu of reinstatement. Upon reconsideration, the district court upheld its initial decision to deny reinstatement to Medlin, but granted Donathan's request for reinstatement to a lieutenant position at Mocksville PD upon the next available opening.\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

The district court further observed that \"[u]nder North Carolina law, the Town waives its immunity to the extent it has purchased insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 357 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 160A-485 ) ). Consequently, because all parties agreed that the Town maintained\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   amount of liability insurance, the district court sought to determine the extent of the Town's insurance coverage. To that end, the district court allowed the Town's insurer-Interlocal Risk Financing Fund of North Carolina (\"Interlocal\")-to intervene in the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Interlocal argued that the Town policy's per-claim limit of $1 million limited Plaintiffs' aggregate recovery against the Town to $1 million. By contrast, Plaintiffs argued that the policy provided up to $1 million\n   <em>\n    per plaintiff\n   </em>\n   and, therefore, $3 million in the aggregate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    at 358-359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court agreed with Interlocal. Specifically, the district court analyzed the Town's insurance policy and concluded that, per the policy's terms, all three Plaintiffs' claims together constituted one single claim under the policy-not three separate claims. Therefore, given the policy's per-claim limit of $1 million, the district court concluded that the Town had waived its governmental immunity in the amount of $1 million only.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    at 361-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because the Town's governmental immunity precluded Plaintiffs from recovering approximately half of their damages from the Town, Plaintiffs argued that they lacked an \"adequate state remedy\" against the Town and thus could seek to recover against the Town under the North Carolina Constitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    at 366-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court disagreed, concluding that Plaintiffs' ability to recover $1 million in insurance proceeds from the Town constituted an adequate state remedy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    at 367-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the district court held Defendants jointly and severally liable to Plaintiffs for a total of $1,990,544 in compensatory damages and front pay. The Court also ordered Cook and Bralley each to pay each Plaintiff $10,000 in punitive damages. And, notwithstanding its conclusion that Defendants were jointly and severally liable for the nearly $2 million in compensatory damages and front pay, the district court held that \"pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20160-485\">\n    N.C.

And, as mentioned above, \"employment wrongful act\" includes an \"action[ ] involving ... termination of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B. Applying these two definitions, we conclude that there were three wrongful acts that served as the bases of Plaintiffs' lawsuit: the Town's termination of Hunter; its termination of Medlin; and its termination of Donathan. The Town terminated each Plaintiff by separate letter and, at least ostensibly, for different written reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 2381, 2415, 2420. The jury's finding that the true\n   <em>\n    reasons\n   </em>\n   underlying Plaintiffs' terminations were identical does not undermine our conclusion that the Town\n   <em>\n    acted\n   </em>\n   thrice-not once. Indeed, even the jury instructions listed each Plaintiff's termination separately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2502-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Rather than focusing on the Town's three wrongful terminations, the district court characterized the Town's wrongful action as the \"approval\" of Plaintiffs' terminations only. But the jury found that the Town\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   terminated each Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   And the policy language requires an inquiry into the insured's\n   <em>\n    actions\n   </em>\n   , not the insured's\n   <em>\n    approval\n   </em>\n   of the actions of others. Here, the Town fired three different individuals. Accordingly, we conclude that Plaintiffs' claims against the Town are based on and arise out of separate and distinct employment wrongful acts of the Town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We consider next whether Plaintiffs' claims are based on and arise out of \"interrelated\" wrongful acts of the Town. We conclude that the meaning of the term interrelated is ambiguous for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To begin, the policy does not define the term \"interrelated.\" A number of courts have held that the meaning of \"interrelated\" in an insurance coverage provision was ambiguous when, as here, the contract did not expressly define the term.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCuen v.

App. 2004).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perhaps\n   because of these decisions finding ambiguity in the meaning of \"interrelated,\" it has now become \"commonplace\" for insurance policies to expressly define the term.

Rep. 7th Art. 7, \u00a7 2 (2016). Yet notwithstanding this trend toward expressly defining \"interrelated,\" Interlocal elected not to define the term in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Interlocal's failure to define \"interrelated\" in the policy further renders the term ambiguous because courts and insurance policies do not define the term \"interrelated\" in a uniform manner, meaning that there is no \"ordinary\" definition of the term. For example, the most common contractual definition of \"interrelated wrongful acts\"-acts \"which have as a common nexus any fact, circumstance, situation, event, transaction or series of facts, circumstances, situations, events, or transactions\"-seems to sweep broadly, potentially encompassing claims by multiple claimants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   13 Am. L. Rep. 7th Art. 7, \u00a7 2. However, Interlocal exclusively reserved that definition for \"related\" employment wrongful act(s), J.A. 2704, while leaving \"interrelated\" undefined. Some courts have observed that \"interrelated,\" when left undefined in a contract, is generally regarded as more restrictive than \"related.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sigma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434866\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/200/697/#p704\">\n    200 F.Supp.2d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Court concludes that the Defendant's choice of the term 'interrelated wrongful acts' in the instant policy, contrasted to [the] use of 'related acts' in the [other] policy, is more restrictive as to what is excluded from the benefits of aggregate coverage.\");\n   <em>\n    Brecek &amp; Young Advisors,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205569242\">\n    2012 WL 5569242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 ;\n   <em>\n    Am.

Therefore, even if the policy-specific definition of \"related\" encompasses claims by multiple claimants premised on distinct wrongs, the definition of \"interrelated\" may not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, the Tenth Circuit has recognized that when, as here, an insurance contract leaves the term \"interrelated\" undefined, \"[m]ost courts ... have generally taken a pro-insured approach to defining 'interrelated,' and have held that 'legally distinct claims that allege\n   <em>\n    different wrongs to different people\n   </em>\n   ' are not 'interrelated' claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Stauth v.

This was error. Read alone, the state statute does vest authority in the Town Board to make personnel decisions. However, as the Town concedes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Br. at 32, when determining whether a local official possesses final policymaking authority, the Supreme Court has directed courts to look to \"the relevant legal materials, including state\n   <em>\n    and local positive law\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p737\">\n    491 U.S. at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p737\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And the relevant local positive law in this case makes clear that the Town delegated to Bralley final and unconstrained policymaking authority with regard to the challenged actions at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   North Carolina General Statute Section 160A-148 provides that town managers, like Bralley, \"shall be responsible to the council for administering all municipal affairs placed in [their] charge\" and, among other things, \"shall appoint and suspend or remove all city officers and employees not elected by the people ... in accordance with such general personnel rules, regulations, policies, or ordinances as the council\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   adopt.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 160A-148 (1973) (emphasis added). Like the wording found in Section 160A-164, the use of the word \"may\" in Section 160A-148 indicates that the North Carolina General Assembly contemplated that town councils, like the Town Board, may decline to adopt any personnel rules, regulations, policies, or ordinances altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Here, the Town Board has exercised its statutory authority not to adopt its own policies or regulations governing the specific terms of its employees' employment. In particular, the Town Board \"does not have a written personnel policy.\" J.A. 112. Nor does the Town Board have any formal grievance procedure or any \"other requirement which requires the Town to provide an employee in a potential discharge situation with pre-discharge procedural due process ... or post-discharge procedural due process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p737\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And it is undisputed that \"since about 1987 or 1988, the Town Board has had no ordinance or grievance procedure by which employees who are disciplined or discharged from employment could challenge adverse employment actions imposed on them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p737\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Around that time, the Town Board decided to \"discontinue\" all personnel policies then in effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 665-66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p690\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Rather than establishing a grievance procedure or fashioning its own employment policies, the Town Board adopted the following personnel ordinance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Town personnel shall be employed by the Town Manager, within the appropriations for that purpose;\n   <em>\n    the terms of the positions shall be at the will of the Town Manager\n   </em>\n   .

Thus, under the ordinance's plain language, the Town Board delegated to Bralley, as Town Manager, its statutory authority to set personnel policy for the Town. In particular, the ordinance confers on Bralley unconstrained authority\n   to define nearly all terms of employment for Town personnel, including all matters related to Plaintiffs' hiring, supervision, and discharge.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

Moreover, the Town concedes that it maintained no formal review process for evaluating Bralley's termination decisions. In light of these concessions and the Town Board's express delegation of final policymaking authority to Bralley, we conclude that the circumstances surrounding Bralley's decision to terminate Plaintiffs present all the hallmarks of a final policymaker wielding her authority.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Valentino v.

In Part II, however, the opinion reverses the district court's conclusion that the Town's coverage under its insurance policy was limited to $1 million. The opinion concludes that because the policy was ambiguous in defining the limit of coverage, it should be construed to provide the Town with $3 million in coverage in this case, the policy's annual aggregate coverage limit. I cannot agree that the policy is ambiguous, and therefore I would affirm the ruling of the district court limiting the Town's coverage to $1 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Town of Mocksville purchased an employment-practices liability insurance policy from the Interlocal Risk Financing Fund of North Carolina that provided coverage of $1 million for each applicable claim against the Town and an aggregate limit for all such claims in one year of $3 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that \"[w]hile the claims of a single individual for the 'same or interrelated acts of [the defendants]' could be combined\" under the each-claim limit, \"the policy language chosen by [the insurer] d[id] not permit the combining of claims of multiple persons.\" As such, they argue, \"the interrelated acts of [the defendants]\n   <em>\n    as to each officer\n   </em>\n   meant\n   <em>\n    each officer\n   </em>\n   was subject to\" the policy's $1 million each-claim limit, for a total of $3 million, the aggregate annual limit. The majority opinion suggests that the policy language is ambiguous, based on how other courts have interpreted the term \"interrelated\" in other insurance policies and how the policy in this case defines \"related,\" and it therefore agrees with the plaintiffs and reverses the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   A fair reading of the policy, however, can only lead to the conclusion that the claims of the plaintiffs in this case amount to a \"single claim,\" as defined in the policy, with a single $1 million limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In the declarations section, the policy provides $1 million in coverage for each claim and $3 million in coverage as an annual aggregate limit for all claims, with each claim subject to a $5,000 deductible. A claim is defined as a \"demand received by the insured\" or a suit or arbitration filed against the insured. And the insured is defined to be the Town of Mocksville and its elected officials and employees for their acts \"within the course and scope of their duties.\" Detailing how the $1 million limit is to be applied to a claim, the policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   The Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations and the rules below fix the most we will pay\n   <em>\n    regardless of the number of ...\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ersons or organizations\n   </em>\n   making \"claims\" or bringing \"suits\".... [T]he Each Claim Limit is the most we will pay for all loss arising out of any \"employment wrongful act(s)\" covered by this policy.\n   <em>\n    \"Claims\" based on and arising out of the same act or interrelated acts of one or more insureds shall be considered to be a single \"claim\"\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (Emphasis added). Similarly, in defining a claim for purposes of applying the deductible amount to each claim, the policy provides, \" 'Claims' based on or\n   <em>\n    arising out of the same act or interrelated acts of one or more insureds shall be considered a single 'claim'\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In short, the policy provides $1 million in coverage for each claim, which it unambiguously defines as the filing of a suit\n   against or a demand for money damages from the Town of Mocksville and its employees. And it makes absolutely clear that all \"[c]laims based on and arising out of the same act or interrelated acts of one or more insureds,\" \"\n   <em>\n    regardless of the number of ...\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    p\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ersons or organizations making 'claims'\n   </em>\n   or bringing 'suits,' \" are to be treated\n   <em>\n    as\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    a single 'claim'.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In this case, the three plaintiff police officers collectively made a single telephone call on December 14, 2011, to the North Carolina Governor's Office about the inappropriate conduct of their chief. As a result of that call, the three officers' employment was terminated on the same day two weeks later by the Chief with the approval of the Town Manager. The plaintiffs claimed and the jury found that their termination was wrongful because it was done in retaliation for their call to the Governor's Office, in violation of their First Amendment right of free speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Under any fair reading of the policy, the officers' claims constituted a \"single claim\" as defined in the policy. While the liability of the defendants is based on three wrongful terminations, the terminations were approved collectively by the Town Manager for the single purpose of retaliating against the plaintiffs for their joint act of making the telephone call. Thus, the acts of terminating the plaintiffs' employment were \"interrelated,\" as that term is ordinarily understood, because they were related to each other by their common connection-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , their mutual relationship-to the single telephone call and the defendants' single purpose of retaliating against the plaintiffs for that call.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1182 (1993) (defining \"interrelated\" as \"having a mutual or reciprocal relation or parallelism\"). Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a reasonable meaning of interrelated that would not encompass the defendants' conduct in this case. Accordingly, under the policy's plain terms, the three terminations gave rise to a \"single claim\" despite the fact that the plaintiffs asserted a \"number of ... [c]laims\" and that they constituted a \"number of [p]ersons or organizations making [the] 'claims' [and] bringing 'suits.' \" Therefore, the $1 million limit, with the $5,000 deductible, applies to that single claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Ignoring the policy's language defining as a \"single claim\" all claims arising out of interrelated wrongful acts,\n   <em>\n    regardless of the number of claims\n   </em>\n   in the suit\n   <em>\n    or the number of persons\n   </em>\n   making them, the majority finds ambiguity in the coverage based on the fact that other courts interpreting the word \"interrelated\" within a policy definition have not defined that term \"in a uniform manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 551. And to further support its conclusion, the majority also seeks to define the undefined term \"interrelated\" by the term \"related\" as used elsewhere in the policy in a different context. At bottom, the majority reaches the conclusion that the term \"interrelated\" must be ambiguous and therefore should be read not to encompass claims\n   <em>\n    brought by different individuals\n   </em>\n   , as the plaintiffs urge. But that conclusion is explicitly foreclosed by the policy's language, which defines as a \"single claim\" all claims arising from the same act or interrelated acts brought by\n   <em>\n    any number of persons\n   </em>\n   , \"\n   <em>\n    regardless of the number\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In contriving ambiguity for this policy, the majority fails to take heed of North Carolina law, which instructs that when a policy does not provide a definition, \"nontechnical words are to be given a meaning consistent with the sense in which they are used in ordinary speech, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8561396\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/276/348/\">\n    276 N.C. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20S.E.2d%20518\">\n    172 S.E.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 522 (1970) (citation omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Wachovia Bank\n   </em>\n   , the North Carolina Supreme Court further explained that ambiguity does not exist unless \"the language of the policy is fairly and reasonably susceptible to\n   <em>\n    either of the constructions for which the parties contend\n   </em>\n   \" and that courts may not, \"under the guise of interpreting an ambiguous provision, remake the contract and impose liability upon the company which it did not assume and for which the policyholder did not pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added). Here, the construction advocated by the plaintiffs-that the claims of multiple individuals cannot be combined-is expressly foreclosed by the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   At bottom, the three plaintiffs in this case jointly made a telephone call to the Governor's Office, and for that conduct, the three were fired in violation of the First Amendment. It could not be clearer that the claims of the three officers are to be treated under the policy as a single claim for which the policy limits coverage to $1 million, less the $5,000 deductible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   For these reasons, I would affirm the district court's construction of the policy.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
