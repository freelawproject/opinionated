O'Malley, United States Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   THOMAS, Chief Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal concerns various antitrust and related state law claims of professional golf caddies (\"Caddies\") who participate in golf tournaments run by the PGA Tour (\"the Tour\") arising out of the Tour's requirement that they wear bibs containing advertisements at professional golfing events. The district court dismissed all claims with prejudice. We affirm the dismissal, but remand the case to allow the district court to reconsider whether to grant the Caddies leave to amend their federal antitrust and California unfair competition claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Henry Longhurst, the renowned British golf writer and commentator, once wrote: \"A good caddie is more than a mere assistant. He is a guide, philosopher, and friend.\" The professional caddie has evolved from simply carrying bags and locating errant shots to providing valuable insights on course topography, club selection, and reading shots. Caddies serve as coaches, strategists, and counselors to professional golfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Tour operates three tours of professional golf tournaments throughout the United States. It requires caddies to wear specified uniforms at the tournaments, including a \"bib\"-a loose-fitting sleeveless garment on the upper body used for identification. For each tournament, the Tour generally works with a local host (\"Local Host\"). The Local Hosts and Tour seek to secure and retain sponsors, including title sponsors for the tournaments. Sponsors pay Local Hosts and the Tour to secure advertising space at the tournaments. At issue in this case is the advertising space on the bibs worn by the Caddies during the tournaments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Local Hosts and the Tour design the bibs. The bibs bear a tournament logo and sponsors' logos, which are often integrated together. With exposure to live tournament, television, and webcast audiences, advertising space on the bibs is valued at approximately $50 million annually. Local Hosts and the Tour receive the entirety of these revenues. The Caddies receive none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although individual professional golfers employ the Caddies as independent contractors, the Tour and Local Hosts require the Caddies to wear the bibs. The Caddies must sign a Caddie Registration and Regulations Form (\"the Form\") in order to participate in any Tour tournament. The Form notes that \"[i]n consideration of PGA TOUR's services in cosponsoring the Tournament,\" the Caddies \"grant and assign to PGA TOUR, without limitation, [their] individual television, radio, motion picture, photographic, electronic, ... and all other similar or related media rights with respect to [their] participation in the Tournament.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Form also provides a list of regulations that the Caddies must adhere to, which in relevant part state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   Caddies shall wear uniforms and identification badges as prescribed by the host tournament and PGA Tour. All caddies are required to wear solid-colored,\n   Khaki-style long pants, which touch the top of the shoe, or solid-colored, knee-length, tailored shorts or skorts and a collared shirt while on club property. T-shirts, jeans, culottes, skirts, capris, cut-off shorts and cargo-style shorts are not permitted. Acceptable colors shall be determined at the discretion of the Tournament Director.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n   Caddies shall wear smooth rubber-sole shoes, preferably tennis or basketball shoes. Permissible colors are limited to white and earth tones such as navy, blue, black, brown, tan, gray, dark green and the like. Bright colors that are intended to draw attention to a person's footwear are not acceptable. Footwear with a closed toe is required. Flip flops, open-toed sandals and other similar shoes are not permitted. Closed-toe Crocs are acceptable provided they conform with the colors described above. GOLF SPIKES are prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n   Caddies' clothing must conform to the Player Endorsement Policy as stated in the PGA TOUR Player Handbook and Tournament Regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Player Endorsement Policy (\"Endorsement Policy\") referenced in Regulation Four prohibits endorsing specific categories of products, places limitations on the size and location of endorsements, and specifies that \"[a]ll sponsorships, endorsements and promotional activities by members, whether during or outside PGA TOUR competitions, are subject to the approval of the PGA TOUR.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Tour and Local Hosts have threatened to prevent caddies who refuse to wear the bibs from participating in tournaments. They have also directly contacted golfers to determine whether the golfers would decline to hire caddies who refused to wear the bibs. These tactics, combined with the Tour's requirement that each golfer have a caddy to participate in a tournament, maximize the value of bib advertising during tournament play.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Caddies contend that the Tour and Local Hosts cannot compel them to wear the bibs. Relatedly, they allege that by requiring the Caddies to wear the bibs, the Tour and Local Hosts have inhibited their endorsement rights under the Endorsement Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these allegations, the Caddies assert contract, equitable quasi-contract, economic duress, publicity, and unfair competition claims under California law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203344\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (discussing publicity claims);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"unfair competition\"). They also allege a false endorsement claim under the Lanham Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Caddies assert antitrust claims under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For their antitrust claims, the Caddies allege two relevant product markets: the Endorsement Market and the Live Action Advertising Market. They define the Endorsement Market as \"the national market for the endorsement of products and services by participants in professional golf tournaments.\" Without the Tour's requirement\n   that the Caddies wear bibs, the Caddies and golfers would be the only sellers in this market. Indeed, the Caddies and golfers are the only visible and recognizable individuals who participate in golf tournaments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to the Caddies, the Tour's audience is a distinct advertising market given its unique demographic. The majority of Tour fans are older, Caucasian, travel via airplane for business, and are interested in products such as financial planning and vacation traveling. These characteristics allegedly distinguish the average Tour fan from the average fan of other major sports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreover, endorsements from the Caddies and golfers during tournament play are purportedly more effective than other forms of golf-related advertising. A golf fan can ignore other forms of advertising by flipping the page of a magazine, clicking away from an online advertisement, or fast-forwarding through television commercials with a DVR. In contrast, a golf fan cannot ignore an in-action endorsement from a caddy or golfer. The Caddies contend that this enhanced effectiveness, combined with a unique degree of price-flexibility provided by the possibility of hiring golfers and caddies of varying skill levels, establishes the plausibility of the Endorsement Market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Caddies define the slightly more expansive Live Action Advertising Market as \"the national ... market for in-play or in-action commercial advertising at professional golf events between commercial breaks.\" In addition to endorsements from the Caddies and golfers, this market includes advertising space on and around the golf course that live tournament, television broadcast, and webcast audiences can see during in-play tournament action. The Tour and Local Hosts provide the advertising space on and around the course. The Caddies contend that the Live Action Advertising Market constitutes a plausible product market for similar reasons as above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Caddies allege three antitrust claims reliant on these proposed product markets. First, they contend that the Tour and Local Hosts violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act by agreeing to require the Caddies to wear the bibs, which unreasonably restrains trade by reducing the product supply in the relevant markets. Second, the Caddies allege that the Tour violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the relevant markets through the use of coercive and threatening conduct. Finally, the Caddies allege that the Tour also violates Section 2 by engaging in coercive reciprocal dealing-a variant of tying. Specifically, the Caddies contend that the Tour leverages monopoly power in the market for professional golf tournaments by selling the right to participate in golf tournaments to the Caddies on the condition that the Caddies sell their endorsement services to the Tour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In February 2015, the Caddies first raised these claims and sought class certification in district court. The Caddies amended their complaint as of right in response to a motion to change venue and amended again with the Tour's consent. The Tour then filed a motion to dismiss the Caddies' Second Amended Complaint. It argued that the Caddies failed to plead any plausible claims for relief because the Caddies consented to wearing the bibs and the proposed antitrust product markets were implausible. The district court agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court concluded that Regulation Two in the Form was unambiguous and authorized the Tour to require the Caddies to wear bibs. It focused specifically on the italicized language below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Caddies shall wear uniforms and identification badges as prescribed by the host tournaments and PGA Tour.\n   </em>\n   All caddies are required to wear solid-colored, Khaki-style long pants, which touch the top of the shoe, or solid-colored, knee-length, tailored shorts or skorts and a collared shirt while on club property. T-shirts, jeans, culottes, skirts, capris, cut-off shorts and cargo-style shorts are not permitted. Acceptable colors shall be determined at the discretion of the Tournament Director.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court recognized that \"[i]n isolation\" the italicized \"language might appear ambiguous.\" The court elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   On the one hand, a person might understand the first sentence of the paragraph to mean that caddies must wear whatever 'uniforms' the host tournament and the Tour decide to 'prescribe,' without limitation .... On the other hand, one might understand the second sentence of the paragraph to be modifying the first one, so that the kinds of 'uniforms' a host tournament and Tour may 'prescribe' include the type and color of the pants and shirts caddies may wear, and nothing more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It noted that the former interpretation authorizes the Tour to require the Caddies to wear bibs, but the latter does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, the district court determined that in the \"context of this case,\" the contractual provision was unambiguous. It relied on the Caddies' concession in their supplemental brief opposing the Tour's motion to dismiss that \"the PGA Tour has required caddies to wear bibs for decades.\" This \"context,\" along with the operative complaint's allegation that the Caddies \"are forced to wear identical bibs during a given tournament,\" confirmed that the contractual provision has a single reasonable interpretation: \"[T]he caddies agreed the Tour could make them wear bibs.\" In light of this conclusion, and the fact that the operative complaint confirmed that the Tour had not relinquished this contractual right, the district court dismissed the breach of contract claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court's conclusion that the Caddies' had consented to wear the bibs led it to dismiss with prejudice the unjust enrichment, publicity, and Lanham Act false endorsement claims as well because each claim required a lack of consent. The Caddies' claim that they signed the Form under economic duress was similarly dismissed with prejudice because the Caddies \"embark[ed] upon a profession whose practitioners have long been required to wear bibs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court also dismissed with prejudice the Caddies' antitrust claims for failure to plead a plausible product market. It assumed when considering the Endorsement Market and the Live Action Advertising Market that professional golf fans constituted a unique market for certain advertisers. Even so, the court reasoned that while the various forms of advertisements aimed at this demographic have their differences, the Caddies failed to allege facts \"from which one could plausibly conclude that these different methods of advertising to golf fans are not reasonably interchangeable.\" For example, \"[i]f it became too expensive to put a logo on a bridge\" or a bib, \"there is no logical reason a company wouldn't decide instead to put its logo on a magazine ad, or on a wall in golf course clubhouses, or any number of other places.\" It concluded that the proposed markets were \"artificial [and] contorted to meet [the Caddies'] litigation needs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, the district court dismissed the Caddies' remaining California unfair competition claim with prejudice given its resolution of other related claims. The Caddies timely appealed the district court's dismissal of all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We review de novo the district court's dismissal of the Caddies' complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Vega v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275408\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1146/#p1152\">\n    881 F.3d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1152 (9th Cir. 2018). \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The identical bibs that the Tour requires fall within this common definition because individuals watching Tour tournaments are able to identify the Caddies by the bibs they wear. Indeed, a caddy simply wearing khaki pants and a collared blue polo shirt would satisfy the Tour's leg wear and shirt requirement, but the individual would be indistinguishable from many golf fans on the course.

Even if we accept the former assumption, \"judicial experience and common sense\" require rejecting the latter.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the district court noted, the Caddies' proposed submarkets\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   are \"not natural,\" \"artificial,\" and \"contorted to meet their litigation needs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Caddies' submarkets-the Endorsement Market and the Live Action Advertising Market-omit many economic substitutes. Companies aiming to target professional golf fans can do so by airing commercials during golf-related television programs, radio broadcasts, or podcasts. They can advertise on golf-related websites or social media pages. They can also directly target golf fans by advertising through a search engine or social media platform that provides advertisers insights on users' online history. As the district court noted, \"[i]f it became too expensive to put a logo on a bridge\" during a golf tournament, \"there is no logical reason a company wouldn't decide instead to put its logo on a magazine ad, or on a wall in golf course clubhouses, or any number of other places.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Caddies offer four arguments to contest this conclusion. First, they note that advertising during the live-action of golf tournaments cannot be avoided by \"flipping the page, clicking out of an ad, ... fast[ ] forwarding with [a] DVR,\" or leaving the room during a commercial break. Second, they claim that \"endorsements made by the endorser during competition provides a unique, exponentially more effective opportunity to improve brand recognition and validity when compared to endorsements made in print or in television commercials.\" Third, they contend that advertising during live golf tournament action provides an element of price flexibility because \"the vast majority of companies purchasing live action advertisements are smaller companies who cannot or do not want to pay for advertising\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   television commercials.\" Finally, they claim that \"econometric studies ... will demonstrate that purchasers in the [proposed markets] will not switch to products outside of th[ose] market[s] in response to a small but significant and non-transitory price increase by [the Tour] ... to such a degree that the price increase is unprofitable.\" None of these arguments withstand modest scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The fact that golf fans can avoid some forms of advertising fails to indicate that these advertising formats are not \"reasonabl[y] interchangeab[le]\" with the products in the proposed markets.\n   <em>\n    Newcal Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165795\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/1038/#p1044\">\n    513 F.3d at 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Caddies' alternative conclusion rests on the implausible assumption that a distinct group of golf fans watches tournament broadcasts but either consumes no other forms of golf media or is uninfluenced by advertisements in all other forms of golf media. The vast majority of golf fans who watch tournament broadcasts certainly consume other forms of golf media. Although these fans likely avoid some advertisements in other golf media, the assumption that they are not influenced by one or more of the diverse forms of advertisements discussed above is implausible. Moreover, even if a distinct group of golf fans exists that is only influenced by live action advertising, for whatever reason, the Caddies provide no explanation why this group of fans is distinct for advertising purposes from the typical group of golf fans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Caddies' claims of increased effectiveness and price flexibility also fail to support their proposed markets. The price of endorsement advertising during golf tournaments would reflect any increased effectiveness compared to other forms of advertising. This increased effectiveness would not place the advertising format in a distinct market because, as discussed above, companies can reach golf consumers through other formats. The price flexibility in the proposed markets also fails to demonstrate their plausibility. Although small companies can advertise in the proposed markets by hiring a lone little-known player or caddy, these same companies could advertise through smaller golf periodicals, less frequented websites, and radio programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, the Caddies' last claim is a legal conclusion veiled as a factual allegation that we do not consider when ruling on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation v.
