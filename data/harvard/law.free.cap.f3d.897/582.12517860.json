The first is the Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\")'s decision granting a right of way through federal land for construction and operation of a pipeline proposed by Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (\"MVP\"). The second is the United States Forest Service (\"Forest Service\")'s decision to amend the Jefferson National Forest Land Resource Management Plan to accommodate the right of way and pipeline construction. Sierra Club, Inc.; Appalachian Voices; Wild Virginia, Inc.; the Wilderness Society; Preserve Craig, Inc.; and Save Monroe, Inc. (collectively, \"Petitioners\") claim that by these decisions, the federal agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), the Mineral Leasing Act (\"MLA\"), and the National Forest Management Act (\"NFMA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After careful review, we conclude that aspects of the Forest Service's decision fail to comply with NEPA and the NFMA. As more fully explained below, we grant the petition challenging the Forest Service's decision and vacate that decision. We also conclude that the BLM failed to acknowledge its obligations under the MLA, and therefore, we also grant the petition challenging the BLM decision and vacate that decision. We remand to the respective agencies for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The Pipeline Project and FERC\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   MVP plans to construct, operate, and maintain approximately 303.5 miles of new underground, 42-inch diameter pipeline extending from Wetzel County, West Virginia, to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. The trench for the pipeline will be at least 54 inches wide and 5.5 to 9 feet deep. Construction will involve \"remov[ing] trees, shrubs, brush, roots, and large rocks\" and will initially require a 75-foot to 125-foot right of way for construction purposes, and a subsequent 50-foot right of way for at least 30 years to accommodate the pipeline's operation.

Pursuant to the Natural Gas Act (\"NGA\"), a natural gas company is not permitted to undertake construction of a pipeline unless FERC first issues a Certificate authorizing such construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(c)(1)(A). Before doing so, in most cases FERC \"shall set the matter for hearing and shall give such reasonable notice of the hearing thereon to all interested persons as in its judgment may be necessary under [FERC's] rules and regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 717f(c)(1)(B).

Because portions of the proposed pipeline route cross federally owned lands, MVP was also required to obtain rights of way and temporary use permits from the federal government to construct and operate the pipeline on those lands. The proposed right of way will cross land managed by two different agencies-the Forest Service (3.6 miles or approximately 83 acres of the Jefferson National Forest in West Virginia and Virginia) and the Army Corps of Engineers (60 feet of the Weston and Gauley Bridge Turnpike Trail in Braxton County, West Virginia)-which means the Department of the Interior is responsible for issuing rights of way and attendant permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (\"Where the surface of the Federal lands involved is administered by ... two or more Federal agencies, the Secretary [of the Interior] is authorized, after consultation with the agencies involved, to grant or renew rights-of-way or permits through the Federal lands involved.\").

The second draft of the report also cited to a 2007 study from the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), which concluded that with the use of sediment basins, \"annual average sediment reductions ranged from 77 to 93 percent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The second draft cited still another study, a 2014 Master's thesis examining sediment barriers \"evaluated containment at a variety of slopes and rainfall\n   events and found that overall average projected performance efficiency ranged from 48 to 87 percent with a mean and median of 79 and 86 percent, respectively.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 311. In light of this data, the second draft concluded that 79% containment would be a proper figure to use \"to model the benefits of erosion and sediment control practices\" expected for the pipeline project.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The second draft also grappled with setting a proper exceedance threshold for impact of sedimentation on waterbodies. Ultimately, it decided to utilize a \"commonly used impact threshold\" of 10% \"to assess potential changes associated with sedimentation.\" J.A. 314-15. It then delineated streams and downstream waterbodies within the vicinity of the pipeline route with expected sediment loads or sediment increases of \"10 percent or greater.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 319, 322. Initially, the Forest Service expressed concern with this analysis, especially with regard to Threatened and Endangered Species (\"TES\"). At an April 6, 2017 meeting with consultants who composed the report, Forest Service officials expressed concern that \"organisms respond differently to increases in sedimentation, and a 10% impact threshold to determine when impacts would occur is likely not relevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1357-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Forest Service filed comments to the second draft on April 25, 2017, and conveyed apprehension with both the 79% and 10% figures. It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 \"Since many of the literature citations [offered in the second draft] are laboratory based and proper installation is widely understood in the industry to be a limiting factor for effectiveness in the field, [79%] is a vast overestimate of containment. It is more appropriate to err on the side of the worst case scenario, rather than the best case. Update the analysis to reflect a ... factor, equal to or less than 48% containment.\" J.A. 1361.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 \"The commonly used threshold of 10% may be a valid assumption for [areas that] meet[ ] water quality standards or do not contain sensitive aquatic biota.

Update the analysis to include cumulative effects delineation for Stony Creek and Craig Creek [both of which contain TES], and track updates (where appropriate) in the tables and figures.\" J.A. 1362. The Forest Service also explained, \"If there are impacts to sensitive species the F[orest] S[ervice] must analyze the significance of adverse effects on the populations, its habitat, and on the viability of the species as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After the Forest Service filed these comments, representatives of the Forest Service and MVP met on May 9, 2017, to discuss the Forest Service's concerns. During that meeting, MVP representatives expressed \"concern[ ] that lowering the containment value from 79% to 48% ...\n   <em>\n    would have ramifications for the entire project analysis\n   </em>\n   and would not accurately reflect the work that MVP has already done.\" J.A. 1363 (emphasis supplied). A representative from Environmental Solutions &amp; Innovations, the company that completed the Hydrologic Report, explained that \"the 79% containment figure was based on a field test thesis paper study,\" and thus, was not\n   <em>\n    strictly\n   </em>\n   laboratory based.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In turn, the Forest Service urged MVP to provide \"additional supporting documentation\n   for how MVP came up with their model assumptions, in particular containment efficiency.\" J.A. 1363. One of the Forest Service officials \"stressed\" that \"good plans aren't enough and must be bolstered by consistent monitoring and accurate implementation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1364.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On June 21, 2017, MVP responded to the Forest Service's concerns with the second draft of the Hydrologic Report, and submitted a third and final Hydrologic Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1374-81 (response to comments), 1384-1420 (final draft), 1422-37 (appendix with methods used in final analysis). As to the Forest Service's sedimentation concerns, MVP sent the Forest Service copies of the following studies:\n   <em>\n    The Performance Evaluation of Two Silt Fence Geosynthetic Fabrics During and After Rainfall Event\n   </em>\n   , the 2014 Master's thesis mentioned above by Gregg Steven Dubinski; a turbidity monitoring study completed by the United States Geological Survey; details regarding site specific erosion control measures along Craig Creek; and \"additional details supporting various aspects of the analysis.\" J.A. 1377-78. It also responded to the Forest Service comments as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The 79% containment value:\n   </em>\n   The studies provided to the Forest Service \"use both field and laboratory investigations ... to provide a range of efficiencies that are reasonably attainable.

Additional detail is provided in Section 2.6 of the [Hydrologic Report].\" J.A. 1381. Section 2.6 of the third Hydrologic Report, in turn, contains a soil loss and sediment delivery analysis, and explains that \"[f]rom a sensitive-species perspective, a 10 percent increase over background would likely be within the normal variance experienced in a stream system\" and \"natural variation in streams is relatively high\"; thus, \"detecting sediment increases in streams is fairly difficult.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1405.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The very next day, June 22, 2017, FERC released the EIS, which incorporated and relied upon the second draft of the Hydrologic Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the EIS stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 In the commentary process, the Forest Service expressed concern \"regarding the potential for increased sedimentation caused by erosion of exposed soil ... to affect the waterbodies crossed by the [pipeline] within the Jefferson National Forest and impact downstream resources.\" J.A. 234.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 To address these concerns, MVP \"commissioned a sedimentation model to assess the extent of sedimentation that could occur during construction within [certain] subwatersheds that intersect the Jefferson National Forest boundaries and the project area.\" J.A. 234-35.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 This \"model\" resulted in the conclusion that catchments in certain subwatersheds \"would likely experience increases in sediment yield over baseline conditions during construction, restoration, and operation.\" J.A. 235.

Of note, the Forest Service did not provide any discussion as to how its concerns with regard to the second draft had been alleviated, and did not explain how the EIS was an adequate statement even though it relied on the second draft, not the third.

Nor can we ascertain how the Forest Service concluded that its comments had been satisfied, especially after having expressed such grave concerns about the sedimentation impact and containment figures presented in the second draft of the Hydrologic Report. The Forest Service suggests the written comments from MVP after the second draft, and the Forest Service's ROD months later, demonstrate that the concerns had been alleviated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp'ts' Br. 38. MVP counsel\n   likewise explained at oral argument, \"[T]he court can certainly discern the rationale\" for the Forest Service's ultimate acquiescence to the 79% figure. Oral Argument at 39:37-40,\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v. Forest Service\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-2399 (May 8, 2018) (hereinafter \"Oral Argument\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Intervenor's Br. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But we certainly\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   discern the Forest Service's rationale because, as MVP counsel admitted at argument, \"[The Forest Service] doesn't say in the record specifically that [its proposed 48% figure] is incorrect.\" Oral Argument at 39:33-36. Indeed, the Forest Service expressed nothing but skepticism of the 79% figure for more than three months. In fact, the Forest Service proposed the 48% figure as a ceiling, rather than a floor or even a desired target, for sediment containment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1361 (proposing a figure \"equal to or less than 48% containment\"). Given the circumstances, we simply cannot conclude that the Forest Service undertook an independent review and determined that its comments and concerns were satisfied when it shifted from a 48% ceiling to 79% with absolutely no explanation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.3\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1506.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). This shift is particularly concerning in light of MVP's commentary at the May 9 meeting that using the 48% figure would have \"ramifications for the entire project analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1363. MVP's counsel attempted to curb this statement at argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument at 35:55-36:01 (The \"ramifications ... would be to challenge basic practice for dealing with construction related impacts.\"). But a more logical way to interpret the statement is that MVP was troubled that using the 48% figure would undercut other studies and numbers supporting the project, causing the entire project to fail or be delayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, MVP's June 21, 2017 comments do not support the Forest Service's change in position. For example, in response to concerns about the 79% containment figure, MVP states that the figure \"is not the best-case scenario, but rather the mean reported value for both silt fences and compost filter socks, two predominant controls proposed to be used on the [pipeline right of way].\" J.A. 1384. Significantly, the Forest Service already knew this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.3\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.3\">\n    at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second draft of Hydrologic Report: \"Th[e] [79%] value is chosen because it is the mean reported value for both silt fences and compost filter socks.\"). In response to both the 79% figure and the 10% sedimentation impact threshold, MVP's June 21 comments list the Dubinski thesis, one government turbidity study, \"details\" about erosion control on Craig Creek, and \"additional support\" that MVP provided to the Forest Service to further explain its rationale.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1368-69, 1372. But critically, the Forest Service ROD does not explain how these materials support the metrics used in the Hydrologic Report, or how they assuage the Forest Service's earlier concerns about TES in the above-threshold subwatersheds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As to the 10% figure for sediment increase above baseline measures, the EIS explains that even when \"accounting for [MVP's] erosion and sediment control methods,\" construction could increase sedimentation \"\n   <em>\n    by more than 10 percent\n   </em>\n   along sections of Craig Creek and [other certain headwater streams, tributaries, and subwatersheds].\" J.A. 235 (emphasis supplied). The EIS also explains that \"a new sediment equilibrium\n   <em>\n    in excess of 10 percent\n   </em>\n   over baseline for streams within [two certain] subwatersheds\" would occur as a result of the project.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis supplied). Yet the Forest Service does not address these points in adopting the EIS, even though it earlier explained that (1) \"organisms respond differently to increases in sedimentation, and a 10% impact threshold to determine when impacts\n   would occur is likely not relevant,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1357-58; and (2) if increase in sediment load leads to \"impacts to sensitive species,\" the Forest Service \"must analyze the significance of adverse effects on the populations, its habitat, and on the viability of the species as a whole,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1362. Indeed, the Forest Service asked MVP to further evaluate the\n   <em>\n    impacts\n   </em>\n   on TES of less than 10% over the sedimentation baseline, but in response, MVP simply stated that a 10% increase \"would likely be within the normal variance experienced in a stream system,\" and \"detecting sediment increases in streams is fairly difficult.\" J.A. 1405.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   ii.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Remand to the Forest Service\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Pursuant to NEPA, we conclude the Forest Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in adopting the sedimentation analysis in the EIS.

Leading up to the filing of the EIS, the Forest Service expressed steadfast concerns about the figures proposed by the Hydrologic Report.

Finally, FERC incorporated the second draft of the Hydrologic Report in the EIS, even though the third and final draft was issued the previous day.

For example, Alternative 1, which would be collocated with existing electrical transmission lines for around 70 more miles than the proposed route, also \"crosses 1.9 fewer miles of [National Forest Service] lands, ... and would impact less interior forest\" compared to the proposed route. J.A. 604. However, it would also be 20 miles longer, \"potentially disturbing 336 more acres, and 90 more parcels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Hybrid Alternative 1A, which would cross the forest in a different location, would \"be substantially collocated with various overhead electric transmission lines,\" and would cross 1.8 fewer miles of the Jefferson National Forest and five fewer miles with landslide potential. But it would also increase the length of the pipeline by six miles, affect 28 more landowners, and cross 22 more perennial streams and two more major waterbodies.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Hybrid Alternative 1B would reduce impacts on interior forests, but would increase the length of the pipeline by almost 15 miles and increase the \"overall project disturbance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 605. And the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Collocation Alternative, which would involve the installation of the MVP pipeline adjacent to the proposed pipeline route for the Atlantic Coast pipeline project, would affect less interior and old growth forest compared to the proposed route. But that option would cross 15.6 more miles of Forest Service land, and in many areas, there is insufficient space to run the pipelines beside each other, so construction would require side slope construction techniques and additional acres of disturbance. The EIS also discussed how collocation is desirable because it reduces forest fragmentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 225 (explaining that collocating the pipeline with an existing right of way \"reduces the amount of fragmentation and new edges by shifting the existing forest edge as opposed to creating a completely new corridor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As for visual impact, the agencies considered this as well, including \"potential visual impacts ... both at the [Appalachian Trail] crossing location and from more distant viewpoints.\" J.A. 152.

But it nonetheless concludes they were not \"directly related\" to the Planning Rule because, with proposed mitigation measures in the plan of development and project design, which \"will minimize adverse environmental impacts to soils and water resources and riparian areas,\" the amendment will not cause \"substantial adverse effects\" or \"a substantial lessening of protections\" to soil and water.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   With regard to the directly related analysis, the Department of Agriculture itself has explained, \"When a specific substantive requirement is associated with\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the purpose for the amendment\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the effects (beneficial or adverse) of the amendment, the responsible official must apply that requirement to the amendment.\" Nat'l Forest Sys.

We conclude that the only way to read this statement, along with \u00a7 219.13(b)(5)(ii), is to require the agency to look to both the purpose and effect of the amendment, and if the substantive requirement at issue (i.e., soil, water) is based upon or associated with either one, it is\n   <em>\n    directly related\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In its ROD here, however, the Forest Service failed to analyze the purpose of the amendment.

The Forest Service admittedly needed to change the Forest Plan because the MVP project could not meet its requirements otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1280 (\"The amendment [to the Forest Plan] is needed because the MVP Project cannot achieve several\n   <em>\n    Forest Plan standards\n   </em>\n   that are intended to protect\n   <em>\n    soil, water, [and] riparian ... resources\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis supplied) ). Of note, elsewhere in the ROD, the Forest Service characterizes the purpose of the amendment as \"ensur[ing] consistency between provisions of the Forest Plan and the proposal to construct, operate, and maintain [the pipeline] on National Forest System land.\" J.A. 1284. But there would be no need to \"ensure consistency\" if the Forest Plan need not be amended in the first place. Thus, the clear purpose of the amendment is to lessen requirements protecting soil and riparian resources so that the pipeline project could meet those requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Having determined the purpose of the amendment, it is clear the Planning Rule sets forth substantive requirements\n   <em>\n    directly related\n   </em>\n   to that purpose: \"soil and soil productivity\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20219.8\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 219.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(ii) ); \"water resources\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20219.8\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 219.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(iv) ); \"the ecological integrity of riparian areas\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20219.8\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 219.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(i) ). Therefore, there is no question that the 2012 Planning Rule requirements for soil, water, and riparian resources are\n   <em>\n    directly related\n   </em>\n   to the purpose of the Forest Plan amendment. The Forest Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Remand to the Forest Service\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Because the soil and riparian Planning Rule requirements are\n   <em>\n    directly related\n   </em>\n   to the amendments to the Jefferson Forest Plan, the agency is required to \"apply [those] requirement[s] within the scope and scale of the amendment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20219.13\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 219.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). At base, this means that the Forest Service is required to ensure that amendments to the soil and riparian standards in the Jefferson Forest Plan will comply with the NFMA and attendant regulations. The Forest Service claims this would be an exercise in futility, as the record already demonstrates that the mitigation measures proposed by MVP and agreed upon by FERC and the other agencies will ensure that there will be no substantial adverse effects to soil and water. However, as explained in our analysis of the Hydrologic Report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the record does not support such a conclusion as a matter of law. We therefore remand to the Forest Service for proper application of the Planning Rule soil and riparian requirements to the Forest Plan amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    The Mineral Leasing Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Finally, we turn to Petitioners' argument that the BLM violated the MLA in its grant of the 3.6 mile right of way across federal land. The Natural Gas Act gives FERC the authority over construction and operation of interstate gas pipelines, but it does not limit or modify other agencies' authority or obligations. The MLA regulates the\n   <em>\n    location\n   </em>\n   of interstate pipelines across most federal lands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This includes approving rights of way and easements for the siting of those pipelines.

Petitioners contend the BLM violated its obligations because it \"failed to demonstrate that alternatives that would make greater use of existing rights-of-way were impractical.\" Pet'rs' Br. 45 (emphasis supplied). We agree. Whereas the BLM's ROD adopted and incorporated the EIS's NEPA alternatives analysis on this issue, it nonetheless failed to recognize that the MLA imposes a higher and more specific bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The EIS \"evaluate[d] a range of reasonable alternatives, as required by NEPA,\" explaining, \"The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether an alternative would be\n   <em>\n    preferable to the proposed action\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 113-14 (emphasis supplied). The EIS used the following criteria in considering whether an alternative was \"preferable\": (1) whether it met \"the stated purpose of the project\"; (2) whether it was \"technically and economically feasible and practical\"; and (3) whether it \"offer[ed] a significant environmental advantage over [the] proposed action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 114. Importantly, the EIS explained, \"Ultimately, an alternative that results in equal or minor advantages in terms of environmental impact would not compel [FERC] to shift the impacts from the [set of landowners set to be affected by the proposed route] to a new set of landowners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Using this criteria, the EIS discussed alternative routes. For example, the Columbia Gas of Virginia (\"CGV\") Peters Mountain Variation would \"follow existing rights-of-way ... cross[ing] approximately 0.8 mile[s] of the Jefferson National Forest.\" J.A. 149. However, the EIS also explained that this route \"would be about 9 miles longer than the comparable portion of the proposed route, and would result in approximately 136 additional acres of construction disturbance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 151. Thus, the EIS concluded that the CGV alternative route \"\n   <em>\n    does not offer a significant environmental advantage\n   </em>\n   when compared to the corresponding proposed route.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 152 (emphasis supplied). The BLM's ROD, like the EIS, considered whether alternatives \"offer[ed] a significant environmental advantage over the proposed pipeline route.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 603;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, by incorporating and adopting the EIS, the BLM fulfilled its statutory duty to utilize existing rights of way\n   <em>\n    when practical\n   </em>\n   . The BLM also argues it has wide discretion to decide, on a case-by-case basis, which alternatives are practical. As support for its interpretation, it points to a BLM regulation providing that the agency \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   ... restrict new grants to existing right of way corridors\n   <em>\n    where safety and other considerations allow\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202882.10\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2882.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphases supplied).
