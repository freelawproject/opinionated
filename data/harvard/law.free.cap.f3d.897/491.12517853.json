An individual contesting a final order of removal has the opportunity to raise that defense in a petition for review and, if it appears to the appellate court considering the petition that a genuine factual question exists as to the petitioner's nationality, that court must transfer the proceeding to the district court where the petitioner resides, for a nationality determination to be made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case requires us to address whether an appeal from a nationality determination following such a transfer must be taken to the appellate court that typically hears appeals from the district court making the determination, or whether jurisdiction lies with the appellate court that transferred the case to the district court in the first place. Both parties urge us to conclude that appeals from nationality determinations made under \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) must be to the court of appeals for the circuit that embraces the transferee district court. We agree. The pertinent statutory language makes it clear that Congress intended for hearings conducted pursuant to \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) to be treated as new proceedings separate from the underlying\n   petitions for review. We thus lack jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a nationality determination made by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Junior M. Ricketts petitioned this Court to review the Board of Immigration Appeals' denial of his motions to reopen his removal proceedings, which had resulted in a final order of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of the defenses to removal that Ricketts has raised is that he is in reality a United States citizen. After determining that there were genuine issues of material fact as to his nationality, we granted a joint motion by Ricketts and the government to transfer the nationality dispute to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York-the district where Ricketts resided at the relevant time-pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(B), so that a determination of his nationality could be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing, it decided that Ricketts had \"failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he is a citizen of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Ricketts v. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-329,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203676419\">\n    2016 WL 3676419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. July 7, 2016). It found instead that the \"evidence overwhelmingly establishe[d]\" that he is a Jamaican national who appropriated the identity of a United States citizen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Of course dissatisfied with the District Court's determination, Ricketts filed a notice of appeal, seeking review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The District Court, however, transmitted the appeal to this Court, not to the Second Circuit. After receiving the case file from the District Court, our Clerk of Court instructed the parties to address whether Ricketts's appeal was properly transmitted to us or whether the appeal should be transferred to the Second Circuit. In response, the government filed a motion to transfer the appeal to the Second Circuit but requested that we retain jurisdiction over Ricketts's consolidated petitions for review. Ricketts also requested that we transfer his appeal to the Second Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

And in the context of proceedings under \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B), the only district court to render a reviewable decision is the transferee district court. Because in this case the transferee court was the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and that court lies within the jurisdiction of the Second Circuit, we have no power to entertain an appeal of the nationality determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our decision today may put us at odds with a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In\n   <em>\n    Demirchyan v. Holder\n   </em>\n   , the court characterized a \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfer as a limited remand which did not require the petitioner challenging a nationality determination to file a separate notice of appeal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205888,4207330\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1141/\">\n    641 F.3d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142-43 (9th Cir. 2011). The Ninth Circuit appears to have rejected the contention that a court of appeals is deprived of jurisdiction over a petitioner's nationality challenge once it initiates a \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205888,4207330\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1141/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205888,4207330\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1141/\">\n    at 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It has thus, perhaps, implicitly rejected one of the premises from which we are operating, namely that \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfers create new proceedings. Importantly, however,\n   <em>\n    Demirchyan\n   </em>\n   involved the more common procedural posture of an intra-circuit \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205888,4207330\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1141/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Ninth Circuit, as both the transferor court of appeals and the court of appeals embracing the district court issuing the ruling, did not have to grapple with the jurisdictional issue that arises when there is an appeal following an inter-circuit \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfer, as is so here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the reasons already explained, there is a meaningful distinction between \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfers and limited remands. As to \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B), Congress constructed a statutory scheme using the term \"transfer\" and specifically instructed that such \"transfers\" be treated as if they were newly filed declaratory judgment actions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(B). In contrast, a limited remand is a procedural device created by appellate courts for judicial convenience and case management to allow a district court to make \"\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   findings or explanations.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lipitor Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276741\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/126/#p151\">\n    855 F.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151 (3d Cir. 2017) (emphasis added). Nationality determinations do not involve returning a case to a district court for additional findings or explanations. Rather, they require a district court to undertake an examination of a petitioner's nationality claim in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joseph v. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928709\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/224/#p229\">\n    421 F.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229-30 (3d Cir. 2005) (explaining that a \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfer results in a district court conducting a de novo nationality determination). Moreover, considerations of judicial convenience and case management do not outweigh Congressional directions. Accordingly, to the extent\n   <em>\n    Demirchyan\n   </em>\n   can be read to stand for the proposition that a court of appeals that initiates a \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transfer necessarily retains jurisdiction over any subsequent challenge to the nationality determination, we respectfully disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction to entertain Ricketts's appeal of the nationality determination made by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York does not affect our jurisdiction over Ricketts's underlying consolidated petitions for review. The jurisdictional discussion above relates only to the nationality determination undertaken by the \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) transferee district court. The proceedings here and in the circuit court embracing the transferee district court progress, in effect, on independent tracks, though it will typically be appropriate for us to stay an underlying petition for review pending a nationality determination. Once there is a final resolution of a petitioner's nationality claim, the merits of the underlying petition for review should be ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We will thus transfer only Ricketts's nationality appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
