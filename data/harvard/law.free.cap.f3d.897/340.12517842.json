The District Court further explained that it was \"very troubled\" that some of the alleged contacts with witnesses were made after the EDVA Stay-Away Order was in place, noting that it would \"consider the defendant's adherence to that Court's admonitions in determining whether it can place its trust in the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the court considered Appellant's request for \"the issuance of an order [listing witnesses] that would absolutely be clear enough for him to follow.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the District Court's view, such an order would be unworkable: \"there is a real risk that the defendant will interpret any list naming certain individuals as license to contact any other individuals involved in the investigation. The Court cannot draft an order that is specific enough to cover every possible future violation of the United States Code, and it should not have to.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n    at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On this rationale, the District Court held that \"it could not find, as the statute requires that it must, that defendant Manafort would abide by [any additional] conditions\" of release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having made the required findings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203148\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), the District Court ordered Appellant detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Manafort appealed the District Court's detention order ten days later. He sought release pending his appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 9(a)(3), which this Court denied. We now address Appellant's merits appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court relied solely on probable cause of Appellant's commission of a crime to find that Appellant was subject to revocation of his release under \u00a7 3148(b)(1)(A). That finding is not contested here. The District Court then made each of the two \u00a7 3148(b)(2) findings, that the proposed package of release conditions would not assure the safety of the community under \u00a7 3148(b)(2)(A), and that Appellant is unlikely to abide by any conditions of release under \u00a7 3148(b)(2)(B). Appellant challenges each of these findings. Either finding provides an independent basis for detention, so upholding either finding is sufficient to uphold the District Court's detention order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellant asserts that both findings are reviewed for clear error, Appellant's Br. 9-10, and the Government does not disagree, Appellee's Br. 12-13, 19. We employ the clear error standard of review because\n   both parties ask us to do so, though we note that the standard of review for the determination that a defendant is unlikely to abide by any conditions of release remains an open question in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we find no clear error in the District Court's finding that Appellant is unlikely to abide by any conditions of release, we affirm and therefore do not reach the challenge to the dangerousness finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellant attacks three underlying factual bases upon which the District Court found that Appellant would be unlikely to abide by any conditions the District Court might craft: (1) the June 8 Superseding Indictment against Appellant for witness tampering; (2) Appellant's potential violation of the Stay-Away Order issued in his separate case pending in the Eastern District of Virginia; and (3) Appellant's actions in relation to the Gag Order issued by the District Court in the DDC case. Appellant's Br. 18, 19-20, 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We agree with Appellant that the District Court's implicit finding that his communications violated the EDVA Stay-Away Order is problematic. At the detention hearing, the District Court viewed the EDVA Stay-Away Order as sufficiently broad to cover any potential witnesses in the EDVA or DDC cases, Hr'g Tr. at 50, and the written detention ruling, after characterizing the EDVA Stay-Away Order as \"clear and unambiguous,\" suggested that Appellant had not adhered to that order, Mem. Op. at 18. For several reasons, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the statutory scheme supports a narrow reading of stay-away orders. Congress specified that a release order \"include a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the release is subject, in a manner sufficiently\n   <em>\n    clear and specific\n   </em>\n   to serve as a guide for the person's conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1) (emphasis added). The statutory requirement for clarity accords with the familiar rule that the court should not punish someone for violating an order if the terms of that order are unclear.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v. Exec. Office of the President, Office of Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    1 F.3d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (reversing a civil contempt finding because of ambiguity in the order). The language in the EDVA Stay-Away Order is at the very least ambiguous with respect to whether the prohibition on contact with \"any person who is a victim or witness in the investigation or prosecution\" prohibits contact with potential witnesses\n   to conduct underlying charges brought in a separate case in another jurisdiction. And any ambiguity in the EDVA Stay-Away Order should be construed against the Government, not Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the statutory provision authorizing stay-away orders focuses on the specific offense pending before that court at that moment. Section 3142 provides, as a potential condition of release, a requirement that the defendant \"avoid all contact with an alleged victim of\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   crime and with a potential witness who may testify concerning\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B)(v) (emphases added). The use of the definite article \"the\" before \"crime\" and \"offense\" suggests a narrow reading of pretrial release orders, confined to witnesses to the alleged conduct charged in the particular case for which the defendant has sought pretrial release. That same definite article is incorporated into the EDVA release order. EDVA Stay-Away Order at 3 (Appellant \"must avoid all contact, directly or indirectly, with any person who is a victim or witness in\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   investigation or prosecution of the defendant\" (emphasis added) ). Thus, it would be natural for anyone, including Appellant, to believe that the no-contact provision is applicable only to the particular charges brought in the EDVA case. While we agree that the Stay-Away Order could plausibly be read to cover witnesses in the District of Columbia case, such a reading is not clear and unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , we find it significant that the Government never contended below that Appellant violated the EDVA Stay-Away Order. If the no-contact provisions of the order clearly applied to Appellant's conduct, it seems quite curious that the Government never said so below. (The Government attempts to do so now,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. 20, but because it did not raise this argument before the District Court, it is forfeited.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The context of the hearing indicates that the District Court concluded that the EDVA Stay-Away Order covered witnesses in the District of Columbia case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 31 (asking Appellant if it is his \"position that he could call witnesses in this [District of Columbia] case, but not witnesses in that [EDVA] case?\"). Further, the District Court construed D1 and D2 to be witnesses in the District of Columbia case, because all of the discussion centered around Appellant's attempts to discuss their testimony about the then-new allegations related to the unregistered-foreign-agent charges in the February 23 Superseding Indictment in the District of Columbia. Thus, the District Court found that Appellant violated the EDVA Stay-Away Order by contacting witnesses in the District of Columbia case, not witnesses in the EDVA case. This finding was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But what impact does this error have on the ultimate finding that Appellant is unlikely to abide by conditions of release in the future? When reviewing under the clear error standard, \"we do not weigh each piece of evidence in isolation, but consider all of the evidence taken as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Barhoumi v. Obama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550489,3691573\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/416/\">\n    609 F.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (D.C.

Cir. 2010) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Despite the District Court's finding that Appellant violated the terms of the EDVA Stay-Away Order, that error does not undermine the District Court's ultimate conclusion. Given the District Court's consideration of all of the information before it and its other subsidiary findings, we are not \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\" in the District Court's finding under \u00a7 3148(b)(2)(B), in light of \"the entire evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barhoumi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550489,3691573\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/416/\">\n    609 F.3d at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Op. at 19. This finding was based on Appellant's course of conduct throughout the \"six months\" he had remained released in the District of Columbia case and Appellant's \"abuse[ ] [of] the trust placed in\" him by the District Court during that time. Hr'g Tr. at 51. That course of conduct included Appellant's decision to push the envelope by contributing to an op-ed in a foreign newspaper while under the Gag Order and his repeated communications with potential witnesses, personally and through an intermediary. \"[A]ll of this\" conduct, which the District Court chronicled in detail during the hearing, \"affect[ed] [the District Court's] judgment about whether [Appellant] can be trusted to comply with the Court's directives.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20L.%20Ed.%20746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The District Court did not clearly err by finding Appellant was unlikely to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The conduct that loomed largest-in both the briefing on the revocation motion and in the District Court's findings-was the evidence suggesting Appellant had committed a crime while on release. The District Court found that if Appellant had committed a new crime even while ordered not to commit a new crime, it was likely to happen again. The District Court observed that there was no way to prevent Appellant from accessing devices that would enable him to contact witnesses while released, Mem. Op. at 17, and thus no way to ensure that further witness tampering would not occur in the future unless he were detained. After all, the communications with D1 and D2 were only discovered by the Government because the witnesses reported them; otherwise, they likely would have gone undetected. The District Court's core conclusion was that even if it entered an order commanding Appellant not to commit further crimes, and even if the order listed every offense in the U.S. Code, it would not be effective because Appellant would attempt to circumvent it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. It was also not lost on the District Court that Appellant had been warned about \"skating close to the line\" with respect to the potential violation of the Gag Order, Hr'g Tr. at 50, and yet Appellant failed to heed those warnings and went right past the line with the alleged witness tampering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While it is true that the District Court also considered the communications to be a violation of the EDVA Stay-Away Order, we do not find clear error after reviewing the entirety of the District Court record. The ultimate \u00a7 3148(b)(2)(B) finding was that Appellant was unlikely to abide by any conditions the District Court might impose, including the \"most fundamental condition of release ... that he not commit [additional] crime[s] during the period of release.\" Mem. Op. at 19. The District Court's treatment of the EDVA Stay-Away Order was merely part of the icing; the cake had already been baked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We find Appellant's remaining arguments to be without merit.
