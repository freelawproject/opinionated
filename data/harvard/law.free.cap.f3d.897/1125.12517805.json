Trump (\"Attendees\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City Defendants contend\n   the court erred when it (1) denied the Officers qualified immunity, and (2) held the Attendees had stated a claim for municipal liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the City. Taking the allegations in the operative complaint as true, and reading them in the light most favorable to the Attendees, we find the Officers violated clearly established rights and are not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the proceedings. We also find the City's liability is not inextricably intertwined with the Officers' liability, and we therefore lack jurisdiction over the City's appeal. We affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity to the Officers and dismiss the City's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The First Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 2, 2016, Trump held a political rally (\"Rally\") at the McEnery Convention Center (\"Convention Center\") in San Jose, California. The San Jose Police Department (\"Police Department\"), along with the U.S. Secret Service, expected between 12,000 and 15,000 people to attend, and the event was to run from 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Police Department was aware that Trump rallies in other cities had \"spurred violent anti-Trump protests,\" and it took several steps to prepare for the Rally. Among other things, the City \"requested between [50] and [70] additional officers\" through \"designated mutual aid ... channels to staff the Rally,\" accepted \"additional officers and vehicle support\" from other police departments in the area, and fitted many of the officers with riot gear. About 250 officers patrolled the Rally on June 2, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), the City \"normal[ly] [implements a] 'zero tolerance' approach to violent protesters[ ] by making targeted arrests during the protests.\" But here, the City took an \"entirely different\" approach: \"the City Defendants instructed all officers to stand by, watch as the attacks occurred, and not intervene\" because \"intervention might cause a riot.\" The Attendees claim the Officers looked on as they were \"battered by several anti-Trump protesters, including, in some instances, being struck in the head and face, kicked in the back, spat upon, and otherwise harassed and assaulted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Significant to this appeal, the Attendees allege the Officers \"[d]irect[ed] [them] into the [m]ob of [v]iolent [p]rotesters\" waiting outside the Convention Center. As part of their crowd-control plan, the Officers only allowed the Attendees to \"leave from the east-northeast exit of the ... Convention Center\" and \"actively prevented [them] from leaving through alternative exits.\" \"Upon exiting the [C]onvention [C]enter, the [A]ttendees were met with a police skirmish line, composed of and/or controlled by the [Officers].\" \"The [O]fficers in this line required the [Attendees] to turn north as they left the [C]onvention [C]enter, and to proceed along Market Street, into the crowd of violent anti-Trump protesters.\" The Officers \"actively prevented the ... [A]ttendees from proceeding south ..., away from the anti-Trump protesters, or from leaving the [C]onvention through alternative exits.\" The Officers \"instructed other police officers\" to direct the Attendees in the same manner. Many of the Attendees \"were beaten, victimized by theft, and/or had objects such as bottles and eggs thrown at them\" as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two Attendees-Hernandez and Haines-Scrodin-claim that San Jose police \"directed [them] to walk through the anti-Trump protesters, rather than ... allow[ing] [them] to turn south, in the direction of safety.\" \"Soon after following the[se] directions ..., [they] were struck repeatedly in their faces and heads by anti-Trump protester, Victor Gasca.\" \"Several other anti-Trump protesters also battered Hernandez and Haines-Scrodin, while Gasca kept up his assault.\" As a result, \"Hernandez suffered a broken nose [and several] abrasions,\" and \"Haines-Scrodin ... suffered [various] bodily injuries.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Another Attendee, I.P., claims he experienced similar violence due to the City Defendants' poorly conceived crowd-control plan. Just like Hernandez and Haines-Scrodin, he \"exited the east-northeast exit of the ... Convention Center, where a line of police officers prevented [him] from turning right, to safety\" and instead \"directed [him] to turn left, into the anti-Trump protesters.\" \"I.P. was struck in the back of his head\" by one protester and \"tackled ... to the ground by another.\" \"After being attacked, I.P. made his way [back] to [the] police skirmish line, and was only later allowed to cross the line to safety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the Attendees, the Officers were clearly aware of the violence outside the Convention Center. \"In fact, as early as [6 p.m.] the day of the Rally, the San Jose police warned all officers deployed around [the] Rally that assaults had already been reported outside the [Convention Center].\" During the Rally, the Officers witnessed the violence firsthand, or were at least informed of it, but they did nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   San Jose police officers on the scene \"arrested only three individuals\" during the Rally, \"each of whom allegedly assaulted and/or battered police officers.\" They made \"no arrests at the Rally in connection with the dozens of similar criminal acts committed against [the Attendees].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the Rally, San Jose Police Chief Edgardo Garcia (\"Chief Garcia\") \"publicly commend[ed] the [police] officers' actions\" and \"lauded [them for showing] 'discipline.' \" Chief Garcia further stated \" 'additional force can incite more violence in the crowd' \" and that the officers at the Rally \" 'should be commended for both their effectiveness and their restraint.' \" Chief Garcia did not discipline the Officers for their conduct during the Rally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on these allegations, the Attendees brought a class action against the City Defendants alleging, among other things, a \u00a7 1983 due process claim against the Officers and a \u00a7 1983 due process claim against the City under\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

The Court \"interpret[s] the 'inextricably intertwined' standard narrowly\" and applies it in \"extremely limited\" circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Puente Ariz.\n   </em>\n   , 821 F.3d at 1109 (citations omitted). \"The standard is only satisfied where the issues are (a) ... so intertwined that [the Court] must decide the pendent issue in order to review the claims properly raised on interlocutory appeal, or (b) resolution of the issue properly raised on\n   interlocutory appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Neither prong is satisfied here. First, we need not decide \"the pendent issue\"-whether the Attendees have stated a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City premised on their ratification theory-in order to decide the issue \"properly raised on interlocutory appeal\"-whether the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Whether the allegations concerning Chief Garcia's public statements and his failure to discipline his officers are sufficient to constitute ratification is an issue that is not necessary for deciding whether the Officers violated the Attendees' due process rights on the night of the Rally by directing them towards violent protesters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Recognizing this, the City proceeds only under the second prong of the test, arguing \"resolution of the issue properly raised [on] appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.\" According to the City, \"a negative answer to the question whether the employee violated the Constitution will always necessarily resolve the pendent issue of whether the municipality was liable for the violation.\" While this might be true in some cases,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Huskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474786\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/893/#p902\">\n    204 F.3d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the principle is inapplicable here because we have held the Officers\n   <em>\n    violated\n   </em>\n   the Attendees' due process rights, based on the allegations in the FAC. That may mean that the City-through Chief Garcia's ratification of his officers' conduct-is also liable under \u00a7 1983, but it does not \"\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   resolve[ ]\" the issue one way or another.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474786\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/893/#p902\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474786\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/893/#p902\">\n    at 905-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

The Officers' liability, as discussed at length above, will turn on whether they increased the danger to the Attendees and acted with deliberate indifference to that danger. Because we must apply \"different legal standards\" to whether Chief Garcia actually ratified the Officers' conduct and to whether that conduct was unconstitutional, the two issues are not \"inextricably intertwined,\" and the City's appeal is not subject to pendent jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Puente Ariz.\n   </em>\n   , 821 F.3d at 1109 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
