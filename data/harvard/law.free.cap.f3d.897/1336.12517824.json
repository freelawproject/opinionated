The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"Board\") of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") instituted the IPRs over AIT's objection that the three IPR petitions filed by Appellee RPX Corporation (\"RPX\") were time-barred under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20315\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2012). AIT contended that RPX was acting as a \"proxy\" for one of its clients, Salesforce.com, Inc. (\"Salesforce\"), on whom AIT had served a complaint alleging infringement of the '482 and '111 patents more than one year before RPX filed its petitions. Thus, AIT alleged that\n   RPX was not the only real party in interest and that the time bar applicable to Salesforce was equally applicable to RPX. In two final written decisions, the Board held certain claims of the patents unpatentable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    RPX Corp. v.

For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the Board applied an unduly restrictive test for determining whether a person or entity is a \"real party in interest\" within the meaning of \u00a7 315(b) and failed to consider the entirety of the evidentiary record in assessing whether \u00a7 315(b) barred institution of these IPRs. We accordingly vacate the Board's final written decisions and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.

One of its strategies is \"to help members of [its] client network quickly and cost-effectively extricate themselves from [non-practicing entity ('NPE') ] lawsuits.\" J.A. 29. Salesforce is one of RPX's clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 17, 2015-more than one year after Salesforce was served with copies of AIT's complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Salesforce\n   </em>\n   litigation and several months after Salesforce's CBM petitions were denied-RPX filed three IPR petitions challenging the patentability of claims of the '482 and '111 patents. In each petition, RPX identified itself as the \"sole real party-in-interest,\" and certified that it is not barred or estopped from requesting IPR as to the '482 and '111 patent claims. Moreover, in each petition, RPX acknowledged that the outcome of the IPRs could impact the ongoing\n   <em>\n    Salesforce\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly thereafter, AIT filed motions for additional discovery, in which it asked the\n   Board to compel RPX to produce documents relevant to identifying the real parties in interest. AIT \"expect[ed] that the requested discovery, together with additional information, will make a compelling showing that RPX is the agent of un-named third party Salesforce.com, Inc.

The first, titled \"Validity Challenge Identification Process and Best Practices\" (\"Best Practices Guide\"), sets forth the company's \"best practices\" for identifying patents whose validity it will challenge in an IPR.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n    at 80-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The document, which was created on July 9, 2014,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1227 \u00b6 14, provides that \"RPX best practices help ensure that RPX is complying with all contractual obligations and to ensure that RPX is and will be deemed by the PTAB and district courts as the sole real party-in-interest in all validity challenges unless another real party-in-interest is expressly identified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n    at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . RPX's best practices (1) expressly discourage the company from taking suggestions from third parties, including clients, regarding validity challenges; (2) provide that it will not discuss forthcoming validity challenges with third parties in advance of filing; and (3) mandate that RPX will not discuss strategy or take feedback on pending validity challenges, and will \"maintain complete control of all aspects of pending validity challenges.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This document further explains that \"[a] validity challenge identification team ... will identify potential validity challenges to propose to the Validity Challenge Approval Committee,\" and \"will identify potential candidates based, in part, on\" multiple factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n    at 80-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The second document is a declaration from RPX's Vice President of Client Relations, William W. Chuang, in which\n   Chuang testified as to the reasons RPX files IPRs, the process that led to RPX's filing of the IPR petitions in this case, and RPX's interactions with Salesforce. Chuang testified that \"RPX has many reasons for filing IPR petitions,\" including (1) reducing patent risk to an industry of companies, including current and potential clients; (2) decreasing the number of plainly invalid patents, which undermines confidence in the general patent market and might cause current and prospective clients to question whether they should pay subscription fees to RPX; (3) providing leverage in negotiating reasonable prices for acquiring patent rights and removing them from the hands of NPEs; and (4) conveying to the industry that RPX, unlike certain of its competitors, \"uses every available method to reduce patent risk efficiently.\" J.A. 1223-26 \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Chuang also averred that RPX followed its Best Practices Guide in deciding to file the three IPR petitions in this case, and that it accordingly \"had no communication with Salesforce whatsoever regarding the filing of IPR petitions against the AIT Patents before the AIT IPRs were filed.\" J.A. 1229 \u00b6 20. He testified that \"RPX originally looked at the AIT Patents after the AIT-Salesforce Litigation was filed\" pursuant to its \"customary practice\" of monitoring newly filed patent infringement lawsuits to identify suits brought by NPEs. J.A. 1235 \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. According to Chuang, RPX \"most likely\" identified the '482 and '111 patents as \"good potential IPR candidates that aligned well with the selection criteria\" set forth in the Best Practices Guide during a meeting held on February 20, 2015-just after Salesforce's CBM petitions were denied. J.A. 1236-37 \u00b6\u00b6 37-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Chuang further testified regarding \"six communications between RPX and Salesforce employees in which the AIT-Salesforce Litigation and/or the AIT Patents were mentioned or discussed.\" J.A. 1230 \u00b6 22. The first of these communications, initiated by RPX, occurred on January 7, 2014, during which Chuang \"mentioned that RPX had become aware that Salesforce had been sued by AIT\"; \"provided a small amount of information\" that RPX knew about the litigation; indicated that, although RPX did not have knowledge of AIT's expectations for its litigation campaign, it had previous dialogue on other matters with the same counsel who was representing AIT in the litigation; and offered to reach out to that counsel. J.A. 1231 \u00b6 23. The following month, after Salesforce \"had just renewed its membership agreement with RPX,\" an in-person meeting was held during which Salesforce \"indicated that it would be interested if RPX could reach out to AIT and find out any information regarding AIT's expectations for its litigation campaign.\" J.A. 1231 \u00b6 24. During a phone call on June 30, 2014, Salesforce \"again indicated that it would be interested in any information RPX could obtain concerning AIT's expectations for its litigation campaign.\" J.A. 1232 \u00b6 25. It does not appear that any contact between RPX and AIT's counsel occurred during that time period. J.A. 1231-32 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly after this third communication, Salesforce filed its CBM petitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salesforce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208041794\">\n    2015 WL 8041794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. According to Chuang, RPX initiated a call to Salesforce approximately two weeks later, during which Salesforce informed RPX that it had filed the CBM petitions, that a stay would therefore be granted in the district court litigation, and that Salesforce no longer was interested in having RPX reach out to AIT to obtain information about AIT's expectations for that litigation. J.A. 1232 \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 11, 2015, approximately five weeks after the Board denied Salesforce's\n   two CBM petitions, RPX again asked Salesforce during a phone call \"if Salesforce would like RPX to reach out to AIT to try to obtain information regarding AIT's expectations for its litigation campaign in view of the fact that Salesforce's petition for CBM review had been denied.\" J.A. 1232 \u00b6 27. According to Chuang, Salesforce indicated that it was not interested in having RPX reach out to AIT at that time, but would inform RPX if circumstances changed in the future. J.A. 1232-33 \u00b6 27. Very shortly thereafter, however, in April or May 2015, \"Salesforce began to bring up the subject of the AIT-Salesforce Litigation,\" but RPX, apparently experiencing a change of heart, \"immediately indicated that it was not inclined to discuss that matter, and the topic of discussion turned elsewhere.\" J.A. 1233 \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The third document contains information regarding the terms of Salesforce's contractual arrangement with RPX. In relevant part, the document reveals that Salesforce has paid RPX substantial sums as membership fees since its membership began, including a very significant payment shortly before the IPR petitions at issue here were filed. J.A. 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After receiving and reviewing the aforementioned discovery, AIT filed preliminary responses in which it argued, among other things, that the IPRs could not be instituted because RPX failed to properly identify Salesforce as a real party in interest and because the petitions were time-barred. It noted the volume and timing of payments Salesforce had made to RPX and provided timelines plotting correspondence between Salesforce and RPX relating to the\n   <em>\n    Salesforce\n   </em>\n   litigation, the CBM proceedings, and the IPR proceedings. AIT did not, however, depose Chuang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C. The Institution Decisions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Board instituted IPRs over AIT's real party in interest challenges, which it construed as being premised on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20312\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.8\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and \u00a7 315(b). It acknowledged that both the '482 and '111 patents had been asserted against Salesforce, RPX's client, in district court, but concluded that AIT \"ha[d] not provided persuasive evidence to support\" its assertion that \"RPX must have filed the [petitions] as a proxy for Salesforce\" or that its \"business model is built upon [RPX] acting as an agent or proxy for third parties in cases just like this.\" In reaching this conclusion, the Board articulated the legal standard as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Whether an entity that is not named as a participant in a given proceeding constitutes [a real party in interest] is a highly fact-dependent question that takes into account how courts generally have used the terms to \"describe relationships and considerations sufficient to justify applying conventional principles of estoppel and preclusion.\" Office Patent Trial Practice Guide,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n    77 Fed.

J.A. 1484. It juxtaposed those statements against other paragraphs in Chuang's declaration, including those in which he testified (1) that the \"primary factor\" driving RPX's decision to file the petitions was the ability to file a strong petition against a low-quality software patent \"before the NPE extracted its price from its first litigation and proceeded to assert the patents more broadly against other targets,\" which would \"provide significant reputational benefits to RPX\"; and (2) that \"RPX did not have any contractual obligation to file [this and the related] IPRs or any 'unwritten,' implicit or covert understanding with Salesforce that it would do so.\" J.A. 1485. The Board also rejected AIT's argument that \"RPX has a history of acting as a proxy,\" distinguishing on their facts two of its earlier decisions on which AIT relied:\n   <em>\n    RPX Corporation v. Virnetx Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. IPR2014-00171 (P.T.A.B. June 5, 2014), Paper No. 49, and\n   <em>\n    RPX Corporation v. ParkerVision\n   </em>\n   , No. IPR2014-00946 (P.T.A.B.

J.A. 1486.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Board next disposed of AIT's argument that RPX has \"adopted a 'willful blindness' strategy,\" under which \"it intentionally operates its business to circumvent the [Board's] RPI case law,\" stating that it was \"not persuaded that the evidence of record supports this assertion\" and that RPX's declaration testimony \"that explains RPX's 'best practices' for identifying RPIs ... contradicts [AIT's] assertion.\" J.A. 1487. The Board was likewise not persuaded by AIT's argument that Salesforce \"advanced\" RPX the cost of the petitions, finding this \"conjecture without evidentiary support.\" J.A. 1487-88. Finally, the Board disagreed with AIT's assertion that timelines showing RPX's communications with Salesforce demonstrate \"a clear pattern of conspiracy.\" The Board pointed to portions of Chuang's declaration in which he testified, without rebuttal, that, although RPX communicated with Salesforce regarding the\n   <em>\n    Salesforce\n   </em>\n   litigation, the CBM proceedings, offers to reach out to AIT, and requests for additional information from Salesforce, RPX did not communicate with Salesforce on the specific topic of the IPRs.

The Final Written Decisions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   AIT filed a combined response to the IPR petitions, reiterating its belief that RPX was acting as a proxy for real party in interest Salesforce. RPX filed separate replies, and the Board held an oral hearing on December 7, 2016, during which AIT again raised its real-party-in-interest argument. At the hearing, AIT, for the first time, raised the possibility that RPX might be time-barred under \u00a7 315(b) as a \"privy\" of Salesforce, arguing that the statute \"merely requires that the real party-in-interest or a privy be time barred without speaking of control.\" J.A. 2024.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In its final written decisions, the Board again rejected AIT's real-party-in-interest challenge and determined that all challenged claims are unpatentable as anticipated\n   or obvious in view of certain prior art references.\n   <em>\n    482 Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207985456\">\n    2016 WL 7985456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 ;\n   <em>\n    111 Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207991300\">\n    2016 WL 7991300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, *15. AIT appeals from the final written decisions, arguing that the Board both \"lacked authority to proceed in rendering the [decisions] because it misconstrued the law of privity and real party in interest\" and erred in certain of its claim constructions and unpatentability determinations. J.A. 483-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The primary issue in this appeal is whether the Board relied on an erroneous understanding of the term \"real party in interest\" in determining that the IPR petitions filed by RPX were not time-barred under \u00a7 315(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This court has had little occasion to grapple with the meaning of the term \"real party in interest\" in the context of \u00a7 315(b). This is due, in no small part, to the fact that time-bar determinations under this provision were not reviewable until we issued our en banc opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wi-Fi One, LLC v. Broadcom Corporation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267278\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/1364/#p1374\">\n    878 F.3d 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\n   <em>\n    Wi-Fi En Banc\n   </em>\n   ), holding \"that time-bar determinations under \u00a7 315(b) are reviewable by this court.\" On remand, the panel held that \"[t]he use of the familiar common law terms 'privy' and 'real party in interest' indicate that Congress intended to adopt common law principles to govern the scope of the [\u00a7] 315(b) one-year bar.\"\n   <em>\n    Wi-Fi One, LLC v.

Cir. 2018) (\n   <em>\n    Wi-Fi Remand\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although we have issued a few decisions recently applying these common-law principles in the context of \u00a7 315(b) challenges, they have been in cases where privity challenges were raised and where the arguments on that question related to the parties' relationship during an earlier litigation that reached a final judgment; the question of who is a \"real party in interest\" in the context of an IPR was not addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the years since the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub.

Specifically, it has published a Trial Practice Guide discussing these terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the PTO's tribunals,\n   including the Board below, have rendered time-bar determinations involving alleged real parties in interest and privies of petitioners that have relied, to varying degrees, on statements contained in the Trial Practice Guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The facts of this case and the arguments made by the parties require us to explore in greater detail the meaning of the term \"real party in interest\" in the context of the AIA. As such, we first construe \u00a7 315(b) by examining the language of the provision, its place in the overall statutory scheme, and the legislative history of the provision. We then explain how the Board in this case rendered a flawed time-bar determination under \u00a7 315(b) by taking an unduly narrow view of the meaning of the governing statutory term and by failing to consider the entirety of the record before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A.

The Common Law in Context\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 315 governs the relationship between IPRs and other proceedings conducted outside the IPR process. Section 315(b), titled \"Patent Owner's Action,\" provides that an IPR \"may not be instituted if the petition requesting the proceeding is filed more than 1 year after the date on which the petitioner, real party in interest, or privy of the petitioner is served with a complaint alleging infringement of the patent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Two insights into Congress's intent vis-\u00e0-vis the reach of \u00a7 315(b) can be gleaned from the statutory text alone. First, the inclusion of the terms \"real party in interest\" and \"privy of the petitioner\" in \u00a7 315(b) makes clear that Congress planned for the provision to apply broadly-sweeping in not only what might be traditionally known as real parties in interest, but privies as well. Second, Congress\n   did not speak of there being only one interested party in each case; instead, it chose language that bars petitions where proxies or privies would benefit from an instituted IPR, even where the petitioning party might separately have its own interest in initiating an IPR. Indeed, Congress understood that there could be\n   <em>\n    multiple\n   </em>\n   real parties in interest, as evidenced by \u00a7 312(a)'s requirement that an IPR petition must \"identif[y]\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   real parties in interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20312\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The terms \"real party in interest\" and \"privy of the petitioner\" are not defined in the AIA.

The Rule provides that \"[a]n action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,\" and specifies seven categories of individuals who \"may sue in their own names without joining the person for whose benefit the action is brought\": (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   executors; (2) administrators; (3) guardians; (4) bailees; (5) trustees of express trusts; (6) parties \"with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for another's benefit\"; and (7) parties authorized by statute.

Under the provisions of the AIA, \"a person who is not the owner of a patent\" may petition for IPR, \"[s]ubject to the provisions of this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20311\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). One of these limiting provisions is \u00a7 315(b). A second is \u00a7 315(a), a related provision that prohibits an IPR from being \"instituted if, before the date on which the petition for such a review is filed, the petitioner or real party in interest filed a civil action challenging the validity of a claim of the patent.\" Other provisions place requirements on the petition itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20311\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 311(b) - (c), 312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Structurally, the AIA permits the filing of an IPR by anyone who is neither the patent owner nor a petitioner, \"real party in interest,\" or \"privy of the petitioner\" whose petition would be time-barred under either \u00a7 315(a) or \u00a7 315(b) from filing an IPR petition. We note that the universe of permissible IPR petitioners seeking to challenge patent claims is significantly larger than the universe of plaintiffs who would have Article III standing to bring a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of a patent in federal court. The PTO recognizes this unique feature of IPRs, stating in its Trial Practice Guide that \"[t]he typical common-law expression of the 'real party-in-interest' (the party 'who, according to the governing substantive law, is entitled to enforce the right') does not fit directly into the AIA trial context\" because \"[t]hat notion reflects standing concepts, but no such requirement exists in the IPR or PGR context.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n    77 Fed.

Although we agree with the PTO's assessment, we do not think that this reality renders the meaning of the term \"real party in interest\" ambiguous in the IPR context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As a starting point, Congress clearly did not intend for the term \"real party in interest\" to be interpreted so broadly as to mean that \"anyone who otherwise would be able to petition for IPR\" will always be deemed the sole real party in interest. Such an interpretation would render the terms \"petitioner\" and \"privy of the petitioner\" in \u00a7 315(b) -and \u00a7 312(a)'s obligation to identify\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   real parties in interest-meaningless. It would also render much of \u00a7 315(e)'s two estoppel provisions meaningless. These provisions prevent not only petitioners, but\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   real parties in interest, from requesting or maintaining alternative administrative attacks or asserting subsequent invalidity challenges in federal court \"on any ground that the petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised during that inter partes review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20315\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1), (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Just how close must the relationship between the real party in interest and the IPR petitioner (or the petition) be? Wright &amp; Miller and other authorities provide examples of legal relationships in which a nonparty is or is not a \"real party in interest.\" Two are particularly relevant in this case. First, \"[a]s a general rule, a person who is an attorney-in-fact or an agent solely for the purpose of bringing suit is viewed as a nominal rather than a real party in interest and will be required to litigate in the name of the principal rather than in the agent's own name.\" Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1553. That said, an agent with an ownership interest in the subject matter of the suit, or one who is the trustee of an express trust or a party in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, may qualify as a real party in interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, an incorporated or unincorporated association \"is not the appropriate party for bringing suit to assert the personal rights of its members\" absent statutory authority to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1552. \"[T]he association may become the real party in interest by acquiring the rights of its members by a bona-fide assignment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thus, when it comes to evaluating the relationship between a party bringing a suit and a non-party, the common law seeks to ascertain who, from a \"practical and equitable\" standpoint, will benefit from the redress that the chosen tribunal might provide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Practice Guide,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n    77 Fed.

As stated in Wright &amp; Miller, \"[t]he 'negative' function of the rule governing who is a real party in interest enables a defendant to present defenses he has against the real party in interest to protect the defendant\n   against a subsequent action by the party actually entitled to relief, and to ensure that the judgment will have proper res judicata effect.\" Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1543 n.3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Key Constructors, Inc. v.

This notion applies with equal force in the IPR context-a patent owner dragged into an IPR by a petitioner, who necessarily has an interest in canceling the patent owner's claims, should not be forced to defend against later judicial or administrative attacks on the same or related grounds by a party that is so closely related to the original petitioner as to qualify as a real party in interest. Section 315(e) is designed to prevent this very possibility by estopping real parties in interest and privies of the petitioner from challenging claims in later judicial or administrative proceedings on any ground that the IPR petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised during the IPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2. Legislative History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Turning to the legislative history, we find nothing that suggests Congress intended for the term \"real party in interest\" to have a meaning that departs from its common-law origins. Instead, it reveals that Congress intended for it to have an expansive formulation. A 2011 House Report on the AIA explains that, \"[i]n utilizing the post-grant review process, petitioners, real parties in interest, and their privies are precluded from\n   <em>\n    improperly mounting multiple challenges\n   </em>\n   to a patent or initiating challenges after filing a civil action challenging the validity a claim in the patent.\" H.R. Rep. No. 112-98, at 48 (2011),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   2011 U.S.C.C.A.N. 67, 78 (emphasis added). In the following paragraph, the report makes clear that Congress \"recognizes the importance of quiet title to patent owners to ensure continued investment resources.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347487\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/179/#p183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, \"[w]hile this amendment is intended to remove current disincentives to current administrative processes, the changes made by it are\n   <em>\n    not to be used as tools for harassment\n   </em>\n   or a means to prevent market entry through\n   <em>\n    repeated litigation and administrative attacks\n   </em>\n   on the validity of a patent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347487\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/179/#p183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Other statements from members of Congress reveal that the terms \"real party in interest\" and \"privy\" were included in \u00a7 315 to serve two related purposes: (1) to ensure that third parties who have sufficiently close relationships with IPR petitioners would be bound by the outcome of instituted IPRs under \u00a7 315(e), the related IPR estoppel provision; and (2) to safeguard patent owners from having to defend their patents against belated administrative attacks by related parties via \u00a7 315(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For example, during the March 2011 Senate debates, Senator Kyl stated that \"[t]he present bill also incorporates S. 3600's extension of the estoppels and other procedural limits in sections 315 and 325 to real parties in interest and privies of the petitioner.\" 157 Cong. Rec. S1376 (Mar. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl). He continued that \"privity is an\n   <em>\n    equitable rule\n   </em>\n   that takes into account the 'practical situation,' and should\n   <em>\n    extend to parties to transactions and other activities relating to the property in question\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347487\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/179/#p183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases added). He then stated that, \"[i]deally, extending could-have-raised estoppel to privies will help ensure that if an inter partes review is instituted while litigation is pending, that review will completely substitute for at least the patents-and-printed-publications portion of the civil litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347487\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/179/#p183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One of his colleagues, Senator Schumer, expressed a similar belief, stating that \"[a] 'privy' is a party that has a direct relationship to the petitioner with respect to the allegedly infringing product or service.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347487\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/179/#p183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at S5432 (Sept. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen.

Conclusion Regarding Statutory Interpretation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We conclude that, with respect to the dispute in this case, \u00a7 315(b) is unambiguous: Congress intended that the term \"real party in interest\" have its expansive common-law meaning. Because \"the statutory language is unambiguous and 'the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,' \" our inquiry ceases and \"we need not contemplate deferring to the agency's interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108314\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/438/#p450\">\n    534 U.S. at 450, 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108314\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/438/#p450\">\n    122 S.Ct. 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first quoting\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , 519 U.S. at 340,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p340\">\n    117 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; then quoting\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. at 842-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   C. The Board Took an Unduly Restrictive View of \"Real Party in Interest\" and Committed Other Errors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Board made several critical errors in this case. First, it made certain factual findings that are not supported by substantial evidence and, at various points, failed to consider the entirety of the record. Second, it failed to adhere to the expansive formulation of \"real party in interest\" that is dictated by the language, structure, purpose, and legislative history of \u00a7 315(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Determining whether a non-party is a \"real party in interest\" demands a flexible approach that takes into account both equitable and practical considerations, with an eye toward determining whether the non-party is a clear beneficiary that has a preexisting, established relationship with the petitioner. Indeed, the Trial Practice Guide, on which the Board relied, suggests that the agency understands the \"fact-dependent\" nature of this inquiry, explaining that the two questions lying at its heart are whether a non-party \"desires review of the patent\" and whether a petition has been filed at a nonparty's \"behest.\" Trial Practice Guide,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C756\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. at 48,759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although the Board quoted the portion of the Trial Practice Guide expressing these two questions and the Guide's statement that \"multiple factors [are] relevant to the question of whether a non-party may be recognized as\" a real party in interest in its institution decision, J.A. 1437, it did not apply these principles in its \u00a7 315(b) analysis. For example, the Board did not meaningfully examine two factors the Trial Practice Guide deems \"[r]elevant\": Salesforce's relationship with RPX and \"the nature of\" RPX as an entity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C760\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. 48,760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trial Practice Guide lists these factors after posing a hypothetical in which a trade association to which \"Party A\" belongs, \"Trade Association X,\" files an IPR. Although the Guide explains that, \"if Trade Association X files an IPR petition, Party A does not become a 'real party-in-interest' or a 'privy' of the Association simply based on its membership in the Association,\" it also provides that this reality does not mean \"that Party A's membership in Trade Association X ... in th[is] scenario[ ] is irrelevant to the determination....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C760\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, \"deeper consideration of the facts in the particular case is necessary to determine whether Party A is a 'real party-in-interest' or a 'privy' of the petitioner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2048%2C760\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We conclude that the Board's consideration of the evidence was impermissibly shallow, both under the Trial Practice Guide and the common law it incorporates. The evidence of record reveals that RPX, unlike a traditional trade association, is a for-profit company whose clients pay for its portfolio of \"patent risk solutions.\" J.A. 73. These solutions help paying members \"extricate themselves from NPE lawsuits.\" J.A. 29. The company's SEC filings reveal that one of its \"strategies\" for transforming the patent market is \"the facilitation of challenges to patent validity,\" one intent of which is to \"reduce expenses for [RPX's] clients.\" J.A. 31. Yet the Board did not\n   consider these facts, which, taken together, imply that RPX can and does file IPRs to serve its clients' financial interests, and that a key reason clients pay RPX is to benefit from this practice in the event they are sued by an NPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This implication becomes stronger when one considers the discovery produced in this case. First, even though it is undisputed that RPX nominally adhered to its \"best practices,\" which prohibit it from discussing IPRs with clients who do not agree to be named as real parties in interest, J.A. 80, these practices do not bear on whether RPX files IPR petitions to benefit\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   clients that previously have been accused of patent infringement. Moreover, several of the factors that RPX considers when identifying potential IPR candidates are highly probative of whether particular individual clients would benefit from having RPX file IPR petitions challenging patents they have been accused of infringing. These include (1) the number of patents \"asserted in the campaign\"; (2) the likelihood of a new validity challenge by another entity; (3) the number of \"RPX clients, including those covered under RPX insurance policies, in suit\"; (4) the \"estimated cost of litigation defense\"; and (5) \"potential reputational benefits\" to RPX. J.A. 80-81. Each of these factors is suggestive of whether any given RPX client would benefit from having RPX file an IPR petition challenging patents that have been asserted against that client in district court. Yet, again, the Board did not examine these factors, in contravention of its obligations under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    Falkner v.

None of the Board's institution decisions nor its final written decisions grapple with the facts\n   outlined above, all of which bear directly on the issue of whether, and under what circumstances, RPX takes a particular client's interests into account when determining whether to file IPR petitions. The Board's selective weighing of the record evidence does not pass muster under the APA. \"Just as it may not short-cut its legal analysis, the Board may not short-cut its consideration of the factual record before it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11197556\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/1352/#p1357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The facts and arguments that the Board\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   consider do not persuade us that its decision not to consider the aforementioned evidence was harmless. First, although there is little evidence regarding RPX's weighing of its \"best practices\" factors in this case, its Vice President of Client Relations, Chuang, did testify that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 RPX considered AIT a non-practicing entity, J.A. 1235-36 \u00b6\u00b6 35-37;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 \"RPX filing [these IPRs] would likely result in positive reputational benefits with the large number of companies (clients and prospects alike) in the software industry,\" J.A. 1237-38 \u00b6 41;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 After Salesforce's CBM petitions were denied, \"it was highly unlikely that any party other than RPX would challenge the AIT Patents before the Patent Office unless and until the AIT-Salesforce Litigation was resolved,\" J.A. 1238-39 \u00b6 43; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 Salesforce was time-barred from challenging the '482 and '111 patents before the PTO, J.A. 1239 \u00b6 43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   RPX did not point to any other clients whom it believed might be at risk of infringement claims arising out of the patents on which the IPR was instituted. Indeed, it conceded that no one else would likely have an incentive to challenge these\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   patents. It simply cited testimony that its reputation might be boosted by the filing of an IPR which could serve to protect\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   client. Given that one of RPX's publicly stated business solutions is to file IPRs where its clients have been sued by non-practicing entities to \"reduce expenses for [its] clients,\" J.A. 31, and that any IPR petitions Salesforce might have wanted to file would have been time-barred, this evidence at least suggests that RPX may have filed the three IPR petitions, in part, to benefit Salesforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Board emphasized Chuang's testimony that \"[t]he primary factor driving RPX's decision to file [the] IPRs\" was \"the ability to file a very strong petition against a low quality patent in the software sector before the NPE extracted its price from its first litigation and proceeded to assert the patents more broadly against other targets,\" which would \"prevent multiple future lawsuits against clients, prospects, and the industry at large and, as a result, provide significant reputational benefits to RPX.\" J.A. 1398. The Board seemed to believe that, so long as RPX articulated an independent interest in pursuing the IPRs, that was enough to make it-and not Salesforce-the real party in interest. But, as discussed above, \u00a7 315(b) does not presume the existence of only one real party in interest-it is not an either-or proposition. The point is not to probe RPX's interest (it does not need any); rather, it is to probe the extent to which Salesforce-as RPX's client-has an interest in and will benefit from RPX's actions, and inquire whether RPX can be said to be representing that interest after examining its relationship with Salesforce. The Board's focus on RPX's motivations to the exclusion of Salesforce's reveals its misunderstanding of controlling legal principles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   A different Board panel recently focused on similar connections between a time-barred party (Springpath) and the nominal petitioner (Cisco) when determining that a petition was barred for failing to identify all real parties in interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cisco Sys., Inc. v.

Reg. at 48,759.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Next, the Board relied on Chuang's averment that \"RPX did not have any contractual obligation to file [the] IPRs or any 'unwritten,' implicit or covert understanding with Salesforce that it would do so.\" J.A. 1398 (citation omitted). As explained more fully below, however, a nonparty to an IPR can be a real party in interest even without entering into an express or implied agreement with the petitioner to file an IPR petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Board also cited Chuang's testimony that RPX followed its Best Practices Guide in this case and accordingly \"had no communication with Salesforce whatsoever regarding the filing of IPR petitions against the AIT Patents before the AIT IPRs were filed.\" J.A. 1229 \u00b6 20. RPX also submitted evidence that it \"did not know before filing the AIT IPRs what (if any) impact an IPR filing would have on RPX's relationship with Salesforce,\" and that it even considered whether Salesforce might\n   react negatively to RPX's filing of the IPR petitions. J.A. 1240 \u00b6 46. Chuang testified that \"defendants often express concern about validity challenges potentially emboldening a plaintiff if unsuccessful or creating conflicts with their litigation strategy,\" and that RPX did not know what, if any, prior art challenges Salesforce may be planning in the litigation. J.A. 1240 \u00b6 46. He further testified that RPX did not have any contractual obligation to file the IPRs or any unwritten, implicit or covert understanding with Salesforce that it would do so. J.A. 1239 \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Chuang did not, however, testify that RPX\n   <em>\n    actually believed\n   </em>\n   Salesforce would have reacted negatively to RPX's filing of IPR petitions challenging claims of the '482 and '111 patents. Rather, the evidence submitted indicates the company's understanding that the very challenges to validity included in the IPR petitions were challenges Salesforce would like to have made if not time-barred from doing so. Indeed, Chuang's own averments about the timing and content of the communications between RPX and Salesforce in relation to the\n   <em>\n    Salesforce\n   </em>\n   litigation and the denied CBM petitions indicate the contrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence might actually indicate that RPX worked to ascertain, with a strong degree of confidence, its client's desires, while taking last-minute efforts to avoid obtaining an express statement of such desires.

But the Board, without providing any reasoned explanation, wrote that it was \"not persuaded that the evidence of record supports th[e] assertion[s]\" that RPX has \"adopted a 'willful blindness' strategy\" and \"intentionally operates its business to circumvent the PTAB's RPI case law.\" J.A. 1400. It further explained that \"RPX has provided declaration testimony that explains RPX's 'best practices' for identifying RPIs that\n   <em>\n    contradicts\n   </em>\n   Patent Owner's assertion.\" J.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   1400 (emphasis added) (citing paragraphs 14-19 of Chuang's declaration). Substantial evidence does not support this determination-nothing in these paragraphs, or anything else in Chuang's declaration or RPX's reply to AIT's preliminary response on real-party-in-interest \"contradicts\" AIT's theory that RPX filed IPR petitions challenging the two patents asserted in the\n   <em>\n    Salesforce\n   </em>\n   action to benefit Salesforce, where Salesforce itself was time-barred from filing petitions. The insufficiency of the Board's reasoning is especially important because RPX bore the burden of persuasion on this issue, as the Board itself recognized. J.A. 1396-97 (recognizing that, \"[w]hen a patent owner provides sufficient evidence prior to institution that reasonably brings into question the accuracy of a petitioner's identification of RPIs, the overall burden remains with the petitioner to establish that it has complied with the statutory requirement to identify all [real parties in interest].\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Zerto\n   </em>\n   , No. IPR2014-01295, slip op. at 6-7) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In sum, we believe that the Board's determination that Salesforce was not a real party in interest under \u00a7 315(b) relied on an impermissibly narrow understanding of the common-law meaning of the term, was not based on consideration of the entirety of the administrative record, and seemingly misallocated the burden of proof. Any one of these errors might warrant vacatur-together, they compel it.

The Board did not consider critical evidence proffered by AIT. Nor did it adequately explain why it rejected certain of AIT's common law theories, particularly where RPX bore the burden of proving its petitions were not time-barred under \u00a7 315(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, we note that several other legal theories de-scribed in Wright &amp; Miller that were not considered by the Board may apply to the facts of this case. The PTO's rules and Trial Practice Guide expressly reference Wright &amp; Miller as an authority its tribunals should consider when rendering real party-in-interest determinations, and we hold that it was error for the\n   Board not to have considered these theories, particularly because AIT raised arguments that directly implicate them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For instance, \u00a7 1553 of Wright &amp; Miller explains that, \"[a]s a general rule, a person who is an attorney-in-fact or an agent solely for the purpose of bringing suit is viewed as a nominal rather than a real party in interest and will be required to litigate in the name of the principal rather than in the agent's own name.\" Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1553. This section clarifies that an agent with an ownership interest in the subject matter of the suit, or one who is the trustee of an express trust or a party in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, may qualify as a real party in interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113803\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1357/#p1363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   AIT effectively raised this argument below, labeling RPX as \"an extension of the client's in-house legal team\" that helps \"selectively clear\" liability for infringement as part of its \"patent risk management solutions.\" J.A. 17. Depending on the nature of the parties' relationship, an entity can serve as an agent to a principal and file an IPR on the principal's behalf even without the two formally agreeing that the agent will do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Agency, \u00a7 1.01 cmt. c (Am. Law Inst. 2006) (\"Thus, a person may be an agent although the principal lacks the right to control the full range of the agent's activities, how the agent uses time, or the agent's exercise of professional judgment.\"). There is no indication that the Board considered AIT's contention that Salesforce is a real party in interest because RPX acted as its attorney-in-fact or its express or implied litigating agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Similarly, a related section of a different treatise discusses \"preclusion by consent and estoppel by conduct,\" beginning with the remark that \"[t]he repose and reliance interests generated by a judgment may deserve protection against nonparties for\n   <em>\n    reasons of acquiescence\n   </em>\n   that depart from any of the common 'privity' theories of participation, representation, or property.\" 18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 4453 (2d ed. 2018) (\"Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper\") (emphasis added). The treatise continues by noting that, \"[a]lthough acquiescence furnishes the most apt single label for these reasons, several distinctive principles can be identified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113803\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1357/#p1363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It then provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   One, relying on actual consent to be bound, may fairly be treated as an aspect of preclusion by judgment. The others are better viewed as\n   <em>\n    species of apparent authority or estoppel by conduct\n   </em>\n   ; the distinctive feature of these theories is that the apparent authority or estoppel arises from conduct that relates to litigation between other persons. Such conduct may include conduct of a nonparty that\n   <em>\n    apparently authorizes\n   </em>\n   a party to represent his interests; acquiescence in a situation that has been created by a prior judgment; and failure to dispel a party's reasonable belief that the nonparty will honor the judgment in pending litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113803\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1357/#p1363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases added). In this case, AIT argued that RPX had apparent authority to file the IPR petitions to benefit Salesforce, pointing to RPX's public statement that its \"interests are 100% aligned with those of [its] clients\" and to the timing of Salesforce's substantial payments to RPX. J.A. 20. The Board erred in its \u00a7 315(b) analysis by not considering this theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Importantly, we do not question the Board's authority to make findings of fact, or our obligation to defer to those findings when not supported by substantial evidence. Where, however, the Board made its findings without considering the entirety of the evidentiary record, appears to have imposed-even if inadvertently-the burden of proving that RPX was not the only real party in interest on AIT, and assessed the evidence it did consider through an incorrect legal lens, we cannot find that substantial evidence supports the Board's ultimate conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Board's\n   <em>\n    428\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    111 Decision\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   , and remand for further proceedings. The Board's decisions in this case neither considered the full range of relationships under \u00a7 315(b) and the common law that could make Salesforce a real party in interest with respect to this IPR nor properly applied the principles articulated in the Trial Practice Guide upon which it purported to rely. The Board also failed to comply with its obligations under the APA to consider the evidence that justifies and detracts from its conclusions and to explain sufficiently its rationale for rejecting AIT's arguments and theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We do not reach the merits of any of the patentability arguments raised in AIT's opening brief. In its discretion, the Board may authorize additional discovery relevant to whether Salesforce is\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   a real party in interest\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a privy of RPX for purposes of \u00a7 315(b). Additional discovery may be particularly warranted in the face of the non-frivolous challenge made to date by AIT to RPX's some-what bald assertions regarding who the real parties in interest are in these IPRs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   COSTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Costs to Applications in Internet Time, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    As stated above, the time-bar arguments that AIT made to the Board centered on a theory that Salesforce was a real party in interest, rather than a privy of RPX. The first time it hinted that it believed Salesforce was a privy of RPX was during the oral hearing, where counsel argued that \u00a7 315(b)\"merely requires that the real party-in-interest or privy be time barred without speaking of control.\" J.A. 2024. It then argued in its Notices of Appeal that \"the Board lacked authority to proceed in rendering the Final Written Decision because it misconstrued the law of privity and real party in interest.\" J.A. 298, 303, 308, 484, 489. Because AIT focused its arguments on whether Salesforce was an unnamed real party in interest and because we vacate the Board's determination on that score, we need not address in this opinion whether RPX and Salesforce were in privity, and leave this argument for the Board to consider on remand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    We discuss the Trial Practice Guide in more detail later. We note, however, that the Trial Practice Guide is exactly that and no more.

These forms of relationship are based on whether the relationship is anchored or based on legal obligations or commitments. For example, non-party preclusion could apply between an indemnitor and an indemnitee, or between an insurer and an insured on the basis that such relationships form privity.\n   <em>\n    Intel Corp. v.

The foregoing examples have little to do with \"control\" over a prior or current litigation, yet privity exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The record before the court shows that although RPX and Salesforce are separate business entities, there exists a legal relationship between them that is defined by mutual legal obligations and commonality of interest. The record suggests that the form of substantive legal relationship between RPX and Salesforce precisely is that which defines privity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   First, RPX advertises itself as \"the leading provider of patent risk solutions, offering defensive buying, acquisition syndication, patent intelligence, insurance services, and advisory services.\" J.A. 73-74. RPX's business model involves buying patents from companies and licensing them back. Hence, one form of the legal relationship between RPX and Salesforce is that of patentee and licensee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Second, RPX provides insurance against non-practicing entities (\"NPE\") patent infringement suits to clients who purchase insurance policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This suggests another form of the legal relationship between RPX and Salesforce as that of insurer and insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Third, RPX has advertised that its \"interests are 100% aligned with those of [its] clients,\" it could \"serve as an extension of a client's in-house legal team,\" and it could \"facilitat[e] challenges to patent validity.\" J.A. 28, 31, 71. Thus, another form of the legal relationship between RPX and Salesforce is an attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   To be clear, the existence of any one of these forms of legal relationships alone does not necessarily establish privity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   However, if the extent of the legal obligations between the parties (i.e., RPX and Salesforce) is such that the parties share a high degree of commonality of proprietary or financial interest, privity is established and \u00a7 315(b) bars the institution of the IPR petitions. Indeed, given the circumstances, any single one of the forms could suffice to establish privity under \u00a7 315(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, when viewed in aggregate, the record evidence suggests sufficient basis of privity, such that the PTO erred in ignoring the issue of privity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The record also suggests that RPX may have acted as a proxy/representative for Salesforce, which independently establishes privity under the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p893\">\n    553 U.S. at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p893\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] party bound by a judgment may not avoid its preclusive force by relitigating through a proxy.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   RPX's Vice President Mr. Chuang states that \"the services RPX provides Salesforce do not include filing IPRs.\" J.A. 96, 101. The record, however, suggests that RPX may have acted in a proxy/representative capacity. The invalidation of AIT's patents-in-suit would directly benefit Salesforce because Salesforce was sued by AIT for infringing the same patents. RPX, as advertised, provides complementary patent risk solutions to its clients, \"including the\n   <em>\n    facilitation of challenges to patent validity\n   </em>\n   , coordinating prior art searches, and other services intended to improve patent quality and reduce expenses for our clients.\" J.A. 31 (emphasis added). RPX's past practice included filing IPRs on behalf of its clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Denial of Institution at *9-10,\n   <em>\n    RPX Corp. v.

IPR is one form of \"challenge[ ] to patent validity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   RPX stated to the Board that \"[e]ven if it were true that RPX's services to Salesforce involved the filing of IPRs, that alone would not make Salesforce an RPI [i.e., real party in interest].\" J.A. 103. This is incorrect. Relitigation through a proxy is itself an independent ground to establish privity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p893\">\n    553 U.S. at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p893\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If RPX was indeed contractually obligated to file the IPRs on behalf of Salesforce, then privity exists and the petitions should be time barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v.

Cir. 2016) (finding that \"party standing outside of privity by contractual obligation stands in the shoes of a party within privity\"). This and other arguments by RPX concerning real party in interest were effective in drawing the attention of the PTO away from privity and to focus on real party in interest. It caused the PTO to lose sight of the \"more expansive\" notion of privity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   77 Fed. Reg. at 48,759.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   When viewed through the lens of the more expensive notion of privity, the record clearly suggests that RPX may have acted as a proxy on behalf of Salesforce. The record contains evidence suggesting that the interests of RPX and Salesforce are aligned. Salesforce is a significant client for RPX.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   They are not competitors: Salesforce is a software company and RPX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   holds itself out to the public as a patent risk management company. Both Salesforce's prior CBM petitions and RPX's IPR petitions sought to invalidate the same patents owned by AIT. RPX claims to have independent reasons for pursuing the IPR petitions, but there is no evidence to show that RPX's interests conflict with Salesforce's interests. To the contrary, RPX advertises that its \"interests are 100% aligned with those of [its] clients,\" and that it \"serve[s] as an extension of a client's in-house legal team.\" J.A. 28, 31, 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Thus, the record reveals that Salesforce was more than a bystander to RPX's filing of these IPR petitions. Salesforce was a preexisting client of RPX, representing a significant and growing revenue stream. Invalidation of the patents-in-suit would directly benefit Salesforce. RPX advertised providing insurance services against patent infringement claims brought by NPEs. These are indicators of privity. And given RPX's documented history of acting as a proxy on behalf of its clients in filing IPR petitions, coupled with RPX's offering of patent validity challenges to its fee-paying members, AIT proffered sufficient concrete evidence to suggest that RPX was in privity with Salesforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   I would remand with instruction that the Board thoroughly review whether privity exists between RPX and Salesforce, including application of all of the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factors. In addition, while the Board partially granted AIT's motion for additional discovery into \"whether Petitioner [RPX] should have identified Salesforce as an RPI in this proceeding,\" it denied AIT's request for discovery into \"[d]ocuments discussing any efforts by RPX to shield its clients from being named as real parties in interest in\n   <em>\n    inter parte\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] reviews and covered business method patent reviews.\" J.A. 972, 1069. The \u00a7 315(b) time bar inquiry is broader than the real party in interest inquiry, and the Board should consider new motions for additional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   IV.

Sections 315(b) and 312(a)(2) entail distinct, independent inquiries. Section 312(a)(2) requires that a petition may be considered only if \"the petition identifies all real parties in interest.\" Section 312(a)(2) is akin to a pleading requirement that can be corrected, and this court has noted that \"the Director [of the PTO] can, and does, allow the petitioner to add a real party in interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Wi-Fi One\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267278\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/1364/#p1374\">\n    878 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1374 n.9.
