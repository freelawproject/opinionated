They sued their insurance company for breach of contract when it refused to cover the damage. They also sued their cleaning-and-restoration company for failing to adequately remedy the damage and prevent mold. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurance company based on the plain language of the Dahlgrens' insurance policy and transferred the claims against the cleaning-and-restoration company to the district court in Delaware for lack of personal jurisdiction. We affirm both the grant of summary judgment and the transfer of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2000, the Dahlgrens, who reside in the District of Columbia, purchased a beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where they spend most of their weekends. At all times relevant to this litigation, the house was a second residence and remained fully furnished with the accessories of daily life, such as furniture, clothes, food, toiletries, and medicine. When not at their beach home, the Dahlgrens routinely left the heat on to prevent the pipes from freezing and asked a friend to check on the house and retrieve the mail. They did not, however, shut off the water supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In February 2013, Ms. Dahlgren returned to the beach home to find two inches of standing water throughout the main level and additional water \"gushing\" from the ceiling overhead. The Dahlgrens had been away for ten days, and, in their absence, a pressurized hot water pipe in the upstairs bathroom had separated at the joint and flooded the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Dahlgrens notified their insurance company, Windsor-Mount Joy Mutual Insurance Co. (\"Windsor-Mount\"), about the flooding. They also contracted with R.W. Home Services, Inc., doing business as Gale Force Cleaning and Restoration (\"Gale Force\"), to remedy the damage and prevent mold. According to the Dahlgrens, Gale Force was negligent in its clean-up effort and mold spread through the house, so the Dahlgrens eventually decided to tear it down and build a new one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Dahlgrens timely filed an insurance claim with Windsor-Mount to cover the damage from the accident. The insurance company denied the claim because, while they were away, the Dahlgrens had failed to shut off the water where it entered the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Dahlgrens sued Windsor-Mount for breach of contract. They filed suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, but Windsor-Mount invoked federal diversity jurisdiction and removed the case to the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1441(a). When Windsor-Mount impleaded Gale Force as a third-party defendant, the Dahlgrens amended their complaint to add claims against Gale Force as well for breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, 6 Del. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2511 -27. The Dahlgrens and Windsor-Mount then filed cross-motions\n   for summary judgment, and Gale Force moved to be dismissed from the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court determined that the Dahlgrens could not recover under the clear terms of their insurance policy and granted summary judgment against them on that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katopothis v.

It provides coverage for damage to both real and personal property resulting from accidental discharge or leakage from the plumbing, subject to specific exclusions. The cover page of the policy also lists a number of endorsements included with the standard contract to amend the terms of coverage. ML-508D is one of those endorsements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    ML-508D was approved by the Delaware Insurance Commissioner and printed on a blue sheet of paper to stand out from the rest of the policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    It reads in full:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    ADDITIONAL EXCLUSIONS FOR UNOCCUPIED RESIDENCES\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    In addition to exclusions found elsewhere in your policy, if the insured residence is vacant, unoccupied (meaning an absence in excess of 72 hours), or under construction and unoccupied, the insured must:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    a.

If their house remained unoccupied \"in excess of 72 hours,\" the Dahlgrens were required to \"[m]aintain heat in the residence and shut off the water supply where it enters the residence,\" or else the plain language of ML-508D excludes coverage for \"loss caused by ... discharge, leakage, or overflow from any plumbing ... system.\" There is no dispute the Dahlgrens were away from their beach home for ten days and failed to shut off the water supply where it entered the house. There is no question that the damage for which they now seek coverage was caused by flooding from the plumbing. It is a plain and simple matter that they cannot recover from Windsor-Mount for their loss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Nevertheless, the Dahlgrens offer several arguments for why we should disregard the straightforward application of ML-508D and grant them relief. None are persuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Dahlgrens first argue that the policy extends coverage to real and personal property for damage that results from plumbing accidents. They contend that this coverage cannot be limited by a subsequent endorsement because doing so would create conflicting contract terms or render the policy ambiguous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    We disagree. By definition, endorsements amend the terms of an insurance policy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Endorsement,\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    (10th ed. 2014) (\"An amendment to an insurance policy; a rider.\"). That's their very purpose. A policy is not ambiguous or contradictory just because an endorsement amends its provisions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Intel Corp. v. Am.

The Dahlgrens' argument neglects this basic proposition of how an insurance policy works.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Dahlgrens also assert that the provisions in their policy extending coverage to real and personal property refer only to two sets of exclusions, neither of which include ML-508D. They reason that this means ML-508D does not apply to real or personal property coverage. At the very least, the Dahlgrens contend, it isn't clear that ML-508D applies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    This argument ignores that ML-508D is titled \"\n    <em>\n     Additional\n    </em>\n    Exclusions for Unoccupied Residences\" (emphasis added) and is listed on the cover page of the policy with other endorsements that amend the terms of the contract. It does not matter that other exclusions also apply to the Dahlgrens' house because ML-508D operates in addition to whatever other exclusions exist. By its terms, ML-508D expressly forecloses recovery for\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    loss associated with plumbing accidents, including damage to real and personal property, unless certain requirements are met.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Next, the Dahlgrens claim their beach home was \"neither vacant nor unoccupied in any conventional sense\" because it remained furnished with the accessories of daily life. Dahlgrens Br. 14. In the alternative, they assert the terms \"vacant\" and \"unoccupied\" in ML-508D are ambiguous. Either way, they explain, ML-508D should not apply to their situation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The policy, however, leaves no doubt what \"unoccupied\" means. ML-508D explicitly defines \"unoccupied\" as \"an absence in excess of 72 hours.\" We agree with the district court that this \"can only be reasonably read to refer to the absence of people.\"\n    <em>\n     Katopothis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272084\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/211/1/#p14\">\n     211 F.Supp.3d at 15\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis omitted);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Windsor-Mount Joy Mut.

ML-508D is just such a \"hidden trap\" or \"fine print,\" they argue, and such deception cannot be allowed to frustrate their reasonable expectation of coverage for accidental flooding. \"It is manifestly unfair to the insureds,\" they assert, \"to permit an insurance company to bury a conflicting Endorsement at the end of the policy, which purports [to] render express grants of coverage in the policy illusory.\" Dahlgrens Br. 13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    We see nothing hidden or deceptive about ML-508D.
