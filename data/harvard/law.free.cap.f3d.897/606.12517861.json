Relying on the victim's unsupported estimate of its replacement costs, the district court ordered Steele to pay $52,990 in restitution. Because fair market value is the appropriate measure of value for restitution and the Government failed to sufficiently demonstrate the victim's loss, we vacate the restitution order and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2015, the U.S. Postal Service hired Steele as a mail handler assistant at its Processing and Distribution Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a part of his duties, Steele processed bulk mail en route to its ultimate destination. Around June 2015, Steele began stealing video game discs sent by GameFly, a video game rental service that ships its merchandise to customers through the mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2015, a GameFly Loss Prevention Manager contacted the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General to report a significant loss of GameFly video games intended for the Charlotte Processing and Distribution Center. On December 20, 2015, federal agents interviewed Steele after they observed him leaving the Processing and Distribution Center and placing numerous GameFly discs in his personal vehicle. During the interview Steele admitted to the thefts, and the next day he submitted his resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2016, a federal grand jury returned an indictment for Steele, charging him with one count of postal theft in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201709\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Steele pleaded guilty without a written plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The U.S. Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) based in part on a Victim Impact Statement from GameFly. In the statement, GameFly reported that it lost 1,390 video game discs during the relevant timeframe and that 100 were recovered from Steele's home and vehicle. GameFly estimated that the lost video game discs cost $40 each and thus calculated the value of the 1,290 unaccounted-for games at $51,600. GameFly further noted that for each of the 1,390 games that went missing, it incurred an additional $1 cost to mail its customers replacement games. The PSR therefore recommended that Steele pay $52,990 in restitution-$51,600 for the lost games themselves plus $1,390 in mailing costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to sentencing, Steele objected to the PSR's loss calculation and restitution amount, but the district court overruled his objections. J.A. 183, 202. At sentencing, Steele argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the $40-per-game estimate. The Government responded that GameFly's estimate was based on the average cost of replacing a game. The Government then called as a witness Chad Caviness, an agent with the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General. Caviness testified that (1) agents recovered 341 discs from Steele's vehicle and residence, J.A. 46; (2) Steele sold newer\n   games for $30 and older games for $20-25, J.A. 42; (3) he had no documentation from GameFly that detailed the value of each game it lost, J.A. 52; and (4) when GameFly reported an estimated average replacement cost for the games, the agents \"just took [GameFly's] word for it.\" J.A. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Caviness's testimony, Steele renewed his objection to the recommended restitution amount. Steel argued that GameFly's loss calculation should instead be based on the fair market value of the game discs because the vast majority of the games he stole were used and valued at substantially less than $40. Steele presented his own research-trade-in receipts and reports from a video game price charting website-to support his argument. However, the district court disagreed and instead reasoned that the fair market value of the games was \"not relevant\" to GameFly's actual victimization. J.A. 76. The district court then accepted GameFly's unsupported estimate of its replacement costs, ordered restitution in the amount of $52,990, and imposed a three-month term of imprisonment. J.A. 76, 89, 173. Steele timely appealed, challenging the restitution order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review the district court's restitution order for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, Congress declined to instruct district courts\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   to value property.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Had Congress intended district courts to use a particular valuation method in all circumstances, presumably it would have articulated one.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keene Corp. v.

Instead of prescribing a single valuation method, the MVRA leaves that determination to district courts. The MVRA requires courts to issue restitution pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203664\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which instructs the court to \"order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses\n   <em>\n    as determined by the court\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203664\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(A) (emphasis added); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(d).

According to the Guidelines, the loss estimate should be based on \"[t]he fair market value of the property unlawfully taken, copied, or destroyed; or, if the fair market value is impracticable to determine or inadequately measures the harm, the cost to the victim of replacing that property.\" U.S.S.G. 2B1.1, Application Note 3C(i). The loss estimate and the restitution amount are not always the same. But because the MVRA requires restitution for a victim's actual loss, the district court's loss estimate largely becomes the ultimate restitution amount. Accordingly, the Guidelines' commentary is relevant in MVRA cases.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The video games that GameFly lost are fungible-they are interchangeable with other games of the same title. Nothing in the record indicates that the stolen games had any unique or personal value to GameFly that\n   fair market value could not adequately capture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And Steele's apparent success with selling and trading the games demonstrates that there was an active market for the used games.

But Caviness actually undercut the Government's restitution argument in two ways. First, Caviness admitted that he did not verify GameFly's loss estimate, he \"just took [GameFly's] word for it.\" J.A. 49.
