Plaintiff Brien Hill is a single-leg amputee who taught in defendant Associates for Renewal in Education's (\"ARE's\") afterschool program. The District Court granted partial summary judgment for ARE on two of Hill's claims, which he now appeals. Three other claims went to trial, where Hill was awarded damages for ARE's failure to accommodate his disability by refusing his request to teach on a lower floor. The primary issues on appeal are whether ARE also failed to reasonably accommodate Hill's disability by refusing his request for a classroom aide, and whether ARE's failures to accommodate Hill's disability created a hostile work environment. Hill proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in the District Court and was represented by appointed counsel for this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm the District Court's conclusion that Hill has not proffered sufficient undisputed facts for his hostile-work-environment claim to survive summary judgment. We reverse as to Hill's remaining failure-to-accommodate claim, however, because Hill's allegations present a triable issue of fact as to whether ARE violated the ADA when it refused his request for a classroom aide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts are taken from the parties' submissions on ARE's motion for summary judgment and are undisputed unless otherwise indicated. ARE is a non-profit that provides care and educational programs to underserved children and adults in Washington, D.C. It is located in a three-story building with no elevator, requiring teachers to climb up and down the stairs \"for fire and emergency evacuation drills, supervised outdoor play and scheduled student lavatory breaks located on the basement floor.\" Supplemental Brief for Plaintiff (\"Pl. Supp.\") 3,\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Assoc. for Renewal in Educ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-823, ECF No. 41. Hill, who wears a leg prosthesis, was employed by ARE in various capacities until his employment was terminated in December 2008. As an ARE teacher and program aide, Hill's duties included \"instructing participants in the classroom, on field trips or outside activities; prepar[ing] and administer[ing] overall classroom management; counsel[ing] participants on academic and behavioral challenges, as well as, provid[ing] administrative and/or clerical support to the administrative personnel.\" Affidavit of La'Troy Bailey (\"Bailey Aff.\") \u00b6 5, ECF No. 32-1. Prior to 2007, Hill requested and was granted several accommodations for his disability, including a request for assignment to a lower-level classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2007, Hill fell while walking across the ARE playground, \"severely injur[ing his] amputated stump and damag[ing his] prosthesis.\" Declaration of Brien Hill \u00b6 5, ECF No. 33. Upon returning to work, he requested a classroom aide for himself and his pregnant co-teacher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hill also requested that he be able to continue holding class on the second floor of the building. These requests were granted until August 27, 2007, when Hill was reassigned to a classroom by himself on the third floor and without a classroom aide. Hill alleged that he \"expressed [his] concerns\" about this reassignment verbally on August 31, 2007; that he made a written request to be \"repositioned back to the lower level\" and have \"the accommodation of having an Aide assigned to [his] classroom;\" and that he followed up with \"daily verbal request[s]\" for these two accommodations throughout the school year. Declaration of Brien Hill (\"Hill Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, ECF No. 10. These accommodations were not provided. Hill was the only teacher in his program who was not assigned a classroom aide, and Hill taught more students than any of his colleagues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Around the same period of time, Hill began to have disciplinary issues at work. On September 1, 2007, Hill's duties were changed to a part-time position due to a reduction in force and due to his \"excessive tardiness and inconsistent call-ins.\" Bailey Aff. \u00b6 4. His supervisor eventually recommended Hill's termination, and on that same day, Hill submitted a letter to ARE's Deputy Director of Education requesting review of the denial of his requests for a classroom aide and for assignment to a lower floor, among other issues. Hill was terminated effective December 15, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hill filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint against ARE asserting, among other things, a hostile work environment and several ADA claims, including failure to accommodate for denying his requests for a classroom aide and for denying his request to teach on a lower floor. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-78, ECF No. 1. ARE moved for summary judgment on most of the ADA claims, arguing that Hill did not actually make the accommodation requests. ARE did not argue that the accommodations of a lower floor or a classroom aide were unreasonable or unnecessary for Hill to perform the essential functions of his job, nor did ARE argue that Hill was unqualified for his position by being physically unable to perform the essential functions of his job with or without accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After receiving the parties' filings, the District Court issued an order\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   stating that \"[t]he record contains no evidence (or argument) on the third element of plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"whether or not plaintiff could perform [his job's essential] functions with or without reasonable accommodation.\" Order, ECF No. 40, at 1. The order directed the parties \"to supplement the record\" and \"advised [Hill] that he should (1) clearly describe the essential functions of the part-time job he held in September 2007 when he allegedly began requesting the accommodations at issue and (2) explain why he needed 'the accommodation of an Aide' and a relocation to a lower level room to perform the essential functions of the job.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Hill responded with a fifteen-page supplemental submission explaining that \"his physical disability substantially limited his ability to walk for long distances, stand for long periods of time (as required given that he supervised his classroom alone), ... [and] supervise[ ] outdoor play and scheduled student lavatory breaks on the basement floor ... without the hazard of pain and bruises.\" Pl. Supp. 3. Hill's supplemental submission also stated that \"he worked alone and suffered a gradual decline in strength and energy due to injury and fatigue from August '07 - December '08,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, and that he \"performed all the DBA Program Aide job(s) ... alone, from August '07 - December '08, and experienced grave hardships in doing so,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response, ARE argued that Hill admitted he was able to perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, \"but not without pain.\" Supplemental Brief for Defendant (\"Def. Supp.\") at 3, ECF No. 42. ARE's supplemental submission did not argue that Hill was unqualified for his position or that the requested accommodations would cause ARE undue hardship. ARE, which was counseled, argued only that Hill did not make the accommodation requests and that he did not need the accommodations of a lower floor or classroom aide because he could perform the essential functions of his position, just with \"pain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for ARE on Hill's claims for hostile work environment and failure to accommodate by refusing to assign him a classroom aide, and denied summary judgment on Hill's claim for failure to accommodate by refusing to assign him to a lower floor.\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Regarding the claim for denial of a classroom aide, the District Court concluded Hill \"ha[d] not adduced any evidence to show that an Aide would have been an effective means of addressing the limitations imposed by his amputated leg,\" and granted summary judgment because \"when an employee seeks a workplace accommodation, the accommodation must be related to the limitation that rendered the person disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197692\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/260/#p267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197692\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/260/#p267\">\n    at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

The jury found for Hill on his failure-to-accommodate claim for ARE's refusal to assign him to a classroom on a lower floor, awarding him compensatory and punitive damages. ARE and Hill both moved to set aside the verdict, and the District Court denied both motions.

Therefore, to be \"reasonable\" under the ADA, an accommodation must be related to the disability that creates the employment barrier and must address that barrier; the ADA does not make employers responsible for alleviating any and all challenges presented by an employee's disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nuzum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556308\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/839/#p848\">\n    432 F.3d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]here must be a causal connection between the major life activity that is limited and the accommodation sought.\");\n   <em>\n    Felix v.

Pt. 1630, App. (2016) (\"[A]n employer [does not] have to provide as an accommodation any amenity or convenience that is not job-related\" and \"that is not provided to employees without disabilities.\"). Hill satisfied these requirements by alleging that he experienced a hazard of pain and bruising on his stump while standing for long periods of time, and by specifically connecting that hazard to supervising his class without assistance. Construing Hill's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   submissions liberally and with all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor, a reasonable jury could find that if ARE provided Hill a classroom aide as it did for his colleagues, that aide could help Hill supervise students in the classroom and during outdoor activities, reducing his need for prolonged standing and mitigating the alleged \"hazard of pain and bruising.\" Pl. Supp. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ARE argues, for the first time on appeal, that a classroom aide would not be a reasonable accommodation. (Recall that ARE argued below that Hill did not request these accommodations, a losing argument on summary judgment because Hill introduced documentary and testimonial evidence of the request). According to ARE, Hill feared only \"falling while walking\" or his prosthesis breaking while he was working, and provided \"no evidence as to how an aide would alleviate this fear\" once Hill was assigned to a lower floor. ARE Br. in Response to Amicus 10-11. ARE now asserts that \"[i]t is unlikely an Aide could prevent a fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   11. ARE also emphasizes that an aide could not help with \"problems arising from staircase climbing,\" and that in any event Hill \"assured [his supervisor] that his disability did not affect him while he worked on the lower level of the facility and did not prevent him from performing essential job duties there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12. ARE uses some language from the complaint to suggest that Hill conceded that he did not need an aide if he was moved to a lower floor, ignoring that the complaint also alleged that Hill supplied ARE \"with medical records attesting to his ability to perform the essential functions of his job with reasonable accommodation of his disability\n   <em>\n    (an aide assigned to his classroom).\n   </em>\n   \" Compl. \u00b6 32 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ARE also fails to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Hill, as we must at this stage.\n   <em>\n    Keefe Co. v.

Cir. 1999). Hill's evidence tended to show not only\n   that he was at risk from falling while walking long distances or climbing stairs, but also that he would suffer \"pain and bruises\" from prolonged standing while supervising his classroom alone. Hill's submission in response to the District Court's order also stated that \"he worked alone and suffered a gradual decline in strength and energy due to injury and fatigue from August '07 - December '08,\" Pl. Supp. 4, and that he \"performed all the DBA Program Aide job(s) ... alone, from August '07 - December '08, and experienced grave hardships in doing so,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Hill's documentary evidence showed that he requested an aide \"to keep with [my] daily schedule, which requires both indoor and outdoor gross motor activities,\" Mem. from Brien Hill to Nykia Washington, ECF No. 22, at 22, thereby connecting the accommodation request to job functions that are made difficult and painful by his disability. Construing this evidence in the light most favorable to Hill, a reasonable jury could find that Hill's disability put him at risk of pain and bruises when standing for long periods of time, that he would have to stand for long periods of time while supervising his classroom or outdoor play without an aide to assist him, and that he did in fact suffer harm \"due to injury and fatigue\" during the time he was denied the accommodation of a classroom aide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    477 U.S. at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the District Court granted summary judgment as to the teacher aide theory, it nonetheless gave Hill wide latitude during the trial to present evidence and argument to the jury about the failure to provide an aide. Hill, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , complained in both opening statement and closing argument about being placed on the third floor \"with no assistance.\" Transcript of Plaintiff Opening Trial Statement at 3,\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Hill also introduced testimony about the duties that aides provide,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310368,4059214\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/66/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310368,4059214\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/66/\">\n    at 95-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ECF No. 101, and suggesting that every teacher had an aide other than him during the 2007-2008 school year,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 288, 293, 318-19, 367-68, ECF No. 102;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 553, 556, ECF No. 103. When Hill testified about the pain and injury he allegedly suffered, he stated numerous times that it was due to \"work[ing] unassisted on the third floor,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 589-90, so he repeatedly told the jury that the failure to provide him an aide contributed to his pain and suffering,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 562, 626-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, although ARE was granted summary judgment with regard to the failure to provide an aide, the District Court was quite solicitous of Hill in allowing him to present evidence and argument at trial regarding his classroom-aide claim. Under these circumstances, it seems quite plausible that in finding for Hill on the reasonable accommodation claim, the jury took into account any pain and injury Hill suffered due to the failure to provide him with an aide. Indeed, the jury was not\n   instructed that the only accommodation request that it could consider was the failure to move Hill to a lower floor; rather, the jury was told simply to recompense Hill if it found in his favor on the failure to accommodate claim, without specifying which particular accommodation to consider.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 719, 723-24, ECF No. 104. Further, the jury was instructed that it could award compensatory damages for \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   physical pain or emotional distress ... that the plaintiff has suffered in the past ... [or] may suffer in the future,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 731 (emphasis added). Similarly, the jury was instructed that \"[i]f you find for the plaintiff, then you must award the plaintiff a sum of money which will fairly and reasonably compensate him for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the damage which he experienced that was proximately caused by the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 730 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It is well settled that a party \"cannot recover the same damages twice, even though the recovery is based on two different theories.\"\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

Thus, even if the District Court erred in granting partial summary judgment, Hill is not entitled to a windfall of double damages from a second trial if the jury already compensated him for ARE's failure to provide him an aide in the damages award from the first trial. \"[H]e should be made whole for his injuries, not enriched.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Youren v.
