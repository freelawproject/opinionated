Green appeals his resulting conviction, claiming that the traffic stop was both instigated and prolonged in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Finding no constitutional violation on either front, we will affirm the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case involves three separate traffic stops, all performed by Pennsylvania State Trooper Michael Volk, that are arguably relevant to Green's constitutional claims. As a drug interdiction officer, Volk's duties largely consist of traveling on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in an unmarked cruiser to search for drugs, money, and weapons. Each of the stops occurred on the Turnpike in the vicinity of Somerset, roughly 70 miles east of Pittsburgh. The first stop involved two men with no further direct connection to the case. The latter two stops both involved Green. The Government argues that information Volk obtained during the first stop helped contribute to reasonable suspicion of Green's criminal activity during the final stop, which led to the heroin discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    April 3, 2013\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Volk stopped a vehicle traveling eastbound on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. This stop did not involve Green, but rather two other men who, like Green, are black. The men had a dog in their back seat. Volk's stated reason for the stop was for following too closely, but he suspected that the stopped vehicle and another vehicle traveling close by were involved in drug trafficking. The occupants stated that they were traveling to Long Branch, New Jersey, in order to breed the dog, which they described as an \"American Bully.\" Volk's computer was not working at the time, so he let the individuals go with a verbal warning. Later that day, Volk learned that at least one of the occupants was on federal pretrial release for drug violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    April 4, 2013\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At approximately 8 a.m. the next day, Volk simultaneously pulled over two separate vehicles traveling eastbound on the Turnpike. Again, Volk believed that the two cars were travelling together and involved in drug trafficking. The stated reasons for the stops were a license plate violation and illegal window tinting. Both drivers denied knowing each other. The first driver, a white male, informed Volk that he was traveling to Baltimore for work. Green drove the second vehicle and informed Volk that he was going to Philadelphia to see family. When Volk asked Green how long he was planning to stay in Philadelphia, Green initially responded, \"I don't know. That all depends,\" at which point Volk began to speak over him, laughing, and asked, \"You don't have to get back for work or anything?\" Green explained that he owned a barbershop, so he had a good amount of flexibility with regard to the hours he worked. Nothing else was discussed about the planned duration of Green's trip and the conversation diverted to other topics. A check of Green's license revealed that he had multiple prior arrests for drug and weapon offenses, though Volk was unaware if Green had any prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After several minutes, Volk brought Green to the rear of Green's vehicle and issued a warning for the window tint violation. Green told Volk that he had only recently purchased the vehicle and that the windows had been tinted by the previous owner. Volk then told Green he could continue on his way. As Green was walking back to the driver's side of his car, Volk asked him if there was anything in the vehicle that should not be there. Green responded that there was not. Volk then asked for Green's consent to search the vehicle and Green acceded, eventually signing a waiver. Volk searched Green's vehicle, including the engine compartment, for roughly twelve minutes and did not discover any contraband. In fact, Green did not have any luggage or baggage of any kind in his vehicle. While conducting the search, Volk detected the smell of raw marijuana in the trunk compartment and noticed that the trunk liner was pulled back. Volk did not discuss any of these observations with Green. Following the search, Volk allowed Green to continue on his way. Volk also received consent to search the other vehicle and similarly uncovered no contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    April 5, 2013\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At approximately 10 a.m. the following day, Volk was removing debris on the side of the Turnpike and noticed Green's vehicle traveling westbound. By his own admission, Volk decided at this point that he would try to find a reason to stop Green. Volk followed Green and ascertained his speed by \"pacing\" Green's vehicle. When pacing, an officer finds the speed at which his vehicle remains equidistant from the target vehicle in order to assess the target vehicle's speed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203368\">\n    75 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requirements for pacing). Here, Volk followed one to two-tenths of a mile behind Green's car for a distance of roughly six-tenths of a mile. The speed limit on that portion of the Turnpike was 65 miles per hour. Volk determined that Green was traveling 79 miles per hour and pulled him over. After walking up to Green's window, Volk feigned surprise, saying, \"You again!\" in a light-hearted manner. When Volk noted that he pulled Green over for speeding, Green apologized and said that he had left the cruise control on while going down a hill. As Green was gathering his license and registration, he asked Volk, \"How you doin' today?\" Volk replied and then asked Green how he was doing, to which Green responded, \"I can't complain. I got a dog, so.\" Volk then observed a dog in the back\n   of Green's vehicle and believed it was-or at least resembled-the dog from the April 3 stop. Volk asked Green why he had returned from Philadelphia after only one day, despite saying the day before that he would be there for \"a couple days.\" As quoted above, Green did not actually say he would be gone \"a couple days\" during the earlier stop, but that was how Volk remembered the previous day's conversation. In any event, Green explained that he was returning from Philadelphia because his daughter had just broken her leg, so he had to hurry back to take care of her. This conversation lasted about forty seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After returning to his cruiser with Green's license and registration, Volk immediately called a colleague to fill him in on the events dating back to April 3. This phone call lasted roughly two minutes and had a decidedly jocular tone. Volk had already requested backup prior to his initial conversation with Green and waited in his vehicle for its arrival. It is unclear whether Volk also requested a canine unit at this time. About eight minutes after the end of his phone call, and with backup not having arrived, Volk called Green to the rear of Green's vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Volk again issued Green a warning and Green struck up a lengthy conversation about his daughter's injury. During this exchange, both Volk and Green stood at the rear of Green's vehicle observing the dog through the back window. Green described the dog's breed as a \"Cane Corso\" or \"Presa Canario,\" and related that he had bought the dog from a kennel somewhere outside of Philadelphia, though he could not recall the name of the exact town. As had happened the day before, Volk indicated that Green was free to leave, but as Green was walking back to the driver's door, Volk again asked if he could search Green's vehicle. This time, Green apologized and declined, explaining that he was in too much of a hurry. Volk then instructed Green to wait in his car until further notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After approximately fifteen minutes, during which there was no meaningful interaction between Volk and Green, a canine unit arrived. Green was taken out of his vehicle and told to take his dog with him to a safe distance away from the police dog.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A canine sweep of the car resulted in an alert for drugs in the trunk. Based on this evidence, Volk obtained a search warrant a few hours later. A search of Green's trunk revealed a duffel bag containing roughly 1,000 bricks of heroin weighing nearly 20 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Green was charged with possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin. Green filed a motion to suppress the heroin as obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing nearly three years after the original stop, in which Volk testified as the only witness. After the District Court denied Green's motion, he pled guilty to the single count, preserving the constitutional issues for appeal. Green was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment-the mandatory minimum-followed by five years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The District Court exercised jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and this\n   Court exercises jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On an appeal of a denial of a motion to suppress, the District Court's factual findings are reviewed for clear error and its legal determinations are subject to plenary review.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736264\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/232/#p237\">\n    672 F.3d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (3d Cir. 2012). We will affirm the District Court's denial of Green's motion to suppress. Although our reasoning differs in some respects from that of the District Court, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    Tourscher v. McCullough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11543283\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/236/#p240\">\n    184 F.3d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (3d Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Green's constitutional claims require us to answer several discrete questions. First, we must assess whether the District Court erred when it ruled that the final traffic stop on April 5 was supported by reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation. If there was no error, we must proceed to determine whether the District Court was also correct in its determination that the stop was conducted in a constitutional manner. Green argues that the stop was prolonged in violation of the Fourth Amendment. To address this claim, we must first decide when the stop was extended, and then determine whether, at that point, the extension was justified by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Initiation of the Traffic Stop\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We turn first to Green's contention that the April 5 stop was initiated in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Traffic stops are classified as a type of\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, and may be initiated based on a reasonable suspicion that a traffic violation has occurred.\n   <em>\n    Navarette v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706993\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/393/\">\n    572 U.S. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1686,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Delfin-Colina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730906\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/392/#p396\">\n    464 F.3d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396-97 (3d Cir. 2006) (adopting reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, as the applicable standard). Here, Volk paced Green's vehicle in compliance with the relevant Pennsylvania statute and estimated his speed at 79 miles per hour, 14 miles per hour above the posted limit. Conceding these facts, Green nonetheless argues that the distance at which Volk conducted the pacing-between one and two-tenths of a mile-was too great to allow for a reliable estimate of Green's speed. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When pacing, the key requirement is maintaining a consistent distance with the target vehicle. At the suppression hearing, Volk testified that he was able to maintain a constant interval between himself and Green. The District Court found that Green's vehicle was some distance from Volk's, but not so far that Volk would have been unable to determine if the interval between the two was increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant. The dashboard camera footage from Volk's cruiser shows that this factual finding is not clearly erroneous. Our confidence in Volk's assessment is further supported by the fact that Green was traveling significantly faster than the speed limit allowed. Logically, the more excessive a driver's speed, the less precise a measurement must be to establish reasonable suspicion that the driver is speeding at least to some degree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sowards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505052\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/583/#p591\">\n    690 F.3d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591-92 (4th Cir. 2012). The operative question is whether Volk had a reasonable suspicion that Green was speeding, not whether Volk could determine Green's exact speed. The District Court did not err in concluding that Volk had a reasonable suspicion that Green was speeding, so the stop was justified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B. Extension of the Traffic Stop\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We next consider whether the April 5 traffic stop, though \"lawful at its inception,\" was unreasonably extended in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Caballes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    543 U.S. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). An unreasonable extension occurs when an officer, without reasonable suspicion, diverts from a stop's traffic-based purpose to investigate other crimes.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1615,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). There is no dispute that the April 5 traffic stop was extended to facilitate a canine sniff for drugs. What is disputed, however, is when this extension occurred, and whether, at that moment, Volk possessed reasonable suspicion in order to justify the extension. In light of\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , we must first determine when the stop was \"measurably extend[ed].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

After determining when the stop was extended-the \"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   moment,\" so to speak-we can assess whether the facts available to Volk at that time were sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that Green was involved in drug trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As subsequent cases in our sister Circuits have demonstrated, the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   rule is far easier to articulate than to apply, and we now find ourselves facing a similar difficulty. We ultimately conclude that\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   does not provide a clear answer for pinpointing the April 5 \"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   moment.\" In light of such uncertainty-and solicitous of Green's Fourth Amendment rights-we will err on the side of caution and assume the earlier of the two plausible \"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   moments\" from which to assess reasonable suspicion. Because Volk did indeed possess reasonable suspicion at this earlier point, Green suffered no constitutional injury in the course of the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Prior to\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   that a \"dog sniff conducted during a ... lawful traffic stop\" does not violate the Fourth Amendment as long as the sniff does not result in the stop being \"prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete\" its traffic-based mission.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    543 U.S. at 410, 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Where, as in the present case, an officer arguably prolongs a traffic stop before issuing a citation, these precedents serve as an uncertain guide. What we know is that an officer may \"conduct certain unrelated checks,\" but not \"in a way that prolongs the stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Applying\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This case presents many of the same ambiguities highlighted above. There can be no doubt that Volk measurably extended the traffic stop when, after issuing Green a warning citation, he instructed Green to wait in his car indefinitely. The key question is whether the stop was measurably extended at an earlier point-that is, whether the \"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   moment\" instead occurred when Volk returned to his vehicle after his brief initial conversation with Green and made an unrelated phone call to his colleague. If it did, then\n   nothing later in the stop can inform our reasonable suspicion analysis. This includes, most significantly, the conversation that occurred when Volk issued the citation to Green.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Under a restrictive reading of\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , it seems clear that Volk's actions following the initial conversation with Green, particularly the phone call to his colleague, added time to the traffic stop and constituted an extension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263490\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/76/#p82\">\n    877 F.3d at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This phone call was focused on Volk's suspicions about drug trafficking, not speeding. At the suppression hearing, Volk conceded that, by the time he made this call, he was intent on searching Green's vehicle and no longer concerned with the moving violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the other hand, there are sound reasons in favor of the more lenient approach followed by several Circuits. To start, this short phone call, though unrelated to the traffic stop, was not shown to have measurably prolonged the stop, which took little more than ten minutes from its inception to the issuance of the warning. Other courts have found that phone calls requesting canine assistance are not measurable extensions,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277260\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/377/#p384\">\n    852 F.3d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384 (4th Cir. 2017), though this conclusion is far from obvious under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, at the time Volk made the phone call he was apparently still waiting for backup, which raises its own set of considerations.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   acknowledged the danger to police officers inherent in traffic stops, and found no constitutional injury where an officer takes \"negligibly burdensome precautions in order to complete his [traffic] mission safely.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, \"safety precautions taken in order to facilitate\" investigation of other crimes are not justified as part of a routine traffic stop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Assuming Volk's request for backup was motivated by safety concerns inherent to the traffic stop, then any actions taken while waiting for backup to arrive, including the phone call, did not add to the \"time reasonably required to complete the mission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    at 1615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    543 U.S. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   would seem to suggest that the validity of Volk waiting for backup turns on his motivation for making the request-traffic-based or otherwise-but even this inquiry strikes us as rather arbitrary. We doubt very much that Volk's motivation can be distilled to a single concern rather than a hazy constellation of factors confronting an officer in such a situation. Of course, Volk ultimately chose not to wait for backup to arrive before reengaging with Green, which adds still greater complexity to the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In light of the uncertainty in applying\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   to the present facts, we believe that the prudent course is to err on the side of caution and proceed on the assumption-not conclusion-that the \"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   moment\" occurred immediately after Volk's initial conversation with Green. Accordingly, we will assess reasonable suspicion based only on the facts known to Volk at that time.

During that stop, Green consented to a search of his vehicle, which failed to uncover any contraband. The Government argues that the unsuccessful nature of the April 4 search is essentially irrelevant to the question of reasonable suspicion on April 5. Green counters that, because he consented to the April 4 search and was found free of contraband, no information from the search could be used to support reasonable suspicion on April 5. Essentially, Green argues that the April 4 search gave him a clean slate moving forward. In support, Green cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Peters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n    10 F.3d 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1993), which likewise included multiple traffic stops in relatively quick succession. The District Court, perhaps seeking to avoid this thorny issue, purported to conduct an independent analysis of the April 5 facts alone. In reality, however, the District Court's analysis\n   incorporated several facts from the preceding two days. For instance, the District Court found Green's travel on April 5 to be suspicious, but could have only reached this conclusion by relying on Green's April 4 statements about his travel plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The present case is easily distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   . There, an officer pulled over the defendant and his passenger for erratic driving in a rented moving truck. The officer suspected that Peters was transporting drugs, and received consent to search his truck. This search failed to uncover any contraband and the officer sent Peters on his way. Concerned that his search had been inadequate, the officer radioed his headquarters about the situation. This led to Peters again being pulled over a few hours down the road, at which point a different officer uncovered evidence that Peters was present in the country illegally. The Tenth Circuit ruled that this evidence should have been suppressed because the second stop was unconstitutionally premised on the same factors that justified the initial stop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n    at 1522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In Green's case, roughly twenty-six hours elapsed between the two traffic stops, as opposed to the four or five hour interval in\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   . In addition, the nature of Green's suspected crime-drug trafficking-made it entirely plausible for Green to have acquired drugs during the intervening time period. In\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, the officers all but knew that the suspect had driven uninterrupted between the two traffic stops.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n    at 1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, they relied on this assumption to predict Peters' location for the second stop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those officers could not have reasonably suspected that Peters acquired contraband between the two stops. Nor was that the point; the second search was simply a redo of the first. Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   there was no independent basis for making the second traffic stop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n    at 1523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Green's speeding provided a legitimate justification for the April 5 stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Given these substantial differences, we see no reason-constitutional or otherwise-to follow\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   and exclude from our analysis information gained during the April 4 stop. It bears repeating: reasonable suspicion is based on the totality of the circumstances, i.e., \"the whole picture.\"\n   <em>\n    Cortez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716341\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/411/#p417\">\n    449 U.S. at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716341\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/411/#p417\">\n    101 S.Ct. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Categorically excluding a large swath of evidence is quite the opposite of considering \"the whole picture.\" Incidentally, this case illustrates that the totality of the circumstances approach does not inherently benefit either side. For instance, although our analysis appropriately considers the fact that Volk detected the smell of raw marijuana emanating from Green's trunk on April 4, we also consider as strong evidence the fact that Green's vehicle was searched and contained no contraband. \"[T]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is 'reasonableness'....\"\n   <em>\n    Brigham City, Utah v.

In our view, a reasonable officer in Volk's position, rather than excluding certain evidence, would consider all of the facts available to him and accord each its due weight. In evaluating his actions, the Constitution requires that we do likewise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Reasonable Suspicion Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As noted above, when evaluating reasonable suspicion a court's task is to assess the situation as a whole. Nevertheless, in explaining our analysis it will often be beneficial, for the sake of clarity, to explain each factor's relative weight in establishing reasonable suspicion. In accordance with our\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   analysis, we will\n   only consider those facts known to Volk at the time he completed his conversation with Green at the beginning of the April 5 stop. We conclude that Volk possessed a reasonable suspicion that Green was engaged in criminal activity. This conclusion is based on three primary factors: (1) Green's misleading statements regarding his travel, (2) the smell of marijuana in Green's trunk, and (3) Green's criminal history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    1. Green's Misleading Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Shortly after being stopped on April 4, Green related to Volk that he was traveling to Philadelphia to visit family. Volk asked Green how long he was staying, to which Green responded, \"I don't know. That all depends.\" Volk immediately began to laugh and, speaking over Green, asked \"You don't have to get back for work or anything?\" Green responded that he was a barber, so his hours were fairly flexible. Roughly twenty-six hours later, Volk pulled Green over again as he returned from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Based on these facts, the District Court concluded that Green's statements \"about his travels to Philadelphia were inconsistent and contradictory,\" and thus contributed to Volk's reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that nothing in Green's statement to Volk on April 4 was logically inconsistent with his April 5 return. Green's statement indicated that his trip was for an indeterminate length of time, which obviously does not foreclose a one-day turnaround. Contradictory or inconsistent statements may contribute to reasonable suspicion,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Givan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9325026\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/452/#p459\">\n    320 F.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 (3d Cir. 2003), but an incomplete statement is not necessarily contradictory or inconsistent. For all we know, Green's complete, uninterrupted statement would have been, \"I don't know. That all depends. Probably tomorrow, but maybe the next day.\" The fact that Green did not provide a full statement about his travel plans limits, but does not defeat, our reliance on this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Though not strictly contradictory, Green's statements concerning his travel were sufficiently confusing so as to meaningfully contribute to reasonable suspicion. While not logically irreconcilable with his earlier statement, Green's travel was nonetheless suspicious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Benoit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703382\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/280/#p285\">\n    730 F.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285-86 (3d Cir. 2013) (premising reasonable suspicion on inconsistent statements regarding the purpose and destination of voyage). In the context of a cross-state trip to visit family for the first time in a while, the answer \"I don't know. That all depends,\" is not how someone would normally characterize the duration of a trip that could possibly last only a few hours. More to the point, we cannot say that Volk was unreasonable in believing that Green's April 4 statement was at least in tension with an April 5 return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In our mind, however, the more significant suspicion arose, not from Green's quick turnaround, but his own statements on April 5. While Green was looking for his license and registration at the beginning of the April 5 stop, Volk asked him how he was doing and Green replied, \"I can't complain. I got a dog, so.\" Only after Volk alluded to their conversation the day before-\"I thought you were staying out a couple days?\"-did Green say he needed to rush back to Pittsburgh because of his daughter's broken leg.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Volk was justified\n   in viewing Green's shifting statements with mounting skepticism. If it was true that Green's family visit had been cut short due to his daughter suffering a serious injury, it is hard to imagine him responding to Volk's question-\"How are you?\"-with such a blas\u00e9 answer-\"I can't complain. I got a dog, so.\" Moreover, Green had already been informed that he was stopped for speeding, so it is highly suspicious that he would not immediately offer his daughter's purported injury as an explanation for his rushing home. Instead, Green's initial explanation for speeding was simply that he had left his cruise control on while going down a hill. Green's puzzling responses provided a reasonable basis to believe that he was lying about his travels and contributed to Volk's reasonable suspicion of illegal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Smell of Marijuana\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   During the consensual search of Green's car on April 4, Volk detected the smell of raw marijuana in the trunk. Volk was unable to locate the source of the smell, and the car was otherwise free of contraband. \"It is well settled that the smell of marijuana alone ... may establish not merely reasonable suspicion, but probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Green, however, argues that the unsuccessful search on April 4 eliminated any probative value of the odor. We disagree. While the fact that no marijuana was found on April 4 is certainly a relevant consideration, it does not preclude our-or Volk's-consideration of this evidence in support of reasonable suspicion on April 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The odor of marijuana in a car \"can 'be evidence of the most persuasive character,' \"\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p589\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   586 n.5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The absence of actual marijuana on April 4 mitigates, but does not eliminate, the probative value of this evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   that, having conducted a prior search, the officer could not justify a subsequent search absent additional evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515910\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1517/\">\n    10 F.3d at 1522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, the April 5 stop was independently justified and there was additional evidence to support reasonable suspicion. In this context, we find no basis in law or logic to prohibit consideration of the marijuana odor merely because Green was not transporting drugs the day before. Reasonable suspicion must be grounded in \"the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\"\n   <em>\n    Brinegar v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3943769\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/160/#p175\">\n    338 U.S. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3943769\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/160/#p175\">\n    69 S.Ct. 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%201879\">\n    93 L.Ed. 1879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949). The smell of marijuana is one such \"practical consideration\" familiar to an officer with Volk's experience in the field. The Fourth Amendment does not demand the kind of cognitive contortions that would be required for Volk to ignore highly probative evidence of drug activity in deciding whether he had reasonable suspicion to extend the stop. Volk was justified in relying on this odor as evidence of\n   criminal activity on April 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    3. Green's Criminal History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   During the April 4 stop, Volk conducted a records check and discovered that Green had multiple prior arrests for drug and firearm violations. Volk did not learn how those arrests were ultimately resolved or whether Green had any convictions. Though a criminal record, much less an arrest record, is not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion, it is a valid factor.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mathurin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481931\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/170/#p177\">\n    561 F.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (3d Cir. 2009). As we have previously noted, \"the use of prior arrests and convictions to aid in establishing probable cause is not only permissible, but is often helpful.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Conley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11939466\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/4/1200/#p1207\">\n    4 F.3d 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1207 (3d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted) (collecting cases). This utility is enhanced when the prior offenses relate to the crime being investigated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11939466\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/4/1200/#p1207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Particularly given the other factors already discussed, Volk was amply justified in considering Green's drug arrests in assessing reasonable suspicion of drug trafficking on April 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Stepping back from these individual factors and considering the \"whole picture,\" our question remains a fairly straight forward one. After the conversation at the start of the April 5 traffic stop, did Volk possess reasonable suspicion that Green was engaged in criminal activity? At that moment, Volk reasonably believed that Green had provided several misleading statements about his travel, he knew that Green's trunk carried the odor of marijuana, and he knew that Green had several prior arrests for drug and firearm violations. This evidence of criminal activity was tempered by the fact that, only one day prior, Green consented to a search of his vehicle, which was found free of contraband. Reasonable minds may disagree over the extent to which the results of this search counteracted the various indicia of criminality, but that is precisely the point. Whatever the effect of the prior search, it was not so sanitizing as to make Volk's suspicion of Green the following day unreasonable. We conclude that Volk had a \"particularized and objective\" basis for suspecting that Green was engaged in criminal activity on April 5,\n   <em>\n    Cortez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716341\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/411/#p417\">\n    449 U.S. at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716341\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/411/#p417\">\n    101 S.Ct. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so extending the traffic stop to facilitate a dog sniff was permissible,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons explained above, we will affirm the decision of the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The record does not reveal why Volk chose not to wait any longer for backup.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    At this point, Volk performed a patdown of Green.
