Gibbs contends that the sentence was plainly procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately address his arguments in favor of a downward-variance sentence. We conclude, however, that the record amply demonstrates that the district court, in reaching its decision to impose the recommended sentence, considered Gibbs's arguments for a downward variance and addressed several of them, while highlighting the seriousness of the violations, as well as Gibbs's extensive criminal history. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gibbs pleaded guilty in August 2010 to possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), and thereafter he was sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment and 3 years' supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Six months after Gibbs was released from prison, he was charged in state court for possession of drug paraphernalia and, upon conviction, was sentenced to 45 days' imprisonment, suspended, and 18 months' probation. Then, in February 2013 and again in August 2013, Gibbs tested positive for the use of marijuana. Finally, in February 2014, Gibbs participated in a conspiracy to traffic in heroin and maintained a vehicle, dwelling, or place for controlled substances and, upon conviction, was sentenced to 19 to 32 months' imprisonment. All four of these incidents violated the conditions of Gibbs's supervised release, and Gibbs's probation officer accordingly filed a motion for revocation. At the revocation hearing, Gibbs admitted to all four violations, and the court thus found \"as a fact that the defendant violated the terms and conditions of his 2010 judgment.\" The\n   court concluded further that Gibbs's drug trafficking offense was a Grade A violation, the most serious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As provided by the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, Gibbs's Grade A violation mandates revocation of supervised release,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1), 7B1.3(a)(1), and when a Grade A violation is coupled with Gibbs's Criminal History Category VI, a sentence of 33 to 41 months' imprisonment is recommended,\n   <em>\n    see id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 7B1.4. But because the maximum revocation sentence that Gibbs could receive, given his underlying conviction, was 24 months' imprisonment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3), that sentence became his recommended sentence, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(b)(1). Counsel for both parties recognized as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While presenting no evidence at the hearing, Gibbs's counsel asked the court to impose a downward-variance sentence of 12 months' imprisonment based on three \"mitigation factors.\" As she stated to the court, \"There's extreme hardship on his family. There is the time already served [on the drug-trafficking conviction]. There may be, thirdly, some discussion from the Government.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the first factor, which was counsel's main argument, counsel stated that a 24-month prison term would deprive Gibbs's three children of significant income and a stable home environment and would impose hardship on Gibbs's mother, who had relocated to care for the children during his absence, as his wife was deceased. With respect to Gibbs's earning potential, counsel noted that Gibbs \"went through a program called Youth Build, where he learned a significant amount of skills. He can build a house from the ground up, framing, painting, landscaping.\" She also pointed to Gibbs's employment, stating that Gibbs had been employed \"at the House of Raeford, the chicken plant\" and at \"Peters Landscaping Company, in Wilmington. He worked seven days, from 10 to 3. So he has skills that he can build upon once he gets this behind him.\" Counsel also noted that Gibbs had been \"working toward his GED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the second mitigation factor, counsel noted that Gibbs had already served 14 months on his drug-trafficking conviction and therefore argued that he had already been duly punished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   And on the third factor, she stated, \"hopefully, the Government will discuss with this Court\" Gibbs's assistance to law enforcement after his drug-trafficking conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Counsel then summarized Gibbs's justification for a downward variance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Now, I'm asking for 12 months ... [a]nd I do think that period of time will be enough time to not only punish Mr. Gibbs, but certainly deter him from any further conduct. But ... it is [also] a reasonable time to be away from the unique and extraordinary situation that he has with his family. So that when he returns home, he can immediately jump in with the skills that he has and be able to provide resources for them[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, the government argued that Gibbs's Grade A violation was a \"serious charge\" and that otherwise he had an extensive criminal history:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   200 bags of heroin was the amount that was involved with the second conviction in 2014. And Mr. Gibbs has had several prior drug convictions and has had 12 convictions prior to his federal sentence. And it's over a six-year period. And several of those were assaultive in nature. He had two assaults. He had multiple resisting officers. So he has not had a good track record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The government noted further that one of the violations at issue-Gibbs's possession\n   of drug paraphernalia-occurred within months after beginning his term of supervised release. But the government did acknowledge Gibbs's cooperation with law enforcement, explaining that \"after the state [offense] with the 200 bags of heroin, [Gibbs] did meet with ATF and did assist them ... with regard to criminal activity in the Wilmington area.\" The government allowed that although the information Gibbs provided had not yet resulted in any charges, law enforcement officers believed that the information was \"helpful\" and \"truthful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the district court offered Gibbs the opportunity to speak on his own behalf, which he declined to do, the court imposed the Guidelines' recommended sentence of 24-months' imprisonment. In doing so, it explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 1st, 2013, the defendant pled guilty to misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia in Brunswick County District Court and was sentenced to 45 days' imprisonment, suspended, 18 months of supervised probation. On January 19, 2015, the defendant was arrested and charged with felony conspiracy to traffic opium/heroin and felony maintain vehicle/dwelling/place for controlled substances. On September 17th, 2015, defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to sell heroin and maintain a vehicle/dwelling/place for controlled substances. The court imposed a 19 to 32 month term of imprisonment. On February 25th, 2013, and August 1st, 2013, the defendant tested positive for marijuana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant has a history of gang affiliation and has prior convictions for assault, marijuana possession, resisting a public officer, possession of stolen goods, trespass, possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm by a felon, possession of a handgun by a minor, carrying a concealed weapon, and driving while license revoked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   He has a scant employment record and little in the way of marketable job skills. While on supervision, the defendant did make an effort to obtain his GED. Upon consideration of Chapter 7 of the [Sentencing Guidelines Manual] and the relevant factors listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the defendant's term of supervision is revoked and the defendant is ordered to be committed to the custody of the [BOP] ... for a period of 24 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When the court then asked defense counsel if she had anything further to add, she stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Yes, Your Honor. I would ask you to reconsider the range of 24 months again-if nothing else, for the extreme hardship that it's going to be on his family at this point. They have done a significant amount to try to mitigate this themselves. But him being away for two years, Your Honor, that's [something] I believe ... the Court can consider. I do not-as the United States has said, they believe that he should have ... something coming off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, the court said, \"All right.\" Then, after a \"[b]rief pause in the proceeding\" (as noted in the transcript), the court stated, \"No change. Twenty-four months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   From the district court's judgment entered January 12, 2017, Gibbs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Gibbs contends that his sentencing was plainly unreasonable as a procedural matter because the district court failed to address or addressed inadequately his arguments for a downward-variance sentence. In particular, his counsel argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Perhaps most troubling, the district court, with no explanation whatsoever,\n   found Mr. Gibbs had \"little in the way of marketable job skills.\" This finding was strictly contrary to what defense counsel had asserted about her client and had offered as a mitigating factor, and yet the court did not explain why it believed Mr. Gibbs had little marketable job skills. Most of us cannot \"build a house from the ground up.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The government responds that the court gave numerous reasons for imposing its 24-month term of imprisonment and that revocation sentences are subject to extra-deferential review. It points out that Gibbs's violations of his supervised-release conditions were sufficiently severe \"breaches of trust\" to outweigh the reasons that he advanced in favor of a downward variance. And it argues that the district court gave Gibbs sufficient individualized consideration when imposing his revocation sentence, emphasizing that it is clear that the court considered his arguments for a downward variance, such that the court committed no procedural error in sentencing him, let alone any error that was plain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The question thus presented is whether the district court provided an adequate explanation when imposing Gibbs's 24-month revocation sentence, given Gibbs's arguments for a downward variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the outset, it is important to review what is demanded of district courts in imposing revocation sentences. When a defendant appears before a court for revocation of his supervised release, he is already subject to the sentence of his criminal judgment, about which he presumably received an appropriate explanation, including an explanation of the range of sentence that could be imposed and why he was receiving a particular sentence. He was also advised of his supervised release and the conditions imposed for it. Thus, as the Sentencing Guidelines emphasize, when a defendant violates those conditions, his violation is not treated as new criminal conduct but rather as a \"breach of trust\" in failing to abide by the conditions of his original sentence, for which the law imposes \"sanctions.\" U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. 3(b);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Crudup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671062\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/433/#p437\">\n    461 F.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437-38 (4th Cir. 2006). When such a violation also involves criminal conduct, the Guidelines leave punishment for that \"to the court responsible for imposing the sentence for that offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Recognizing the distinction between original sentencing and revocation sentencing, the Sentencing Commission has adopted \"revocation policy statements\" that provide sanctions for \"three broad grades of violations,\" formalizing an approach that provides district courts with \"greater flexibility\" than would be provided by specific revocation guidelines to determine the appropriate sanction. U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Consistent with this framework, we have held that a court of appeals reviewing a district court's revocation sentence must adopt a more \"deferential appellate posture\" than when reviewing original sentences to \"account [for] the unique nature of supervised release revocation sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    Crudup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671062\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/433/#p437\">\n    461 F.3d at 438-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In this vein, \"a [district] court's statement of its reasons for going beyond non-binding\n   <em>\n    policy statements\n   </em>\n   in imposing a [revocation] sentence ... need not be as specific as has been required when courts departed from\n   <em>\n    guidelines\n   </em>\n   that were, before\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , considered to be mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Crudup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671062\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/433/#p437\">\n    461 F.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For these reasons, while original sentences are reviewed for \"reasonableness,\" we have recognized that even an unreasonable revocation sentence may stand unless it is\n   <em>\n    plainly\n   </em>\n   unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 438-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This structure of appellate review of revocation sentences still addresses distinctly both\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   reasonableness and\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   reasonableness, but on the more deferential basis noted. A revocation sentence passes procedural muster if it is supported by \"a sufficient explanation so that we may effectively review the reasonableness of the sentence,\" which must encompass \"an assurance that the sentencing court considered the [applicable sentencing] factors with regard to the particular defendant before [it] and also considered any potentially meritorious arguments raised by the parties with regard to sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Moulden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781815\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/478/652/#p657\">\n    478 F.3d at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And a sentence passes substantive muster if the totality of the circumstances indicates that the court had a \" 'proper basis for its conclusion' that the defendant should receive the sentence imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In support of this argument, Gibbs's counsel asserted that Gibbs had certain job skills and a high degree of employability, though Gibbs provided no evidence to support those assertions. He now maintains that the district court responded to his arguments with a single sentence-that Gibbs had \"a scant employment record and little in the way of marketable job skills\" although he \"did make an effort to obtain his GED\"-contrary to his counsel's representations\n   at the revocation hearing. Gibbs also emphasizes that, in response to his request to reconsider the 24-month sentence \"for the extreme hardship that it's going to be on his family,\" the court stated simply, \"No change.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We conclude, however, that the record supports the district court's conclusion that Gibbs had a \"scant\" employment record and job skills. Counsel for Gibbs stated at the revocation hearing that Gibbs went through a program called \"Youth Build\" \"where he learned a significant amount of skills\" relating to building a house. But she provided no evidence that Gibbs ever applied that learning and used those skills. Indeed, in relating Gibbs's job experience, counsel for Gibbs stated only that he had been employed at a chicken plant and at a landscaping company, neither of which involved building a house or even working on a house, and she never specified the duration of those positions. Thus, it was hardly \"contrary\" to the record for the court to have concluded that Gibbs had only scant work experience and job skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   And as to the hardship that a 24-month sentence would impose on Gibbs's family, the court clearly considered it. Indeed, when explicitly asked to do so, the court stated, \"All right.\" After giving the argument thought, however, the court announced that it was not prepared to deviate from the 24-month recommendation. In the same way, the court considered and rejected Gibbs's request for a downward variance based on his cooperation with law enforcement. When Gibbs's counsel asked the court to consider a downward variance, \"as the United States has said they believe that he should have ... something coming off,\" the court's response of \"All right\" also covered that request.

But the majority's characterization is blatantly contradicted by the record itself. The district court made\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   mention of three of Gibbs's four arguments, much less explained its reasoning. The majority conveniently omits that a police detective was present at sentencing to testify about Gibbs's assistance in the investigations, and that the district court declined to hear from him without any explanation or further comment concerning the Government's mitigating proffer. The majority further knits from whole cloth an interpretation of the words \"all right\" and a brief pause-made\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the sentence was imposed-that, in its view, miraculously addressed not one but\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   of Gibbs's arguments. By resting much of its analysis on this pause rather than anything the district court actually said, the majority implicitly concedes that the court sentenced Gibbs to 24 months' imprisonment without any reference to his nonfrivolous mitigating arguments. Further troubling, the majority conflates substantive and procedural reasonableness, applying our substantive reasonableness presumption to Gibbs's procedural challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   By papering over the district court's failings, the majority essentially concludes that Gibbs's extensive criminal history excused the district court from its clearly established obligation to say\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   about Gibbs's nonfrivolous arguments. This flies in the face of our caselaw. Tellingly, the majority does not even cite our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Blue\n   </em>\n   , let alone attempt to distinguish this clear and controlling circuit precedent. I am compelled to dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In 2010, Gibbs pled guilty to Possession of Firearm by a Convicted Felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The district court sentenced Gibbs to 36 months in prison, followed by an equivalent period of supervised release. Gibbs served his prison sentence and began\n   his term of supervised release on June 29, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In January 2015, Gibbs's probation officer filed a Motion for Revocation on Offender Under Term of Supervised Release on the basis of his use of a controlled substance (marijuana), as well as two instances of criminal conduct. First, the probation officer had uncovered the fact that Gibbs had pled guilty to a North Carolina misdemeanor Possession of Drug Paraphernalia charge in March 2013, for which he was sentenced to 45 days in prison and 18 months of supervised probation. Second, Gibbs was arrested in January 2015 and charged with felony Conspiracy to Traffic Opium/Heroin, as well as felony Maintenance of a Vehicle/Dwelling/Place for Controlled Substance. In October 2015, Gibbs's probation officer filed an Amended Motion for Revocation on Offender Under Term of Supervised Release to reflect Gibbs's guilty plea to the heroin-selling charge, for which Gibbs was sentenced to 19 to 32 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At his revocation hearing, Gibbs admitted to violating the terms and conditions of his supervised release as described above. The parties agreed that it was a Grade A violation with a statutory maximum sentence of 24 months, as well as a Guidelines range of 24 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Gibbs made four nonfrivolous arguments in favor of a shorter sentence of 12 months. First, Gibbs argued that he had already served 14 months in state prison for the offenses underlying the violation of his supervised release. Second, he argued that a prolonged prison sentence would bring extreme hardship to his family, who attended Gibbs's sentencing hearing in a show of support. Because the mother of Gibbs's three young children is deceased, Gibbs's mother had taken a significant reduction in pay to relocate to Wilmington, North Carolina, to help care for the children. Gibbs argued that his lengthy imprisonment would thus strain the emotional lives of his children-who have a \"unique bond\" with their father-as well as subtract his earnings from the household. Third, Gibbs described a work program that he had completed, which provided him with the skills to \"build a house from the ground up,\" including framing, painting, and landscaping. Gibbs had also been previously employed by two separate employers. At the time of the hearing, Gibbs was also pursuing his GED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, in addition to his own mitigating arguments, Gibbs adopted the Government's statements recounting his cooperation in providing law enforcement with helpful information regarding criminal activity. The Government explained that \"to his credit,\" Gibbs had provided agents with truthful information about a murder, a bank robbery, and drug activity in the Wilmington area. The Government's agent-witness was available to further elaborate on Gibbs's cooperative behavior, but the court declined to hear from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At sentencing, the district court reiterated Gibbs's violations of supervised release and summarized Gibbs's criminal background as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The defendant has a history of gang affiliation and has prior convictions for assault, marijuana possession, resisting a public officer, possession of stolen goods, trespass, possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm by a felon, possession of a handgun by a minor, carrying a concealed weapon, and driving while license revoke.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   J.A. 29. The court added that Gibbs \"has a scant employment record and little in the way of marketable job skills\" and mentioned only in passing Gibbs's efforts to obtain his GED.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It then revoked Gibbs's supervised release and sentenced\n   him to a 24-month term of imprisonment. By way of explanation, the court said only:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Upon consideration of Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and the relevant factors listed in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a), the defendant's term of supervision is revoked, and the defendant is ordered to be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons or its authorized representative for a period of 24 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Gibbs requested that the court reconsider the 24-month range, the court replied, \"All right,\" paused briefly, and then declared, \"No change.

Thus, our task, contrary to what the majority opinion implies, is not to describe what\n   <em>\n    our\n   </em>\n   reasons would have been had\n   <em>\n    we\n   </em>\n   been the ones to sentence Gibbs to two years in prison. Rather, our responsibility is to determine whether the district court adequately explained\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   reasons for sentencing Gibbs, and, by extension, whether Gibbs was sentenced in a fair manner. The abuse of discretion standard underscores the critical need for a requirement of clear explanation from the district court. Such a requirement exists precisely so that we do not risk substituting our own reasoning for that of the sentencing court, which is closer to the facts of the case and thus better able to fashion an appropriate sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In light of the law of this Court, the majority opinion cannot justify the district court's failure to offer Gibbs an adequate explanation. While insisting that the record \"amply\" demonstrates the district court's consideration,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 200-01, the majority sets the bar absurdly low by asserting that two words and a brief pause are enough to provide a satisfactory acknowledgement of a defendant's arguments for a downward variance. Such a conclusion renders meaningless the requirement to explain a sentencing decision-a sentencing decision that, lest we forget, amounts to no less than the deprivation of the defendant's liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At Gibbs's sentencing hearing, the district court gave no indication that it had considered Gibbs's time already served, nor his family's hardship, nor his completed work training, nor his cooperation with the Government's investigations in the Wilmington area-the bases of each of Gibbs's nonfrivolous mitigating arguments. The court also offered no explanation for imposing the particular sentence it chose. Nonetheless, the majority believes the district court fulfilled its congressionally mandated duty to adequately explain its sentence. As such, the majority predicates its decision on little more than its independent belief that Gibbs received the punishment he deserved. Such a position is not only an affront to over a decade of clearly established precedent with regard to sentencing procedure, but also a transgression of our role as a reviewing court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    <em>\n     Gall v.
