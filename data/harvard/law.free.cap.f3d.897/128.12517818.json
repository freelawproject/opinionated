In contesting the fees, both parties adopted unproductive tactics and strayed from professional etiquette, conduct that ultimately caused the District Court to proclaim that \"[i]t is a hellish judicial duty to review and resolve disputed attorneys' fee petitions, particularly in cases, like this one, where the adversaries fan the flames at virtually every opportunity.\" App. 8. While Relator sought $3,113,530.50 in fees, the Court reduced that amount to $1,794,427.27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relator timely appealed from orders that the Court entered on April 25, 2017, and May 24, 2017, awarding fees and costs. We will remand on one narrow ground, but otherwise affirm the Court's orders in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this False Claims Act action, Relator claimed that C&amp;D manufactured and shipped some 349 defective batteries to the United States government for use in intercontinental ballistic missile launch controls. In the summer of 2014, after some four years of litigation, the parties engaged in active mediation. Relator subsequently demanded a settlement of $1.5 million, plus fees and costs, and the negotiations ended without success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Then, in the spring of 2015, Relator filed a Second Amended Complaint in which he expanded his demands for alleged damages\n   to $30 million, or twenty times the amount of his initial demand. After the District Court denied cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties settled the case for $1.7 million, representing about six percent of the total amount that the Relator demanded in his Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Attorneys' Fees Dispute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a statutory matter, the settlement made Relator a prevailing party under the False Claims Act, entitling him to an award of \"\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   attorneys' fees and costs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) (emphasis added). Although the parties settled the merits of the case, they were not able to agree on the fees that Relator should recover. Initially Relator sought $2,367,904.85 in attorneys' fees as of December 31, 2015. As the District Court explained, \"C&amp;D responded that the reasonable fee amount should have been no more than about half that amount, arguing essentially that the case had been over-staffed and over-worked by the Relator's various sets of lawyers, and that the fee petition was based on the wrong hourly rates and included duplicative entries, inappropriate submissions such as for travel time, and, finally, that there should be a reduction of the amount awarded for degree of success, or rather, lack of success, given the modest settlement amount.\" App. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the District Court, both parties' counsel were uncooperative and did not act in good faith:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court repeatedly offered certain guidance for possibly bridging the chasm and directed the parties' counsel to exchange various pertinent information in an effort to minimize areas of disagreement. Counsel were equally slow to do so, and the hoped for exercise that the Court intended as a way to persuade counsel of the benefits of good faith and good sense achieved very little-other than to lead to an exchange [of] dueling briefs, innuendo and insults.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   App. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Relator responded to C&amp;D's objections by increasing his fee demand to $3,278,115.99, or, as the District Court observed, \"almost $1 million\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than the fees [he] sought a year ago and almost twice the dollar amount of the settlement [he] reached.\" App. 11. Notably, Relator opted to apply hourly rates that he \"extrapolated\" from actual Community Legal Services (\"CLS\") rates and which were higher than those that he originally used to calculate his fee demand. App. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The District Court's Rulings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its decision, the District Court emphasized that it \"was at all times well aware of who was doing what, to what possible end and [had] been entirely attentive to the at times puzzling performance of the professional duties of the lawyers.\" App. 11. The Court noted that its resolution of the fee award reflected its \"hands-on contemporaneous evaluation (and necessary attendant factual findings) of the services performed and for which payment is sought.\" App. 11. It found that, \"[i]n the main, ... C&amp;D's opposition to the fee petition adopts most of the Court's guidance as to, for lack of a better term, 'lawyer hours' and acceptable rates for various tasks undertaken.\" App. 11 n.6. It then proceeded to resolve the areas in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Hourly Rates\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties and the District Court agreed that the rate issue was \"best resolved by using primarily-if not exclusively-the rates promulgated by the Philadelphia office of Community Legal Services.\" App. 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Maldonado v. Houstoun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085540\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/181/#p187\">\n    256 F.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187-88 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"The fee schedule established by [CLS] has been approvingly cited by the Third Circuit as being well developed and has been found by [the Eastern District of Pennsylvania] to be a fair reflection of the prevailing market rates in Philadelphia.\" (second alteration in original) (quotation marks and citation omitted) ) ). The Court rejected Relator's \"extrapolated\" rates that were higher than the CLS rates because \"the CLS rates promulgated in 2014 remain the actual current rates; neither CLS nor any court in any reported opinions that this Court has been able to locate have resorted to the 'extrapolation' technique now used by [Relator's] counsel.\" App. 16. Because the CLS rates provided a range-rather than a specific dollar amount-for reasonable hourly rates, the Court elected \"to take an equitable approach\" and \"direct[ed] counsel to use for each time-keeper for whom a fee is sought and permitted an hourly rate at the mid-point of the applicable range.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Reasonableness of Hours Claimed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The District Court reduced Relator's recoverable attorney hours for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , depositions, document review, summary judgment motions, a motion for reconsideration,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, and travel time expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Depositions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In regard to depositions, C&amp;D objected both to the number of hours involved in taking and preparing for depositions, as well as the number of attorneys attending some of those depositions on behalf of Relator. In its decision, the District Court remarked that during its various meetings regarding the fee dispute, it had \"frequently addressed the matter of the crowd of counsel at the depositions and in preparation sessions for them.\" App. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on previous guidance that it had issued to the parties, the District Court permitted Relator to receive fees for the twelve depositions that C&amp;D specifically challenged, but limited those fees in each deposition to those generated by the Relator lawyer who actually did the questioning and one other Relator lawyer actually in attendance. The Court also allowed \"[p]rep time compensation\" for each deposition of one lawyer per deposition (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the lawyer who actually logged preparation time for the deposition), \"up to a maximum of 1.75 preparation hours per hour of documented deposition time.\" App. 17. If less than 1.75 hours/deposition hour was recorded, then the lesser time value had to be used.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment and Reconsideration Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C&amp;D identified more than 900 hours and more than $440,000 in fees submitted by Relator for: (1) filing a motion for summary judgment; (2) responding to C&amp;D's motion for summary judgment; (3) arguing the motions; and (4) responding to C&amp;D's motion for reconsideration. The District Court stated that it \"cannot avoid observing that the number of hours attributed to the Relator's own motion (284.15) comes within a day's worth of the number of\n   hours counsel then charged for defending against the C&amp;D opposing motion (291.20).\" App. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The District Court was troubled by this reality because \"one would reasonably expect that at least a good portion of the work undertaken to plow the legal field for advancing a summary judgment motion would be (or at least should be) useful and usable for defending an opposing motion (or vice versa), especially for lawyers (such as those representing Relator here) with a self-proclaimed expertise in the controlling legal issues.\" App. 20. In regard to oral argument, the Court was \"puzzled as to how Relator's counsel can call for compensation for 121.2 hours for this activity, slightly more than 48 times the length of the entire time in court for both parties' arguments, including pleasantries.\" App. 20. As to Relator's response to C&amp;D's motion for reconsideration, the Court found that there was \"no credible description as to why\" counsel devoted some seventy-eight hours to \"address[ ] the 5-page motion[.]\" App. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the end, the District Court-based on its \"knowledge of the issues and the briefs as well as having discretion to apply its knowledge gleaned from managing the case from start to finish\"-allowed: (1) sixty percent of the time claimed for preparation of Relator's motion for summary judgment; (2) fifty percent of the time claimed for preparation of Relator's opposition to C&amp;D's motion for summary judgment; (3) thirty percent of the time claimed for Relator's reply brief; (4) a total of 42.5 hours for two lawyers to prepare for and one lawyer to conduct oral argument; and (5) twenty-five hours to respond to C&amp;D's motion for reconsideration. App. 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C&amp;D challenged as unreasonable Relator's claim for 203 hours and more than $85,000 in fees in connection with Relator's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion and his opposition to two such motions filed by C&amp;D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court agreed with C&amp;D. Accordingly, the Court reduced the charges by $58,106.56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Travel Time\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Relator sought fees of 247.70 hours and $129,526.75 for travel time logged by two of Relator's attorneys based in Cincinnati. C&amp;D objected and posited that the travel time be reduced by half. However, the District Court recognized that this Court has held that, \"under normal circumstances, a party that hires counsel from outside of the forum of the litigation may not be compensated for travel time, travel costs, or the costs of local counsel.\" App. 22 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hahnemann Univ. Hosp. v. All Shore, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048845\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/300/#p311\">\n    514 F.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (3d Cir. 2008) ). Thus, following\n   <em>\n    Hahnemann\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that, \"to the extent that Relator's out-of-forum counsel seek reimbursement for travel time to and from the forum-for instance, for court appearances-that travel time will not be reimbursed.\" App. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   However, the District Court treated \"depositions held outside of the forum differently, as even counsel located in the forum area would have incurred travel time for those events.\" App. 23. It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [W]hile the Court is disinclined to allow a claim for multiple lawyers to be traveling on someone else's ticket or for any lawyer to charge 'full freight' for any travel, the Court is equally mindful that but for a professional obligation the lawyer likely would not be traveling at all,\n   in which case the lawyer at least theoretically would have been able to enjoy other pursuits. Thus, some time-oriented compensation for travel time is fair for non-forum events in the case, though the Court is disinclined to authorize companion traveling for events ultimately attended by multiple counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   App. 23 (footnote omitted). Noting that neither party had provided evidence of practices relating to fees for travel time in the local community, the Court held that, \"[b]ecause the burden is squarely on Relator to show that the fees he requests are reasonable, Relator will bear the weight of this failure.\" App. 24. Accordingly, the Court ordered that travel time at fifty percent would be allowed for two attorneys to attend events occurring outside the forum area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    \"Success\" or \"Benefits Achieved\" Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C&amp;D argued for a twenty percent reduction of the fee award based on Relator's lack of success.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

The District Court recognized that \"Relator and his counsel achieved only very modest results: a $1.7 million monetary settlement payment which was about 6% of the Relator's demand in his Second Amended Complaint and roughly $200,000 more than the first settlement demand at the start of the case in 2014.\" App. 25. The Court concluded that, \"after balancing the arguments, the applicable burdens, the Court's knowledge of the case and counsel's conduct, and the foregoing reductions, ... the appropriate exercise of discretion is to further reduce the fee to be awarded to 90% of the permissible fee calculated once the reductions imposed in this ruling have been applied.\" App. 26. Accordingly, the Court reduced the fee by ten percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Judgment and Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In light of the District Court's decision, the parties filed a joint submission regarding Relator's attorneys' fees on May 23, 2017. The parties agreed that for the purposes of the fee award, the Court could use $1,794,427.27 for fees and $164,585.49 for costs, the sum of which was $1,959,012.76. The Court entered judgment on the basis of this stipulation. Relator timely appealed from the fee award, arguing that he is entitled to $564,599.12 in additional fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On appeal, Relator contends that the District Court erred by reducing the billable rates and portions of the fee award that relate to various motions, depositions, and travel expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons below, we will remand this case only for the Court to decide whether the \"fees on fees\" that Relator seeks to collect are reasonable and whether they should be reduced based on the results obtained. We will affirm the Court's judgment in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Awards Below C&amp;D's Suggestions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The District Court reduced the hourly rates and attorneys' hours related to both\n   travel expenses and Relator's reply brief to an amount below that that C&amp;D suggested. We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   to determine whether the Court was able to reduce the attorneys' fees beyond the reductions suggested by C&amp;D.\n   <em>\n    SeePlanned Parenthood of Cent.

Relator contends that the Court acted\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   and committed reversible error. We disagree and find that the Court appropriately exercised its discretion in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   According to Relator, the District Court's discretion to award attorneys' fees is restricted by the parties' positions of what is reasonable, and it therefore cannot award an amount below that which the party opposing the fees contends is reasonable. He relies on\n   <em>\n    Bell v. United Princeton Properties, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11353662\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/713/\">\n    884 F.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1989), for his proposition that \"a court may not sua sponte reduce the amount of the award when the defendant has not specifically taken issue with the amount of time spent or the billing rate[.]\" Appellant Br. at 8-9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11353662\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/713/\">\n    884 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   720 ). Relator contends that this Court prohibits fee award reductions that were not sought by the opposing party for two reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In so deciding, we reasoned first that\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reduction of a fee request deprives the fee applicant of her entitlement to ... offer evidence in support of the reasonableness of her request. And second, because statutory fee litigation is adversarial litigation, there is no need to allow the district court to reduce a fee award on its own initiative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Appellant Br. at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11353662\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/713/\">\n    884 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   719 ) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the District Court reduced, in three instances, Relator's fee award by more than the amount suggested by C&amp;D. First, C&amp;D argued before the Court that the hourly rates on the high end of the CLS ranges were adequate to compensate Relator, but the Court determined that the hourly rate would constitute the midpoint-rather than the high end-of the CLS rate range. Second, C&amp;D sought a reduction of fifty percent for travel time to the forum by counsel based outside the forum. The Court disallowed all such travel time because it was bound by\n   <em>\n    Hahnemann\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, C&amp;D proposed that 50 hours would be sufficient for Relator to prepare an adequate reply brief. The Court, however, allowed recovery of thirty percent of the 127 hours that Relator's attorneys billed, or thirty-eight hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We reject Relator's argument and affirm the District Court's reduction of its fee award in the aforementioned instances by more than had been argued for by C&amp;D. The Court's determination of reasonable hourly rates and the reduction of fees for the summary judgment reply brief and travel time cannot be characterized as\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   rulings as Relator suggests.

Regarding the reasonableness of the fees, Relator contends that the District Court acted in an arbitrary and indiscriminate manner by limiting the deposition fees: (1) to the time at deposition for the Relator attorney who did the questioning and one additional attorney, and (2) \"prep time\" compensation for one lawyer who actually logged preparation time for each deposition, up to a maximum of 1.75 preparation hours per hour of documented deposition time. C&amp;D counters that those limitations are reasonable because, prior to \"filing of the fee petition, the parties and the court engaged in an iterative process ... [where] the district court provided guidance to the parties as to what would be considered a reasonable approach, such as 1.75 hours of preparation time per deposition hour and the time spent at the deposition itself for two attorneys, unless Relator could demonstrate that additional attorneys made material contributions to the deposition.\" Appellee Br. at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The District Court's decision to limit fees recoverable for time at depositions to two attorneys is reasonable in light of its concern that \"the matter of the crowd of counsel at the depositions\" had to be addressed. App. 17. Indeed, the record reflects that upwards of four attorneys on behalf of Relator attended straightforward depositions, and Relator failed to substantiate the need for the excess attorneys to the Court (and does not attempt to do so on appeal). Accordingly, the Court did not abuse its discretion in issuing that limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Nor did the District Court abuse its discretion when it limited recoverable preparation time to one attorney and up to a maximum of 1.75 preparation hours per hour of documented deposition time. The record reflects that Relator seeks to recover an unreasonable amount of deposition fees, including, among other things: (1) $37,609 for deposing two individuals over five hours; (2) $64,412 for deposing a Rule 30(b)(6) witness for seven hours; (3) $26,927 for deposing two other individuals for 6.2 hours; and (4) $169,120 for seven more depositions. In total, Relator claims\n   nearly $300,000 in fees to prepare for and conduct twelve depositions that averaged about 5.25 hours each. Relator, who has the burden to show that the fees are reasonable, does not provide an argument on appeal to substantiate those exorbitant costs, nor did it to the District Court. The Court explained that it had given the parties \"prior express guidance on the issue of claiming fees for time devoted to depositions\" throughout the litigation.

The Court credited C&amp;D's challenges, and it noted that \"Relator ... failed to demonstrate why any greater amount of preparation time should be allowed.\" App. 18.

According to him, C&amp;D made a fatal mistake by not submitting affidavits challenging those fees. However, he relies on\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , which provides that an objecting party need only submit an affidavit \"to the extent the challenger seeks to raise a factual issue-for example, a claim that the fee applicant's billing rate was lower than claimed[.]\" Appellant Br. at 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11353662\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/713/\">\n    884 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   720 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   C&amp;D does not challenge any of the underlying facts supporting Relator's claim for legal fees,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the billing rates and number of hours worked.

In such instances,\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   makes clear that \"parties need not submit counter-affidavits challenging the fee request, so long as they submit briefs that identify the portion of the fee request being challenged and state the grounds for the challenge with sufficient specificity to give the fee applicants notice that they must defend the contested portion of their fee petition.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11353662\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/713/\">\n    884 F.2d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The question on appeal therefore is whether the Court properly analyzed the circumstances of the case and then properly explained its reasoning with respect to the fees associated with the summary judgment, reconsideration, and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The District Court permitted sixty percent of Relator's claim for the written work recorded for Relator's summary judgment motion, fifty percent of the time charged for opposing C&amp;D's summary judgment motion, and thirty percent of the time recorded for the Relator's reply brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It did so on the basis that: (1) \"the number of hours attributed to the Relator's\n   own motion (284.15) comes within a day's worth of the number of hours counsel then charged for defending against the C&amp;D opposing motion (291.20)\"; (2) expert attorneys \"in the specific legal fields at issue in this case would [not] need to log so many hours on supposedly familiar issues\"; (3) \"one would reasonably expect that at least a good portion of the work undertaken to plow the legal field for advancing a summary judgment motion would be (or at least should be) useful and usable for defending an opposing motion (or vice versa)\"; and (4) the Court had significant knowledge of the case \"gleaned from managing the case from start to finish[.]\" App. 19-20.

App. 21. The District Court adopted C&amp;D's recommendation and reduced it to twenty-five hours, explaining that: (1) motions for reconsideration are themselves rarely successful and are granted only under very narrow circumstances, making it relatively easy to respond to them; and (2) C&amp;D's motion for reconsideration was only five pages-accordingly, it could not possibly have reasonably taken seventy-eight hours to prepare a response.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p436\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p436\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This explanation is sufficient to warrant the reduction and meet the \"concise but clear\" standard.

In other words, the Court explained that C&amp;D met its burden by adequately challenging Relator's excessive fee request as it relates to the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, and Relator failed to defend the reasonableness of his request in light of C&amp;D's challenge. That makes sense given that Relator's only response to C&amp;D's challenge was that the parties had to speculate about the relationship between C&amp;D's proposed hours and the real world of work actually done on the case, and that C&amp;D's challenges did not give Relator sufficient notice to rebut the claimed reductions.
