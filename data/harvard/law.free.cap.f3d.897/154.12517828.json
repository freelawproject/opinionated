Because we conclude that Reeves has identified evidence that may show actual innocence that was not presented to the jury, we will vacate and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 25, 2006, a man robbed a City Gas and Diesel convenience store in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and shot and killed the store's clerk. The robbery and shooting were captured on the store's silent, black-and-white surveillance video. The video shows that a single robber entered the store and pointed a gun at the clerk. The clerk tried to close a bulletproof glass window, but the robber's arm blocked the window from closing. The robber fired a shot, causing the clerk to fall back. The clerk got up, made a surrendering gesture, and began emptying the cash register. The clerk then fell to the floor, and the robber jumped over the counter through the open bulletproof glass window and collected the remaining money. He then left the store on foot. A local newspaper published a story about the crime the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A few days after the shooting, Reeves, then eighteen years old, was in jail for conduct unrelated to the robbery. A police officer asked him about the convenience store robbery and Reeves claimed that he had witnessed the crime and identified a robber by name. Reeves was subsequently released and attended his family's Memorial Day cookout a few days later. On May 30, 2006, the police interviewed Reeves, who ultimately admitted that he had lied about witnessing the robbery to gain release and attend his family's cookout. He was charged with and pleaded guilty to hindering apprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around this time, the police had received information about other potential suspects. The same day the robbery occurred, the police were notified that two individuals who had previously been convicted of other crimes-Kai Anderson and Michael Holmes-failed to show up at a work-release center located near the City Gas and Diesel and that Anderson fit the physical description of the robber. On May\n   29, 2006, the police spoke to Danielle Ignazzito-the mother of Anderson's child-who stated that Anderson called her two days after the robbery, telling her he had \"a lot of money\" to give her for outstanding child support. App. 155. She further stated that she received a call from Kenneth Marlow, who told her that Anderson and Holmes had fled the state because police were looking for Anderson for the robbery. On May 31, 2006, Anderson was arrested and admitted escaping the work release center with Holmes, talking to Marlow, and asking Marlow to call Ignazzito. Anderson claimed that a different person committed the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 9, 2006, the police interviewed Marlow. Marlow stated that Anderson told him that he was involved in the robbery and asked Marlow to call Ignazzito for him. A few weeks later, Johnathan Johnston-who had been incarcerated with Anderson-told the police that Anderson confessed to him that he participated in the robbery with Holmes and Holmes's younger brother to obtain money to repay a victim of another robbery Anderson committed. According to Johnston, Anderson provided specific details about the robbery, including that the robber was not supposed to shoot the clerk but that the gun went off, and the clerk fell, got up, then fell again, at which point the robber jumped over the counter to retrieve the money. Johnston also stated that Anderson wanted Johnston's wife to threaten Ignazzito so that she would not talk to the police. Johnston further told the police that Anderson said he had also confessed to Marlow and that Marlow was not supposed to tell Ignazzito about the robbery. On March 9, 2007, the police interviewed Michael Holmes, who admitted to leaving the work release center with Anderson on the day of the robbery but spent the day visiting various people's homes. The record does not indicate why the Anderson leads were not pursued further, but before trial, Reeves's trial counsel was provided with copies of the police reports about Anderson and Holmes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 29, 2009, more than three years after the shooting, Reeves and his then-girlfriend, who was pregnant, were arrested and taken to jail for conduct unrelated to the City Gas and Diesel robbery. Reeves again spoke to police officers and, ten to twelve hours later, confessed to committing the City Gas and Diesel robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At Reeves's trial in 2010, the prosecutor presented the testimony of the officers who had interviewed Reeves, an audio recording of Reeves's confession, and the store surveillance tape of the robbery and shooting, among other evidence. Reeves testified and denied involvement in the robbery, stating that he was experiencing health problems on the day of his July 29, 2009 confession and that detectives told him they would take him to the hospital only if he confessed. He also asserted that detectives promised to release his girlfriend if he confessed and that the police fed him details about the robbery for his taped confession. Reeves further stated that he was in Baltimore at the time of the crime, which caused the prosecution to call a rebuttal witness who testified that while he was in jail with Reeves, Reeves discussed paying a person to say that Reeves was in Baltimore, not Harrisburg, when the robbery occurred. The Kai Anderson evidence was not presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury convicted Reeves of robbery, carrying a firearm without a license, and second degree murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction and sentence on July 1, 2011, and Reeves did not appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 30, 2012, Reeves filed a Post-Conviction Relief Act (\"PCRA\") petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial counsel's failure to present the Kai Anderson evidence, among other alleged deficiencies. On October 10, 2012, the PCRA Court issued a memorandum order notifying Reeves of its intent to dismiss the PCRA petition. Reeves filed objections on October 29, 2012, and the PCRA Court dismissed the petition on November 26, 2012 without a hearing, concluding that trial counsel's failure to present evidence of an alternate suspect did not prejudice Reeves because Reeves confessed to committing the robbery and the store surveillance video corroborated his confession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 7, 2013, the Pennsylvania Superior Court summarily affirmed and adopted the PCRA Court's October 10, 2012 and November 26, 2012 opinions without additional reasoning. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Reeves's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 31, 2014, Reeves filed a federal habeas petition with new counsel, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that Reeves's trial counsel failed to investigate and present certain exculpatory evidence at trial, including evidence suggesting that Anderson and Holmes committed the robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reeves conceded that his federal habeas petition was filed approximately four months late, but asserted that this procedural defect was excusable because he had shown actual innocence. The petition was referred to the Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation. The Magistrate Judge opined that the actual innocence exception requires the petitioner to present new evidence and that the evidence Reeves claims should have been presented was available to him and his trial counsel and thus did not qualify as new evidence. As a result, the Magistrate Judge denied an evidentiary hearing and recommended that the District Court dismiss Reeves's petition as untimely. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation, agreed that the evidence concerning alternative suspects was not new evidence because it was available at trial, concluded that Reeves failed to demonstrate actual innocence sufficient to overcome the statute of limitations, and dismissed Reeves's petition as time-barred. The District Court also denied an evidentiary hearing and a certificate of appealability. Reeves sought a certificate of appealability, which we granted as to, among other things, \"(1) whether the evidence Appellant relied on in the District Court constitutes 'new' evidence\" and \"(2) whether Appellant's evidence satisfied the [actual innocence] standard.\" App. 72-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Reeves asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present\n   at trial evidence of alternative suspects for the shooting, his left-handedness, mental condition at the time of his confession, and history of compulsive lying. He concedes that his petition is late but argues that this exculpatory evidence demonstrates actual innocence and warrants excusing his untimeliness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), state prisoners have one year to file a federal habeas petition, which begins to run from \"the date on which the judgment became final.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).

The Supreme Court opinions addressing the actual innocence gateway do not explicitly define \"new evidence,\" and our sister circuit courts are split on whether the evidence must be newly discovered or whether it is sufficient that the evidence was not presented to the fact-finder at trial. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit-the first to address the issue-held that \"evidence is new only if it was not available at trial and could not have been discovered earlier through the exercise of due diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Amrine v.

Thereafter, the Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and Ninth Circuits concluded otherwise: petitioners can satisfy the actual innocence standard's new evidence requirement by offering \"newly presented\" exculpatory evidence, meaning evidence not presented to the jury at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

Such an inequity could occur under the following circumstances: say that a petitioner was convicted of a murder, and the prosecutor had withheld a videotape depicting a different person committing the crime. Further assume the tape was not revealed until years after the trial. That petitioner could invoke the actual innocence gateway to pursue this\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   due process claim because the evidence was newly discovered. Now, assume the same videotape was produced to trial counsel and was available for use at trial, but counsel did not present it to the jury. Under\n   <em>\n    Amrine\n   </em>\n   , that petitioner would be forced to concede that the evidence was not new because it was available at trial, and he would be foreclosed from seeking relief under the actual innocence gateway. In contrast, in the former scenario, the same evidence, which existed but was unknown to the petitioner, would be deemed new evidence that could support the actual innocence gateway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As the\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   court stated, \"in a case where the underlying constitutional violation claimed is ineffective assistance of counsel premised on a failure to present [such] evidence, a requirement that the new evidence be unknown to the defense at the time of trial would operate as a roadblock to the actual innocence gateway.\" 350 F.3d at 679-80. To overcome this roadblock, we now hold that when a petitioner asserts ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel's failure to discover or present to the fact-finder the very exculpatory evidence that demonstrates his actual innocence, such evidence constitutes new evidence for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   actual innocence gateway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The approach we adopt is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   and the rulings of many of our sister circuits.

The limited approach we adopt to evaluate new evidence to support an actual innocence gateway claim, where that claim is made in pursuit of an underlying claim of ineffective assistance of counsel: (1) ensures that reliable, compelling evidence of innocence will not be rejected on the basis that it should have been discovered or presented by counsel when the very constitutional violation asserted is that counsel failed to take appropriate actions with respect to that specific evidence; and (2) is consistent with the Supreme Court's command that a petitioner will pass through the actual innocence gateway only in rare and extraordinary cases.\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    513 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation and the District Court's decision adopting that report both understandably concluded that exculpatory evidence available to, but not presented by, Reeves's trial counsel-such as the evidence concerning alternative suspects-was not new evidence for purposes of the\n   actual innocence gateway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   They therefore did not proceed to determine the reliability of the evidence or consider whether such evidence, assessed with all the rest of the evidence adduced at trial, would more likely than not convince any reasonable juror not to convict Reeves.

Indeed, the case in support of Reeves's claim of actual innocence is so substantial that a group consisting of retired federal judges, former federal prosecutors, and a former member of the Office of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, has filed an amicus brief on his behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, as I shall discuss, for some inexplicable reason, police simply refused to follow even the most obvious leads that did not confirm their suspicion that Reeves was the killer. They did eventually obtain a confession from Reeves. However,\n   given the totality of the circumstances here, that confession does not negate his claim of actual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Shortly after the May 25th, 2006 robbery of the City Gas &amp; Diesel described in the majority opinion, Jerry Reeves, who was then just eighteen years old, was arrested at a city park in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was not arrested because police suspected him of being involved in the fatal robbery of City Gas &amp; Diesel. Rather, he was arrested for throwing a rock onto a miniature golf course and hitting someone in the leg. While in his jail cell, Reeves was approached by Officer Derek Fenton. Fenton did not approach Reeves based on any suspicion that Reeves was involved in the fatal shooting. Rather, Fenton fancied himself a bit of a sleuth and prided himself on his ability to ferret out information. He testified that he went to Reeves in his jail cell because he, Fenton, believed himself to have \"an excellent rapport with our detective division for the intelligence [he was] able to gather.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Fenton's words, he approached Reeves because: \"You don't know until you try and anyone you encounter on the street, you just strike them a conversation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reeves, who had been adopted out of foster care, and had a history of lying, was eager to get out of jail and go home for a family cookout the next day. Thus, Fenton's instincts appeared to pay off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Reeves told Officer Fenton that he had witnessed the robbery from across the street. He even identified the robber. Reeves told Fenton that the robber was a man named Jermaine Taylor, who was six feet tall with brown skin. Reeves would later testify at his trial that that was a lie. The police had apparently told Reeves that if he \"had info they would let [him] out,\" and Reeves wanted to be released so he could get home in time for the aforementioned cookout.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified: \"I ha[d] not seen my family in a while, so I wanted to see them.\" \"That is why I lied.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As promised, the police released him after the conversation with Officer Fenton and he attended his family's cookout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the meantime, a \"very excited\" Officer Fenton notified the detective bureau.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fenton told Detective Christopher Krokos, the lead detective on the City Gas &amp; Diesel homicide, about Reeves's story. Krokos understandably followed up by contacting Reeves who agreed to come to the police station to be interviewed on May 30th, five days after the robbery. Once more, Reeves repeated that a six-foot-tall, brown-skinned, Black male named Jermaine Taylor had been the robber. This time he added a detail that police knew was not true. Even though the surveillance video depicted the shooter leaving the scene alone and on foot, Reeves stated that he had seen the robber run out of the store and get into a dark-colored Buick with lightly tinted windows and three other passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Detective Krokos would later write in his daily report that Reeves's adoptive father, Terrie Reeves, had informed the detective that Reeves had admitted to lying about witnessing the robbery. Krokos also noted in his report that Reeves's father had cautioned Reeves not to lie again to the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nevertheless, at this point, Krokos confronted Reeves about his untruthfulness. Reeves then revised his story and said that he had heard the shooting but had not actually seen it. To make things worse for Reeves, he admitted that Jermaine Taylor, the man he claimed had been the robber, \"was someone he made up,\" and that \"none of the information he gave [Krokos] was true.\" Reeves's admission that he had been lying clearly gave police reason to suspect that he might have been involved. As a result of that admission, Reeves was charged with hindering apprehension, and the investigation continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Police had already received a number of leads pointing in a different direction that should have, at the very least, cautioned against myopically focusing on Reeves. The very same day of the robbery, staff at the county work-release center in Harrisburg had informed police that two work-release clients-Kai Anderson and Michael Holmes-had escaped the night of the robbery. Anderson fit the description of the robbery suspect, and the work-release staff told police that it was \"very coincidental\" that Anderson and Holmes escaped the same night the robbery occurred. The work-release staff also provided police with photos and information about Anderson to aid in pursuing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, Kimberly Clark, the grandmother of Anderson's child, had independently called police to tell them that Anderson had been making minute-long calls to her daughter, Danielle Ignazzito, several times a day and had been \"act[ing] mysterious[ly].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clark also reported that Anderson had told Ignazzito that \"he's on the run and or is wanted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Then came a third tip about Anderson. Ignazzito, Clark's daughter and the mother of Anderson's son, had initially been \"afraid\" to give police information about Anderson's whereabouts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But on May 29th, just four days after the robbery, Ignazzito told police that Anderson had called her several times to say that he had a lot of money to give her for their child. Ignazzito said she had also spoken to Kenneth Marlow, a friend of Anderson's. Marlow told her that Anderson was in trouble, that Anderson had fled to Ohio with Michael Holmes (who had escaped from the work-release center with Anderson), and that Anderson was being sought by police in connection with the City Gas &amp; Diesel homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Six days after the robbery, police arrested Anderson for escaping from the work-release center. Detective Krokos took the opportunity to interview Anderson, just as he had interviewed Reeves a few days earlier. The interview was unfruitful. Anderson confirmed that he had escaped from the work-release center but denied any involvement in the robbery. He did, however, confirm that he had asked Marlow to call Ignazzito, just as Ignazzito had told Krokos. Yet it is not clear if he also confirmed that he had expressed concern about being connected to the robbery, as Ignazzito had reported. Anderson did admit that he had been \"in the area of Linden St[.] and Walnut St.\"-just a few blocks away from the City Gas &amp; Diesel-on the night of the robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also said that he had encountered the real robber there and actually heard that person confess to the crime. Despite information placing him near the crime scene, and the\n   three independent tips at least suggesting that further investigation into Anderson was warranted, it does not appear that suspicion ever turned from Reeves to Anderson (or to anyone else).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Then came a fourth tip. A week after interviewing Anderson, Detective Krokos interviewed Marlow. Marlow admitted calling Ignazzito on Anderson's behalf, as Ignazzito had reported, and to telling Ignazzito that Anderson was on the run. Marlow also said that Anderson was \"involved in the robbery/homicide at the City Gas &amp; Diesel on State St.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marlow even told Krokos that he heard Anderson admit his involvement. According to Marlow, Anderson had said that he (Anderson) \"got a gun[,] went to the gas station[,] and shot the dude and robbed him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, Detective Krokos now had information implicating Anderson from not two, not three, but\n   <em>\n    four\n   </em>\n   sources-the work-release center staff, Clark, Ignazzito, and now Marlow. Yet, for reasons that are not at all clear on this record, the investigation continued to focus on Reeves. There is more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Approximately a month after the robbery, another witness, Johnathan Johnston, came forward. Johnston and Anderson had known each other for over fifteen years and had reunited at Dauphin County Prison after Anderson's arrest for escaping from the work-release center. Johnston told Krokos that Anderson had admitted involvement in the City Gas &amp; Diesel robbery while they were in the County Prison. Johnston's statement about Anderson's confession should have been taken particularly seriously because, unlike the stories that Reeves gave Krokos, Anderson's purported statements to Johnston included subtle details about the robbery, many of which were unknown to the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Johnston said that Anderson had told him that (1) the shooter needed to be small enough to fit through the gap in the bullet-proof glass window to get to the other side of the counter; (2) the shooter was wearing all black; and (3) the shooter left the store on foot heading west. Johnston's statements to Krokos contained other indicia of reliability: Johnston knew that Anderson had admitted his involvement to Marlow, and that Marlow had repeated Johnston's inculpatory statement to Ignazzito.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Johnston told Krokos something else that the detective inexplicably ignored. According to Johnston, \"[Anderson] knew he could beat [the evidence in the surveillance video] he just need somebody talk to [Ignazzito] so she can, don't say nothing and get scared because the cops already tried to scare her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Johnston said that Anderson had also asked him (Johnston) to\n   have his wife threaten Ignazzito not to give the police any more information about Anderson and the City Gas &amp; Diesel homicide. Finally, Johnston said that Anderson told him that after \"the gun went off[,] the [clerk] fell then got back up and he fell again.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   That detail was visible in surveillance videos of the crime, but had not been made public. Again, for reasons that are not at all apparent on this record, Krokos failed to pursue Anderson as a suspect, and the investigation began to \"stall.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Despite information that directly implicated Anderson and despite the police learning that Anderson knew subtle details about the robbery, the investigation appears to have simply gone dormant for three years. Then, serendipity unfortunately placed Reeves in Detective Krokos's crosshairs yet again. In July of 2009, Reeves, who was now twenty-one years old, had been arrested with his girlfriend after an incident at a bar. Upon learning of Reeves's arrest, and despite all of the evidence pointing toward Anderson, Krokos took the opportunity to speak with Reeves once more about the City Gas &amp; Diesel robbery. At his trial, Reeves testified that he agreed to be interviewed again because he wanted to keep his pregnant girlfriend-with whom he had been arrested-from going to prison and was told that the officers would \"see what they could do\" if he talked to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Reeves offered the same story about having witnessed the crime that he had given Krokos three years earlier. However, this time Reeves said that two men, not one, had robbed the store and that Reeves's own cousin had stood outside as a lookout. Again, Krokos pressed Reeves on his lack of truthfulness. The video showed that only one man had robbed the store. Reeves responded by changing his story yet again. This time, he stated he was not actually across the street when he saw the shooting, but was in a parking lot near the payphone; that he spoke to his cousin about the imminent plan to rob the store; and that it was an unknown male who actually went inside. The questioning continued until Reeves finally asked, \"[W]hat if I was in the store when it happened then what[']s that?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The police report states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Reeves was confronted with the fact that if other people are involved they may talk to us about the incident. He was asked what [are Reeves's cousin and the other individual Reeves named] going to say if asked about this incident? Reeves stated that they will say that it was me who did it.

He began to cry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then Reeves \"confessed.\" He said that he robbed the store because he needed money; that he knew the people in the store because he used to sweep the floors for them; that he got a gun but that he did not know the make or caliber; and that he had been given the gun the same day by someone in Baltimore, Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Reeves then provided details on the robbery, many of which were prompted by leading questions from Krokos and his team. They posed questions to confirm that, like the robber in the video, Reeves had also jumped over the counter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. ...

Okay so what are you wearing when you go in the store?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   A. Black, black pants, black t-shirt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q.

No[.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Despite obtaining what purported to be a confession, Krokos either ignored or did not credit some rather remarkable discrepancies between Reeves's account and the actual facts of the robbery. Reeves said that he struggled with the clerk before the shooting. Yet the surveillance video shows that the clerk and the robber never even touched one another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reeves said he ran\n   towards Boas Street, which is north of the City Gas &amp; Diesel, while the actual robber headed in a westerly direction, according to the surveillance video. Reeves also said he did not remember if he had gotten anything from the store after firing the gun, though the real robber left with a bag full of money from the cash register. Finally, Reeves said the gun he used \"looked like a [ ]9\" millimeter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is the same caliber as a .357, but the actual gun used was a much smaller, .25 caliber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Most significantly, in the video, the shooter appears to be right-handed. He removed the pistol from the front of his pants with his right hand then brandished it in his right hand. He switched the gun to his left hand only after the clerk had been shot and he needed his right hand to finish taking money from the register and from the floor. Once he had collected the money, he used his right hand to jump back over the counter. It is uncontested that Reeves is left-handed, and he has offered affidavits from people who knew him as a child to corroborate that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Of course, police may not have noticed that Reeves was left-handed during the numerous times they interacted with him and it would have been understandable to simply assume, absent a reason to suspect otherwise, that he was right-handed. This is particularly true in light of his confession and his prior interviews, which continuously resulted in what can only be described as false exculpatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   However, as I have already detailed, police had to ignore several leads to even get to the point of Reeves's confession three years after the fatal robbery. These leads included evidence that Anderson had admitted his involvement in the crime to two people; that he had suddenly come into a significant sum of money; that he had escaped from the work-release center on the night of the robbery; and that he had been in the vicinity of the robbery that night. Anderson had also tried to have someone threaten Ignazzito to keep her from saying anything more about his involvement in the robbery, and he had made statements revealing a detail about the robbery not known to the general public. Yet, during the three-year lapse in this investigation, it does not appear that police did anything to pursue the evidence of Anderson's involvement before initiating the discussion with Reeves that ultimately led to the statement that resulted in his conviction for the fatal robbery. Given this record, as I noted at the outset, Reeves's apparent confession does not negate the claim of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence under\n   <em>\n    Schlup v. Delo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Reeves would not be the first person to\n   have falsely confessed to a crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the National Registry of Exonerations, roughly half of individuals who have been exonerated following murder convictions involving DNA evidence in the United States since 1989, made a false confession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Pennsylvania, the rate of false confessions is comparable. Nearly half of individuals who have been exonerated with DNA evidence following a conviction for murder in Pennsylvania had confessed to those murders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In referring to this data, I do not, of course, suggest that police should have completely ignored Reeves's confession. Rather, I refer to it simply to underscore that Reeves's confession does not negate his arguments under\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   . I have already noted that absent the detective's inexplicable failure to pursue leads pointing to Anderson and the equally puzzling three-year gap in this investigation, there would have been no incriminating statement from Reeves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Reeves has now spent eight years in prison for this armed robbery and murder conviction, a fact that will hopefully inform the speed with which subsequent courts address his now likely procedurally-cognizable habeas claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n     513 U.S. 298\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 324,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n     115 S.Ct. 851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n     130 L.Ed.2d 808\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1995).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brief for Former Prosecutors, et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Reeves 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    App. 307.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n     at 306\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n     at 318\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n     at 318\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n     at 307-08\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Officer Fenton, Detective Krokos and Terrie Reeves were not the only individuals to have witnessed Reeves lying.
