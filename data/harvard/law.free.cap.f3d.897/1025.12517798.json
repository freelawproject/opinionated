The Project contemplates a number of land management activities such as logging, thinning, and road construction and maintenance. These activities will take place in areas where two threatened species are present-the Canada lynx\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Of the multiple claims Alliance initially alleged, only two are at issue in this appeal. First, Alliance challenges the Forest Service's decision to approve the Project as arbitrary and capricious because it improperly relied on the Northern Rocky Mountains Lynx Management Direction (\"Lynx Amendment\") in determining the impact of Project activities on lynx and lynx critical habitat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The basis for this argument is that in 2009, after the Forest Service adopted the Lynx Amendment in 2007, the FWS designated large areas of lynx critical habitat on National Forest lands, including the Kootenai National Forest. Despite this new designation of critical habitat, the Forest Service did not request reconsultation on the Lynx Amendment with the FWS under ESA \u00a7 7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). In light of these developments, Alliance argued that the Forest Service could not properly rely on the Lynx Amendment until it reinitiated consultation with the FWS, and the FWS completed reconsultation by issuing a new biological opinion for the Lynx Amendment. We addressed the Forest Service's obligation to reinitiate consultation on the Lynx Amendment in\n   <em>\n    Cottonwood Environmental Law Center v. U.S. Forest Service\n   </em>\n   , where we held that it was required to do so.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233197\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1075/#p1085\">\n    789 F.3d 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1085-88 (9th Cir. 2015),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607146,12607147,12607148,12607149,12607150\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/293/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607148,12607373,12607153,12607154,12607155,12607158,12607159\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/196/213/\">\n    196 L.Ed.2d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While this appeal was pending, the Forest Service reinitiated consultation with the FWS, and after we heard argument, the FWS issued a new biological opinion for the Lynx Amendment, completing the reconsultation process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of these events, Federal Defendants moved to dismiss the lynx ESA \u00a7 7 reconsultation claim on the ground that it is moot. In response, Alliance agreed but requested that we vacate the district court's ruling on this claim. The Intervenor Defendants disagree and urge us to decide Alliance's lynx ESA claim on a theory not advanced by Alliance or the district court. As we explain below, we agree this claim is moot. We therefore dismiss it, and remand to the district court with directions to vacate the part of its summary judgment ruling that addresses this lynx related claim and to dismiss it as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Alliance's second argument on appeal arises under NFMA and relates to the Forest Service's failure to comply with the Motorized Vehicle Access Amendments (\"Access Amendments\"), which set standards for grizzly bear habitat on Forest Service land. Alliance argues that the total road maintenance and construction in an area in which the Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bears are found exceeds the total road mileage \"baseline\" standard established by the Access Amendments and an earlier\n   Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan (\"Recovery Plan\"). Alliance asserts that the Forest Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the Project without complying with this standard. The district court rejected this claim and granted summary judgment to Defendants.\n   <em>\n    All. for the Wild Rockies v. Savage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272547\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/1181/#p1194\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1194 (D. Mont. 2016). We reverse and in so doing, we reject the Federal Defendants' argument that Alliance waived this claim by failing to raise it during the administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Forest Service engaged in a multi-step process before approving the Project. At the outset, after determining that the Project area included lynx and Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bear habitat, the Forest Service prepared a Biological Assessment to evaluate whether the Project would adversely affect those threatened species. The Forest Service concluded that the Project \"may affect, [but] is not likely to adversely affect\" lynx or Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bears, or their respective habitats. The Forest Service transmitted the Biological Assessment to the FWS, and thereafter engaged in informal consultation with the FWS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the meantime, the Forest Service prepared and published a Draft Environmental Impact Statement as required by NEPA, in which it reiterated its conclusion that the Project would not adversely affect the lynx or the Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2035928\">\n    78 Fed.

The FWS agreed with the Biological Assessment's conclusion that the threatened species would not be jeopardized and their habitats would not be adversely affected. The Forest Service subsequently prepared and published a Final Environmental Impact Statement, followed by a Record of Decision approving the Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015741\">\n    79 Fed.

The basis for Alliance's claims under the ESA, NFMA and NEPA was the allegedly erroneous analysis of the effects of the Project on lynx and Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bears and both species' habitats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Kootenai Forest stakeholders\n   coalition and Lincoln County were granted leave to intervene on behalf of the Federal Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alliance filed a motion for summary judgment. Federal Defendants and Intervenor Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed separate cross-motions for summary judgment.

First, it argues that the Forest Service's decision to approve the Project was arbitrary and capricious because it relied on the Lynx Amendment before FWS completed reconsultation as directed by our holding in\n   <em>\n    Cottonwood\n   </em>\n   . Second, Alliance argues that the Forest Service's finding of \"no adverse affect\" on lynx and lynx critical habitat in the Biological Assessment for the Project and FWS's concurrence in that finding before completion of the reconsultation process was arbitrary and capricious. Although Alliance argues that the \"no adverse affect\" finding fails to satisfy the Forest Service's definition of that term, this argument is subsumed within Alliance's ESA \u00a7 7 reconsultation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We agree with the Federal Defendants that Alliance's lynx related claim is properly characterized as a reconsultation claim under ESA \u00a7 7, as Alliance was seeking reconsultation. We further agree with the Federal Defendants and Alliance that this claim is moot as there is no effective relief available to Alliance; it has obtained all that it sought with this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.E.R.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11944550\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/100/1451/#p1458\">\n    100 F.3d at 1458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The baseline road mileage for the Tobacco BORZ polygon was calculated in 2009, and amounts to 1,123.9 linear miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Project contemplates a range of road-related activities within the overlapping area, including constructing new roads, decommissioning both National Forest and \"undetermined\" roads, and assigning road numbers to \"undetermined\" roads to incorporate them into the National Forest road system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an attempt to satisfy the Access Amendments' mandate that road mileage shall not increase beyond the baseline, the Forest Service conducted a survey of existing roads, including \"undetermined\" roads, in the overlapping area. It then concluded that because the Project would not increase the road mileage in the overlapping area beyond the existing condition, it would not increase the linear road mileage within the Tobacco BORZ polygon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In particular, the Forest Service concluded that its construction of 2.2 miles of new road would be more than off-set by decommissioning 0.65 miles of National Forest road and 1.84 miles of \"undetermined\" road, and that the assignment of road numbers to 2.6 miles of \"undetermined\" road would have no effect because those roads were already existing. Based on these calculations, the Forest Service concluded that the net effect of the Project would be a reduction of 0.3 miles of road in the Tobacco BORZ polygon (2.2 - 0.65 - 1.84 = -0.3). The FWS concurred in the Forest Service's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Forest Service's analysis was plainly insufficient. The Access Amendments are unequivocal: the Forest Service must examine whether a proposed project will result in road mileage within the BORZ polygon that exceeds the Access Amendments baseline established for that BORZ polygon. The Forest Service did not conduct that analysis. It instead conducted a survey of the roads existing in the overlapping area at the time of the Project proposal (in 2011), and analyzed the effects of the Project on its own measurement. The Forest Service never assessed the impact of the Project on the 1,123.9 linear mile baseline condition of the Tobacco BORZ polygon. In other words, the Forest Service's \"failure to measure [linear road miles] as defined by the [Access Amendments] renders us unable to determine from the record that the agency is complying with the forest plan standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Hapner v. Tidwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784699\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1239/#p1250\">\n    621 F.3d 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1250 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We recognize that, in some circumstances, it would be possible for the Forest Service to comply with the Access Amendments by measuring the impact of the project on existing roads-but only if the Forest Service additionally determined that the existing roads were included in the Access Amendments baseline measurement. Here, the Forest Service did not determine whether the existing roads it measured (most notably, whether the particular \"undetermined\" roads it measured), were included in the baseline. Absent such a determination, it is impossible to determine whether the Project will result in an increase in road mileage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   An examination of the record in this case reveals the problem with the Forest Service's failure to make this necessary determination. To justify the addition of 2.2 miles of new permanent road, the Forest Service relied on the decommissioning of 1.84 miles of \"undetermined\" road and the decommissioning of 0.65 miles of National Forest road. If, however, as Alliance argues, \"undetermined\" roads were not included in the Access Amendments baseline calculation in the first place, it would be illogical to offset the 2.2 miles of new road construction with the decommissioning of 1.84 miles of \"undetermined\" road.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that we do not know whether the \"undetermined\" roads at issue were included in the Access Amendments baseline calculation is precisely the problem. Without such information, we cannot determine whether the Forest Service complied with the Access Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The district court agreed that it is impossible to determine, with certainty, whether the \"undetermined\" roads at issue were included in the baseline calculation.\n   <em>\n    All. for the Wild Rockies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272547\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/1181/#p1194\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d at 1192-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the district court concluded that some circumstantial evidence supported a finding that such roads were included in the baseline, and therefore granted summary judgment to Defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272547\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/1181/#p1194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272547\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/1181/#p1194\">\n    at 1193-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court's conclusion misses the point.

Therefore, according to Intervenor Defendants it is not mere \"happenstance\" that reconsultation occurred, but rather was the result of Alliance's own actions. This, however, reads \"causation\" too broadly. The FWS \"caused\" the mootness by completing the reconsultation process at the Forest Service's request. Additionally, our holding in\n    <em>\n     Cottonwood\n    </em>\n    that the Forest Service was required to reinitiate consultation with the FWS serves to sever any causal ties to Alliance's own actions.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Helliker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723285\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/871/#p878\">\n     463 F.3d at 879\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that vacatur was appropriate despite the fact that a party had contributed to mootness by lobbying the state legislature to amend the statutory scheme at issue).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Alliance's unopposed motion for judicial notice of the Forest Service's November 2, 2016 letter requesting reconsultation (Dkt.

Second, the definition of \"undetermined\" roads indicates that it is a term that refers to both temporary and permanent roads, but the Access Amendments are concerned solely with permanent roads, which suggests that some (or all) of the undetermined roads would not have been included in the baseline. Third, the definition of \"undetermined\" roads indicates that such roads are included in one database (the SYSTEM linear event in the Infra Travel Routes database), but not in another database (the forest transportation atlas).
