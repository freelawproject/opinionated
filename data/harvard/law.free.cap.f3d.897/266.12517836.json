We must likewise determine whether Plaintiffs' inferences from those facts are reasonable, such that they plausibly state a claim for relief. That is, we must ultimately decide whether the factual allegations and reasonable inferences from Plaintiffs' complaint plausibly allege that BNPP proximately caused the embassy bombings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Regarding BNPP's conduct, Plaintiffs' complaint relies almost entirely on the statement of facts that BNPP filed in district court when it pleaded guilty in 2014 to violating various U.S. sanctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   From\n   these stipulated facts, Plaintiffs allege that BNPP \"move[d] large amounts of money throughout the U.S. financial system on behalf of\" Sudan and al Qaeda \"between 1997 up to and including August 7, 1998,\" the date of the embassy bombings.

In fact, only two stipulated facts repeated in the complaint occurred before the embassy bombings. First, BNPP agreed to become the sole \"correspondent bank\" in Europe for the Sudanese government, meaning nearly all major Sudanese banks would have U.S. dollar accounts with BNPP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82 (quoting Statement of Facts \u00b6 19, J.A. 96).

Neither of these allegations speaks to whether BNPP began moving Sudanese resources through the U.S. financial system prior to the embassy bombings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In alleging that transactions between BNPP and Sudan began in 1997, Plaintiffs also rely on a blatant misinterpretation of BNPP's stipulations. Plaintiffs allege that BNPP admitted that \"in the months and years\" following a 1997 decision to use an unaffiliated bank in the United States (captioned in the statement of facts as \"U.S. Bank 1\") as its \"principal means for clearing U.S. dollar transactions\" with sanctioned Sudanese banks, its personnel were aware that BNPP was circumventing U.S. sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 84;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85 (quoting Statement of Facts \u00b6 31, J.A. 103). But Plaintiffs misrepresent the timeline established by BNPP's stipulations. The decision to use U.S. Bank 1 did not occur in 1997, as Plaintiffs claim. Rather, BNPP admitted that it decided to use U.S. Bank 1 at a meeting that took place shortly after BNPP entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with federal and state authorities regarding BNPP's failure to comply with a federal anti-money-laundering statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Facts \u00b6 29, J.A. 102. BNPP entered into that agreement in September 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28, J.A. 101-02. Establishing that BNPP processed U.S. dollars for Sudan \"in the months and years\" after a decision made in 2004 does nothing to support the existence of banking transactions between BNPP and Sudan\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the 1998 embassy bombing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At bottom, Plaintiffs do not allege facts addressing directly whether BNPP began to process funds for Sudan before the embassy bombings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That said, Plaintiffs' failure to allege transactions between BNPP and Sudan\n   before the bombings does not end our inquiry.

In other words, the Court reasoned\n   <em>\n    as a general matter\n   </em>\n   that a statute provides for aiding and abetting liability only if expressly set out by Congress. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Central Bank\n   </em>\n   relied on a principle of statutory interpretation that applies equally with respect to implied and express causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Courts have also sometimes premised aiding and abetting liability under the ATA on legislative history that purportedly expresses Congress's \"intent to cut off the flow of money to terrorists at every point along the causal chain of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    Boim I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433620\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/1000/#p1015\">\n    291 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1021 (citing S.

In particular, it is unclear whether the complaint alleges only that BNPP is liable as a primary violator of \u00a7 2333 or if it also alleges BNPP is liable as an aider and abettor of an ATA violation. While Plaintiffs use the language of aiding and abetting liability, they never actually list a claim for relief premised on civil aiding and abetting under \u00a7 2333. Nevertheless, because the parties spent much of their briefing debating the availability of aiding and abetting liability under \u00a7 2333, the district court assumed that Plaintiffs asserted those claims.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268049\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/85/#p100\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs continue to press for aiding and abetting liability.

If civil conspiracy were available, BNPP would be liable if (1) BNPP entered into an \"agreement\" with Sudan and al Qaeda; (2) BNPP participated in an \"unlawful act, or a lawful act in an unlawful manner\"; (3) Plaintiffs' injuries were caused by an \"unlawful overt act performed by one of the parties to the agreement\"; and (4) the \"overt act was done pursuant to and in furtherance of the common scheme.\"\n    <em>\n     Halberstam v.
