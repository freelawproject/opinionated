The district court, applying the four-year limitations period of what it determined to be the\n   most closely analogous state statute, found that Plaintiff Jacob McGreevey's \u00a7 303(c) claim was time-barred and dismissed the case. McGreevey appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After carefully considering the parties' briefs, and with the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that the federal catchall statute of limitations in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) applies to private suits alleging violations of \u00a7 303(c) of the SCRA. Because that provision, like the state statute relied upon by the district court, also specifies a four-year limitations period, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2006 McGreevey, a United States Marine, refinanced the mortgage on his home in Vancouver, Washington, with Defendant PHH Mortgage Corporation (PHH Mortgage). By January 16, 2009, PHH Mortgage and Defendant Northwest Trustee Services, Inc. (Northwest)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   had initiated foreclosure proceedings. Four months later, on May 18, 2009, the Marines recalled McGreevey to active service in Iraq. On July 21, 2010, after McGreevey completed his service in Iraq, the Marines released him from military duty. Following his release, McGreevey promptly advised Defendants of his military service and requested an opportunity to refinance his mortgage. Defendants ignored his request and proceeded with a foreclosure sale of McGreevey's home on August 20, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Almost six years after the sale, McGreevey filed suit against Defendants in district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He alleged that Defendants had violated \u00a7 303(c) of the SCRA, which at that time prohibited the \"sale, foreclosure, or seizure of property\" for a breach of a mortgage obligation if \"made during, or within nine months after, the period of the servicemember's military service\" unless such sale, foreclosure, or seizure occurred by court order or under waiver by the servicemember of his SCRA rights.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203953\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended complaint sought an award of money damages, costs, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss McGreevey's complaint as time-barred. Noting that the SCRA does not contain a statute of limitations, Defendants urged the district court to apply the limitations period of the closest state-law analogue to the SCRA. Defendants advanced as analogous two Washington statutes-the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 19.86 (four-year limitations period), and the Deeds of Trust Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 61.24 (two-year limitations period). Additionally, Defendants identified the Fair\n   Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1692p, as a federal statute with a one-year limitations period that could apply. If the district court applied the limitations period from any of these statutes, dismissal would be required because-even after taking into account that the period was tolled for 404 days for McGreevey's active duty service pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203936\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) -more than four years passed from the accrual of McGreevey's claim until the filing of McGreevey's complaint in May 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, McGreevey agreed that the district judge should adopt a limitations period from the statute most analogous to the SCRA, but he argued that other statutes were better candidates. He contended that the district court need not look to a state statute, asserting that the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. ch. 43, was most analogous. If accepted, that approach would have solved McGreevey's untimeliness problem because the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   explicitly provided that \"there shall be no limit on the period for filing\" a USERRA claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204327\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As an alternative, McGreevey suggested the court apply Washington's six-year statute of limitations for breach of contract claims,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%204.16.040\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 4.16.040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In their reply, Defendants argued that neither Washington's breach of contract law nor the USERRA was analogous, noting that McGreevey was not suing for breach of contract and that the USERRA was enacted for a purpose entirely different from that of the SCRA. And as an alternative argument, Defendants for the first time raised\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) in support of their motion. By enacting \u00a7 1658(a), Congress established a four-year limitations period for claims arising from any federal statute enacted after December 1, 1990, that fails to delineate a limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss, rejecting McGreevey's arguments and applying the four-year statute of limitations contained in the Washington CPA. In doing so, the district court did not comment on the applicability of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). On appeal, McGreevey maintains that the district court erred in applying the four-year limitations period of the Washington CPA instead of USERRA or Washington's limitations period for breach of contract claims. Defendants' primary argument on appeal is that McGreevey's SCRA claim is time-barred under the catchall four-year limitations period of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Traditionally, when a federal statute creating a right of action did not include a limitations period, courts would apply the limitations period of the \"closest state analogue.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The district court sought such an analogue here and ultimately applied the four-year limitations period of the Washington CPA.
