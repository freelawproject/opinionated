Investment Group, LLC owns several parcels of property in Glendale,\n   Colorado. The City of Glendale adopted a resolution declaring several of M.A.K.'s parcels \"blighted\" under state law. Glendale never notified M.A.K. of its resolution or the legal consequences flowing from it. In fact, the blight resolution began a seven-year window in which the City could begin condemnation proceedings against M.A.K.'s property. It also started the clock on a thirty-day window in which M.A.K. had a right to seek judicial review of the blight resolution under state law. Receiving no notice, M.A.K. did not timely seek review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   M.A.K. argues Colorado's Urban Renewal statute-both on its face and as-applied to M.A.K.-violates due process because it does not require municipalities to notify property owners about (1) an adverse blight determination, or (2) the thirty days owners have to seek review. We conclude M.A.K.'s allegations state a claim that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to M.A.K. because M.A.K. did not receive notice that Glendale found its property blighted. Since we hold the statute violated due process as applied to M.A.K., we need not decide whether the statute is unconstitutional on its face.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for M.A.K.'s second argument, we hold that due process did not require Glendale to inform M.A.K. about the thirty-day review window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by describing the relevant statutory framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Colorado's urban renewal statute\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Colorado's Urban Renewal statute declares eliminating \"blighted\" areas to be a public use for which municipalities can use their power of eminent domain.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031-25-102\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 31-25-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The law enables municipalities to eventually transfer blighted private property to other private parties or public entities for redevelopment. After a municipality determines an area is blighted, it can begin condemnation proceedings against the blighted property at any time for seven years following the blight determination. \u00a7 31-25-105.5(2)(a)(I). The blight determination is therefore not a complete taking in the constitutional sense, but it slates the property for possible condemnation in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To label a property blighted, municipalities must meet certain statutory requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Municipalities must find that the property meets \"at least five\" of the eleven statutory blight factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31-25-105.5(5)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those findings must be made\n   at a public hearing. \u00a7 31-25-107(1)(a), (3)(a). And the findings must be based on \"reasonably current information obtained at the time the blight determination is made.\" \u00a7 31-25-105.5(2)(a)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Act allows property owners to challenge a city's blight determination. \"Any owner of property located within the urban renewal area may challenge the determination of blight made by the governing body ... by filing, not later than thirty days after the date the determination of blight is made, a civil action in district court for the county in which the property is located ....\" \u00a7 31-25-105.5(2)(b). The civil action is \"for judicial review of the exercise of discretion on the part of the governing body in making the determination of blight,\" and \"the governing body shall have the burden of proving that, in making its determination of blight, it has neither exceeded its jurisdiction nor abused its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031-25-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As for notice, the statute requires a city to notify property owners in two instances: (1) when the city begins a study regarding blight involving their properties, and (2) when the city will hold a hearing regarding its intention to acquire property for public or private redevelopment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31-25-107(1)(b), (3)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But when it comes to the\n   <em>\n    results\n   </em>\n   of these blight hearings, the notice requirement depends on whether the city found the property at issue blighted or not. Strangely enough, Colorado's statute requires a city to mail notice to those whose property it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find blighted, but does not require a city to notify those whose property it\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   find blighted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31-25-107(1)(b). The statute also takes care to note that \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, any determination made by the governing body ... shall be deemed a legislative determination and shall not be deemed a quasi-judicial determination.\" \u00a7 31-25-105.5(2)(c). This has consequences we will discuss below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The blight determination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to its complaint, M.A.K. owns several parcels of real property in Glendale, Colorado. Seeking to redevelop its property, M.A.K. began working with the city of Glendale on a private redevelopment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2013, the City of Glendale embarked on a \"Riverwalk Urban Renewal Plan.\" The Plan entailed declaring a group of properties blighted under the Urban Renewal Law, allowing the City to condemn the properties and commence their private redevelopment. M.A.K.'s property was among the properties affected by the Plan. In April of the same year, Glendale notified M.A.K. it was commencing a study on whether an area that included M.A.K.'s property was blighted. The notice explained that Glendale would hold a hearing on May 7, 2013 to approve the Riverwalk Urban Renewal Plan. According to M.A.K.'s complaint, the notice did not explain\n   that the hearing related to the possibility of future condemnation proceedings against M.A.K.'s property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After receiving this letter, M.A.K. claims one of its principals met with a representative of Glendale and asked what \"blight\" meant and whether M.A.K. should take any action in response. The representative answered that M.A.K. \"did not need to worry about the notice.\" App. 15. Having worked with the City representative before, M.A.K. relied on his statement and did not attend the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the May 7 hearing, Glendale found M.A.K.'s property blighted pursuant to the statutory factors. Glendale did not notify M.A.K. of this determination. Nor did Glendale inform M.A.K. of the thirty-day window to challenge it in state court. For that reason, M.A.K. claims it did not learn about the blight determination until November 2013, when it engaged a real estate attorney to assist in M.A.K.'s private redevelopment of its property. By that time, the thirty-day window to challenge the determination had closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. The suit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   M.A.K. brought suit against Glendale under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , challenging Colorado's Urban Renewal statute both facially and as applied to its property. M.A.K. alleged the statute violated both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court granted Glendale's motion to dismiss both claims. In the district court's view, M.A.K. did not have due process rights at stake because the blight determination was legislative in nature. M.A.K.'s equal protection claim, on the other hand, failed because the statute did not treat M.A.K. differently from others similarly situated. M.A.K. appealed only the court's dismissal of its procedural due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   M.A.K. argues Colorado's Urban Renewal Statute fails due process as applied to M.A.K. because (1) it does not provide for adequate notice when a city finds a landowner's property blighted, (2) it does not provide for notice of the thirty-day review period, and (3) M.A.K. in fact did not know about the blight determination or the right of review within thirty days. We agree only with its first proposition: the city's failure to notify M.A.K. of the blight determination violated M.A.K.'s right to due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We \"review the grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Christy Sports, LLC v.

In doing so, we \"must accept all the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint as true and must construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Albers v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs of Jefferson Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292410\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/697/#p700\">\n    771 F.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 700 (10th Cir. 2014). A district court must deny a motion to dismiss if the complaint provides \"facts sufficient to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292410\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/697/#p700\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since M.A.K. claims the statute's application in this case violated its procedural due process rights, we undertake the familiar \"two-step inquiry\" for procedural due process cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pater v. City of Casper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3416468\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1290/#p1293\">\n    646 F.3d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1293 (10th Cir. 2011). First, \"we ask whether the City's actions deprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected property interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3416468\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1290/#p1293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"If plaintiffs can satisfy this requirement, we\n   then consider whether they were afforded the appropriate level of process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3416468\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1290/#p1293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"In so doing, we note the procedural due process analysis is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances, but rather is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3416468\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1290/#p1293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3416468\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1290/#p1293\">\n    at 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, we must answer two questions in this case. First, does M.A.K. have a constitutionally protected property interest at stake? Second, if it does, did Glendale provide M.A.K. sufficient notice that its property interests were in danger? We take each question in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Protected property interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The blight determination does not effect a complete taking of M.A.K.'s property. As explained above, it is only the first step toward condemnation. The parties therefore debate whether M.A.K. has a protected property interest at stake in this case at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   M.A.K. contends it has a property interest in the statutory right to seek review within thirty days of the blight finding. We agree with M.A.K. that it has a protected property right in the statutory cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Colorado's statute gives property owners a right to \"judicial review of the exercise of discretion on the part of the governing body in making the determination of blight.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031-25-105.5\">\n    Colo.

The opportunity for review is not, then, an empty formality: if the record clearly showed Glendale abused its discretion, M.A.K. would be\n   <em>\n    entitled\n   </em>\n   to a favorable outcome. Under the Supreme Court's case law, that sort of entitlement is a property right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Glendale ignores\n   <em>\n    Olim\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Crown Point\n   </em>\n   's reasoning and argues instead that M.A.K. cannot have a property interest in judicial review because the blight determination does not adversely affect its property value. Indeed, at oral argument, Glendale counter-intuitively suggested the blight determination's effect on property values is so speculative that it might\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   , not decrease M.A.K.'s property values. That being so, Glendale claims that even if the city council\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   abused its discretion and M.A.K.\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   entitled to a favorable outcome at the review proceeding, M.A.K. has no protected property right because its property values would not necessarily be harmed in the real world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We disagree with this contention. First of all, we are not convinced the blight determination's effects do not burden M.A.K.'s real property interests. M.A.K. claims the blight determination depreciates its property values and limits its ability to sell its properties or obtain a mortgage. And M.A.K. would have to bear that burden for\n   <em>\n    up to seven years\n   </em>\n   .

M.A.K. has a procedural property interest in obtaining review simply because the statute provides an entitlement to reversal for abuse of discretion. That is all.

In contemporary terms this means notice had to be mailed, emailed, or personally served. Without the minimal step of actual notice, M.A.K. was left unaware of the potentially looming condemnation action, and so had little reason to even investigate whether it could challenge the blight determination that authorizes that action. As a consequence, M.A.K. lost its statutory right to review within thirty days. In other words, M.A.K.'s ability to preserve its\n   <em>\n    property right\n   </em>\n   in the\n   <em>\n    statutory right of review\n   </em>\n   depended on its knowledge of the simple fact the blight finding\n   <em>\n    existed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   When in the absence of notice, property owners are likely to lose a property right-in a cause of action or otherwise-the\n   <em>\n    Mullane\n   </em>\n   rule applies. At that point, the state must take reasonable steps to provide enough notice for reasonable persons to realize they must investigate possible remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Glendale argues property owners cannot sit on their rights and that they have some duty of self-preservation to stay abreast of legislative pronouncements. But while it is true M.A.K. could have attended the City's hearing and learned of the blight resolution, \"a party's ability to take steps to safeguard its interests does not relieve the State of its constitutional obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mennonite Bd. of Missions v.

When a published law provides a certain amount of time for a person to take action in order to protect his or her property rights, the government generally does not have to notify that person about the deadline. But when it is \"only after [government] actions take place that the time period begins to run,\" the government must provide notice.\n   <em>\n    Tulsa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13731\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/478/#p485\">\n    485 U.S. at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13731\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/478/#p485\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, if the clock only begins to tick after the government takes a formal action, the government must let the affected person know about what it did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   To illustrate, consider the difference between a statute of limitations and the amount of time a party has to answer a complaint under Rule 12. Both are published, but both are not self-executing. A statute of limitations is self-executing because a party need not commence a proceeding to start the clock. Publication of the statute is therefore sufficient notice for persons with claims to find out how long they have to bring suit. But the published rule regarding how long one has to answer a complaint is not sufficient to notify a person\n   who does not know he or she has been sued. The rule is not self-executing because an action must be taken before the clock starts to tick. Sure, a person can be aware in general that if he is sued, he has a certain amount of time to respond. But that person is not required to check court records to make sure he has not been sued. Due process requires the defendant be notified of a pending action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Here, Glendale took a formal action: it found M.A.K.'s property blighted. M.A.K. was not aware of that action. To be sure, we can impute to M.A.K. knowledge that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   its property were ever to be found blighted, it would have thirty days to challenge that determination. But it never found out its property was so designated-not until several months after the fact, at least. Our usual rule that citizens are presumptively charged with knowledge of the law therefore does not derail our conclusion that, in the circumstances of this case, Glendale had to notify M.A.K. about the blight determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Other opportunities for review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, Glendale insists that Colorado's statute allows M.A.K. to challenge the original blight determination if and when a condemnation proceeding begins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Glendale bases this assertion on Colorado's provisions governing condemnations for blight, which require \"the condemning entity to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the taking of the property is necessary for the eradication of blight.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-1-101\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 38-1-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b). Glendale thus argues no harm was done when M.A.K. lost its statutory right to review the blight determination within thirty days, because the state provides an opportunity to bring the same claim during a condemnation proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We disagree that the condemnation proceeding adequately compensates M.A.K. for the loss of its statutory right to review of the blight determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First of all, Glendale might\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   bring a condemnation proceeding. An opportunity for review that may never come cannot replace a statutory\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, a\n   <em>\n    cause of action\n   </em>\n   to have the blight determination\n   <em>\n    reversed\n   </em>\n   is not the same thing as\n   <em>\n    being able to argue\n   </em>\n   the property is not blighted in a future condemnation action. The first is a cause of action to reverse an erroneous blight determination and so prevent a condemnation proceeding from commencing in the first place. The second is no cause of action at all. It is only a possible argument to be made in the midst of a condemnation proceeding that is\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   underway-a last-ditch defense, instead of a nip in the bud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Third, at the most basic level, a proceeding for review of the blight determination and a condemnation proceeding are not equivalent because a blight determination and a condemnation are different things in themselves. True, the blight determination is a step leading toward condemnation. But the blight determination also stands alone. It exists for seven years even if the city\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   brings a condemnation proceeding. And the burdens it creates-uncertainty for property owners chief among them-are separate from the burdens a condemnation creates. For that reason, a condemnation proceeding, no matter how thorough, cannot clean up for a lost opportunity to challenge the blight determination that came before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In sum, even if property owners can argue their property is not blighted if and when condemnation proceedings begin, that does not preserve the cause of action for immediate review of the blight determination itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Notice of the right of review within 30 days\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As for specific notice of the thirty-day time frame in which to seek review, we agree with Glendale that due process did not require it. If M.A.K. had been notified of the blight finding, it would have been up to M.A.K. to find out what remedies were available under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Supreme Court explained this principle in\n   <em>\n    City of West Covina v. Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076460\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/234/\">\n    525 U.S. 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076460\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/234/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076460\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/234/\">\n    142 L.Ed.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999).

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Colorado's statute gave M.A.K. a right to seek review of a blight determination for abuse of discretion. At the same time, it allowed Glendale to find M.A.K.'s property blighted without notifying M.A.K. This was so even though the blight determination started the clock on the thirty days M.A.K. had to seek review and commenced a seven-year period during which Glendale could bring condemnation proceedings against the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accepting M.A.K.'s allegations as true, we hold M.A.K. has a protected property interest in the statutory cause of action for abuse-of-discretion review. Because Glendale's failure to notify M.A.K. of the blight determination effectively deprived M.A.K. of this right, Glendale violated M.A.K.'s right to due process. Had M.A.K. learned about the blight determination, M.A.K. could have found out for itself what remedies it could pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   What the Due Process Clause required here was not so much to ask-merely a letter, an envelope, and a stamp. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that notice by mail is practically \"a minimum constitutional precondition to a proceeding which will adversely affect the liberty or property interests of any party.\"\n   <em>\n    Mennonite Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194044\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/791/#p799\">\n    462 U.S. at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6125771,6194044\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/103/2706/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We take care to note the limits of our holding, however. This is not a case in which the property owner attended the blight hearing and learned of the determination there.

We only hold that where, as alleged here, a property owner does not otherwise learn about the blight determination, it violates due process for a City not to send direct notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's grant of the motion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    A facial challenge \"is not limited to [a] plaintiff['s] particular case,\"\n    <em>\n     John Doe No. 1 v.
