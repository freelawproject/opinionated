They allege, among other things, that the Commission erred in assessing the project's environmental impacts, unreasonably relied on expert opinions concerning the project's safety, and failed to recognize the bias of a third-party contractor.

In light of increasing demand for natural gas in the New England area, Algonquin planned several discrete projects to increase the capacity of its pipeline system. One of those projects, the Algonquin Incremental Market Project (AIM Project), is the subject of the petitions for review we consider in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In February 2014, Algonquin applied to the Commission for authorization to construct the AIM Project. The proposal sought to replace 29.2 miles of existing pipeline with larger diameter pipe, construct 8.2 miles of new pipeline, build three new meter stations, and modify various other compressor and meter stations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Of particular relevance, the AIM project included a proposal to construct roughly five miles of new pipeline known as the West Roxbury Lateral, which would run\n   adjacent to an active quarry outside of Boston. The project also sought to install larger-diameter replacement pipeline next to the Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear facility in Westchester County, New York. Overall, the AIM Project would give Algonquin an additional 342,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas transport capacity from Ramapo, New York, to various cities in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to the AIM Project, Algonquin is pursuing two other upgrades to its northeast pipeline system. Those ventures are known as the Atlantic Bridge Project and the Access Northeast Project. In the Atlantic Bridge Project, Algonquin seeks to create 132,705 dekatherms per day of capacity from New Jersey and New York to various points on its system, by replacing several miles of pipeline with larger-diameter pipes and constructing or modifying a number of compressor and meter stations. Algonquin applied for a Section 7 certificate for Atlantic Bridge in October 2015, and the Commission granted the certificate in January 2017.

In the Access Northeast Project, Algonquin planned to install pipeline and modify facilities in order to provide natural gas to electric power plants in New England. Pre-filing review for the Access Northeast Project began in November 2015, but Algonquin withdrew the pre-filing application in June 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 23, 2015, the Commission issued its final environmental impact statement under NEPA for the AIM Project. On March 3, 2015, after receiving comments on the environmental impact statement, the Commission issued an order granting Algonquin a Section 7 certificate to construct and operate the AIM Project.

The City of Boston Delegation alleged that the Commission failed to give adequate consideration to the safety risks of running the West Roxbury Lateral adjacent to an active quarry. The Town of Dedham, Massachusetts, and Riverkeeper, Inc., argued in part that the Commission impermissibly segmented its NEPA review by failing to consider Algonquin's three planned projects together in a single environmental impact statement. Additionally, a coalition of environmental groups, community organizations, and individuals alleged, among other claims, that the Commission insufficiently examined the cumulative impact of the Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast projects, and failed adequately to consider safety issues raised by the pipeline's proximity to the Indian Point nuclear facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Commission denied the parties' requests for rehearing and dismissed their requests for a stay.

A number of parties now seek review in this court of the Commission's grant of a Section 7 certificate for the AIM Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In particular, we consider three petitions for review, brought by (i) the City of Boston Delegation; (ii) the Town of Dedham, Massachusetts; and (iii) Riverkeeper, Inc., along with a coalition of environmental groups, community organizations, and individuals. The Delegation, in its own briefing, raises challenges focused on the West Roxbury Lateral. The Town of Dedham, together with Riverkeeper, Inc., and the coalition, jointly present a separate set of arguments addressing, among other\n   things, the cumulative environmental impacts of Algonquin's three projects and the safety concerns raised by the AIM Project's proximity to the Indian Point nuclear facility. Algonquin, as intervenor, has submitted a brief supporting the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before reaching the merits of petitioners' claims, we must first examine their standing to sue. Although the Commission did not initially contest the petitioners' standing, Algonquin raised the issue as intervenor. And because we have an independent obligation to assure ourselves of our jurisdiction, we asked for supplemental briefing addressing the question of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To establish standing under Article III of the Constitution, petitioners must demonstrate (i) an injury in fact, (ii) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and (iii) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). We hold that the City of Boston Delegation lacks standing because it has failed to demonstrate an injury in fact. We therefore dismiss the Delegation's petition for review for lack of jurisdiction without reaching the merits of the Delegation's arguments. We conclude that the remaining petitioners have adequately demonstrated standing and thus reach the merits of their petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The City of Boston Delegation consists of nine elected representatives from Boston, including the Mayor, a congressman, five city councilors, a state senator, and a state representative. The Delegation's claim of injury for standing purposes rests on the West Roxbury Lateral's allegedly adverse safety, health, and environmental effects on the City. The Delegation stakes its standing primarily on the Mayor's participation in the petition. The Delegation's theory is that, because the Mayor regularly initiates litigation on behalf of the City, the Mayor's involvement in the petition effectively makes the City of Boston a party. As a result, the Delegation asserts, the harms to the City caused by the pipeline can supply the requisite injury in fact for purposes of establishing the Delegation's standing. We are unpersuaded by the Delegation's theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While the City of Boston could in theory bring an action, the Mayor does not act as the City when he files a lawsuit in his own name. Under Massachusetts law, the City of Boston \"may in its corporate capacity sue and be sued by its name.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%2040%2C%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). And in practice, the City does in fact sue in its own name.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Boston v. Boston Police Superior Officers Fed'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223936\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/210/\">\n    466 Mass. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20N.E.2d%20693\">\n    993 N.E.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The city code specifies the process by which a lawsuit is initiated on behalf of the City of Boston: the City's Corporation Counsel \"shall, subject to the direction of the Mayor, institute any suit or proceeding in behalf of the City which he shall deem the interest of the City requires.\" City of Boston Mun. Code, Ordinance \u00a7 5-8.1. That process did not take place here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Delegation reads the ordinance to encompass any lawsuit determined by the\n   <em>\n    Mayor\n   </em>\n   to be in the City's interest, thus affording the Mayor discretion to sue on behalf of the City. The ordinance, though, does not support that reading. Rather, the ordinance requires the\n   <em>\n    Corporation Counsel\n   </em>\n   to institute suit (subject to the Mayor's direction), and in doing so, the\n   <em>\n    Corporation Counsel\n   </em>\n   must \"deem the interest of the City requires\" bringing the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There is no indication here that the Mayor directed the Corporation Counsel to file this petition, or that the Corporation Counsel made the requisite determination\n   that \"the interest of the City require[d]\" seeking review of the Commission's order. The ordinance's procedure for initiating suit on behalf of the City thus was not followed. And the Mayor, per the terms of the ordinance, does not inherently litigate on behalf of the City whenever he appears in his own name, at least without the necessary determination by the Corporation Counsel. We are not at liberty to disregard the city code's prescribed process by which an action is brought in the City's name. We therefore cannot treat the City as a de facto petitioner merely by virtue of the Mayor's participation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Delegation has pointed us to no cases supporting a contrary conclusion. For instance, the Delegation cites\n   <em>\n    RicMer Properties v. Board of Health of Revere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1508520\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/59/173/\">\n    59 Mass.App.Ct. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=794%20N.E.2d%201236\">\n    794 N.E.2d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), for the proposition a municipality in Massachusetts can represent \"the public interest\" by asserting parens patriae standing on behalf of the municipality's residents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=794%20N.E.2d%201236\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=794%20N.E.2d%201236\">\n    at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    RicMer\n   </em>\n   does not help the Delegation.

The other cases referenced by the Delegation likewise do not support the proposition that a mayor, in her own name, can assert a city's parens patriae interest even if the city itself is not a party: those cases involved actions brought by a municipality itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Sudbury v.

In these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the Delegation, purely by virtue of the Mayor's participation, is acting on behalf of the City in pursuing the petition for review. It follows that the Delegation cannot assert injuries to the City itself (or assert the City's parens patriae interest in its residents) as the basis of the Delegation's standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maiden Creek Assocs., L.P. v.

And because the City itself is not a party, we have no occasion to consider whether the City, if it were a party, could establish standing based on a parens patriae theory.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Olmsted v.

The Delegation's attempts to do so in passing, by briefly asserting that certain of its members individually have standing, are inadequate. For instance, the Delegation observes, without any elaboration, that two of its members reside in the West Roxbury neighborhood and that the Mayor has an interest in the neighborhood's safety as the city's chief executive. Those \"[b]are allegations\" are insufficient to demonstrate a \"substantial probability\" that the Delegation has sustained an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

The Commission's safety finding meets the substantial-evidence threshold.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Commission of course can rely on expert reports in its decisions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Murray Energy Corp. v. FERC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553617,4078278\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/231/\">\n     629 F.3d 231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 238 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Here, it relied on two: Entergy's safety evaluation and NRC's confirming analysis. The Commission discussed those evaluations in its environmental impact statement, its certificate order, and its rehearing order, in support of its finding that the \"AIM Project can safely operate near Indian Point.\" Rehearing Order \u00b6 201. Those expert opinions qualify as substantial evidence supporting the Commission's safety finding, and the Commission acted well within its discretion in relying on them to grant Algonquin's certificate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Petitioners contend that the Commission erred in accepting Entergy's and NRC's safety findings rather than those of competing expert analyses that found safety risks to Indian Point from the AIM Project. Specifically, petitioners and their experts fault Entergy and NRC for assuming that gas flow could be terminated within three minutes of a pipeline rupture, and estimating a blast radius based on that assumption. But whereas Entergy's analysis assumed a three-minute response time, NRC directly responded to the opposing experts' concerns about that assumption; after conducting an analysis that assumed a \"catastrophic failure\" and continuous gas flow for one hour, NRC still concluded that the pipeline posed no safety threat. AIM Project Final Environmental Impact Statement at 4-278. In ratifying NRC's \"extensive formal responses\" to petitioners' experts, the Commission found NRC's assumptions reasonable and its analysis persuasive. Rehearing Order \u00b6 201.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In general, we defer to the Commission's \"resolution of factual disputes between expert witnesses,\" and accept its decision \"to credit\" one expert's \"conclusions\" over another expert's if its choice is \"reasonable.\"\n    <em>\n     Murray Energy Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553617,4078278\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/231/\">\n     629 F.3d at 239\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted). Here, the Commission was faced with Entergy and NRC's analyses, on one hand, and critiques from two independent experts, on the other. It permissibly decided to credit the NRC's expert conclusions, and to accept that NRC's \"extensive formal responses\" had adequately addressed the opposing experts' concerns. Rehearing Order \u00b6 201.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The expert conclusion adopted by the Commission, moreover, was that of another federal agency. Agencies can be expected to \"respect [the] views of such other agencies as to those problems\" for which those \"other agencies are more directly responsible and more competent.\"\n    <em>\n     City of Pittsburgh v.

Cir. 1956). So, for instance, we sustained an agency's decision against undertaking a rulemaking in reliance on the opinion of \"other government agencies and non-governmental expert organizations with specific expertise\" on the matter.\n    <em>\n     EMR Network v.

Cir. 2016). The Commission determined that it was \"satisfied as to [NRC's] competence and the validity of their basic data and analysis,\" Rehearing Order \u00b6 203, and chose to credit NRC's safety conclusions. We see no basis to reject the Commission's decision to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    C.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    As their final ground for overturning the Commission's grant of a Section 7 certificate, petitioners contend that a third-party contractor that the Commission relied on to prepare the environmental impact statement-Natural Resource Group-had a conflict of interest. Petitioners did not present that objection to the agency. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider the issue unless we conclude that \"there is reasonable ground for [petitioners'] failure\" to raise the argument on rehearing before the agency. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In a case involving an analogous exhaustion provision and a conflict-of-interest claim, we held that a petitioner had demonstrated a \"reasonable ground\" to excuse the lack of exhaustion because the petitioner \"had no reason during the [environmental review] process to suspect the alleged defects in the selection and supervision of [the contractor].\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <em>\n     Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc.\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     CARE\n    </em>\n    )\n    <em>\n     v.

We therefore have jurisdiction to consider the merits of petitioners' conflict-of-interest claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    We reject petitioners' argument on the merits, however. Petitioners' claim of a conflict of interest rests on an allegation that Natural Resource Group was also hired by a consortium that included Algonquin's parent company to perform public-affairs work in connection with a separate project. That ostensible conflict did not arise until the environmental-review process for the AIM Project was substantially underway. Neither the Commission nor Natural Resource Group failed to follow the conflicts disclosure rules in place at the time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. Energy Reg. Comm'n,\n    <em>\n     Handbook for Using Third-Party Contractors to Prepare Envtl. Documents for Nat. Gas\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Facilities &amp; Hydropower Projects\n    </em>\n    at 4-1 to 4-6 (Dec. 2014). In addition, the Commission later once again hired the Natural Resource Group to assist with the environmental statement for the Atlantic Bridge Project. In doing so, the Commission found that the supposed conflict identified by petitioners here was not a \"disqualifying conflict\" under the Commission's rules. Letter from Chairman Norman Bay to Sen. Elizabeth Warren 2, FERC Docket No. CP16-9 (July 19, 2016). Petitioners offer no basis for disagreeing with that conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Finally, even if petitioners had identified an actual conflict of interest, it would afford a ground for invalidating the environmental impact statement only if it rose to the level of \"compromis[ing] the objectivity and integrity of the NEPA process.\"\n    <em>\n     CARE\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720594,9061907\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/678/\">\n     355 F.3d at 686-87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (formatting modified).
