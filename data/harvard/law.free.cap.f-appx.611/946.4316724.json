He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress guns that were found during an inventory search of the rental car that he was driving after he and his passenger were arrested during a traffic stop. Mr. Joseph bases his argument on two grounds: (1) that the traffic stop was pre-textual, and therefore, violated his Fourth Amendment rights; and (2) that the inventory search was illegal because the officers failed to follow established procedures pri- or to searching the rental car.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Mr. Joseph also challenges his 180-month sentence. He contends that the district court erred in applying the 15-year mandatory sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because his three prior drug convictions, for violations of Florida Statute \u00a7 893.18, were not \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact for clear error and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2007). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed in the district court, which, in this case, is the government. <em>See id. </em>at 1235-36. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a serious drug offense within the meaning of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">Binding precedent forecloses all but one of Mr. Joseph\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">As for his first claim \u2014 that the traffic stop was unlawful because it was pre-textual \u2014 the Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops [does not] depend[ ] on the actual motivations of the individual officers involved.\u201d <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Accordingly, as long as an officer had \u201cprobable cause to believe that a traffic violation ... occurred!,]\u201d the traffic stop will be deemed lawful. <em>Id. </em>at 810,116 S.Ct. 1769. At Mr. Joseph\u2019s suppression hearing, Officers McGriff and Christ\u00f3ffel (the officers who conducted the traffic stop) testified that they observed Mr. Joseph operating the vehicle without wearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>a seat belt, which is a traffic violation under Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.614(4)(b). Because Mr. Joseph did not present any evidence to controvert the police officers\u2019 testimony, the district court did not clearly err in crediting that testimony and finding that the traffic stop was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">With respect to the assertion that the district court improperly applied the ACCA enhancement, we recently held that violations of \u00a7 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes qualify as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014). Thus, we conclude that the district court properly classified Mr. Joseph as an armed career criminal for purposes of ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Mr. Joseph\u2019s remaining argument\u2014that the inventory search was illegal\u2014is not foreclosed by precedent, but it is without merit. The Supreme Court has held that inventory searches of lawfully impounded vehicles. are an exception to the general warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 371, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987). For an impoundment of a vehicle to be lawful, it must be done according to an established routine practice and \u201con the basis of something other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Florida v. Wells, </em>495 U.S. 1, 4, 110 S.Ct. 1632, 109 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990). The established procedure, however, need not be detailed. <em>United States v. Johnson, 777 </em>F.3d 1270, 1277 (11th Cir.2015). For example, we have upheld an inventory search where the district court had indicated that a police department\u2019s policy \u201c \u2018permitted impoundment under the circumstances\u2019 and \u2018the defendant had not countered th[e] assertion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Mr. Joseph first points to Florida\u2019s Nonresident Violator Compact, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 322.50, as evidence that the officers failed to follow established procedures. He contends that because he was an out-of-state resident, the Compact required the officers to issue him a citation for the seat belt violation and release him on his own recognizance instead of detaining him. Mr. Joseph\u2019s argument, however, fails to recognize a major point\u2014the Compact only permits a police officer to release a motorist on his promise to appear if he possesses a \u201cdriver license issued by a party jurisdiction.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 322.50, Art. III. Mr. Joseph admitted that he did not have a driver license, and the officers arrested him based on his admission. The officers also arrested the passenger, Michael Jeon-Poix, for possession of marijuana after he admitted that he had a small quantity of weed in his pocket. Thus, the officers were well within their rights to arrest both men and subsequently impound and search the rental car.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Mr. Joseph also claims that the officers violated the Riviera Beach Police Department\u2019s impoundment policy by not granting him the opportunity to call someone to recover the rental car prior to impounding it. Although the officers generally agreed with Mr. Joseph\u2019s characterization of the Department\u2019s policy, Officer McGriff testified at the suppression hearing that, due to liability concerns, police officers are only permitted to release the vehicle to its owner or the person who rented the car. Officer Christoffel testified that he did not recall finding a rental agreement or any other document that would have indicated who rented the vehicle, and under such circumstances, rental companies have requested that the Department automatically tow the vehicle without first contacting them. Again, Mr. Joseph did not offer any evidence to counter this testimony. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>that the officers acted pursuant to the Department\u2019s policy and that the impoundment and inventory search were legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mr. Joseph\u2019s conviction and sentence. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
