Cox, Chanez, and the partnership (collectively \u201cthe Medical Group\u201d) ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>peal the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Howroyd-Wright Employment Agency, Inc., known as Ap-pleOne (\u201cAppleOne\u201d), following a bench trial. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The Medical Group\u2019s longtime office manager, Rosemarie Ewton (\u201cEwton\u201d), decided to retire. Ewton was tasked with finding candidates who might replace her. She contacted Dina Moon (\u201cMoon\u201d), the manager of the branch office of AppleOne, a placement staffing company. Ewton asked Moon to provide her with a list of candidates for the Medical Group\u2019s office manager position. Ewton told Moon that healthcare experience was beneficial but not required. AppleOne and the Medical Group did not enter into a written contract, but AppleOne agreed to furnish candidates. In return, AppleOne would receive a finder\u2019s fee if one of its candidates was hired. AppleOne provided a written guarantee to the Medical Group, stating that it would fully refund the fee if the \u201cplacement did not work out for any reasons during the first 30 days of employment.\u201d If the candidate was employed for 30 to 90 days, the Medical Group \u201cwould receive a prorated refund or a free placement to replace the employee.\u201d If the candidate was employed from 90 days to 5 years, \u201cAppleOne would charge the Medical Group half of its normal placement fee to replace the candidate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Moon forwarded five resumes to Ewton, including Ginger Brown\u2019s (\u201cBrown\u2019s\u201d). Brown\u2019s resume listed that she had been a registered nurse (\u201cRN\u201d). Moon relayed this information to Ewton via e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The Medical Group interviewed four of the five candidates referred by AppleOne. It asked for references from two candidates, including Brown. AppleOne provided the Medical Group with four positive employment references from coworkers at her last position. The Medical Group offered the job to Brown, and she accepted it. Moon performed a background check on Brown and reported to Ewton that the background check had not revealed \u201cany records on her in the national database.\u201d The Medical Group paid AppleOne a fee of $7,275 for referring Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">For several months, Ewton trained and monitored Brown. Then Ewton retired and Brown took over the office manager position. Shortly thereafter, over a series of several months, Brown embezzled over $60,000 from the Medical Group. Once caught, she was terminated. She was employed for a total of six months. The Medical Group later learned that Brown had never been an RN; indeed, she did not hold a nursing degree or other undergraduate degree. The Medical Group also learned that Brown had been subject to a deferred adjudication in 2007, although it had been dismissed by the time the Medical Group hired her. AppleOne\u2019s criminal background check may have revealed this deferred adjudication if Brown had provided it with her maiden name rather than denying that she had any aliases.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">The Medical Group sued AppleOne under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\u201cDTPA\u201d). The Medical Group requested restitution from AppleOne in the amount of the fee paid for referring Brown, the money that Brown had embezzled, and the salary paid to Brown. The district court conducted a bench trial and found in favor of AppleOne, dismissing the Medical Group\u2019s claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">On appeal, the Medical Group argues that the district court erred as a matter of. law, but it does not challenge the court\u2019s factual findings. First, it argues that Ap-pleOne\u2019s misconduct was a producing cause of its injuries as a matter of law. Under the DTPA, \u201c[a] consumer may maintain an action\u201d if a misrepresentation or unconscionable action \u201cconstitute[s] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>producing cause of economic damages or damages for mental anguish.\u201d Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 17.50(a). \u201cA producing cause is a substantial factor which brings about the injury and without which the injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Doe v. Boys Clubs of Greater Dall., Inc., </em>907 S.W.2d 472, 481 (Tex.1995). While a plaintiff \u201cneed not establish that the harm was foreseeable,\u201d it is not enough to show that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cfurnished an attenuated condition that made the injury possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481-82. Thus, for example, when boys meet a man because he volunteers with their Boys Club, but the boys and their family then befriend the man outside of the club context, the club\u2019s misrepresentation that it thoroughly checks the background of its volunteers is not a producing cause of the man\u2019s later molestation of the boys outside of the club. <em>Id. </em>Or, when a church advertises a teenage boy as a babysitter and parents hire him, the church\u2019s advertisement is not the producing cause of his later molestation of their children because the parents themselves chose to hire the teenager as a babysitter. <em>Bryant v. S.A.S., </em>416 S.W.3d 52, 60 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Here, AppleOne introduced Brown to the Medical Group. But, as the above cases demonstrate, the mere introduction of a malefactor to an injured party is not necessarily a producing cause of the later injuries. We agree with the district court that AppleOne\u2019s behavior was not the producing cause of the Medical Group\u2019s injuries. The district court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Drs. Chanez, Cox and Williams collectively made the decision on behalf of the Medical Group to hire Ginger Brown. Ms. Ewton did not make that decision. In deciding to hire Ms. Brown, Drs. Chanez, Cox and Williams relied on Ms. Brown\u2019s resume, their own interview of her, and Ms. Ewton\u2019s feedback to the doctors after her interview of Ms. Brown. In hiring Brown, no representative of the Medical Group relied on AppleOrie\u2019s interview of Brown or on other information AppleOne provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoE\">Again, the Medical Group has not challenged this or any other factual finding on appeal. In particular, the Medical Group has not demonstrated that AppleOne\u2019s representation that Brown was an RN caused the Medical Group to hire her. Because the doctors of the Medical Group decided to hire Brown based upon their own observations, we conclude that AppleOne\u2019s conduct was not the producing cause of the Medical Group hiring Brown and its resulting injuries. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Second, the Medical Group argues that AppleOne\u2019s refusal to provide restitution was unconscionable. It points to a case holding that an employment agency acted unconscionably by refusing to refund a finder\u2019s fee to an employer. <em>Diversified Human Resources Grp., Inc. v. PB-KBB, Inc., </em>671 S.W.2d 634, 637 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1984). In <em>PB-KBB, </em>the candidate presented by the agency falsely claimed that he was an engineer. <em>Id. </em>Neither the employment agency nor the employer knew that he was lying. <em>Id. </em>The employer hired the candidate, discovered that he was not an engineer, and fired him. <em>Id. </em>It sued to recover the finder\u2019s fee it had paid to the agency. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that the agency\u2019s refusal to refund the finder\u2019s fee was unconscionable because there was a \u201cgross disparity between the value received and consideration paid.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">This case differs from <em>PB-KBB </em>in two critical respects. First and most importantly, the definition of \u201cunconscionable action\u201d has since been amended to omit the \u201cgross disparity\u201d language on which <em>PB-KBB </em>relied. <em>See </em>Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 17.45(5). Instead, \u201cunconscionable ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tion or course of action\u201d is now defined as \u201can act or practice which, to a consumer\u2019s detriment, takes advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of the consumer to a grossly unfair degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, AppleOne did not take advantage of the Medical Group or its members, given that it did not know that Brown was lying on her resume and it did not represent that it would perform a more thorough check of Brown than it did. Second, in <em>PB-KBB, </em>the employment agency provided no express, limited warranty of the candidate\u2019s suitability. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, here, AppleOne did provide just such an express, limited warranty, which allowed for a full refund for 30 days, prorated refund for 90 days, and discount on further services for five years. It was not unconscionable for AppleOne to follow its clear-cut express warranty rather than refunding the full fee and providing restitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Because the producing cause and uncon-scionability issues are dispositive, we do not reach the Medical Group\u2019s other issues. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\">. Further, at most <em>PB-KBB </em>would support refunding the finder\u2019s fee, not restitution of Brown's salary and the embezzled funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
