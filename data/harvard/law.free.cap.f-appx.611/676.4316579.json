We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Martinez\u2019s motion. In 2014, the district court reduced Martinez\u2019s sentence from 119 months of imprisonment to 72 months of imprisonment based on Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, but amendment 782 did not alter Martinez\u2019s sentencing range. The district court denied Martinez\u2019s motion because he \u201cagreed [in the factual proffer to his plea agreement] that the weight of the cocaine involved was 900 kilograms of cocaine,\u201d which made him ineligible for a further reduction of his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (assigning a base offense level of 38 for cases involving 450 kilograms or more of cocaine). Martinez challenges the amount of cocaine attributed to him, but the district court could not disturb its earlier finding about drug quantity when considering Martinez\u2019s motion to reduce. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Because Martinez was ineligible for a reduction of his sentence, the district court lacked the authority to consider the statutory sentencing factors or to exercise its discretion to impose a new sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">We AFFIRM the denial of Martinez\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
