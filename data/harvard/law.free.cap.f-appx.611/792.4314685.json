The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the claims lacked merit, and the defendants were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where the \u201cmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Sanchez first challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his due process challenge to his reduction in classification from Level 1 to Level 2, denial of access to property, denial of commissary and visitation privileges, and recreation restrictions \u2014 prior to any disciplinary hearing \u2014 lacked merit. This claim of \u201cpunishment\u201d without notice and a hearing fails, however, as Sanchez\u2019s change in classification status, the denial of commissary and visitation privileges, and cell restrictions do not implicate a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>664 F.3d 966, 974 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 958-59 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 508 (5th Cir.1999). In addition, Sanchez\u2019s claim that certain (unidentified) property was taken from him does not state a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Stauffer v. Gearhart, </em>741 F.3d 574, 583 (5th Cir.2014). Further, to the extent Sanchez contends prison rules and regulations were violated in connection with his reduction in classification, cell restrictions, and denial of various privileges, he is not entitled to relief. <em>See Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1251 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Next, Sanchez challenges the dismissal of his claim that the defendants violated his due process rights throughout the disciplinary hearing proceedings. As the summary judgment evidence reflects, Sanchez\u2019s disciplinary conviction resulted in a punishment of 15 days of recreation restriction, 45 days of commissary restriction, 15 days of cell restriction, a reduction in classification, and the loss of 90 days of good time. None of those consequences implicated a protected liberty interest for Sanchez. <em>See Kimbrell v. Cockrell, </em>311 F.3d 361, 362 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Malchi, </em>211 F.3d at 958-59; <em>Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Sanchez has not shown that he was entitled to due process. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">Sanchez also maintains that he was denied due process in the assistance of his defense because his Counsel Substitute, Sandra Reed and Shelia Forte, failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>to adequately represent him during the preliminary investigation and the disciplinary hearing. Sanchez, however, cannot maintain a \u00a7 1988 action against Reed and Forte based on their actions as his counsel substitute. <em>See Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 234 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent Sanchez contends that Reed\u2019s and Forte\u2019s alleged shortcomings violated TDCJ rules, he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Jackson, </em>864 F.2d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Also without merit is Sanchez\u2019s claim that he was punished in excess of established prison procedures, thereby resulting in a due process violation. First, the nature of the complained-of action\u2014 failure to promote Sanchez to Level 1 after 90 days had expired infraction-free in Level 2 \u2014 is not in the realm of the \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d which would give rise to a protected liberty interest requiring any particular procedures. See <em>San-din, </em>515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Second, as stated previously, the reduction in classification and attendant restrictions did not infringe upon any constitutionally protected liberty interests. <em>See Malchi, </em>211 F.3d at 958-59; <em>Luken, </em>71 F.3d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">With regard to his claim of retaliation, Sanchez maintains that Officer Angela Hilborn reported him for a baseless infraction because he made a statement concerning the possible filing of a grievance against her. This claim fails for several reasons. In his complaint, Sanchez expressly stated that his comment to Officer Hilborn was \u201csarcastic.\u201d Thus, because his threatened grievance would have been frivolous, it could not form the basis of a retaliation claim. <em>See Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 311 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, Sanchez\u2019s allegations of retaliation are conclusory and speculative and do not give rise to any inference that Officer Hilborn\u2019s actions were motivated by a retaliatory intent. <em>See </em>Woods <em>v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Sanchez also challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim that Warden Dawn Grounds and Major James Powers created an unwritten custom and policy to punish inmates, through demotion in classification, without notice and a hearing and to issue excessive punishment by keeping offenders in Level 2 for over 90 days. This claim is unavailing, however, because the purported policy does not result in any constitutional injury. <em>See Wernecke v. Garcia, </em>591 F.3d 386, 401 (5th Cir.2009). Further, to the extent Sanchez alleged any personal involvement by Warden Grounds or Major Powers, he abandons these claims by failing to brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">In addition to the foregoing, Sanchez contends that the prison\u2019s use of food loaf as punishment violates due process; that \u201cpunishment\u201d prior to any procedural protections constituted cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment; and that prison officials imposed two punishments for his disciplinary infraction, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Sanchez raised these claims for the first time in reply to the defendants\u2019 responsive pleadings, and the district court did not address them in granting the summary judgment motion. Even if the district court should have allowed Sanchez to amend his pleadings to add these claims, he cannot show that he is entitled to any relief. Sanchez\u2019s placement on the food-loaf diet for seven days does not implicate a liberty interest. <em>See Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293; <em>Jones, </em>664 F.3d at 974. As to his Eighth Amendment claim, the demotion to Level 2 and denial of various privileges for up to 92 days does not implicate any life necessi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>ty, and Sanchez did not allege sufficient facts about the prison officials to show that they were deliberately indifferent. <em>See Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 352 (5th Cir.1999). Finally, the constitutional proscription against double jeopardy does not apply to Sanchez\u2019s disciplinary proceeding. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Sanchez does not challenge the dismissal of his claims against Captain Shaylon Allen, Sergeant Randy McBain, and the Unit Grievance Staff. Consequently, he abandons these claims by failing to brief them. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
