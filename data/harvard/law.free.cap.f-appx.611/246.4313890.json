He claims the district court erroneously enhanced his offense level by 16, pursuant to advisory Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (pre-de-portation conviction for certain drug-trafficking offenses). In that regard, he presents two bases for maintaining the court improperly ruled Rivera\u2019s 2010 Texas conviction for possession, with intent to deliver, a controlled substance constituted a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under that Guideline. For the reasons that follow, each of the two bases is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-20\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo; its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">Rivera concedes his first basis, that his Texas offense encompasses a broader range of conduct than Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 contemplates, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>in which our court held the Texas offense of possession, with intent to deliver, cocaine was a drug-trafficking offense under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 and an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). 767 F.3d 453, 461 (5th Cir.2014), cert. <em>denied </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). He presents this issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-24\">For his second basis, Rivera maintains his prior Texas crime was not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d because Texas law does not require proof of remuneration or commercial activity in order to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>conviction for possession, with intent to deliver, a controlled substance. Recently, however, in <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>our court held an enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for a pri- or conviction of a drug-trafficking offense is warranted regardless of whether the conviction for the prior offense required remuneration. 782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(19 June 2015) (No. 14-10355).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
