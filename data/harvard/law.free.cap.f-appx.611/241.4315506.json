She argues that the district court erroneously determined the amount of restitution in Case No. 3:13-CR-8-6 because the restitution amount included intended, but not actual, loss amounts. She also argues that the district court erred by denying the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 without considering the nature or extent of Tyler\u2019s cooperation. Relying on the appellate waiver in the plea agreement, the Government seeks dismissal of the appeal or, alternatively, summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We review the validity of an appeal waiver de novo. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). The waiver provision broadly waived Tyler\u2019s right to appeal her sentence. She did not reserve any appeal rights. The record of her rearraignment shows that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, as Tyler knew she had the right to appeal and that she was giving up that right in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994). Because the plain language of the waiver provision applies to Tyler\u2019s challenge to her sentences, we will enforce the waiver and DISMISS the appeal. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544, 546 (5th Cir.2005). The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for summary affirmance is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
