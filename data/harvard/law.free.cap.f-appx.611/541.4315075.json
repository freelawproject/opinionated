Jones, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration of its denial of his motion to reopen his complaint, in which he sought review of the denial of social security disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d). He argues that he presented newly discovered evidence that he could not have previously acquired with due dili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>gence that supported his DIB application and argues that the district court ignored the evidence when it failed to remand his case to the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) under Sentences Four and Six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">I. Scope of Appeal and Motion to Reopen and Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We must determine <em>sua sponte </em>the scope of our jurisdiction in the instant appeal. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2009). A notice of appeal must \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d Fed. R.App.P. 3(c)(1)(B). . We generally have jurisdiction to review \u201conly those judgments, orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant\u2019s notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Osterneck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir.1987). Although we will \u201cgenerally construe a notice of appeal liberally, we will not expand it to include judgments and orders not specified unless the overriding intent to appeal these orders is readily apparent on the face of the notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may look to the record, including the parties\u2019 briefs, to determine the issues and orders an appellant intended to appeal. <em>See KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, </em>465 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2006) (finding that the appellant clearly intended to appeal a certain district court order, despite the appellant\u2019s failure to include that order in the notice of appeal, as the appellant\u2019s brief addressed only the issues in that order, both parties fully briefed those issues, and the appellee would suffer no prejudice if the notice of appeal were construed to include the order).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The law-of-the-case doctrine generally makes the findings of fact and conclusions of law of an appellate court binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case either in the trial court or on appeal. <em>This That &amp; the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb Cnty., </em>439 F.3d 1275, 1283 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cFurthermore, the law-of-the-case doctrine bars relitigation of issues that were decided either explicitly or by necessary implication\u201d in a prior appeal. <em>Id. </em>When applied to a question of law, the law-of-the-case doctrine can be overcome only when (1) \u201cnew and substantially different evidence is produced, or there has been a change in the controlling authority; or (2) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). We will not consider arguments unpresented before the district court or administrative agency. <em>Kelley v. Apfel, </em>185 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Where a claimant seeks review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, the district court has two methods \u2014 each addressing a different problem \u2014 for remanding a case back to the Commissioner under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc., Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.2007). The first method, known as a Sentence Four remand, is \u201cbased upon a determination that the Commissioner erred in some respect in reaching the decision to deny benefits.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Chater, </em>99 F.3d 1086, 1095 (11th Cir.1996). The second method, a Sentence Six remand, is not based on error, but rather is available if new, material evidence becomes available to a claimant when the claimant could not have presented that evidence during the administrative proceeding. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1267; <em>Jackson, </em>99 F.3d at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Although Jones stated in his <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal that he was appealing the district court\u2019s order denying his latest Rule 59 motion for reconsideration, it is apparent from the issues he addressed in his initial brief that he also intended to appeal the order denying his prior motion to reopen and remand. The Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>has not argued that she would be prejudiced by interpreting the notice of appeal to include both orders. Accordingly, Jones\u2019s notice of appeal was effective to appeal both the order denying his motion to reopen and remand and the order denying his Rule 59 motion for reconsideration. <em>See KH Outdoor, </em>465 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Jones\u2019s arguments for a Sentence Four remand are not properly before this Court, as he did not raise them in his motion to reopen or in his subsequent Rule 59 motion for reconsideration. <em>See Kelley, </em>185 F.3d at 1215. In a prior appeal in this case, we disposed of Jones\u2019s current arguments regarding (1) a Sentence Six remand based on purportedly new medical evidence, and (2) various related due process violations. <em>See Jones v. Comm\u2019r of Soc., Sec., Admin., Miami, S Region, </em>497 Fed.Appx. 888, 891-94 (11th Cir.2012). Because Jones has identified no additional new evidence or a change in the law, the law-of-the-case doctrine bars these claims. <em>See This That &amp; the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc., </em>439 F.3d at 1283. Accordingly, Jones has not shown that the district court erred in denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">II. Rule 59 Motion for Reconsideration and Due Process Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Issues not addressed in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Jones has abandoned any argument that the district court erred by denying his Rule 59 motion for reconsideration, by failing to present any such argument in his appellate briefs. <em>See id., </em>518 F.3d at 874. As such, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
