Alvi contends that the BIA erred in concluding that he did not qualify for a \u00a7 1181(b) waiver because he was not admissible to the United States as a returning lawful permanent resident. Specifically, he argues that the BIA failed to give proper weight to his testimony and evidence regarding his absence from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Alvi has failed to provide evidence so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder would agree with the BIA\u2019s determination that he abandoned his lawful permanent resident status. <em>See Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, the BIA did not err in concluding that Alvi did not qualify for a \u00a7 1181(b) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Finally, Alvi has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s December 20, 2013, determination that he failed to establish that he was eligible for an adjustment of status or any other form of relief from removal and that it was not authorized to review the constitutionality of the immigration laws. See <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
