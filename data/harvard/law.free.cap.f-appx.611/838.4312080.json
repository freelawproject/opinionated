Ramirez-Bertran now challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of his guidelines sentencing range. He concedes that he did not object on this basis in the district court, however, and we review the issue only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The district court applied a 12-level drug-trafficking enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) based on Ramirez-Bertran\u2019s 2009 Virginia conviction for manufacture of a controlled substance under \u00a7 18.2-248 of the Virginia Code. Ramirez-Bertran maintains that nothing in the record shows under which particular subsection of the Virginia statute he was convicted and that this court must therefore decide whether the least culpable conduct under the statute, <em>ie., </em>giving away or possessing with intent to give away a small quantity of a controlled substance for no remuneration, constitutes a drug-trafficking offense for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n. l(B)(iv)). This court recently held that an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b) for a prior drug-trafficking conviction, as that term is defined by the Sentencing Commission in \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n. l(B)(iv)), is warranted regardless of whether the conviction for the prior offense required proof of remuneration or commercial activity. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 19, 2015) (No. 14-10355). Accordingly, the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
