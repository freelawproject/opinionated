The district court dismissed Woo-droffe\u2019s case based on improper venue and his failure to attach pleadings that were served on him in state court. Because those defects are procedural and the district court lacked the authority to dismiss Woodroffe\u2019s notice of removal <em>sua sponte, </em>we vacate the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-25\">The district court adopted the recommendations of the magistrate judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>deny Woodroffe\u2019s application to proceed as an indigent and to dismiss his case. The district court determined that Woodroffe \u201cfailed to cure the deficiencies\u201d in his notice of removal; he had \u201cfailed to show why the Court should dispense with the geographical requirement,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1441(a); </em>and he had \u201cfailed to file a copy of process, pleadings, and other orders served on him in the state action,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1446(a), M.D. Fla. R. 4.02(b). The district court \u201cexamined the exhibits [Woo-droffe] filed with his original Notice of Removal,\u201d but without a copy of the \u201cunderlying complaint\u201d in the state action, the district court could not \u201cmake any determination whether the removal of [the] case [was] proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>issues involving the jurisdiction of the district court. <em>Hollis v. Florida State Univ., </em>259 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Woodroffe\u2019s notice of removal was procedurally defective. \u201c[T]o remove any civil action from a State court[, a defendant] shall file in the district court of the United States for the district and division within which such action is pending a notice of removal ... together with a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a). Woodroffe filed his notice of removal in an improper venue, and he failed to attach any pleadings that were served on him in state court. Those defects are procedural, but do not deprive a district court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Peterson v. BMI Refractories, </em>124 F.3d 1386, 1394 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[F]ailure to comply with the geographic requirements of \u00a7 1441(a) is a procedural defect that does not deprive a district court of subject matter jurisdiction in a removed case.\u201d); <em>Cook v. Randolph Cnty., Ga., </em>573 F.3d 1143, 1150 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]he failure to include all state court pleadings and process with the notice of removal is procedurally incorrect but is not a jurisdictional defect.\u201d). Improper venue can be waived, <em>see Manley v. Engram, </em>755 F.2d 1463, 1468 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201c[T]he right to object to improper venue may be waived.\u201d), and the district court can remedy a scarcity of supporting documents, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b) (providing that the district court \u201cmay require the removing party to file ... copies of all records and proceedings in such State court or may cause the same to be brought before it by writ of certiorari issued to [the] State court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The district court erred when it dismissed Woodroffe\u2019s case <em>sua sponte </em>for procedural defects in his notice of removal. <em>See Hollis, </em>259 F.3d at 1299-1300. When a notice of removal contains \u201cany defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d the district court may remand the action to state court based on a timely motion to remand. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). But the district court may not act <em>sua sponte; </em>\u201cthe district court must wait for a party\u2019s motion before remanding a ease based on [a] procedural defect.\u201d <em>Whole Health Chiropractic &amp; Wellness, Inc. v. Humana Med. Plan, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2001). Because the district court exceeded its authority, we vacate the order that dismissed Woodroffe\u2019s notice of removal and remand for further proceedings. We express no opinion on whether the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
