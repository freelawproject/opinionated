We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Watkins\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Watkins\u2019s motions to appoint substitute counsel, take judicial notice, and compel counsel to provide a copy of the record are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not'be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
