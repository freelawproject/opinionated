She argues that, because the Bureau of Prisons staff members at Federal Medical Center Carswell have been deliberately indifferent to her serious medical needs in violation of her constitutional rights, she should be granted compassionate release so that she may obtain necessary medical care. Darien need not obtain a certif\u00edcate of appealability in this case. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Darien\u2019s impassioned plea for release does not address the reasons behind the district court\u2019s dismissal of her \u00a7 2241 petition. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to identify error in the district court\u2019s basis for dismissing her \u00a7 2241 petition, Darien has abandoned any appellate challenge she might have raised regarding the decision. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Darien\u2019s appeal presents no legal points arguable on their merits, the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
