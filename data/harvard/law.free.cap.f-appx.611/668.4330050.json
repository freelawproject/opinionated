After careful consideration, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Bernard Seidling (Debtor) filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Kelly filed a proof of claim based on Debtor\u2019s involvement in a bad-faith involuntary bankruptcy against Kelly\u2019s son.- Debtor and Seidling each filed objections to Kelly\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">After roughly one year of litigation between the Seidlings and Kelly, Debtor admitted, by failing to respond to a request for admission, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. (a)(3), that he \u201centered into a conspiracy to file a bad faith involuntary bankruptcy\u201d against Kelly\u2019s son. Accordingly, Debtor withdrew his objection to Kelly\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">With only Seidling\u2019s objection outstanding, Kelly moved for final judgment and liquidation of his claim. The bankruptcy court granted the motion, holding Seidling no longer had standing to raise an objection to Kelly\u2019s claim and allowing Kelly\u2019s claim against the estate in the full amount of $640,000. Seidling appealed to the district court. The district court affirmed, and Seidling now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AbR1\">\n<em>1. Debtor\u2019s Admission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The primary issue in this appeal is whether the bankruptcy court erred in allowing Kelly\u2019s claim against Debtor\u2019s estate based, in part, on Debtor\u2019s admission that Kelly\u2019s bad faith claim had merit. The bankruptcy court did not err in relying on Debtor\u2019s admissions. <em>Cf. Conlon v. United States, </em>474 F.3d 616, 621 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cUnanswered requests for admissions may be relied on as the basis for granting summary judgment.\u201d). The only authority Seidling cites to support her position is Rule 36(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states a party\u2019s admission \u201cis not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding.\u201d As the district court pointed out, however, the bankruptcy court\u2019s use of Debtor\u2019s admissions did not violate Rule 36(b). Debtor\u2019s admission was used against the same party (Debtor) in the same proceeding. Accordingly, the district court did not err in relying on Debtor\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">, Furthermore, the bankruptcy court held Seidling lacked standing to object to Kelly\u2019s claim, and Seidling has not challenged that holding. Given that Seidling\u2019s' objections were.not legally operative, and given that the only other objection was with-, drawn, the bankruptcy court had no basis for disallowing Kelly\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 3001(f) (\u201cA proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with these rules shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.\u201d); <em>see also In re Lampe, </em>665 F.3d 506, 514 (3d Cir.2011) (\u201c[A] proof of claim that alleges sufficient facts to support liability satisfies the claimant\u2019s initial obligation to proceed, after which the burden shifts to the objector to produce sufficient evidence' to negate the prima facie validity of the filed claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>\n<em>2. Other Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Seidling\u2019s appeal raises several other issues, including: (i) the <em>sua sponte </em>overruling of Seidling\u2019s objection; (ii) lack of notice; (iii) denial of due process; (iv) the requirement of a trial on damages; (v) insufficient evidence to support the damage award; and (vi) punitive damages improperly awarded. We do not address the merits of these issues because, as the district court found, they have been waived. Bankruptcy Rule 8006 requires an appellant to file and serve, within 14 days after filing a notice of appeal, \u201ca designation of the items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8006. \u201cAn issue that is not listed pursuant to [Rule 8006] and is not inferable from the issues that are listed is deemed waived and will not be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>In re Freeman, </em>956 F.2d 252, 255 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">When Seidling appealed to the district court, she filed a Rule 8006 statement of issues that raised only one question: whether \u201cthe Court erred\u201d in entering the order. As the district court explained, \u201c[a] statement of issues that merely accuses the bankruptcy court of having \u2018erred\u2019 is insufficient to infer specific grounds for error upon appeal.\u201d (District Court Opinion at 6.) Accordingly, the district court did not err in holding these issues were waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-11\">. In addition to the Kelly appeal (No. 14-13224), Seidling also appeals from a similar bankruptcy court order in favor of another creditor, Anthony S. Scheur (No. 14-13391). Both the Kelly and Scheur appeals involve many identical issues, and we affirm for substantially the same reasons. With respect to the two distinct issues raised in the Scheur appeal, we agree with the district court these arguments were waived. <em>See Hurley v. Moore, </em>233 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cArguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this Court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
