Specifically, Defendant Collick was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286; three counts of theft of public money, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 641, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>642; three counts of aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), (c)(1); and three counts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. Defendant Deatrice Smith Williams was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286; three counts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; and three counts of aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On appeal, Defendant Collick challenges only his convictions, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on all counts and that his convictions should be vacated because of alleged juror misconduct. Defendant Smith Williams challenges only her total 51-month sentence, arguing that the district court erred in applying a sophisticated means enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. After review, we affirm the Defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">I. MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The district court did not err in denying Defendant Collick\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 based on insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the testimony of Corey Thompson, the Defendants\u2019 co-conspirator, established that Defendant Collick voluntarily participated in a conspiracy to defraud the government by committing tax fraud. <em>See United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1194 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that to sustain a conviction for conspiracy to defraud the government under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286, the government must prove \u201cthe existence of an agreement to achieve an unlawful objective, the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy, and the commission of an overt act in furtherance of it\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Specifically, Thompson testified that he and Defendant Collick agreed to file fraudulent tax returns over the internet using stolen identities and thereby obtain other individuals\u2019 refund checks. Thompson\u2019s testimony further established that Defendant Collick committed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, such as: (1) obtaining stolen identities from his mother-in-law, Defendant Smith Williams, who had access to identifying information through her work at a medical debt collection business, Hollis Cobb Associates; (2) buying prepaid debit cards in the name of the stolen identities so that tax refunds from the false returns could be deposited directly on the cards; and (3) providing mailing addresses to receive prepaid cards and refund checks, including an address on Hinchcliff Road. Thompson, meanwhile, learned how to use the stolen identities Defendant Col-lick obtained from Defendant Smith Williams to create fraudulent paperwork and to file false tax returns and then taught Defendant Collick how to file the false returns. Thompson, who worked as a cable and internet installer, also rerouted his and Defendant Collick\u2019s internet traffic through other IP addresses while they were filing the false tax returns so that it would appear the returns were being filed by someone else. This evidence was more than sufficient to support Defendant Col-lick\u2019s conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Given that Thompson testified that he and Defendant Collick used the internet to perpetrate their scheme, his testimony also established that Collick committed wire fraud. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>486 F.3d 1212, 1221-22 (11th Cir.2007) (stating that an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 conviction for wire fraud requires evidence that the defendant (1) intentionally participated in a scheme to defraud another of property, and (2) used or caused the use of wires to execute the scheme to defraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Further, Defendant Collick\u2019s convictions for theft of government money were supported by Thompson\u2019s testimony and the testimony of Ryan McCommons and Jennifer Simmons, two victims of the fraud scheme. <em>See United States v. McRee, </em>7 F.3d 976, 980 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc) (stating that to support an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 conviction, the government must prove that (1) the money or property belonged to the government; (2) the defendant fraudulently appropriated the money or property for his own use or the use of others; and (3) the defendant did so knowingly and willfully with the intent to either temporarily or permanently deprive the owner of the use of the money or property). According to Thompson, he and Defendant Collick filed fraudulent tax returns in the names of both McCommons and Simmons, among others, using Defendant Collick\u2019s Hinchcliff Road address. McCommons and Simmons testified that, as a result of the false returns and their forged signatures on the refund checks, they were deprived of the government refunds actually owed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In turn, the evidence of Defendant Collick\u2019s theft of government money, in conjunction with the evidence that Defendant Collick used stolen identities he obtained from Defendant Smith Williams, supported Defendant Collick\u2019s convictions for aggravated identity theft. <em>See United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1192 (11th Cir.2011) (stating that to prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), aggravated identity theft, the evidence must establish that the defendant (1) knowingly transferred, possessed, or used; (2) the means of identification of another; (3) without lawful authority; (4) during and in relation to a felony enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(c), one of which is theft of government money in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Defendant Collick\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence rests entirely on his argument that Thompson\u2019s testimony was not credible. Credibility determinations, however, are left to the jury, and we assume the jury resolved any credibility evaluations in favor of the verdict. <em>Gupta, </em>463 F.3d at 1194. The fact that Thompson stood to benefit from his testimony, has lied in the past, and has engaged in criminal behavior does not make his testimony per se incredible. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). Thompson\u2019s testimony was plausible on its face, coherent, and consistent and could not be considered incredible as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that to be considered incredible as a matter of law, the testimony must be about facts that the witness could not possibly have observed or that defy the laws of nature).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Moreover, Thompson\u2019s testimony was amply corroborated by other witnesses, including Kimberly Curry, who testified that she agreed to let Defendant Collick have mail sent to her Hinchcliff Road address and that she did not recognize the names on any of the refund checks that were later sent to that address. In addition, Curry\u2019s mother, Cassandra Shepard, testified that after she returned some of the mysterious refund checks being sent to the Hinchcliff Road address to the Internal Revenue Service, Defendant Collick called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>and asked about the mail, and Shepard told him what she had done. Finally, Kelly O\u2019Donnell, the office manager at Hollis Cobb Associates, testified that Defendant Collick\u2019s mother-in-law, Defendant Smith Williams, used the company\u2019s database to access the patient accounts of McCommons and Simmons, along with other individuals who had their identities stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">While Defendant Collick contends he was an unwitting participant in Thompson\u2019s scheme, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, .amply showed that Collick knowingly and willfully joined the scheme. Because the government\u2019s evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict Defendant Col-lick on all counts, the district court did not err in denying his Rule 29 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II. JUROR MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Defendant Collick argues that he should be granted a new trial based on juror misconduct that violated his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only evidence Collick offers to show juror misconduct, however, is an evaluation form completed by one of the jurors after the trial, which Collick argues indicates that the juror\u2019s determination of guilt was influenced by Collick\u2019s decision not to testify.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Such evidence is excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 606, which prohibits evidence of, <em>inter alia, </em>a juror\u2019s statements about the juror\u2019s \u201cmental processes concerning the verdict.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)(1); <em>United States v. Siegelman, </em>640 F.3d 1159, 1185 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that \u201cthe Supreme Court has recognized a near-universal and firmly established common-law rule <em>flatly prohibiting </em>the use of juror testimony to impeach a verdict,\u201d which is now codified in Rule 606(b)). Although Rule 606 contains several exceptions, Collick does not contend that any of them apply. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)(2) (permitting juror testimony about whether (1) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention; (2) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or (3) a mistake was made on the verdict form). Accordingly, Collick has not shown any basis for vacating his convictions and granting him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">III. SOPHISTICATED MEANS ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">Defendant Smith Williams challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level sophisticated means enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b), based on her co-conspirators\u2019 relevant conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-16\">A defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by two levels if she used sophisticated means during either the execution or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>cealment of the offense conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). \u201cSophisticated means\u201d refers to especially complex or intricate conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 9(B). Where, as here, the offense involves a criminal conspiracy, the advisory guidelines calculations are based on all relevant conduct, which includes \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Here, Defendant Smith Williams does not dispute that Collick and Thompson\u2019s use of prepaid debit cards, other people\u2019s mailing addresses, and other computer IP addresses constituted \u201csophisticated means\u201d in furtherance of the tax fraud conspiracy. Rather, D\u00e9fendant Smith Williams contends that their actions were not reasonably foreseeable to her because she did not understand how they would carry out the tax fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The problem for Defendant Smith Williams is that the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that she actually knew of the means used by Thompson and Collick to file the false tax returns because she traveled to Alabama to learn how to file the false tax returns for herself. This finding is supported by the record. Specifically, at trial, Thompson testified that, during one of his trips with Collick to collect refund checks, Col-lick said that his mother-in-law, Defendant Smith Williams, was planning to visit so she could learn from Collick how to file false tax returns using stolen identities.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">There is no merit to Defendant Smith Williams\u2019 argument that the means Thompson and Collick used were too technologically advanced to be reasonably foreseeable. A defendant need not have fully understood the precise means used for those means to be reasonably foreseeable. It is sufficient that Defendant Smith Williams was aware of the sophisticated means being used by her co-conspirators. Thus, the district court properly applied the sophisticated meaiis enhancement in calculating Defendant Smith Williams\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the Defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">.
