(\u201cU.S.Xpress\u201d), and others; and (2) the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to U.S. Xpress on his claims of: racial and religious discrimination, in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) (\u201cTitle VII\u201d); age discrimination, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a); and hostile work environment based on racial, religious, and age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Thompkins\u2019s initial brief focuses almost exclusively on the alleged misconduct of his attorney and others. In several places, he states generally that he had provided his attorney with proof to support his claims and that disputed issues of material fact still exist. In response, U.S. Xpress contends that Thompkins has failed to address the merits of any of his discrimination claims. In his reply brief, Thompkins references various documents from the record, again alleging broadly that they create genuine issues of material fact. There was no abuse of discretion in denying and striking Thompkins\u2019s request to investigate alleged misconduct. The motion was not signed under oath, in violation of a local rule. There was also a failure to state with particularity the circumstances of the alleged misconduct, also in violation of the local rule. Finally, the motion was properly stricken because the motion revealed settlement communications in violation of the court\u2019s express order.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">While we construe <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally, issues not briefed by a <em>pro se </em>litigant on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA party fails to adequately \u2018brief a claim when he does not plainly and prominently raise it, for instance by devoting a discrete section of his argument to those claims.\u201d <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 681 (11th Cir.2014). Passing references to an issue do not suffice. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we do not address arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Thompkins has abandoned any claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to U.S. Xpress because he provides no meaningful argument of those claims or the summary judgment order in his initial brief. <em>See Sapuppo, </em>739 F.3d at 681; <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. Even if Thompkins\u2019s general references in his reply brief to documents in the record are liberally construed to raise an argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment, we do not address matters raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
