We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b969-24\">In 2008, Garcon was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e) and (g). He was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment. Garcon appealed his conviction; we affirmed. <em>United States v. Garcon, </em>349 Fed.Appx. 377 (11th Cir.2009). Garcon filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and two motions to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), none of which was successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-25\">In July 2014, Garcon filed the Rule 36 motion that is the subject of this appeal. Garcon\u2019s sentencing proceedings and those proceedings related to his Rule 36 motion are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-26\">A. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-27\">According to Garcon\u2019s original PSI, three firearms were uncovered in connection with his crime: a Sig Sauer .40 caliber handgun, a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, and an Intratec firearm. The Sig Sauer had been reported stolen. Garcon received enhancements under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), because his crime involved more than two but less than eight firearms, and \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), because one of the firearms was stolen. Garcon\u2019s sentence also was enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), because he was classified as an armed-career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He received a total of nine criminal-history points, yielding a criminal-history category of IV. Because his PSI classified him as an armed-career criminal, his criminal-history category was increased to VI. Among the prior convictions for which he received criminal-history points were a 1992 manslaughter crime the PSI labeled as \u201cAccessory to Manslaughter\u201d and a 1995 battery-on-a-law-enforcement-officer crime. Based on his offense level of 34 and criminal-history category of VI, Garcon\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was 262 to 327 months of imprisonment. Under \u00a7 924(e)(1), Garcon\u2019s mandatory-minimum sentence was 15 years of imprisonment, with a maximum possible sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Garcon objected to the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) enhancement for an offense involving more than two but less than eight firearms, because the indictment mentioned only the Sig Sauer firearm. He also objected to the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) enhancement for the stolen firearm, because the firearm was not included in the count of conviction in the indictment. Finally, he objected to his classification in the PSI as an armed-career criminal, because (1) he was convicted of being only an accessory after the fact to manslaughter; (2) that conviction was not a violent felony for purposes of \u00a7 924(e); and (3) without the manslaughter crime, he did not have the requisite three predicate convictions to qualify for the armed-career-criminal enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">At sentencing, the district judge overruled Garcon\u2019s objections to the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) enhancement for a crime involving more than two but less than eight firearms and the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) enhancement for a stolen firearm. The government noted, however, the PSI incorrectly indicated the Sig Sauer firearm, rather than the Mossberg shotgun, was stolen. The district judge asked the probation officer to make that correction in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">To support his objection to his armed-career-criminal classification, Garcon submitted copies of the judgment and commitment order from his manslaughter crime, which showed the conviction was for being an accessory after the fact. The district judge ultimately sustained the objection and found the manslaughter conviction did not constitute a violent felony within the' meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(1), and the PSI improperly had imposed an armed-career-criminal enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">The district judge recalculated Garcon\u2019s Guidelines range to be 168 to 210 months of imprisonment but, because his statutory-maximum penalty became 120 months of imprisonment following the judge\u2019s sustaining his objection to the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement, that penalty became his Guidelines range. An amended PSI showed the changes to the Guidelines calculations the judge had made at sentencing, including deleting the paragraph stating Garcon was subject to the enhancement as an armed-career criminal, as well as clarifying the Mossberg shotgun had been reported stolen, rather than the Sig Sauer firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">B. <em>Rule 36 Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">In July 2014, Garcon filed the subject Rule 36 motion to correct clerical errors in his PSI and raised four arguments. First, he argued the PSI erroneously stated his crime involved between two and eight firearms. Garcon contended his crime was limited to only one firearm. Second, he argued the PSI erroneously stated the Sig Sauer firearm was stolen. Third, he concluded several of his prior crimes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>improperly used as bases for his criminal-history score, because they were more than ten years old. Fourth, Garcon argued the PSI improperly had failed to specify his prior conviction for manslaughter was for being an \u201caccessory after the fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The district judge denied Garcon\u2019s Rule 36 motion. He explained Rule 36 could be used only to correct clerical errors and found Garcon improperly had sought to make substantive changes to his PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">On appeal, Garcon raises the four arguments he raised in his Rule 36 motion in district court. Regarding the fourth argument, he explains correcting the alleged error in the PSI regarding his manslaughter crime would have no effect on his sentence, but would affect his Bureau of Prisons classification and facility placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">We review de novo a district judge\u2019s application of Rule 36. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004). Under Rule 36, \u201c[ajfter giving any ntice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. We have described clerical errors as \u201cminor and mechanical in nature.\u201d <em>Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1165 (explaining a district judge\u2019s Rule 36 order changing the payees of court-ordered restitution to conform to the judge\u2019s oral sentencing pronouncement was a correction of a clerical error). \u201cIt is clear in this Circuit that Rule 36 may not be used to make a substantive alteration to a criminal sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1164 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The district judge correctly denied Garcon\u2019s Rule 36 motion, because the changes Garcon requested to his PSI were substantive, not clerical. <em>See id. </em>Garcon raised the objection at sentencing to the number of firearms involved in the crime, resulting in the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) enhancement; the judge overruled it. Garcon\u2019s request his \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) enhancement be removed from his PSI and his Guidelines sentencing range be recalculated is not a \u201cclerical error\u201d but a substantive matter he raised at sentencing; the judge rejected it. <em>See Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164. To the extent Garcon is requesting his criminal history be recalculated, Rule 36 is not appropriate for raising that claim. <em>See Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164. The change substantively would alter his Guidelines sentencing range, which is not \u201cminor and mechanical in nature.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1165. Garcon\u2019s request his PSI be corrected to show the Mossberg shotgun was stolen, rather than the Sig Sauer firearm, is unnecessary, because the Amended PSI already has that correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">We also conclude Rule 36 relief is not appropriate to change the characterization of Garcon\u2019s manslaughter crime in paragraph 24 of his amended PSI to specify his conviction was for being an \u201caccessory after the fact,\u201d rather than simply an \u201caccessory.\u201d The amended PSI already specifies that his conviction is for being an \u201caccessory\u201d to manslaughter; therefore, the language in the PSI is not erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Moreover, all references to Garcon\u2019s classification as an armed-career criminal were removed from the Amended PSI, and the judge\u2019s sentence reflects he was not an armed-career criminal. Because there is no error in the PSI regarding Garcon\u2019s prior conviction for being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter, Rule 36 relief is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
