After receiving a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, he brought suit pro se under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) for wrongful discharge and failure to accommodate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted summary judgment against Mr. Dorsey\u2019s claims, finding that he was not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d under the ADA and that no reasonable accommodation was possible. Mr. Dorsey appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Mr. Dorsey explains that he already had back injuries when he applied to work as an employee of Protemp Staffing at Boise Cascade Company\u2019s plant. He disclosed those injuries and was hired by Protemp and. placed in a job which he was able to perform. Things went well at the plant until September 21, 2011, when he was asked to help clear a clogged chipper machine. As Mr. Dorsey explains it, the chipper machine suddenly began moving while he was using a long hook to remove plywood panels from it. The sudden restarting of the machine jerked Mr. Dorsey into the air. The jerk and fall onto the ground caused severe pain in his back and neck. He asked for medical help, but was told by a supervisor to stay on the job and just \u201ctake it easy.\u201d The next day, he called Boise to explain that he could not come to work due to the pain, and asked again for medical help. He was told to wait for a Boise representative to call him back. While doing so, he received a call from a Protemp representative who told him he was fired for not reporting to work that day, and showed no interest in the accident other than advising him to get a lawyer. When he contacted Boise again, he was told he had to deal with Protemp, his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony and filings raise serious complaints about his treatment by Boise and Protemp, in whose service he was injured. However, as the district court found, Mr. Dorsey\u2019s ADA claims cannot survive summary judgment. The ADA protects certain \u201cqualified individuals\u201d from discrimination based on disability and affords them the right to reasonable accommodations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cQualified individuals\u201d are those \u201cwho, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Dorsey argues that he is a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d but his pleadings establish that on the date of his September 2011 discharge, he could not go in to work due to the pain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>He stated in sworn deposition testimony-on June 1, 2012 in a related Worker\u2019s Compensation case that he could not perform any employment whatsoever due to his injuries. On June 12, 2014, Mr. Dorsey again agreed in deposition testimony that he could not \u201cimagine that anyone could ... create a job that [he] could do right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony makes it clear that at the time he was discharged and denied medical care by Boise and Pro-temp, he was unable to work, and that he remained unable to work for some time thereafter, no matter what accommodations were provided. A person who cannot do any work, let alone the particular work required for the job from which he was discharged, is not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d under the ADA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record suggests that Mr. Dorsey at some point in 2018 may have become able to do light work, but \u201c[t]he relevant time for determining whether the plaintiff is a \u2018qualified individual with a disability\u2019 is at the time of discharge.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201cindefinite leave\u201d until a worker recovers enough to work is not a reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The court recognizes the serious nature of Mr. Dorsey\u2019s complaint, but the ADA is simply not designed for a situation such as this, where a workplace accident injures a worker so severely that he is unable to continue working. Because Mr. Dorsey is not a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d his ADA claims cannot survive summary judgment. Mr. Dorsey\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
