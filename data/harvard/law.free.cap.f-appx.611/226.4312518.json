This court reviews the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). However, to the extent that Lopez failed to object to his sentence in the district court, this court reviews for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u2018We have rejected the arguments that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 improperly double counts prior convictions and that it lacks an empirical basis. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). This court has also rejected substantive reasonableness challenges based on the alleged lack of seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). The district court sentenced Lopez within the guidelines range after listening to his mitigating arguments, and the \u201csentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). In short, Lopez has failed to show that the district court committed any error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
