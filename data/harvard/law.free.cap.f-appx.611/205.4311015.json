He contends that the district court plainly erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his 1996 Louisiana conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana was a felony drug trafficking offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moncrieffe v. </em>Holder; \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), as well as our decision in <em>United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268 (5th Cir.2005), he contends that the Louisiana statute under which he was convicted is broader than the drug trafficking offense definition set forth in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 because it proscribes the possession with intent to give away and administer a controlled substance. Because Jaimes-Jaimes did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005), <em>superseded, by regulation on other grounds as stat-. ed in United States v. Pimpton, </em>558 Fed.Appx. 335, 337-38 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">In <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2015) (No. 14-10355), we held that an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) is warranted regardless whether the conviction for the prior drug trafficking offense required proof of remuneration or commercial activity. Further, Jaimes-Jaimes has failed to establish a realistic probability that Louisiana would prosecute an individual under LA. REV. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 40:966(A)(1) for administering a controlled substance \u201cin a way that does not also constitute either \u2018dispensing\u2019 or \u2018distributing\u2019 under the federal sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). Therefore, Jaimes-Jaimes cannot show error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
