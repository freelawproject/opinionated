The district court denied Perez\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Perez is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">Perez must have statutory authority for the filing of his motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>See Veldhoen v. United States Coast Guard, </em>35 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1994). Had Perez\u2019s motion been construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court would have lacked jurisdiction to consider it because he had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and we have not authorized him to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Further, Perez\u2019s jurisdictional challenge to the indictment was not a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion,\u201d and consequently, his motion could not have been construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition brought via the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-23\">Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) allows a district court to modify a sentence under certain narrow circumstances, none of those circumstances were implicated by Perez\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. See \u00a7 3582(c). He was also precluded from obtaining relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, as relief thereunder is reserved only for direct appeals. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Finally, Perez\u2019s motion did not qualify as a writ of coram nobis or a writ of audita querela. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 489 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Jimenez v. Trominski, </em>91 F.3d 767, 768 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Perez\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment did not fall into a recognized category of post-conviction motions, and th\u00e9refore it was, in essence, \u201ca meaningless, unauthorized motion\u201d which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. Because he has failed to show that the instant appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), Perez\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">' MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
