Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)); committed during a drinking episode. The plea was induced by the court\u2019s promise further confinement, if any, would not exceed two years, the mitigated term. Eventually, Alkire received probation, under a suspended imposition of sentence, served one year as a condition, and was ordered not to use alcoholic beverages during the probation term. Five days after his release from jail he was arrested for being under the influence. Probation was then revoked and he was sentenced to state prison for a three-year term. He correctly claims this violates the promise which induced his change of plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (c) states: \u201cUpon any revocation and termination of probation the court may, if the <em>sentence </em>has been suspended, pronounce judgment for any time <em>within the longest period for which the person might have been sentenced. </em>However, if the judgment has been pronounced and the execution thereof had been suspended, the court may revoke such suspension and order that the judgment shall be in full force and effect. In either case, the person shall be delivered over to the proper officer to serve his sentence, less any credits herein provided for.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Although, \u201cthe longest period for which ... [Alkire] may have been sentenced\u201d is susceptible to two possible interpretations: (1) the four-year maximum term prescribed by Penal Code section 245, or (2) the two-year cap enunciated in the plea bargain agreement\u2014\u201c[w]here the statute is susceptible of two reasonable constructions ... a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>dant is ordinarily entitled to that construction most favorable to him. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 488 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Moreover, rule 435(b)(1) of the California Rules of Court requires: \u201c(b) Upon revocation and termination of probation pursuant to section 1203.2, when the sentencing judge determines that the defendant shall be committed to prison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201c(1 j If the imposition of sentence was previously suspended ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\"><em>\u201cThe length of the sentence shall be based on circumstances existing at the time probation was granted, </em>and subsequent events may not be considered in selecting the base term nor in deciding whether to strike or specifically not order the additional punishment for enhancements charged and found.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Here, at the time probation was granted Alkire could have been sentenced to a term no longer than two years\u2014pursuant to the negotiated plea arrangement. The plea bargain, therefore, constituted the only <em>relevant circumstance </em>existing when probation was granted, and necessarily determines the length of Alkire\u2019s sentence upon revocation of probation. To hold otherwise ignores the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Under different circumstances, if the court had not suspended sentence but pronounced the two-year cap under the plea bargain and then suspended its execution before granting probation, Alkire would face only his promised two years upon violation of the probation. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 435(b)(2);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.2, subd. (c), <em>supra.) </em>There is no reasonable purpose in subjecting him to an additional two years\u2014simply because the court chose to suspend imposition, rather than actually impose, sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Finally, had Alkire waived probation, opting instead for immediate incarceration, under the plea bargain (see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 433(a)(2)) he would only have been subject to an actual term of two years\u2014less 115 days credit for time already served. Nowhere does the record show he voluntarily waived his right to be sentenced in this man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ner, nor that he understood the conditions of his probation included the possibility of serving four years state prison time in the event he violated its terms. The colloquy during the <em>change of plea hearing </em>does not show otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cThe Court: Now, is this crime a felony or misdemeanor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201cDefendant Alkire: A felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cThe Court: What is the maximum sentence you could receive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">\u201cDefendant Alkire: Two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">\u201cMr. Smith: Four years for the crime, two years on the plea bargain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">\u201cThe Court: Four years in state prison and a fine of $5,000 is the maximum?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">\u201cDefendant Alkire: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">\u201cThe Court: And if you were sent to state prison and parole revoked, you could be sent back to state prison for four years. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">\u201cDefendant Alkire: Yes, Sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">Although the dissent believes this admonition adequately informed Alkire of his maximum penalty\u2014in the event he violated probation, a close reading of the transcript reveals <em>probation </em>was not anticipated at this stage. Rather, the statement was an attempt to advise him of the <em>parole </em>consequences of his guilty plea\u2014as set forth in Penal Code section 3000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 433(e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">Each party agrees the precise issues presented here were resolved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 753 [118 Cal.Rptr. 924], and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 583 [120 Cal.Rptr. 127]. However, <em>Allen </em>does not involve, or even discuss, our issue, and <em>Turner </em>is factually different.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>First of all, in this case, the plea bargain form stated as follows: \u201cJudge <em>promises </em>that should further custody be imposed, a term no greater than 2 years, the mitigated term shall be imposed.\u201d (Italics added.) The court orally read this exact phrase (albeit piecemeal) to insure Alkire\u2019s awareness of the judge\u2019s promise. There is no limitation on when, or in what manner, the <em>further custody </em>is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>is not in point. There the prosecution unsuccessfully appealed a postjudgment probation term modification releasing Allen from custody earlier than contemplated in a plea bargain. The Court of Appeal ruled only on the question of whether such a plea bargain, setting specific custodial probation terms, deprived the court of its inherent judicial power to modify those terms in the absence of express language to that effect. Then, in dicta, irrelevant to its resolution of that issue, the court stated: \u201cpost-judgment modification of probation can make the ultimate disposition of the case more onerous to defendant than originally bargained for.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 590.) The People tell us this language is a statement a defendant violating probation may be sentenced accordingly, notwithstanding the terms of any plea bargain. This misstates the holding which was concerned only with the power of the court to modify continuing terms of probation, a proposition with which we need not quarrel since our case does not involve a modification of existing probation terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In <em>Turner </em>the defendant was not promised any specific limitation on the length of his incarceration, only that he would do his time, if any, locally. After violating probation by pulling an armed robbery,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was sentenced to prison. Before entering his bargained plea, the court expressly advised he faced a maximum sentence of one to fifteen years in state prison. At sentencing Turner was asked if he accepted each term of his probation, and he did so. (Alkire was never advised he had the right to object to probation, nor was he advised one of the consequences of his failing to fulfill each condition of probation could be his being sent to state prison for a term in excess of the \u201cpromised\u201d two years.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In <em>Turner </em>the court stressed there was nothing in the plea bargain providing for what would happen should probation be violated. Here, implicit in the judge\u2019s promise is a two-year limitation on any state prison time should it be imposed. The language would not alert anyone of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>potential exposure to a longer term. If we take the prosecution\u2019s position, that granting of probation somehow affects the promised incarceration maximum, we could find it really means, as the trial court apparently felt, no more than two years each time you have the opportunity to revoke, or modify probation. This inappropriately relegates the bargaining process to one of dealing in sleight-of-hand, shadows and illusions when dealing with substantial legal and constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Even here, the sentencing judge was uncertain whether he was bound by the bargain made and accepted by the \u201cpromising\u201d judge, and believed he was honoring the plea bargain because the midterm, three-year commitment really resulted in a new, current two years of service (because the one year already served as a condition of probation must be credited against that term).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In every case involving a bargain setting a maximum term of incarceration, the prosecution would have us insert implied language essentially as follows: \u201cwe will give you the mitigated two-year prison term if we decide to send you to prison now, but if you are successful in convincing the court you deserve a chance on probation, and fail, all bets are off and you may be sentenced to the aggravated term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Assuming such a bargain may be struck, it must at least be expressed at a time when a defendant still has the ability to negotiate, not after negotiations are closed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The appropriate relief where a plea bargain is expressly, or impliedly, rejected by the court <em>before imposing any restrictions on a defendant by way of sentence, or probation while suspending sentence imposition, </em>is to give a defendant the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea, go back to square one and put the People to their proof. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.5.) Alkire has already served time as a condition of probation and the preplea status quo cannot be restored. He is entitled to his bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Judgment is modified to show the state prison commitment to be two years, the mitigated term. The trial court and the Department of Corrections are ordered to change their records accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Langford, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-10\"> California Rules of Court, rule 435(b)(2) reads: \u201cIf the execution of sentence was previously suspended, the judge shall order that the judgment previously pronounced be in full force and effect and that the defendant be committed to the custody of the Director of Corrections for the term prescribed in that judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-16\"> Even under Penal Code section 3000, however, in the event Alkire\u2019s parole was revoked, he could be sent back to the state prison only for the remainder of his term as bargained for under the plea arrangement (616 days).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\"> The opinion stressed the significance of the manner in which the probation terms were violated. If this is significant, we point to the gross disparity between Alkire\u2019s breach and that of Turner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\"> It might be said, Alkire cannot complain the court is now reneging on its part of the bargain since his probation default violates the bargain. However, Alkire agreed only to waive his constitutional rights to trial, confrontation, etc., enter a plea of guilty to the charge and expose himself to a potential two-year state prison sentence. When he withdrew his not guilty plea, and entered the plea upon which he stands convicted, he gave the prosecution all it bargained for.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b80-12\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b80-5\">COLOGNE, Acting P\u201e J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aym\">I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">When the plea bargain was struck, Alkire agreed to waive his constitutional rights and plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)) on the condition, among others, the court at the upcoming probation and sentence hearing would not sentence him to serve more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The full statement of the bargain in the change of plea form which Alkire initialed in the margin and signed was as follows: \u201cDefendant to cop \u00a7 245(a) [count I]; people to dismiss all remaining counts and allegations. Defendant to be examined by appropriate body pursuant to Penal Code \u00a7 1203.03. Judge promises that should further custody be imposed, a term no greater than 2 years, the mitigated term shall be imposed. Defendant to make full restitution to victim for medical costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The trial court\u2019s full statement reflecting this aspect of the change of plea was: \u201cThe Court: Now, on the back here on paragraph 12 it says, \u2018Defendant to change his plea to Penal Code section 245(A), count one. People to dismiss all remaining counts and allegations. Defendant to be examined by appropriate body pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.03. Judge promises that should further custody be imposed in\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u201cMr. Smith [defense counsel]: Does it say no more than two years?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u201cThe Court: \u2018No greater than two years.\u2019 \u2018A term no greater than two years, the mitigating term shall be imposed. Defendant to make full restitution to victim for medical costs.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">\u201cDo you understand all that?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201cDefendant Alkire: Yes, sir.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The court could have sentenced him to two years and he would have had no complaint. Instead, Alkire was accorded more leniency than he bargained for\u2014he was given probation on certain specified conditions and he was advised if \u201cparole\u201d was violated he could be given up to four years in prison. The consideration for waiving his constitutional rights was fully given. If he had objected to probation or other terms of the bargain, he could have withdrawn his plea; he did not. Now, having eaten his cake, he wants it too.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 753 [118 Cal.Rptr. 924], the defendant initially pled guilty with a stipulation any time served would be local. At sentencing, the trial court rejected the stipulation and the plea was withdrawn. The case went to trial and following a mistrial, defendant entered a plea of guilty with the same agreement he would only be given local time and, further, his prior felony conviction allegation would be stricken. He was granted probation. Thereafter revocation proceedings were instituted and defendant was given an indeterminate state prison sentence. On appeal, the defendant contended the trial court violated the plea bargain by ordering state prison time. In response, this court opined: \u201cHere Turner pled guilty to a charge of burglary; he bargained for local time; he received probation. Probation was a more, not less, lenient sentence than Turner bargained for. There was nothing in this plea providing for what would happen if probation were violated. Needless to say, such a bargain would be difficult to negotiate since neither party would know in advance what the violation of probation might be. Here, after the violation occurred, there was no plea bargain involved because the bargain contemplated the initial sentencing proceeding only. It was within the discretion of the trial court to look at the situation anew .. . . \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d 753, at p. 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>This case is dispositive of the. issue before the court. Its essential holding is that where a defendant receives at the initial sentencing hearing the bargain or a more lenient sentence than the bargain provided, and he is granted probation, then the bargain is fulfilled and upon any future violation of probation the court may \u201clook at the situation anew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">There is no distinction between that case and this. By the process of judicial notice (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (d), 459), it is to be determined imposition of sentence was suspended in Turner\u2019s case just as it was in Alkire\u2019s.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (c), applies to each case permitting the court upon revocation of probation to \u201cpronounce judgment for any time within the longest period for which the person might have been sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization of the facts, I believe when the trial court here referred to \u201cfurther custody,\u201d it clearly was speaking of nothing more than custody immediately following Alkire\u2019s commitment to the Department of Corrections for the diagnostic study under Penal Code section 1203.03, the subject of the sentence just preceding the one using the quoted words. It is improper in my view to analyze the trial court\u2019s words without reference to the whole content of the bargain, and particularly the sentence immediately preceding the sentence using the phrase \u201cfurther custody.\u201d Thus, as I read the trial court\u2019s statement of the bargain, it had to do only with the upcoming hearing for sentencing pursuant to the plea bargain just completed. As in <em>Turner, </em>it had nothing to do with sentencing after a revocation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The record discloses at the sentencing hearing Alkire was advised the maximum penalty could be four years custody. The court asked Alkire if he understood the maximum sentence he could receive and his counsel stated \u201cfour years for the crime, two years on the plea bargain,\u201d but the court stated \u201cfour years in state prison and a fine of $5,000 is the maximum\u201d; the court then followed with \u201cand if you were sent to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>prison and parole revoked, you could be sent back to state prison for four years. Do you understand that?\u201d Alkire replied he did.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The fact Alkire\u2019s original sentence (probation) was more lenient than that bargained for removes the necessity of advising him he had a right to withdraw the plea if he was then sentenced to a term greater than that provided in the plea bargain since there would be no prejudice. He has had more than ample warning of the consequences in the event of a probation violation and a postjudgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The failure to observe the condition of probation to abstain from alcohol, which very clearly is a cause of his violent behavior, justified the sentence ultimately imposed especially when one considers the earlier probation report which suggested the upper term plus three years extra for a Penal Code 12022.7 enhancement. The Department of Corrections\u2019 diagnostic report referred to him as \u201can extremely high risk candidate for probation.\u201d The ultimate sentence imposing the three-year middle term without enhancement was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In connection with certain other points made by the majority, I cannot agree there is ambiguity in the language of Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (c), permitting application of a most favorable construction for defendants. The phrase allowing judgment upon probation revocation for the \u201clongest period for which the person [or defendant] might have been sentenced\u201d has been in the codified law since 1903 (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203, as amended by Stats. 1903, ch. 34). I am convinced the quoted phrase neither had nor has any possible reference to a plea bargained sentence inasmuch as plea bargaining was not even officially recognized until 1970 (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 208, 215 [145 Cal.Rptr. 686, 577 P.2d 1026]; <em>People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 595 [91 Cal.Rptr. 385, 477 P.2d 409]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.5, as added by Stats. 1970, ch. 1123).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The reference to the \u201clongest period\u201d is to the time period prescribed by the statutes, not to any plea bargained lesser sentence. Plain meaning of the phrase is reflected in decisions such as <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d 753, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 583 [120 Cal.Rptr. 127], in which it is said (at page 590): \u201c[P]ost-judgment modification of probation can make the ultimate disposition of the case more onerous to the defendant than originally bargained for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Valuable and correct precedents such as <em>Turner </em>and <em>Allen </em>should not be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Finally, viewing the record in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment, it cannot be said the court relied on facts arising postjudgment. At the sentencing hearing in which the judgment under review was made, in fixing the length of sentence, the court said nothing about events arising after the original grant of probation. Accordingly, contrary to Alkire\u2019s argument, rule 435(b)(1) of the California Rules of court was not violated and the holding of the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Colley </em>(1980) 113 Cal. App.3d 870 [170 Cal.Rptr. 339], is inapplicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 28, 1981. Mosk, J., and Richardson, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\"> Benefits of the plea bargain to Alkire, aside from the reduced maximum term on the aggravated assault to which he was pleading, included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao4\">a. Dismissal of the allegation he personally inflicted great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7\u2014additional term of three years in prison).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A76\">b.

Dismissal of allegations of five prior felony convictions with terms separately served by Alkire (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)\u2014additional one-year prison term for each).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuZ\">d.

The essential repercussions of a violation of the terms of one\u2019s conditional freedom are similar whether that freedom is due technically to parole or to probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"> Similarly, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s inclusion of the plea bargained sentence within the meaning of the word \u201ccircumstances\u201d in rule 435(b)(1). \u201cCircumstances,\u201d as used in the sentencing rules, refers to the crime or the defendant, not the plea bargained sentence (see Cal.
