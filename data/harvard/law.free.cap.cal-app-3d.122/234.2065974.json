J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB7\">We have consolidated defendant Madaris\u2019 appeal from a judgment of conviction of violating Penal Code section 12021 (possession of a concealable firearm by one previously convicted of a felony), based upon a jury\u2019s verdict, with his concurrent application for a writ of habeas corpus based upon allegations of constitutionally inadequate representation by trial counsel concerning matters outside the appellate record (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 426 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859]).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The Appeal From the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">We find no merit, for the reasons we now state, in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">I.  Madaris\u2019 first <em>appellate </em>contention is that \u201cThe defendant was denied his constitutional right to effective aid of counsel in the preparation and trial of his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">It is argued that: \u201cIn this case the appellants\u2019 <em>[sic] </em>counsel at the trial level was not adequately prepared at trial to properly advise the appellant of his rights concerning the charge under Penal Code 12021(a). It was the lack of full and adequate legal research that prompted the trial counsel to work out a stipulation that in effect elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>nated the most crucial element from the charge under Penal Code section 12021(a).\u201d The argument is wholly without support in the appellate record, and thus meritless. (See <em>In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870, 875 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">It is also pointed out that: \u201cThe trial counsel convinced the court that there should be a stipulation by the appellant and the state that appellant admit his prior conviction as a felon ....\u201d By this obvious tactical ploy <em>outside of the jury\u2019s presence, </em>trial counsel was able to keep from the jury any knowledge that Madaris had previously been convicted of <em>robbery, </em>an advantage that is frequently, and we think wisely, sought by able trial counsel. The point is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The defense offered by Madaris was that his possession of the concealable firearm of the charge resulted when he wrested it from another in order to prevent immediate violence to yet another person. Pursuant to that defense the trial court instructed the jury that \u201cwhere there is no predesign or prior possession of a concealable firearm, the temporary possession of a concealable firearm by a person only while acting in the defense of another is not a violation of Penal Code section 12021(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">No merit is seen in the argument that counsel prejudicially \u201cpermitted\u201d Madaris to testify that under the above-noted circumstances he had temporarily and knowingly possessed the concealable firearm. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 12, 26-27 [148 Cal.Rptr. 409, 582 P.2d 1000].) The defense was a tactical choice (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Najera </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 504, 516 [105 Cal.Rptr. 345, 503 P.2d 1353]) and, further, we are of the opinion that counsel for a criminally accused witness is <em>not </em>under a duty to \u201cpermit\u201d him to testify other than truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Nor is trial counsel reasonably to be faulted for \u201cwithdrawing\u201d the instruction on \u201cwillfully,\u201d as found in CALJIC No. 1.20, stating as relevant that: the term \u201cimplies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act or to make the omission in question. The word does not require in its meaning any intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u201d Competent counsel, we opine, under the. circumstances here might reasonably conclude such an instruction more likely to prejudice, than benefit, his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u201cAnyone who seeks on appeal to predicate a reversal of conviction on error must show that it was prejudicial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Archerd </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 615, 643 [91 Cal.Rptr. 397, 477 P.2d 421].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>II. Madaris\u2019 next appellate contention follows: \u201cThe prosecution failed to prove the status of defendant as a felon as set out in section 12021(a) of the California Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">What Madaris characterizes as the prosecution\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d was the above mentioned stipulation, compelled by law upon his attorney\u2019s motion, \u201cso as to avoid any prejudice which might result from informing the jury that [Madaris] had been convicted of [the crime of robbery]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 143, 156-157 [167 Cal.Rptr, 844, 616 P.2d 826]), proof of which otherwise appears to have been readily available. As noted, the stipulation benefited, rather than prejudiced, Madaris and his case. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Archerd, supra, </em>3 Cal. 3d 615, 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">III.  Another assignment of judicial error is that: \u201cThe court erroneously admitted into evidence the fact that defendant had previously been convicted of theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Madaris having elected to testify on his own behalf, a <em>Beagle (People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1]) hearing was conducted out of the jury\u2019s presence which resulted in the trial court\u2019s ruling that he might be impeached by proof of his conviction of a \u201cfelony involving theft ... . \u201d Thus (as noted in part II above) was kept from the jury the inherent violence of Madaris\u2019 actual <em>robbery </em>conviction. The ruling was in full accord with <em>Beagle\u2019s </em>authority and strictures; it was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Nor do we find anything in <em>People </em>v. <em>Burdine </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 442 [160 Cal.Rptr. 375], holding that a five-year-old conviction, as here, is stale and for that reason, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">IV.  Madaris\u2019 final appellate contention is stated in this manner: \u201cThe jury\u2019s instructions were improper, confusing, inconsistent and constituted prejudicial error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">We quote from the supportive arguments: \u201cFirst, as has been previously mentioned, the instructions on \u2018willful!\u2019 were omitted.... Second, the court failed to instruct on the element of previous conviction of appellant as a part of section 12021(a) of the Penal Code.\u201d (For the above stated reasons (parts I and II above) these arguments lack merit.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cThird, the court instructed on flight as specified in CALJIC 252 ....\u201d (Such an instruction was supported by substantial evidence, and has repeatedly been approved as a correct statement of law. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 711, 719 [161 Cal.Rptr. 830]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 122, 124-125 [161 Cal.Rptr. 293]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 672, 678-679 [156 Cal. Rptr. 646]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 42, 45 [156 Cal. Rptr. 235].)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u201cNext, the court gave an erroneous instruction on motive. The court stated, \u2018However, you may consider motive or lack of motive, as a circumstance in this case. Absence [sic] of motive may tend to establish guilt. Absence of motive may tend to establish innocence.\u2019 ... Out of this error it can only be inferred that no motive is needed to establish guilt.\u201d (From the entire instruction it is manifest that the jury were not misled by the trial court\u2019s inadvertent substitution of \u201cabsence\u201d for \u201cpresence\u201d in the sentence \u201cAbsence of motive may tend to establish guilt.\u201d And it is settled law that \u201cno motive at all\u201d is needed to establish guilt. (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) Elements of Crime, \u00a7 54, pp. 59-60.))</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u201cFinally, the appellant requested but was denied an instruction regarding expert testimony. ... This was important because Officer Lindberg testified as to the concealability of the weapon in question .... This person gave testimony as an expert as to concealability of the firearm. As such the court should have instructed the jury on that point.\u201d (\u201cExpert testimony as to facts may be necessary where the facts from which conclusions are to be drawn are peculiarly within the expert\u2019s knowledge and are not a matter of common knowledge as to which an ordinary witness may competently testify.\u201d (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) The Opinion Rule, \u00a7 407, pp. 365-366.) We are of the opinion that the trial court reasonably concluded that the concealability of a firearm is \u201ca matter of common knowledge as to which an ordinary witness may competently testify.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The application was made on Madaris\u2019 behalf by his appellate attorney \u201cunder penalty of perjury ... . \u201d There is a threshold question. It concerns the duty of a reviewing court where a criminal appeal on a trial record is attended by an application for a writ of habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>founded upon claimed constitutional inadequacy of trial counsel, <em>as to which no record is available.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Madaris argues that, having consolidated his appeal with his application for habeas corpus, we, under compulsion of <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587], <em>must </em>issue an order to show cause why the writ should not be granted, returnable for hearing and disposition before this, or the superior, court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The point, we think, was recently answered by the state\u2019s high court. <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 288-296 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149], in a closely similar procedural context affirmed a judgment of conviction and summarily denied a petition for writ of habeas corpus founded on alleged and unrecorded constitutional inadequacy of defense counsel. The court found that the petition had failed \u201cto reveal sufficient facts to establish even a prima facie case\u201d for relief (pp. 289-290).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We inquire whether such a prima facie case has here been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">We note initially that the <em>burden </em>\u201cof proving a claim of inadequate trial assistance\u201d rests upon the habeas corpus applicant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 814, 828 [163 Cal.Rptr. 601, 608 P.2d 689]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 412, 425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">A petition for habeas corpus \u201cmust be verified by the oath or affirmation of the party making the application.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1474.) Without such a verification the petition, at least ordinarily, will be summarily denied. <em>(In re Newell </em>(1923) 64 Cal.App. 103 [220 P. 425].) Verification, under the statute, manifestly requires that all factual matters <em>relied upon </em>be stated by their declarant, whomsoever he may be, under o\u00e1th.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The record upon which Madaris founds his habeas corpus application consists of <em>unsworn </em>statements of his trial attorney and a declaration under penalty of perjury of his attorney on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The <em>unsworn </em>statement of Madaris\u2019 <em>trial </em>attorney recites, as relevant: \u201cI never called a witness by the name of Mike Garsa. The petitioner gave me his name, address and telephone number. However, I did not interview this witness prior to the trial. I knew that he was a character witness for truthfulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The <em>sworn </em>declaration of Madaris\u2019 <em>appellate </em>attorney recites: \u201c1. I interviewed Mike Garsa on July 10, 1980. 2. Mike Garsa owns A.C. Auto Wreckers, 220 Rincon, San Francisco, California. 3. Mike Garsa has known Derek R. Medaris [sic] for two to three years beginning in 1977 and up until the present. Derek Maderis [sic] was employed by Mike Garsa. 4. Derek was a reliable worker and he always showed the best type of work habits. 5. Derek stayed and took care of the office when Mike Garsa went on vacation. 6. Mike Garsa believes that Derek Maderis is a truthful and honest person. He was the most honest and best person that ever worked for him. 7. Mike Garsa would like to have Derek Maderis work for him again and wants Derek Maderis to be released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The latter declaration is plainly the equivalent of what will reasonably be called typical courtroom hearsay, i.e., sworn testimony of a witness conveying an out-of-court unsworn statement of another, that is offered to the court \u201cto prove the truth of the matter stated\u201d (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200), and which, if here produced before the trial jury, would probably have resulted in a different verdict. Offered for any other reason the declaration would have no conceivable evidentiary, or procedural, purpose or validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It has long been the rule of California that factual allegations on which a petition for habeas corpus are based must be \u201cin such form that perjury may be assigned upon the allegations if they are false.\u201d <em>(Ex parte Walpole </em>(1890) 84 Cal. 584 [24 P. 308].) Here the critical allegations were patently not in such form.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Madaris has not met the requirement of <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 264, that his petition reveal \u201ca prima facie case\u201d for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Additionally, we observe high authority that trial counsel\u2019s failure to call certain witnesses upon a criminal trial will usually be deemed \u201ctrial tactics as to which [reviewing courts] will not ordinarily exercise judicial hindsight.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 441, 458.) The wisdom of such a rule becomes patent in light of the case at bench. Experienced trial judges and attorneys are well aware that testimony of an accused\u2019s good reputation for honesty and truthfulness is, as often as not, followed by an onslaught of contrary evidence; here, as we have by now repetitiously pointed out, trial counsel might reasonably have expected evidence of Madaris\u2019 theretofore suppressed robbery conviction to be unfolded before the jury. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 786.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Pope </em>tells us that where possible: \u201c[T]he appellate court must look to see if the record contains any explanation for the challenged aspect of representation. If it does, the court must inquire whether the explanation demonstrates that counsel was reasonably competent and acting as a conscientious, diligent advocate.\u201d (23 Cal.3d, p. 425.) Here the record, as noted, demonstrates a probable tactical purpose of counsel within the range of reasonable competence; in such situations reviewing courts will not \u201csecond-guess\u201d trial counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frierson, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 142, 158.) It seems unreasonable to allow a concert of trial and appellate attorneys, under circumstances where the prosecution\u2019s refutation is ordinarily <em>impossible, </em>to impugn an inference reasonably, and properly, drawn from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Moreover, we observe that in an otherwise proper case \u201cviolations of the right to counsel may be disregarded as harmless error.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1981) 449 U.S. 361 [66 L.Ed.2d 564, 568, 101 S.Ct. 665, 668].) Were we, arguendo, to accept as true Madaris\u2019 instant contentions, we should be obliged to apply that doctrine. The case against Madaris was strong, and it is reasonably certain that had the testimony of Mike Garsa been offered and allowed, greater harm than benefit would have resulted from the then permissible evidence of Madaris\u2019 pri- or <em>robbery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The judgment from which Madaris has appealed (1 Crim. No. 21170) is affirmed. His application for a writ of habeas corpus (1 Crim. No. 21666) is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b161-8\">GRODIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1z\">I concur in the opinion of the court insofar as it affirms the conviction on appeal (1 Crim. No. 21170), and I agree that defendant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus (1 Crim. No. 21666) should be denied. I write separately to express somewhat different views as to the latter issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The claim of incompetency asserted in the petition\u2014the failure of defendant\u2019s trial counsel to interview or to call a potential character witness\u2014is of necessity based upon facts outside the appellate record and is, therefore, appropriately raised through petition for hab\u00e9as corpus. (<em>In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 426 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859].) The question presented is whether, taking the facts alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>as true, the defendant has established a prima facie case for relief. <em>(In re Lawler </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 190, 194 [150 Cal.Rptr. 833, 588 P.2d 1257].) If so, then an order to show cause should issue, and an evidentiary hearing held if necessary. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Such a procedure is expressly contemplated by <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>and the possibility that trial and appellate attorneys acted in \u201cconcert,\u201d whatever the implications of that term, is no bar to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">I agree that in this case the petition, read in conjunction with the appellate record, does not establish a prima facie case of incompetency of counsel requiring reversal. I do not base this conclusion upon characterization of the declaration by defendant\u2019s appellate counsel as \u201chearsay,\u201d since it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter stated by the witness Garsa, but rather to establish what Garsa would have testified if he had been called as a witness. Rather, I base this conclusion upon the lack of specificity in the petition (we are not told, for example, when defendant advised his trial counsel of Garsa\u2019s existence or potential testimony), in the face of an appellate record which suggests both the plausibility of a tactical explanation for not calling Garsa as a witness and the extreme improbability that calling him as a witness would have made a difference in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
