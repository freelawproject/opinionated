The Supplier sued for the contract price and reasonable value of materials provided the Contractor and utilized on the job, including as one of its counts a cause of action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien against the leasehold interest of the Owner. Owner cross-complained against Supplier for damages based upon an alleged failure to provide state-required certifications of the electrical equipment and for delay in performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">All issues raised by the pleadings were resolved by summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Supplier. While the form of the judgment might appear somewhat more broad, the affirmative relief granted is characterized in the respondent-Supplier\u2019s appellate brief as solely the foreclosure of its mechanic\u2019s lien.  The Supplier further stipulated in the brief that the recovery of judgment on this single cause of action merged all other theories upon which the complaint was premised, thereby precluding any further action on same. These statements constitute judicial admissions which are binding upon the Supplier. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 666, 674 [38 Cal.Rptr. 291]; <em>Arruda </em>v. <em>Arruda </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 410, 417 [32 Cal.Rptr. 257].) Therefore, on appeal the only questions presented concern the propriety of granting summary judgment (1) foreclosing the mechanic\u2019s lien, and (2) dismissing the Owner\u2019s cross-complaint for damages for failure of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">It is well established that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the court may look only to the <em>evidence </em>before it, which is presented by means of declarations under penalty of perjury, affidavits, admissions, answers to interrogatories, or depositions. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.) The pleadings do not constitute evidence (particularly should this be so in cases where they are unverified, as here) in support of the pleader. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 188, p. 2837.)  Reviewing the evidence before the court, we find that the moving party-Supplier filed declarations detailing the terms of the contract with the Contractor; identifying items ordered and delivered, together with dates and values thereof; setting forth the details of the recordation of mechanic\u2019s lien claims; admitting the lack of any direct contract with the Owner; denying any obligation to furnish state-required certifications; and generally stating facts showing full performance of the contract and delivery of goods used on the jobsite of a value equal to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Defendant Owner filed a \u201cStatement in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d but by way of evidence provided only a two-page declaration of the general partner of Owner. This document controverted none of the factual material produced by the Supplier, save and excepting only minor allegations concerning completion of the job. In this regard, the Owner\u2019s evidence shows that no notice of completion of the work of improvement had even been recorded, that the project had not been completed or occupied or accepted by the Owner, and that no cessation of work had occurred on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">In summary, then, all of the factual contentions of the Supplier were admitted except for facts relating to completion of the job by the Owner. The ruling in favor of the Supplier on the Owner\u2019s cross-complaint is therefore fully justified. The only facts in issue are those bearing upon time periods relating to the foreclosure of the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Stipulated facts having to do with the lien are as follows: The Supplier furnished materials in March and April 1978. On July 21, 1978, it recorded a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien. No action was ever commenced to foreclose this lien. A second mechanic\u2019s lien claim was recorded on February 13, 1979, upon which this action to foreclose was commenced on May 8, 1979. Accepting the respondent-Owner\u2019s version of the facts relative to completion, we assume for purposes of the summary judgment motion that the project has never been completed, and work thereon continues.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Appellant-Owner, recognizing the authority of <em>Schwarz &amp; Gottlieb, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marcuse </em>(1917) 175 Cal. 401 [165 P. 1015], concedes that the filing of one claim of lien does not bar additional filings during the statutory period of permissible filings. Hence, failure to bring an action to foreclose a lien during the 90-day period will not necessarily preclude lien relief, provided the lienor is within the time frame during which a second claim of lien may be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Owner\u2019s contention, however, is that any claim of lien must be filed within a specified period of time from a \u201cstarting point,\u201d suggesting that several \u201cstarting points\u201d are provided by the statute. One \u201cstarting point,\u201d it is claimed, is the subcontractor\u2019s cessation of furnishing of labor or materials to the job; and the subsequent starting points are either the completion of work on the project or the recordation of notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>completion or cessation of -work. Since 90 days had passed from the first \u201cstarting point,\u201d and the second \u201cstarting point\u201d had never occurred, the second lien claim was not timely filed. The support for this contention is assertedly found in <em>Schwarz </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, supra, </em>at page 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The difficulty with this contention is that the statute in effect in 1917 was different from that prevailing in 1978. In 1917, the applicable section (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1187) required a lienor who was not an original contractor to record his claim \u201cwithin thirty days after he has ceased to labor or has ceased to furnish materials, or both; or at his option, within thirty days after completion of the original contract, if any, under which he was employed . ... \u201d This section therefore provided two times for the commencement of defined periods within which a claim could be filed\u2014one \u201cstarting date\u201d was the completion of work by the subcontractor (after which he could file the claim within 30 days), and the other \u201cstarting date\u201d was the completion of the total project (after which he again could file within 30 days). The currently applicable authority, Civil Code section 3116<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> retains as an initial date after which a claim can be filed the completion of work by the subcontractor, but does <em>not </em>utilize this date as a \u201cstarting date\u201d for the tolling of any statute of limitations within which additional claims must be filed. The \u201cstarting dates\u201d for tolling the period of filing all have to do with completion of the work of improvement or cessation of work, and provide for a 90-day period if no notice of completion is recorded by the owner, or a 30-day period after such notice has been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">There is, therefore, no merit in appellant-Owner\u2019s contention. Since the claim of lien was filed during the period of work on the project as a whole, before any cessation of such work or notice of completion was filed, the claim of lien was filed within the statutory period. The action to foreclose the lien was brought within 90 days of its date of recordation. Because of lack of evidence from Owner relative to the goods furnished or the amount of the lien, the evidence produced by the Supplier is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Cologne, Acting P.
