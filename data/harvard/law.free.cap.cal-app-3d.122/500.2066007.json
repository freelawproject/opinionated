Daly, who died in July 1978. The complaint contains seven causes of action. The first cause of action (for declaratory relief) alleges: Plaintiff, Randal Jones, first met James Daly in December 1975. Between that time and March 1976, they \u201cmet on frequent occasions, dated, engaged in sexual activities and, in general, acted towards one another as two people do who have discovered a love, one for the other.\u201d In March 1976 plaintiff and Daly orally agreed that plaintiff would move into Daly\u2019s condominium with Daly, quit his job, go travelling with Daly and \u201ccohabit with him [Daly] as if [they] were, in fact, married.\u201d They also entered into an oral agreement (referred to hereinafter, in the language of the complaint, as \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d) whereby each agreed: during the time \u201cthey lived and cohabited together,\u201d they would combine their efforts and earnings and would share equally any and all property accumulated as a result of their efforts, whether individual or combined, except that Daly would give plaintiff a monthly allowance for his personal use, and they \u201cwould hold themselves out to the public at large as cohabiting mates, and [plaintiff] would render his services as a lover, companion, homemaker, traveling companion, housekeeper and cook to Daly\u201d; and \u201cin order that [plaintiff] would be able to devote a substantial portion of his time to Daly\u2019s benefit as his lover, companion, homemaker, traveling companion, housekeeper and cook,\u201d plaintiff would abandon \u201ca material portion\u201d of his potential career as a model, and in return Daly would furnish financial support to plaintiff for the rest of his life. Pursuant to and in reliance on the \u201ccohabitors agreement,\u201d plaintiff and Daly \u201ccohabited and lived together continuously\u201d from March 1976 until Daly\u2019s death, and plaintiff allowed himself to be known to the general public \u201cas the lover and cohabitation mate of Daly.\u201d Plaintiff performed all of the terms and conditions required to be performed by him under the \u201ccohabitors agreement.\u201d During the time that plaintiff and Daly \u201clived and cohabited together\u201d they acquired, as a result of their efforts and earnings, substantial real and personal property (hereinafter, in the language of the complaint, \u201ccohabitors\u2019 equitable property\u201d). Plaintiff does not know the exact nature and extent of such property, but he believes it has a value in excess of $2 million and will amend the complaint to reflect the true value when it is ascertained. Under the \u201ccohabitors agreement,\u201d all of the \u201ccohabitors\u2019 equitable property\u201d was to be shared and divided equally between plaintiff and Daly. All of such property is in the possession of defendant executors and under their control. Plaintiff has demanded that defendants recognize his interest in the \u201ccohabitors\u2019 equitable property,\u201d but defendants refuse to do so. On November 1, 1978, plaintiff filed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>proceeding for probate of Daly\u2019s estate a creditor\u2019s claim, wherein he claimed one-half of the estate; defendants denied the claim. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between plaintiff and defendants in that plaintiff contends, and defendants deny, that as a result of the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d plaintiff is entitled to one-half of all of the \u201ccohabitors\u2019 equitable property\u201d as a tenant in common with the estate of Daly and that defendants are under a duty to pay to plaintiff, on behalf of the estate, a reasonable sum for his support. Plaintiff desires a judicial determination of the validity of the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d and the respective rights, duties and obligations of plaintiff and defendants under that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The terms of the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d alleged in the first cause of action are incorporated into each of the subsequent causes of action other than the sixth and seventh causes of action. The second and third causes of action seek payment of plaintiffs creditor\u2019s claim rejected by defendants. The fourth cause of action seeks half of the \u201ccohabitors\u2019 equitable property\u201d on the theory of a constructive trust. The fifth cause of action alleges an implied in fact agreement between plaintiff and Daly for the equal division of all assets standing in Daly\u2019s name. The sixth and seventh causes of action are common counts which seek $300,000 as the reasonable value of plaintiffs services to Daly.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"> Defendants demurred specially to the first cause of action on the ground of uncertainty, and demurred generally to all causes of action. The trial court sustained the demurrer to each cause of action without leave to amend<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cper moving points and authorities.\u201d One of the arguments advanced by defendants in support of their demurrer was that under <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Marvin </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 660 [134 Cal.Rptr. 815, 557 P.2d 106], the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d is unenforceable because the complaint shows on its face that plaintiffs rendition of sexual services to Daly was an express and inseparable part of the consideration for the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Marvin, supra, </em>18 Cal. 3d 660, a woman sued a man with whom she had lived for approximately six years without marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>alleging: that she and defendant entered into an oral agreement that while the parties lived together they would combine their efforts and earnings and would share equally in any and all property accumulated as a result of their efforts, whether individual or combined, that they would hold themselves out to the general public as husband and wife and that plaintiff would give up her career as an entertainer and singer in order to devote her full time to defendant as his companion, homemaker, housekeeper and cook; in return defendant agreed to provide for all of plaintiff\u2019s financial support and needs for the rest of her life. Plaintiff further alleged that after she had lived with defendant for almost six years, he forced her to leave his household and refused to recognize her rights under the contract. Plaintiff prayed for declaratory relief, asking the court to determine her contractual and property rights, and also to impose a constructive trust on half of the property acquired during the course of the relationship. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.  The Supreme Court reversed the judgment, stating: \u201cIn summary, we base our opinion on the principle that adults who voluntarily live together and engage in sexual relations are nonetheless as competent as any other persons to contract respecting their earnings and property rights. Of course, they cannot lawfully contract to pay for the performance of sexual services, for such a contract is, in essence, an agreement for prostitution and unlawful for that reason. But they may agree to pool their earnings and to hold all property acquired during the relationship in accord with the law governing community property; conversely they may agree that each partner\u2019s earnings and the property acquired from those earnings remains the separate property of the earning partner. <em>So long as the agreement does not rest upon illicit meretricious consideration, </em>the parties may order their economic affairs as they choose, and no policy precludes the courts from enforcing such agreements.\u201d (18 Cal.3d at p. 674; italics added; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In determining whether the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d rests upon illicit meretricious consideration, we are guided by the following principles: \u201c[A] contract between nonmarital partners, even if expressly made in contemplation of a common living arrangement, is invalid only if sexual acts form an inseparable part of the consideration for the agreement.  In sum, a court will not enforce a contract for the pooling of property and earnings if it is explicitly and inseparably based upon services as a paramour.\u201d <em>(Marvin </em>v. <em>Marvin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 660, 672.) The complaint herein alleges: Following their initial meeting, plaintiff and Daly \u201cdated, engaged in sexual activities and, in general, acted to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>wards one another as two people do who have discovered a love, one for the other\u201d; plaintiff orally agreed \u201cto cohabit with [Daly] as if [they] were, in fact, married\u201d; at the same time they entered into the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d whereby they agreed that during the time \u201cthey lived and cohabited together\u201d they would hold themselves out to the public at large as \u201ccohabiting mates\u201d and plaintiff would render his services to Daly as \u201ca lover, companion, homemaker, traveling companion, housekeeper and cook\u201d (italics added); in order that plaintiff would be able to devote his time to Daly\u2019s benefit \u201cas his lover, companion, homemaker, traveling companion, housekeeper and cook,\u201d he would abandon his career; plaintiff and Daly \u201ccohabited and lived together\u201d and pursuant to and in reliance on the \u201ccohabitors agreement,\u201d plaintiff allowed himself to be known to the general public as the \u201clover and cohabitation mate\u201d of Daly. These allegations clearly show that plaintiff\u2019s rendition of sexual services to Daly was an inseparable part of the consideration for the \u201ccohabitors agreement,\u201d and indeed was the predominant consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Plaintiff argues that the complaint is not subject to the foregoing interpretation because the \u201caccepted California concept of cohabitation is the mutual assumption of those marital rights, duties and obligations which are usually manifested by married people, including but <em>not necessarily dependent upon sexual </em>relations\u201d <em>(Boyd </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 374, 381 [39 Cal.Rptr. 400]; italics added); and while one meaning of the word \u201clover\u201d is paramour, it also may mean a person in love or an affectionate or benevolent friend. (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1966) p. 1340.)  Pleadings must be reasonably interpreted; they must be read as a whole and each part must be given the meaning that it derives from the context wherein it appears. <em>(Speegle </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Underwriters </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 34, 42 [172 P.2d 867]; <em>National Automobile &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 403, 408 [67 Cal.Rptr. 784].)  The complaint alleges that plaintiff and Daly engaged in sexual activities, agreed to cohabit and to hold themselves out to the public as cohabiting mates, and entered into the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d whereby plaintiff was to render services to Daly as a lover. Viewed in the context of the complaint as a whole, the words \u201ccohabiting\u201d and \u201clover\u201d do not have the innocuous meanings which plaintiff ascribes to them. These terms can pertain only to plaintiff's rendition of sexual services to Daly.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><em>Marvin </em>states that \u201ceven if sexual services are part of the contractual consideration, any <em>severable </em>portion of the contract supported by inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>pendent consideration will still be enforced.\u201d (18 Cal.3d at p. 672; italics in original.) That principle is inapplicable in the present case. There is no severable portion of the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d supported by independent consideration. According to the allegations of the complaint, the agreement provided that the parties would share equally the earnings and property accumulated as a result of their efforts while they lived together and that Daly would support plaintiff for the rest of his life. Neither the property sharing nor the support provision of the agreement rests upon plaintiff\u2019s acting as Daly\u2019s traveling companion, housekeeper or cook as distinguished from acting as his lover. The latter service forms an inseparable part of the consideration for the agreement and renders it unenforceable in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Since plaintiff\u2019s right to relief under the second through the fifth causes of action depends upon the validity of the \u201ccohabitors agreement,\u201d the trial court properly sustained the demurrer thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Appellant argues that the sixth and seventh causes of action (labelled, respectively, common counts in quantum meruit and for labor and services rendered) incorporated therein neither the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d nor any of the other allegations of the first cause of action relating to sexual services rendered by plaintiff to Daly, thus they are not subject to general demurrer. However, the common counts which are here sufficiently pleaded (see 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a7\u00a7 431, 436, 440, pp. 2088, 2093, 2094-2095) are so permeated with the same reason for the rendition of the \u201cservices rendered\u201d by plaintiff, i.e., the sexual cohabitation of the parties, that it cannot be said that the agreement by Daly to pay for those services does not also rest upon illegal meretricious consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We note that the period covered by the services rendered by plaintiff alleged in the common counts\u2014March 1976 through July 1978\u2014is the same time span covered by the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d alleged in the first cause of action; that the $300,000 prayed for in the common counts as the reasonable value of such services is alleged to be \u201cequivalent approximately to one-half of the total estate of Daly,\u201d and that it is a one-half interest in the \u201ccohabitors\u2019 equitable property\u201d acquired during the cohabitation of the parties that is prayed for under the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d in the other causes of action; and that incorporated into the common counts are allegations of the first cause of action relating to plaintiff\u2019s presentation of his creditor\u2019s claim to Daly\u2019s estate (a copy of which is attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>reference) which expressly rests on an \u201coral agreement\u201d entered into \u201c[a]bout March, 1976 through in or about July 1978,\u201d which \u201coral agreement\u201d is obviously the precise \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d described in the first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">While the simple pleading of the common counts standing alone would appear to be innocuous enough to withstand defendants\u2019 challenge, a common sense reading of the entire complaint promptly dispels any notion that the same element of illegal meretricious consideration that so infects the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d as to render it unenforceable does not as well dominate the common counts; and the reality of the situation dictates the conclusion that the recovery under the sixth and seventh causes of action is based on the exact set of circumstances specifically pleaded in the first cause of action. It is true that common counts are not subject to a general demurrer <em>(Auckland </em>v. <em>Conlin </em>(1928) 203 Cal. 776, <em>111 </em>[265 P. 946]; <em>Moya </em>v. <em>Northrup </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 276, 279 [88 Cal.Rptr. 783]; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>McLaglen </em>(1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 219, 223 [186 P.2d 48]), but here they are subject to the rule that \u201cif plaintiff is not entitled to recover under one count in a complaint wherein all the facts upon which his demand is based are specifically pleaded, it is proper to sustain a demurrer to a common count set forth in the complaint, the recovery under which is obviously based on the set of facts specifically pleaded in the other count.\u201d <em>(Hays </em>v. <em>Temple </em>(1937) 23 Cal.App.2d 690, 695 [73 P.2d 1248]; <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Southern Counties Gas Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 347, 353 [340 P.2d 608]; <em>Orloff </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Trust Co. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 484, 489 [110 P.2d 396]; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>National Auto, and Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 599, 606 [113 Cal.Rptr. 391]; <em>Zumbrun </em>v. <em>University of Southern California, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.3d 1, 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The only remaining question is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Ordinarily it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a general demurrer to a complaint without leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect in the complaint can be cured by amendment. <em>(Harman </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 150, 157 [101 Cal.Rptr. 880, 496 P.2d 1248]; <em>Lemoge Electric </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 659, 664 [297 P.2d 638].) However, the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Leslie Salt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Co. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 627, 636 [75 Cal.Rptr. 766, 451 P.2d 406].) That burden is not met where, as in the present case, plaintiff does not indicate either in the trial court or in this court the manner in which the complaint is proposed to be amended, and how that amendment will cure the defects in his pleading. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Leslie Salt Co., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at p. 636; <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 708, 716 [86 Cal.Rptr. 754].)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A complaint for declaratory relief is sufficient if it sets forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties under a contract and requests that those rights and duties be adjudged by the court. <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>Hibernia Bank </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 540, 549-550 [305 P.2d 20]; <em>Columbia Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>DeToth </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 753, 760 [161 P.2d 217, 162 A.L.R. 747].)  The first cause of action meets these requirements and the demurrer to that cause of action therefore was improperly sustained. However, \u201c[w]hile Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 entitles a plaintiff suing pursuant to its provisions to a declaration of rights and duties even if the eventual declaration may be adverse [citations], error of the trial court in refusing to entertain the action is nevertheless not prejudicial if it is clear from the face of the complaint that the plaintiff\u2019s position is untenable and that a declaration adverse to the plaintiff will end the matter.\u201d <em>(Warren </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 678, 684-685 [121 Cal.Rptr. 19].) The complaint shows on its face that the \u201ccohabitors agreement\u201d is unenforceable, conferring no rights on plaintiff and imposing no duties upon defendants. Inasmuch as the opinion of this court is the equivalent of an express declaration to that effect, reversal of the judgment of dismissal as to the first cause of action would serve no purpose and would simply constitute an idle act. (See <em>Taschner </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 48, 57 [107 Cal.Rptr. 214]; <em>Haley </em>v. <em>L. A. County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 285, 292-294 [342 P.2d 476]; 3 Witkin, Cal.

However, inasmuch as the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer in general terms, we must assume that the court ruled only on the general demurrer and not on the special demurrer. (See <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 529, 544 [93 Cal.Rptr. 866, 483 P.2d 34, 57 A.L.R. 301].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\"> Plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the order sustaining the demurrer without leave to.amend, and for an order overruling the demurrer or granting leave to amend the complaint.
