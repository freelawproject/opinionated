(Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23090.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In 1979 real parties applied for an onsale beer and wine license for the Marmalade Max Disco, in Roseville, California. The department denied the license on the ground that it \u201cwould create a law enforcement problem for the Police Department of Roseville.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23958.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board rejected the department\u2019s determination as unsupported by the findings and the findings as unsupported by substantial evidence (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22, II 7; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23084, subds. (c), (d)), but affirmed the denial on an alternative ground (zoning restrictions). The department petitioned this court for a writ of review, which we granted. Real parties have since obtained zoning approval and (upon our rejection of the department\u2019s motion for a stay) have been granted an on-sale beer and wine license for their establishment. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The Marmalade Max Disco is located near the city limits of Rose-ville in an area described by police witnesses as remote. Its remoteness, coupled with an increase in city population without a corresponding increase in police officers, they said, resulted in infrequency of police patroling and a longer response time to calls for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Sergeant Richard Fancher, supervisor of the late-night patrol shift, estimated that the average response time to the establishment was 10 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>15 minutes, though it depended on where the patrol car was when it received a call, and it might be as long as 20 minutes. Officer Frederick Rockholm testified that, on the three occasions he was called to the Marmalade Max Disco, his response time had varied (according to where he was when he received the call) from 5 or 10 minutes to 10 or 15 minutes. Officer William Hughes of the police department\u2019s administrative division testified that, during a recent period, the average police response time, city-wide, was 13.92 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The department found on the basis of this evidence that real parties\u2019 establishment was \u201cremote\u201d and the police department\u2019s manpower \u201climited,\u201d and that, as a result, response time to the establishment was \u201cslow.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">It was not seriously disputed, and the department accordingly found, that \u201csome police problems\u201d had occurred at the Marmalade Max Disco during the period it was operated without an alcoholic beverage license. The police witnesses testified that the department responded to about four calls per month at the establishment, for a variety of situations, including \u201cnumerous\u201d false alarms, liquor law (primarily age) violations, petty thefts, stolen automobiles and a stolen motorcycle, fighting and disturbing the peace, and at least one \u201cserious\u201d assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The evidence was in substantial conflict, however, as to the effect of granting the license, since real parties proposed to change the character of the establishment. \u201cDisco\u201d music would continue to be played, but persons under 21 years of age would be excluded. This would itself, real parties thought, discourage younger persons from coming there and drinking in their cars, a problem that had existed to some extent. In seeking a beer and wine license, real parties \u201caim[ed]\u201d at attracting a \u201csophisticated,\u201d monied clientele, aged 21 to 30 or 35. A dress code would be enforced. This \u201ccrowd\u201d would be unlike that of the bars in Roseville that featured \u201crock\u201d music; the owner testified that he had never seen a fight in any of a number of bars elsewhere which catered to the type of clientele he sought to attract. The establishment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>continue to employ two uniformed security guards, and would hire an \u201cadequate[ ]\u201d number of \u201cbouncers\u201d (probably four). Finally, due to structural modifications, occupancy would be cut from 800 to about 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">On the other hand, city Police Chief James A. Hall testified that police problems had arisen at licensed establishments in the city that featured music favored by \u201cyounger people.\u201d Such \u201cloud, young\u201d music, he said, \u201cseems to draw the people there that loiter and drink and get involved in other illegal activity,\u201d such as drunk driving and fights. Captain Robert Leighty agreed that the type of music played at an establishment \u201chas a lot to do with the type of person it attracts.\u201d Officer Rockholm testified that 17 to 20 year olds tended to congregate around and try to enter licensed establishments that feature music. Sergeant Fancher testified that, in his experience, anywhere an establishment begins to serve alcoholic beverages, the incidence of fighting and drunk driving increases. Officer Hughes indicated that bars at which \u201cloud rock music\u201d was played required a disproportionate number of police responses. The department apparently found it unnecessary to resolve this conflict in the evidence, concluding merely that it was \u201creasonable to infer ... that, despite efforts of the [real parties\u2019] security force, <em>disturbances sometimes would occur </em>when several hundred young persons would gather together in the described surroundings.\u201d (Italics added.) (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">On review of the board\u2019s reversal of the department\u2019s determination, we are limited, as was the board, to determining whether the department proceeded illegally or exceeded its jurisdiction, whether relevant evidence was unavailable or improperly excluded, and whether the department\u2019s findings supported its decision and were themselves supported by substantial evidence. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23090.2; <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(Schaeffer) (1972) 7 Cal. 3d 433, 436 [102 Cal.Rptr. 857, 498 P.2d 1105].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   The depart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>merit\u2019s determinations that issuance of a license to real parties would \u201ccreate a law enforcement problem\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23958) and is \u201ccontrary to public welfare and morals\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were based on findings that (1) despite real parties\u2019 employment of a security force, \u201cdisturbances sometimes would occur when several hundred young persons would gather together in the described surroundings\u201d and, if such disturbances occurred, (2) due to its remote location and the limited number of police officers, police could not respond quickly to the establishment. We conclude that finding (1) does not support the department\u2019s decision and that finding (2) is not supported by substantial evidence. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">One crucial purpose of a requirement that an administrative agency make findings in connection with its decisions is to expose the agency\u2019s mode of analysis to a reviewing court. <em>(Bakman </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 665, 688 [160 Cal.Rptr. 583]; <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. App. Bd. (Lopez) </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App. 3d 209, 218 [83 Cal.Rptr. 89]; see also <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 994, 1003-1004 [159 Cal.Rptr. 222].) Proper findings \u201cdirect the reviewing court\u2019s attention to the analytic route the administrative agency traveled from evidence to action.\u201d <em>(Topanga Assn, for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Findings are a prerequisite to our review of a department decision and we are directed to determine whether \u201c[t]he decision of the department is supported by the findings.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23090.2, subd. (c); <em>ante, </em>fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Business and Professions Code section 23958 authorizes the denial of \u201ca license if [its] issuance ... would tend to create a law enforcement problem.\u201d The department impliedly found this standard to have been met in finding, as a prediction, that \u201cdisturbances sometimes would occur\u201d at the Marmalade Max Disco.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">While the language of section 23958 might otherwise be susceptible of the very broad reading given to it by the department findings, we must interpret it in light of the constitutional requirement of \u201cgood cause\u201d for the denial of a license (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22, 11 5), which may not be impaired by legislative enactment. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 867, 875 [13 Cal.Rptr. 513, 362 P.2d 337].) Whatever the precise parameters of the \u201claw enforcement problem[s]\u201d contemplated by the statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>board that the department\u2019s reliance upon a finding that \u201cdisturbances\u201d (of undetermined severity) would \u201csometimes\u201d (in the indefinite future) occur reflects altogether \u201ctoo sweeping\u201d a view of what constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d to deny a license to serve alcoholic beverages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even if we accepted, and we do not, the department\u2019s additional finding that police response time to the establishment was \u201cslow,\u201d such a vague, temporally open-ended standard appears to us unsupportable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The requirement of \u201cgood cause\u201d mandates that the department not act arbitrarily in denying a license. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 876.) \u201cAs the cases make clear, ... the Department\u2019s role in evaluating an application for a license to sell alcoholic beverages is to assure that the public welfare and morals are preserved \u2018from <em>probable impairment </em>in the future.\u2019\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Kirby </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(Schaeffer), <em>supra, 1 </em>Cal. 3d at p. 441.)  The department\u2019s finding runs far afield of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the standard of \u201c\u2018probable impairment.\u2019\u201d The department\u2019s view of what constitutes a \u201claw enforcement problem\u201d is broad enough to embrace all establishments for which licenses might be sought; it is difficult to conceive of a bar of which it can be shown that no disturbance will ever occur there. We cannot accept the department\u2019s broad interpretation of the statutory standard for denying a license in Business and Professions Code section 23958 for to do so would eviscerate the constitutional standard of \u201cgood cause.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the finding that \u201cdisturbances sometimes would occur\u201d does not support the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Paras, Acting P. J., and Perluss, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\"> At the time of the administrative hearing, Business and Professions Code section 23958 provided: \u201cUpon receipt of an application for a license or for a transfer of a license and the applicable fee, the department shall make a thorough investigation to determine whether the applicant and the premises for which a license is applied qualify for a license and whether the provisions of this division have been complied with, and shall investigate all matters connected therewith which may affect the public welfare and morals. The department shall deny an application for a license or for a transfer of a license if either the applicant or the premises for which a license is applied do not qualify for a license under this division. [11] The department further may deny an application for a license <em>if issuance of such license would tend to create a law enforcement </em>problem, or if issuance would result in or add to an undue concentration of licenses and the applicant fails to show that public convenience or necessity would be served by such issuance.\u201d (Italics added.)

Thus, in <em>Parente </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1934) 1 Cal.App.2d 238 [36 P.2d 437], a denial was upheld where the respondent board had before it evidence of a long-standing, \u201ccontinuous police problem\u201d at the applicant\u2019s premises, which the court interpreted as referring to \u201cthe difficulty of controlling the lawless, the idle, the dissolute and the criminal element of a city tending to congregate at a designated place .... \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 244-246.) In <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Dept. Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>(1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 541 [13 Cal.Rptr. 531], the court was concerned with the added difficulty of enforcing liquor control laws in an area of \u201cundue concentration\u201d of licensed establishments in which 75 arrests were made each week for public drunkenness and other offenses. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 546-547.) In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. Con. Appeals Bd. </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 106 [28 Cal.Rptr. 74], revocation of an establishment\u2019s license was justified by the fact that intoxicated persons were arrested there almost daily. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 114-120.) More recently, in <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. (Schaeffer) </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 433 [102 Cal.Rptr. 857, 498 P.2d 1105], the Supreme Court upheld a determination that issuance of an off-sale beer and wine license would create a law enforcement problem where the evidence showed that the proposed premises were located at the edge of the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara, in a small community nearly surrounded by the campus; that the village had the highest crime rate in the county; that at least 50 to 60 percent of persons arrested there were under the influence of alcohol; and, critically, that there had recently been a number of riots and other University-related disturbances (including the burning of a bank) in the immediate vicinity of the premises, which prompted concern that in any future disturbance the establishment might be broken into and liquor consumed by looters and rioters. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 437-441.) Nothing in these decisions supports the department\u2019s view of what constitutes a law enforcement problem. In all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>them, there was repeated or on-going criminal conduct of legitimate and substantial concern to law enforcement agencies, not a mere expectation that \u201cdisturbances would sometimes occur.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> The board said: \u201c[W]e believe the department\u2019s determination that \u2018disturbances would sometimes occur\u2019 as too sweeping a basis for denial of the license. An applicant should not be required to guarantee that <em>no </em>disturbances would occur at the proposed premises. The department did not determine that past conduct constituted a law enforcement problem. The evidence does not establish that enforcement of the law was hampered due to the time required for the police to arrive at the premises, because of it being located at the boundary of the city. Moreover, we do not consider the fact that the manpower of a local police department is limited as being relevant to the issue whether the operation of a licensed premises would cause a law enforcement problem, or as constituting a basis for prohibiting the establishment of a legitimate business <em>(Flores, </em>AB-4164, August 19, 1975). Based on the foregoing, we conclude the department\u2019s determination that issuance of the license would <em>create </em>a law enforcement problem is not supported by substantial evidence; it is merely speculative.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> The board concluded that there was not substantial evidence to \u201cestablish that enforcement of the law was hampered due to the time required for the police to arrive at the premises.\u201d We agree. While there was testimony that the premises in question are geographically remote from business and residential centers, the average police response time to the establishment was estimated to be between 10 and 15 minutes, whereas the city-wide average response time was approximately 14 minutes. Moreover, there was undisputed testimony that, though it had not previously been on any established patrol \u201cbeat,\u201d police had recently been patrolling the vicinity of the \u201cdisco\u201d twice a night. The general short-handedness of the police department, which was cited as the other factor affecting response time, was correctly rejected by the board as a reason for denial of a license. It places no real constraint (in addition to the illusory one, discussed herein, that disturbances may sometimes occur at the establishment) on the department\u2019s discretion to deny a license; there are few communities, we suspect, where the addition of more police officers would not reduce the average police response time to calls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
