(which operates a camp in the Santa Cruz mountains to which families and groups subscribing to its nondenominational Christian \u201cStatement of Faith\u201d go for religious conferences and retreats), were \u201cchurchfes]\u201d within the meaning of section 634.5, subdivision (a), of the Unemployment Insurance Code, which excludes from coverage under the unemployment and disability insurance laws services performed for \u201c.. . (1) a church or convention or association of churches, or (2) an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The director contends that the trial court erred in interpreting the term \u201cchurch\u201d to embrace taxpayers because they \u201cperform[] functions identical to traditional churches in purpose, Bible, creed, doctrine, and worship.\u201d He urges us to adopt a narrower definition. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Taxpayer Young Life Campaign (Young Life) is an incorporated nonprofit Christian youth organization having no official connection with any denominational church body. It was founded in 1941 by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Presbyterian minister for the purpose, according to its articles, of supporting \u201ca benevolent, charitable, educational and missionary undertaking, particularly to encourage Christian young people to continue their spiritual life, which shall be manifested in Bible study, prayer and consistent Christian living.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">A major element of Young Life\u2019s activities in pursuit of its purpose is a weekly \u201cclub meeting.\u201d It is usually conducted at a private home by a member of the Young Life staff (many of whom are ministers ordained by denominational churches), or by a volunteer leader. \u201cClub meetings\u201d usually begin with several songs, followed by \u00e1 skit or game or other \u201cfun time,\u201d then perhaps some announcements or a participant\u2019s \u201csharing of] his own faith,\u201d and then a \u201cclub talk\u201d or sermon by the leader, followed by more songs. The meetings are held in the evening and last about an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">There are also weekly \u201ccampaigner\u201d meetings, often in a private home, at which adolescents who have progressed to the point of \u201caccepting] the Christian faith\u201d engage in Bible study, enjoy the fellowship of others sharing their commitment and discuss life and the Christian faith. In addition, Young Life conducts many weekend and week-long excursions at its various camps, at which religious programs and personal counseling are combined with recreational activities. Young Life also operates five facilities caring for runaways.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Young Life subscribes to a nondenominational Christian Statement of Faith, to which all but perhaps 100 of Young Life\u2019s total staff of 650, including all of its management and ministerial staff, as well as its board of trustees, must adhere. The board includes several pastors of denominational churches as well as laymen. Young Life does not ordain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ministers, but its executive director, all of its 5 divisional and 22 regional directors and a majority of its 350 area directors (local ministerial staff) were ordained, either by a denominational church or by an ordaining body such as the Evangelical Christian Alliance. Its field staff undergo a six-month graduate course at Young Life\u2019s Institute of Youth Ministries at the Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, unless they are graduates of a seminary. There are another 200 to 250 direct ministry staff. In addition, about 5,000 college students and adult volunteers, some of them ordained ministers, supplement Young Life\u2019s field staff. These volunteers are trained by the local area directors and must subscribe to the Young Life Statement of Faith. From time to time the ordained ministers administer sacraments, such as baptism, marriage and the Eucharist.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">About 60,000 adolescents participate in Young Life activities each week, some 80 percent of whom are not affiliated with a denominational church. Young Life works closely with denominational churches and encourages its participants to develop ties to them, partly because its ministry is primarily directed to adolescents (though it has recently expanded its ministry to adults). It does not seek to \u201cconvert\u201d adolescents to the Young Life \u201cchurch,\u201d or to \u201ccompete\u201d with more traditional churches, but rather seeks to lead them to accept the Christian faith. It does not ask them, specifically, to subscribe to the Young Life Statement of Faith, but it conveys the essential content of the statement in \u201cclub talks\u201d and counseling with adolescents interested in \u201ccommitting]\u201d themselves to Christ. Young Life did not hold itself out as a church in 1972 and, in fact, in one brochure it affirmatively stated that it was not a church, because the adolescents whom it sought to reach reacted negatively to traditional churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Taxpayer Mount Hermon Association, Inc. (Mount Hermon), is a nonprofit corporation, founded in 1906 and incorporated in 1929, which operates a complex of nondenominational Christian conference centers in a forest setting in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Its purpose is to propagate the Christian gospel and nurture the faith of those who have accepted it. According to its articles of incorporation, its purpose is: \u201c\u2018(1) To organize, promote, maintain and control the Mount Hermon Summer Assembly and other meetings and conventions for biblical, missionary, evangelistic, and educational purposes; [II] (2) To organize, promote, maintain and control missionary and evangelistic enterprises, [July 1981] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>schools, colleges, hospitals, and other Christian agencies of similar character for the public spiritual and moral good.\u201d Mount Hermon considers its rustic setting and the fact that people usually stay there for several days at a time to be useful in communicating its Christian message.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Mount Hermon operates three contiguous camps (Redwood Camp, Ponderosa Lodge and Mount Hermon Center), whose programs are directed, respectively, toward elementary and junior high school students, high school and college students, and adults. The facilities are open year-round, but are used most intensively through the summer. Programs include conferences for pastors, families and single adults, and Bible study. A typical summer family program lasts a week and involves morning services and religious discussion for adults and child-care and Sunday school classes for children, afternoon recreational activities, and an evening service. Activities at Redwood Camp and Ponderosa Lodge combine recreation and religious discussions and personal counseling, moderated by counselors, most of whom are not ordained, though many are seminary students.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Sunday worship services are held year-round, usually by Mount Hermon staff members. During the summer these \u201ctypical Protestant\u201d services are heavily attended, with 1,000 to 2,000 participants each week; during the winter the services may be attended by as few as 15 to 20 people and are sometimes permitted to be conducted by the particular conference group. Nevertheless, a number of people who live nearby attend services at Mount Hermon substantially every Sunday, some tithe to it and many people come every summer to Mount Hermon. Ministers on Mount Hermon\u2019s staff dispense the sacraments of baptism, communion and matrimony, though Mount Hermon does not promulgate rigid forms for their dispensation, leaving that to the ministers who have varying denominational backgrounds. The ministers visit hospitals and make home visits. Mount Hermon also operates a Sunday school on the grounds for all ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">All of Mount Hermon\u2019s thirty-five staff members (which includes six or seven ministers, as well as cooks, housekeepers and administrative and clerical personnel) and its board of trustees must subscribe to a nondenominational Christian Statement of Faith. In order to use Mount Hermon\u2019s facilities, a group must conform to the Statement of Faith, though individuals need not, since to require such adherence would defeat Mount Hermon\u2019s evangelistic purposes. Mount Hermon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>considers itself \u201cinterdenominational,\u201d in that it is \u201cconcerned about the whole denominational spectrum.\u201d It therefore declines to become involved in denominational disputes or to \u201cconvert\u201d people from traditional churches. It numbers among its \u201ccongregation\u201d everyone who has a \u201ccontinuing interest\u201d in Mount Hermon.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Following the amendment of Unemployment Insurance Code section 634.5 in 1971, Young Life was assessed $3,386.58 in disability insurance taxes by the director\u2019s predecessor agency; it chose to take advantage of a provision permitting nonprofit organizations to contribute to the unemployment insurance fund on an \u201cadded cost of benefits paid\u201d basis. (Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7 803, subd. (b)(1); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3304 (a)(6)(B), 3309(a)(2).) Mount Hermon was similarly assessed, in the sum of $5,316.88. Both organizations were found by Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board referees to be \u201cchurches,\u201d but the decisions were reversed by the board. (In re Young Life Campaign (1977) Precedent Tax Decision, P-T-337; In re Mount Hermon Ass\u2019n. (1977) Precedent Tax Decision, P-T-335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Both cases were tried, de novo, in the Superior Court of Sacramento County, as was authorized by former Unemployment Insurance Code section 1182 (now \u00a7 1241). The court ruled that taxpayers are \u201cchurch[es]\u201d within the meaning of the exemption. The director appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Definitional problems lie at the core of church-state issues. As to tax (and other) matters, they are of ancient respectability. \u201cThe Bible relates that when the Pharisees asked Jesus whether it was permissible to pay taxes to Caesar, Jesus replied that one should \u2018Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s and unto God the things that are God\u2019s.\u2019\u201d (Schwarz, <em>Limiting Religious Tax Exemptions: When Should the Church Render unto </em>Caesar? (1976) 29 U.Fla.L.Rev. 50.) In view of Christ\u2019s tenuous relations with the Pharisees, he wisely left undefined things Caesar and things God.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">A not dissimilar judicial prudence counsels against a premature and preemptive definition of \u201cchurch,\u201d for purposes of exemption from the unemployment insurance tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>This case touches upon the definitional core in its modern, constitutional setting. It tenders the meaning of things \u201cchurch\u201d in the unemployment insurance tax law, a term which Congress, in studied silence, left undefined.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The director urges that, the \u201cchurch\u201d exemption be narrowly defined to effectuate the purposes of the unemployment insurance laws. (Cf. <em>Cal. Emp. Com. </em>v. <em>Butte County etc. Assn. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 624, 630-631 [154 P.2d 892] [agricultural labor exemption].) He suggests that \u201cchurch\u201d \u201cmeans an assembly of persons of the same faith who worship together under standards, rites and doctrines established by the organization.\u201d Young Life and Mount Hermon would have us put meaning into \u201cchurch\u201d by use of the \u201cfunctional\u201d criteria, applied by the trial court in the light of First Amendment concerns. We take the latter direction. This course is doubtless not comforting to the tax man, but it serves to steer clear of constitutional obstacles.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">As the United States Supreme Court has (again) recently said in construing (on another point) the exemption here at issue: \u201cA statute, of course, is to be construed, if such a construction is fairly possible, to avoid raising doubts of its constitutionality. \u201d <em>(St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>South Dakota </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 772, 780 [68 L.Ed. 2d 612, 619, 101 S.Ct. 2142]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seeger </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 163 [13 L.Ed.2d 733, 85 S.Ct. 850]; <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 490 [59 L.Ed.2d 533, 99 S.Ct. 1313].) We take that advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The determination of what is a \u201cchurch,\u201d like \u201c[t]he determination of what is a \u2018religious\u2019 belief or practice is more often than not a difficult and delicate task .. <em>.(Thomas </em>v. <em>Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 707, 714 [67 L.Ed.2d 624, 631, 101 S.Ct. 1425].) The task is made more delicate by the overlapping, yet potentially conflicting, constitutional proscriptions against the burdening of the free exercise of religion and against the undue entanglement of the state with religion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The clauses do not serve identical purposes and the United States Supreme Court, so it says, \u201chas strug-</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>gled to find a neutral course between the two Religion Clauses, both of which are cast in absolute terms, and either of which, if expanded to a logical extreme, would tend to clash with the other.\u201d <em>(Walz </em>v. <em>Tax Commission </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 664, 668-669 [25 L.Ed.2d 697, 701, 90 S.Ct. 1409].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since <em>Walz </em>the failure to exempt a religious organization from a tax may unduly entangle the state with religion in violation of the establishment clause. But the exemption itself, by embracing only churches and not other religious organizations, arguably countenances an impermissible discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although we skirt these problems, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>they remain the background against which the definitional problem is resolved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The board, in its precedent tax decisions in the Young Life and Mount Hermon cases, rested its conclusions, respectively, upon the \u201ctraditional meaning\u201d and \u201cgeneral understanding\u201d of the term \u201cchurch.\u201d In the Young Life case, the board defined \u201cchurch\u201d as an \u201cassembly of persons who meet together for religious worship, \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but found that the organization did not come within the \u201ctraditional meaning\u201d of the term because of its limited ministry (i.e., adolescents), its encouragement of affiliation with traditional churches, its use of clergy ordained by denominational churches, and its failure to hold itself out as a church. In the Mount Hermon case, the board held that Mount Hermon\u2019s \u201cmajor functions ... are not church functions,\u201d concluding that its recreational aspects predominated over \u201ca few hours of Bible studies\u201d moderated by a counselor and \u201csummer . .. church services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The board\u2019s decisions relied on the federal district court decision in <em>De La Salle Institute </em>v. <em>United States </em>(N.D. Cal. 1961) 195 F.Supp. 891.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The issue in that case was whether a winery operated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic religious order, was a \u201cchurch\u201d within the meaning of the term as used in the Unrelated Business Income Tax Law (former 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a)(2)(A): Revenue Act of 1950, ch. 994, \u00a7 422, 64 Stat. 947; repealed, Pub.L. No. 91-172, \u00a7 121, subd. (a)(1) (1969)), the first significant provision in which Congress used the phrase \u201cchurch [or] convention or association of churches\u201d (Whelan, <em>\u201cChurch\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code; The Definitional Problems </em>(1977) 45 Fordham L.Rev. 885, 901). The court decided \u201cthe winery [was] not a church,\u201d concluding that any religious activities connected therewith were \u201cincidental\u201d to its \u201cprincipal [winemaking] activities\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The court pointed to Congress\u2019 silence in the matter. \u201cTo exempt churches, one must know what a church is. Congress must either define \u2018church\u2019 or leave the definition to the common meaning and usage of the word; otherwise, Congress would be unable to exempt churches. It would be impractical to accord an exemption to every corporation which asserted itself to be a church. Obviously Congress did not intend to do this....\u201d <em>(De La Salle Institute </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>195 F.Supp. at p. 903.) \u201cWhat is a \u2018church\u2019 for purposes of the statute must be interpreted in the light of the common understanding of the word. <em>An organization established to carry out </em>\u2018church\u2019 <em>functions, under the general understanding of the term, is a \u2018church.\u2019\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>{Ibid.) </em>The court was guided in identifying \u201cchurch functions\u201d by an interpretative regulation which provided that \u201c[a] religious order [would] be considered to be engaged in carrying out the <em>functions of a church </em>if its duties include[d] the ministration of sacerdotal functions and the conduct of religious worship.\u201d (Italics added.) (Former Treas. Reg. 26 C.F.R. [Int. Rev. Code 1954] \u00a7 1.51 l-2(a)(3)(ii); <em>De La Salle Institute </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>195 F.Supp. at p. 900.) The Christian Brothers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ate not priests and the order\u2019s primary activity (education) does not constitute \u201creligious worship,\u201d the court concluded.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The trial court\u2019s decision looked to the same \u201cfunctions\u201d adopted in <em>De La Salle </em>and followed by the board but refused to make them collectively exclusive. It did not accept the board\u2019s narrow view of what is embraced by the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of \u201cchurch,\u201d which failed to accord criterial recognition to the more unconventional aspects of taxpayers\u2019 ministries\u2014i.e., Young Life\u2019s concentration on youth and nondenominational character and Mount Hermon\u2019s recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Resort to the \u201ccommon meaning,\u201d or customary usage, of \u201cchurch\u201d is a traditionally appropriate means of determining meaning, given Congress\u2019 silence. (Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1973) \u00a7 46.01, pp. 48-51.) However, because of the First Amendment, the conventional \u201cunderstanding\u201d of what constitutes a church, which is reflective of established, traditional churches, must not be permitted to reward conventional churches and exclude unorthodox ones. <em>(Washington Ethical Society </em>v. <em>District of Columbia </em>(D.C.Cir. 1957) 249 F.2d 127; see Note, <em>Religious Organizations and the Unemployment Insurance Code: Is California Playing Favorites with </em>Churches? (1979) 10 Pacific L.J. 225, 233-239; Worthing, <em>\u201cReligion\u201d and \"Religious Institutions\u201d Under the First Amendment </em>(1980) 7 Pepperdine L.Rev. 313, 344-346.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The director approaches the problem of definition with procrustean enthusiasm. To justify a \u201ctraditional\u201d view of \u201cchurch,\u201d he suggests a definition establishing characteristics deemed <em>collectively essential </em>to the common understanding of the term: \u201c\u2018[Cjhurch\u2019 for purposes of the exemption is an entity [1] organized primarily for religious worship [2] by an assembly of persons [3] of the same faith [4] who knowingly and voluntarily worship together as members [5] under and in compliance with standards, religious rites, and doctrines established by the assembly or entity for such worship. [6] The organization must have sufficiently definable organizational structure to be considered an employing unit, [7] must not advocate membership and active participation in other churches while actively participating in its activities, and, [8] its practices and doctrines must be peculiar to itself and unique to the participating assembly.\u201d Director most strenuously contends that respondents\u2019 nondenominational characters prevent them from being considered \u201cchurch[es].\u201d Director points out that neither Young Life nor Mount Hermon has or claims to have \u201cpeculiar\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d religious rites, practices and doctrines, and that both encourage participation in traditional churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">For the proposition that nondenominational religious organizations are not \u201cchurches,\u201d director relies upon <em>Vic Coburn Evangelistic Assn. </em>v. <em>Employment Div. </em>(1978) 35 Ore.App. 655 [582 P.2d 51], and <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(1967) 48 T.C. 358. In <em>Vic Coburn, </em>a traveling evangelistic Christian ministry was held not to be a church, in the absence of a continuing congregation. In the <em>Chapman </em>case, the Tax Court of the United States held that the Missionary Dentist, a nonprofit organization whose purpose was to preach the gospel around the world, using dentistry as a means by which to contact people <em>(id., </em>at p. 360), was not a \u201cchurch\u201d within the contemplation of Internal Revenue Code section 170(b)(1)(A). The court gleaned from a congressional committee report<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and \u201cphrases appearing throughout the ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>legislative history, such as \u2018under church auspices\u2019 and \u2018as integral parts of the church\u2019 that the term is intended to be synonymous with the terms \u2018denomination\u2019 or \u2018sect\u2019 rather than to be used in any universal sense.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 363.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court concluded: \u201cWe think it apparent from this record that the organization in question is not of a type that could be said to be a denomination or sect. It is a group of missionary workers drawn from many Christian churches who give of their time and talents to spread universal Christian beliefs. All its members must be in full communion of an accredited Christian community in order to be affiliated with the organization. It is interdenominational and independent of any connection with the churches with which its members are affiliated. It does not seek converts other than to the principles of Christianity generally and if successful urges these converts to establish their own native churches .... The Missionary Dentist is not a church. It is merely a religious organization comprised of individual members who are already affiliated with various churches.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The <em>Vic Coburn </em>case is easily distinguishable from the one before us. The Oregon court relied upon a state administrative regulation defining \u201cchurch\u201d for unemployment tax purposes as \u201ca particular religious group organized as a congregation and conducting regular worship services.\u201d (Ore. Admin. Reg. 471-31 -090( 1 )(a).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No similar regulation has been promulgated in California. Moreover, in both the Young Life and Mount Hermon cases, there is evidence that their members have a continuing commitment to and interest in the organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We find the rationale of the <em>Chapman </em>decision, if not its holding, unpersuasive. We cannot accept the notion that a religious organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>which proclaims Christianity, conducts services for the worship of the Christian God and provides for the administration of the Christian sacraments to its assembled members is not a church because it recognizes but refuses to enter the arena of sectarian strife, seeking instead to rise above it because of its belief that it is only the \u201cacceptance of Christ\u201d that matters. In <em>Maumee Valley Broadcasting Assn. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972) 29 Ohio St.2d 95 [58 Ohio Ops.2d 192, 279 N.E.2d 863], a religious radio station was held to be a \u201cchurch\u201d despite its interdenominational makeup, the court observing that \u201ca church of the type \u2018that finds with joy the grain of gold in every creed, and floods with light and love the germs of good in every soul\u2019 cannot reasonably be denied exempt status for that reason alone.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>279 N.E.2d at p. 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Riddell </em>(S.D.Cal. 1962) 205 F.Supp. 918, a federal district court determined (albeit in dicta) that an organization without a name, constitution, rules (other than those enunciated in the Bible), headquarters, or bank account was a \u201cchurch.\u201d The court said: \u201cThese factors ... might normally be indicative of an absence of unity of purpose or operation. However, in the case of the church in question, they stem from the very doctrinal ties that bind its members together. The members of the church regard themselves simply as members of the body of Christ, that is, members of the body of persons following the teachings of Christ as revealed in the New Testament. They have refrained from adopting a denominational name and any written organizational guide supplementary to the New Testament because they believe that to do so would be to add an arbitrary gloss to biblical precepts, thus obscuring the word of God. Yet ... [m]any of them have worshiped and worked together for years in furtherance of the purposes of the church. They hold regular public meetings in homes and rented quarters for Bible study, worship and evangelism. They assemble together at \u2018camp meetings.\u2019 ... They recognize specific individuals as ministers and as church officers, from whom they accept guidance .... Thus, while the church lacks some of the common indicia of organization, it plainly is an organized association of persons dedicated to religious purposes.\u201d <em>(Morey </em>v. <em>Riddell, supra, </em>205 F.Supp. at pp. 919-920.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Since there is obvious danger in any attempt to prescribe the liturgy or incidents of worship of a \u201cchurch,\u201d we conclude that the use of camping activities to \u201cprovide an atmosphere ... to promote the religious experience\u201d which the organization seeks to foster is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>inconsistent with \u201cchurch\u201d status. The same reasoning applies to Young Life\u2019s recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">We have another, more fundamental difficulty with the director\u2019s \u201cdefinition.\u201d It attempts conclusively to define \u201cchurch,\u201d to provide an axiomatic test of the necessary and sufficient conditions for its application. Such an attempt is doomed to constitutional failure. Acceptance of the forms and practices of orthodox churches, as <em>exclusive </em>norms, inevitably leads to the exclusion of less established, less orthodox organizations which fulfill the same \u201cchurch\u201d functions in the lives of their members as such organizations and the preclusion of new religious forms. <em>(Fellowship of Humanity </em>v. <em>Co.

The point was impliedly made in <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>South Dakota, supra, </em>451 U.S. 772, where, in holding that the term \u201cchurch\u201d in the federal exemption statute includes religious elementary and secondary schools with no separate legal existence from a church, the Supreme Court was careful to \u201cdisavow any intimations in this case <em>defining or limiting </em>what constitutes a church under FUTA or any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>at p. 784, fn. 15 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 621].)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Nevertheless, since \u201cchurch [es]\u201d are exempted from unemployment insurance taxes, determinations whether an organization is a \u201cchurch\u201d will necessarily be made, despite the difficulties of interpretation. The IRS has adopted a useful approach to such determinations, an approach which is at odds with director\u2019s preemptive definition. Rather than defining \u201cchurch,\u201d the IRS admits its inability to formulate a definition, and applies criteria derived from the forms and practices observed in recognized churches,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> without giving controlling weight to any.
