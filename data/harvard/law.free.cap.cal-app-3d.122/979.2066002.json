J.</author>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">This court issued a writ of review, at the request of petitioner Rod-man Scott, to consider an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (hereinafter Board) dated February 6, 1981. The order under review set aside an earlier finding that Scott was an \u201cemployee\u201d of Mr. John Velthoen when Scott sustained an injury to his left knee on September 16, 1978; consequently, the Board ordered that Scott take nothing pursuant to his application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>For the reasons to be explained, we hold the Board exceeded its jurisdiction on February 6, 1981, in finding that Scott was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of Velthoen at the time of his injury as defined by the workers\u2019 compensation law (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3351). Nevertheless, we also hold that respondent Time Fire &amp; Casualty Company is not liable for payment of compensation benefits to Scott under the homeowner\u2019s comprehensive personal liability policy issued to Velthoen and in effect on the date of Scott\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The rather protracted procedural history of the case is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">On May 23, 1979, a hearing was held before a workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ). It was stipulated that only the following issues would be considered: employment;, occupation, and whether the injury to Scott\u2019s knee arose in the course of employment; all other issues were deferred. The WCJ received inter alia the following evidence regarding Scott\u2019s conditions of employment. Mr. Velthoen hired Mr. Scott to assist in building a personal home for Velthoen; Scott was to install some \u201csandwich panels\u201d for the walls and place roof trusses. While Scott was doing this work on September 16, 1978, he injured his left knee. Scott testified he was to be paid an hourly wage and he received two paychecks totalling $480 from Velthoen for the work. The WCJ thereafter entered a finding of fact and order on July 19, 1979, to the effect that Scott\u2019s knee injury arose out of and in the course of his employment as a carpenter by John Velthoen, uninsured. The July 19th order provided that all other issues were deferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Although the WCJ had rejected the employer\u2019s contention that Scott was an independent contractor, rather than an employee, the employer Velthoen did not petition the Board for reconsideration of the July 19th order.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Time Fire &amp; Casualty Company was thereafter joined as a defendant. A hearing was held before the WCJ on May 5 and August 25, 1980, to determine the issue of compensation insurance coverage. At these hearings, the WCJ received inter alia the following evidence: Velthoen purchased a homeowner\u2019s liability insurance policy issued by Time Fire &amp; Casualty Company for a property Velthoen owned on Palendale Road in Modesto. The policy was issued September 23, 1975, for the period of three years subject to payment of annual premiums. Velthoen later sold that property and purchased another on Costner Road, on which he planned to build a home. Velthoen notified his insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>anee agent of this change in March 1978, and the new property was added to the policy. Scott was injured September 16, 1978, while doing work on the home under construction on Costner Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Velthoen also testified that Scott had worked between 25 and 30 hours for him; Velthoen said that if Scott had not been injured when he was, he would have worked sufficient additional hours to total 50 or 60 hours. Scott testified he was paid $480 representing 48 hours work. According to Scott, he also was on the job site for an additional three to five hours doing inspection work for which he was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Based on this evidence, the WCJ issued an order on November 17, 1980. This order contained a finding that Insurance Code section 11590 extended compensation insurance coverage for the injury sustained by Scott.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The WCJ ordered that Time Fire &amp; Casualty Company provide compensation coverage for Velthoen for Scott\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The insurer thereafter filed a timely petition for reconsideration of the November 17th order finding coverage. The WCJ filed a report and recommendation that the petition for reconsideration be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The Board thereafter granted reconsideration and rendered a decision on February 6, 1981. With respect to insurance coverage, the Board found that Time Fire &amp; Casualty Company did provide a comprehensive policy of personal liability insurance in effect on the date of injury; however, the Board ordered that Scott take nothing by his application because he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of Velthoen within the workers\u2019 compensation law. The code sections which led the Board to that conclusion were Labor Code sections 3351, 3352 and 4151. Labor Code section 3351 provides that a person who meets the following definition is an \u201cemployee\u201d: \u201c... every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire ... and includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>\u201c(d) Except as provided in subdivision (h) of Section 3352, any person employed by the owner or occupant of a residential dwelling whose duties are incidental to the ownership, maintenance, or use of the dwelling, including the care and supervision of children, or whose duties are personal and not in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of such owner or occupant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Section 3352 at the time relevant to this action set forth the following exclusion: \u201c(h) Any person defined in subdivision (d) of Section 3351 who was employed by such employer <em>for less than 52 hours during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the injury </em>. .. . \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Board concluded that because Scott had worked for less than 52 hours during the 90 days before the injury, he was excluded from the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d and from the benefit of the act. The Board also concluded that an election to cover Scott under Labor Code section 4151 was precluded because Scott came within the exclusion of section 3352, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">We first observe that the WCJ\u2019s order of July 19, 1979, that petitioner Scott\u2019s knee injury \u201carose out of and in the course of his employment as a carpenter by John Velthoen, uninsured,\u201d was a final order for purposes of Board reconsideration as authorized by the Labor Code section 5900 et seq. Finality of an order for the purpose of reconsideration may be defined as \u201cthe resolution of a current issue affecting the substantive rights of the parties, ...\u201d (Cal. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973) \u00a7 10.3, pp. 322-323; <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 528, 534-535 [163 Cal.Rptr. 750].) (1) Because the employer Velthoen failed to petition for reconsideration within 20 days from the date of service of the order as authorized by Labor Code section 5903, the Board was without jurisdiction on February 6, 1981, to reconsider the question whether at the time of his injury Scott was Velthoen\u2019s \u201cemployee\u201d within the broad meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation law. (See 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries &amp; Workmen\u2019s Compensation [hereinafter Hanna] (2d ed. 1981) \u00a7 7.02[4](b), p. 7-14.)  The Board, however, could determine the employment question on reconsideration of the November 17, 1980, order insofar as the employment related to the insurance coverage under the Time Fire &amp; Casualty Company policy. As we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>explain, the Board reached the correct result on this question but for the wrong reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The Board ordered that Scott take nothing by way of compensation benefits under the homeowner\u2019s policy because he was excluded from coverage under Labor Code section 3352, subdivision (h) as a person \u201cwho was employed by such employer for less than 52 hours during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the injury .. . While this finding is factually correct, it is legally redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The primary and correct issue before the Board on the petition for reconsideration was whether Scott was a \u201cperson defined as an employee by subdivision (d) of Section 3351 of the Labor Code\u201d <em>as provided in Insurance Code section 11590 </em>(fn. 1, <em>ante </em>at p. 983). As we have seen, Labor Code section 3351 defines \u201cemployee\u201d as every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire including \u201cany person employed by the owner or occupant of a residential dwelling whose duties are incidental to the ownership, maintenance, or use of the dwelling ... or whose duties are personal and not in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of such owner or occupant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The persuasive fact is that Scott, who was employed by Velthoen as a carpenter to help in the construction of Velthoen\u2019s residence, did not qualify as a person whose duties were \u201cincidental to\u201d the ownership, maintenance, or use of the dwelling. The legislative history of section 3351, subdivision (d) shows it was intended to cover \u201ccasual employees\u201d not in the course of the employer\u2019s trade, business or occupation such as household domestic servants, babysitters, and part-time gardeners. (See former Lab. Code, \u00a7 3352, subds. (a), (f), and (h) as set forth at Stats. 1970, ch. 982, p. 1752, \u00a7 1; and see generally 2 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.02[2](b), pp. 15-20\u201415-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The building of a house cannot be deemed a casual or minor activity incidental to the ownership or use of the house; it is the essential prerequisite to the ownership and use of the house. Thus, the qualifying language of section 3351, subdivision (d) contemplates a completed dwelling or at least a building sufficiently completed to be occupied as a residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>In the case at bench, the dwelling had not been completed when Scott was injured; it was still under construction and had no roof. Therefore, as a matter of law Scott was not a person defined as an employee by section 3351, subdivision (d). This being so, Insurance Code section 11590 is inapplicable on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The matter is remanded to the Board with directions to reinstate the July 19, 1979, order that Scott\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment as a carpenter by John Velthoen, uninsured. The Board is further directed to dismiss respondent Time Fire &amp; Casualty Company as a party to the compensation proceedings, because the comprehensive liability policy it issued to Velthoen does not provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Scott\u2019s injury under Insurance Code section 11590.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Hanson (P. D.), J., and Pettitt, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\"> Insurance Code section 11590 provides: \u201cExcept as provided in Section 11591, no policy providing comprehensive personal liability insurance may be issued or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 1977, <em>unless it contains a provision for coverage against liability for the payment of compensation, </em>as defined in Section 3207 of the Labor Code, <em>to any person defined as an employee by subdivision (d) of Section 3351 of the Labor Code. </em>Any such policy in effect on or after January 1, 1977, whether or not actually containing such provisions, shall be construed as if such provisions were embodied therein. However, such coverage shall not apply if any other existing, valid and collectible, workers\u2019 compensation insurance for such liability is applicable to the injury or death of such employee.\" (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> The exclusion provided by section 3352, subdivision (h) should not be construed to defeat the right to compensation benefits of those persons employed to assist an owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>in the construction of a house. To do so would leave a\" vast number of workers unprotected by the workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
