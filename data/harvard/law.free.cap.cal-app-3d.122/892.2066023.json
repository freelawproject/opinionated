The pertinent facts are not in dispute, and are summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In 1961, Tye On Lock made <em>inter vivos </em>gifts by deed of two parcels of improved real property to his two sons, each receiving one of the parcels. During decedent\u2019s lifetime, neither he nor the donees of the gifts either paid the gift taxes or reported the gifts for tax purposes. Appellant was one of the donees of the gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Tye On Lock died on July 1, 1971, in the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong, being on that date a resident of Hong Kong, but leaving property in the City and County of San Francisco subject to distribution therein. Decedent\u2019s last will and testament named Frank Sam Lock, his second son and appellant herein, as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Appellant filed a \u201cPetition for Probate of Will and for Letters Testamentary\u201d on September 10, 1971. Decedent\u2019s will was admitted to probate on October 7, 1971, and on that date appellant was duly appointed executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">On November 13, 1979, appellant submitted a \u201cFirst and Final Account and Petition for Executor for Final Distribution.\u201d The petition requested, pursuant to decedent\u2019s will, that a one-third share of the estate be distributed to both appellant and Lock Wing Leng\u2014a minor son of decedent who had not been named a donee of the <em>inter vivos </em>gifts transferred by decedent in 1961<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014with lesser shares to be distributed to three grandchildren of decedent. The petition also included, as attachments, the following: (1) a report of disbursements during the account period showing a total of $39,009.69 paid by the executor for state and federal gift taxes and accounting fees pertinent thereto, and (2) a declaration by counsel for appellant which stated that \u201cthe gift taxes were paid because decedent had made <em>inter vivos </em>gifts in 1961 by deeds, . . . \u201d and further that the \u201cdonor is primarily liable for the taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">After a hearing on the petition, the court rendered a \u201cDecision\u201d on January 4, 1980, denying appellant\u2019s petition for distribution and settlement of the account. Specifically, the court disallowed payment of the gift taxes by the estate, citing the following reasons: (1) the executor failed to disclose the gifts or pay the California and federal gift taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>and accompanying fees (including interest and penalties) until seven years after his appointment, thereby causing accrual of substantial interest and penalties; and (2) since the donees (including appellant) were responsible for payment of the taxes, to charge them against the decedent\u2019s estate would be prejudicial to the interest of the estate beneficiaries who were not the objects of the gifts. On its own motion, the court filed a \u201cCorrection to Intended Decision\u201d on November 6, 1980, correcting a typist\u2019s error in the amount of the tax disbursements disallowed in the \u201cDecision,\u201d and directing counsel for appellant to prepare \u201cfindings and form of Judgment in accordance with intended decision of January 4, 1980 as herein corrected.\u201d Appeal was taken from the decision of January 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Before considering the substantive issues raised here, we must deal with respondent\u2019s claim that the instant appeaTshould be dismissed because the trial court\u2019s \u201cDecision\u201d of January 4, 1980, is not a final, appealable judgment. Respondent submits that the \u201cDecision\u201d is not an order, but merely a statement expressing the court\u2019s disapproval of the executor\u2019s petition for settlement of account and final distribution. Thus, respondent argues, appellant\u2019s notice of appeal, filed February 7, 1980, was premature. In support of this contention, respondent cites rule 232 of the California Rules of Court, which states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe announcement of intended decision shall not constitute a judgment and shall not be binding on the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">As respondent suggests, pursuant to rule 232, an oral or written intended decision of the court is not generally considered a final judgment. <em>(Kinney </em>v. <em>Vaccari </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 348, 357 [165 Cal.Rptr. 787, 612 P.2d 877]; <em>Ripani </em>v. <em>Liberty Loan Corp. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App. 3d 603, 614 [157 Cal.Rptr. 272]; <em>Dairyman\u2019s Cooperative Creamery Assn. </em>v. <em>Leipold </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 184, 188 [109 Cal.Rptr. 753].) However, it is well settled that the substance or effect of the judgment and not its designation is determinative of its finality. A memorandum of decision may be treated as an appealable order or judgment when it is signed and filed, and when it constitutes the trial judge\u2019s determination on the merits. <em>(Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 430, 434, fn. 1 [147 Cal.Rptr. 835]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kozden </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 918, 920 [111 Cal.Rptr. 826]; <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Concord Community Hosp. Dist. </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 51, 55-56 [43 Cal.Rptr. 255]; <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 752, 757 [255 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>In <em>Estate of Conroy </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 734 [136 Cal.Rptr. 807], the probate court signed and filed a document entitled \u201cDecision,\u201d which, after specifying the judge\u2019s reasons therefor, stated, \u201c\u2018The amended Report of the Inheritance Tax Referee is hereby approved.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 737, fn. 1.) In ruling that the \u201cDecision\u201d was appealable, the court reasoned: \u201c\u2018. .. since no particular language is requisite for an order, a trial judge\u2019s written statement of his views on the law and the proper decision may be treated as an order when signed and filed and when it constitutes his final determination of the merits.\u2019 [Citation.] The use of the phrase \u2018is hereby approved\u2019 would clearly indicate that the document entitled \u2018Decision\u2019 was intended to be a final determination on the merits and therefore an order and should be treated as such although not properly labeled.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Similarly, though denominated a \u201cDecision,\u201d the trial court\u2019s ruling here is in effect a final judgment. It declares that, \u201cSettlement of the account and petition for distribution are denied ...\u201d and further that the gift tax disbursements in the account \u201care disallowed.\u201d The \u201cDecision\u201d was filed on January 7, 1980, and entered by the clerk on January 8, 1980. By its terms, the decision constitutes a final determination on the petition and contemplates no further judicial action to give it vitality as an order. It is couched in terms of an order, as signed, filed and entered: in our view, it should be treated as final and . appealable, notwithstanding its label. <em>(Estate of Conroy, supra, </em>67 Cal.App. 3d 734, 737, fn. 1; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kozden, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.3d 918, 920; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 621, 623, fn. 1 [83 Cal.Rptr. 747];<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Concord Community Hosp.

A. Hammond Co. </em>(1924) 67 Cal.App. 420, 423 [277 P. 938].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Respondent insists that the \u201cCorrection to Intended Decision\u201d filed on November 6, 1980, reveals that the trial court did not intend its \u201cDecision\u201d to be a final judgment, noting that, in addition to correcting a typographical error, the document requested the executor to prepare \u201cfindings and form of Judgment... . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">However, the amendment merely corrected a clerical error, an action which the court was at liberty to take even if the earlier decision were deemed a final judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hartsell </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 8, 13 [109 Cal.Rptr. 627].) Moreover, the correction was issued after appellant filed notice of appeal, and long after the court made and entered its \u201cDecision\u201d phrased in terms of a final judgment. Appellant was entitled to rely upon this ruling and appeal from it as a final judgment. We thus conclude that the instant appeal should not be dismissed as premature, and proceed to the merits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Appellant argues that the trial court improperly construed section 15901 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, title 18, California Administrative Code, section 15901.1, and other pertinent statutes and regulations, in ruling that the donees of the gifts were chargeable with payment of the gift taxes not paid by the decedent-donor during his lifetime. It is appellant\u2019s position that the statutory scheme places the primary tax liability upon the donor of the gifts, or the estate in the event of the donor\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">California statutory law does not specifically direct which party\u2014the donee of the gift or the donor\u2019s estate\u2014is to be held responsible for payment of gift taxes not paid during the life of the donor. However, section 15901 places primary gift tax liability on the donor; it provides: \u201cBoth the donor and the donee of a gift are personally liable for the tax imposed by this part. The donor, however, is primarily liable for the tax.\u201d Title 18, California Administrative Code, section 15901, expounds upon the code section slightly, by stating: \u201cBoth the donor and the donee of a gift are personally liable for any gift tax due. The donor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>primarily liable; however, the Controller may proceed directly against the donee for payment if, for any reason, the tax is not paid by the donor.\u201d Title 18, California Administrative Code section 15901.1 further provides: \u201cIf a donor or donee dies before he pays the gift tax, his estate shall pay the tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The federal gift tax scheme is roughly analogous. Section 2501 of the Internal Revenue Code sets the gift tax. Section 2502, subdivision (d) of the code (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2502(d)) directs: \u201cThe tax imposed by section 2501 shall be paid by the donor.\u201d Section 25.2502-2 of the accompanying Code of Federal Regulations pertains more specifically to the problem presented here; it states, in relevant part: \u201cSection 2502(d) provides that the donor shall pay the tax. If the donor dies before the tax is paid the amount of the tax is a debt due the United States from the decedent\u2019s estate and his executor or administrator is responsible for its payment out of the estate.\u201d (26 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.2502-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The primary gift tax liability under both California and federal statutes thus rests with the donor or the donor\u2019s estate. <em>(Estate of Cummings </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 659, 666 [46 Cal.Rptr. 491], <em>(Cummings </em>I).) This is so because the gift tax is not imposed upon the receipt of property by the donee; rather, it is an excise upon the donor\u2019s act of making the transfer. (Cf. <em>Sheaffer\u2019s Estate </em>v. <em>C.I.R. </em>(8th Cir. 1963) 313 F.2d 738, 741; <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Robinette </em>(3d Cir. 1942) 129 F.2d 832, 834;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cummings I, supra, </em>at p. 663.) Quoting from the Guide to Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2001-4000), the court in <em>Cummings I, supra, </em>at page 663, stated: \u201c\u2018The Federal gift tax is a levy imposed upon the gratuitous <em>inter vivos </em>transfer of property by individuals. This tax is intended to prevent or counteract avoidance of the estate and income taxes. In certain instances, however, the gift and estate taxes overlap. <em>Thus, a transfer may be sufficiently complete to subject the transferor to gift taxation and yet, because of its inherent testamentary nature, be subject to estate tax on the transferor\u2019s demise. </em>The impact of both gift and estate taxes in such cases is lessened by the device of allowing the gift tax, subject to certain limitations.\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Because the gift tax is primarily chargeable to the donor or to donor\u2019s estate, the most appropriate interpretation of the statutory scheme is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>that the donees are responsible for payment of the tax only if it is not paid by the party primarily liable\u2014the donor. As concluded in <em>Sheaf-fer\u2019s Estate, supra, </em>313 F.2d 738, 741: \u201cAn examination of the controlling gift tax statutes and the cases interpreting them leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the liability for payment of the tax is in the first instance that of the donor, and the donee does not become liable unless the donor fails to make payment on the tax by the 15th day of March following the close of the calendar year. See Mississippi Valley Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 8 Cir. 147 F.2d 186 (1945), and Fletcher Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 7 Cir. 141 F.2d 36 (1944), cert, denied, 323 U.S. 711, 65 S.Ct. 36, 89 L.Ed. 572 (1944).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Such a conclusion is buttressed by reference to California code sections which provide for the filing of gift tax returns. Section 15651 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code directs that: \u201cEvery donor making any gifts ... shall file a gift return with the Controller on or before the 15th day of the second month following the close of the calendar quarter in which he makes a gift.\u201d The donee of a gift is required to file a return only if so directed by the Controller. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 15671.) Thus, the Controller may seek payment from either party, but it is clearly contemplated that the tax is chargeable to the donee only if payment cannot be exacted from the donor.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Respondent asserts that section 15901 and its accompanying Administrative Code regulations merely refer to the obligation of donors and donees vis-\u00e1-vis the government; that as between the donor\u2019s estate and the donees the intent of the donor-testator controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In support of this proposition, respondent cites <em>Estate of Cummings </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 661 [69 Cal.Rptr. 792] <em>(Cummings II), </em>in which the court ruled that taxes paid by the decedent\u2019s estate on gifts made by the decedent-donor in contemplation of death were subject to proration pursuant to the California proration statutes. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 970 et seq.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In accordance with the objective of the proration statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>tes\u2014\u201c\u2018\u201cthat the federal estate tax is intended, in the absence of an expression to the contrary, to be levied, for state inheritance tax purposes, in accordance with the benefit that a person interested receives from the estate <em>(Id., </em>at p. 668)\u2014the court concluded that the tax liability should be prorated so that each donee would be responsible for his equitable proportion thereof, notwithstanding a clause in the donor-testator\u2019s will which directed the executor to pay all expenses and taxes from the residue of the estate. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Respondent insists that a like result is compelled here because the decedent\u2019s will similarly contains no specific provision dictating the payment of gift taxes by the estate. But this argument ignores an important factor which distinguishes the present case from <em>Cummings II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In <em>Cummings II, </em>the proration statutes were applicable because the gifts were made in contemplation of death and, therefore, were included in the estate for estate tax purposes. Thus, pursuant to Probate Code section 975, the taxes were specifically subject to proration. <em>(Estate of Cummings, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 661, 667.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In the present case, the gifts were not made in contemplation of death; no federal estate taxes were assessed for the gifts. For that reason, proration is inappropriate. The California proration statutes (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 970-977) provide for proration of <em>federal estate taxes </em>among beneficiaries of an estate. <em>(Estate of Carley </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 582, 585 [153 Cal.Rptr. 528]; <em>Estate of McLaughlin </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 516, 518 [52 Cal.Rptr. 543].) For example, section 970 directs proration \u201cWhenever it appears upon any accounting, or in any appropriate action or proceeding, that an executor, administrator, trustee or other fiduciary has paid an <em>estate tax </em>to the <em>Federal Government </em>under the provisions of any <em>Federal estate tax law, </em>.. ..\u201d (Italics added.) Section 975, relied upon by the court in <em>Cummings II, supra, </em>(263 Cal.App.2d 661), similarly pertains to \u201cany property required to be included in the <em>gross estate </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Proration is not proper here, as the gifts in question were not made in contemplation of death or otherwise included in decedent\u2019s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Instead, the gift taxes were due and owing during the decedent\u2019s lifetime, and are more appropriately considered as debts of the estate, to be charged against the estate in accordance with the dictates of Probate Code section 750.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the court recognized in <em>Cummings I, supra, </em>\u201cthe liability for gift taxes is a debt of the deceased donor payable by his estate.\u201d (236 Cal.App.2d 659, 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Thus, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the donees of the <em>inter vivos </em>gifts were chargeable with the unpaid gift taxes. Under the statutory scheme, the donor\u2019s estate is primarily responsible for such gift tax burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">However, notwithstanding our conclusion that a decedent\u2019s estate is generally liable for unpaid gift taxes, we uphold the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s petition for settlement of the account and final distribution on the ground that the negligence of the executor in failing to promptly pay the gift taxes resulted in penalties and interest, which, if the estate were compelled to pay, would prejudice the estate beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In ruling upon a petition for settlement of an executor\u2019s account or final distribution of an estate, the probate court is vested with broad jurisdiction which will not be disturbed on appeal except when abused. <em>(Estate ofFraysher </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 131, 136 [301 P.2d 848]; <em>Estate ofLindauer </em>(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 160, 165 [127 P.2d 589].) Here, the trial court ruled that the petition could not be granted in the absence of an allocation of that amount of the disbursements representing the tax penalties and interest chargeable against the executor. The court did not abuse its discretion in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>\u201c[A]n executor has the duty to preserve the estate\u2019s property by paying taxes legally imposed when there is sufficient money on hand for that purpose. <em>(Estate of MacMillan, </em>43 Cal.2d 437, 447 ...; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>15 Cal.2d 368, 372 ....)\u201d <em>(Estate of Harvey </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 555, 557 [36 Cal.Rptr. 788].) It is proper to surcharge a negligent executor for losses suffered by an estate due to penalties or interest paid on delinquent taxes, or to deny settlement of an executor\u2019s account or final distribution in the absence of such a surcharge. <em>(In re Herteman </em>(1887) 73 Cal. 545, 546 [15 P. 121]; <em>Estate of Gerber </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 96, 113-114 [140 Cal.Rptr. 577]; <em>Estate of Harvey, supra, </em>at pp. 557-558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Here, appellant was appointed executor in October 1971. Although it appears that at all times the estate had sufficient funds to pay the gift taxes, the gifts were not disclosed until appellant filed IT-22 forms in this proceeding in 1978, and appellant has offered no explanation for this nonfeasance. During the period of delinquency, interest on the taxes accrued at a rate of 7 percent per annum prior to 1970, and 12 percent per annum thereafter. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 15961.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that negligent inaction by appellant proximately caused a gift tax delinquency and resulted in accrued interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Estate of Gerber, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d 96, 114; <em>Estate of Harvey, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.2d 555, 558.) Appellant therefore should be surcharged for the interest attributable to his nonfeasance. <em>(Estate of Gerber, supra, </em>at p. 114.) Based upon the failure of the petition to account for the interest which accrued during the period in which appellant negligently failed to pay the gift taxes, and surcharge the executor for that sum, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying settlement of the account and final distribution of the estate. <em>(Estate of Harvey, supra, </em>at p. 558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>The judgment is affirmed and the action is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Racanelli, P.
