R. Civ. P. 26(c). In Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Motion (Doc. 40), he avers that Defendants did not attempt to confer with him prior to filing their Motion. (Doc. 40) at 3 n.1. Indeed, nowhere in their Motion (Doc. 39) do Defendants certify that they attempted to confer with Plaintiff prior to filing their Motion. Therefore, Defendants' Motion is due to be denied for this reason alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Nevertheless, the undersigned will address the substantive issues in Defendants' Motion as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Complaint (Doc. 1-1) in state court, alleging breach of contract, bad faith, fraud, and suppression by Defendants for allegedly failing to honor Plaintiff's disability insurance policy. On July 25, 2018, Defendants removed the case to this Court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 1). On August 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (Doc. 13), adding claims of intentional interference with contractual relations and conspiracy, while dropping his claims of fraud and suppression. (Doc. 13) at 8-12. On September 10, 2018, Defendants individually filed Motions to Dismiss (Docs. 17, 18) Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (Doc. 13). On October 16, 2018, Plaintiff filed his Response in Opposition (Doc. 23) to Defendants' Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 6, 2018, Defendant Standard Insurance Company (\"Standard\") filed a Motion for Leave to File Under Seal (Doc. 26) its Reply to Plaintiff's Response in Opposition, claiming \"Standard's Reply contains citations and references to documents considered by Defendants to be highly confidential and sensitive business information.\" (Doc. 26) at 1. On the same day, Standard filed its redacted Reply (Doc. 28) to Plaintiff's Response in Opposition, which included-under seal-an unredacted Reply (Doc. 28-3) and an Exhibit 'A' (Doc. 28-1). Exhibit 'A' included an Administration Agreement and a Reinsurance Agreement between Standard and Defendant Northwestern Mutual.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742741\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/476/819/#p821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Also that day, Standard filed a Motion for a Protective Order (Doc. 27), which Plaintiff opposed (Doc. 29) at 10-12. On November 8, 2018, the United States Magistrate\n   Judge then assigned to the case granted (Doc. 31) Standard's Motion (Doc. 26) \"to the extent that Defendant Standard may file its Reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss and accompanying Exhibit A under seal.\" (Doc. 31) at 1. In that same Order, the Magistrate Judge denied Standard's request for a protective order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742741\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/476/819/#p821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 12, 2018, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Entry of Protective Order (Doc. 32) regarding the designation and protection of \"Confidential\" documents and the previous Magistrate Judge subsequently entered a Stipulated Protective Order (Doc. 33). On December 7, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Uphold Confidentiality Designation (Doc. 39), asserting that Plaintiff was challenging the confidentiality designations of two exhibits filed in its Reply Brief (Doc. 28).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 39) at 3. On December 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Response (Doc. 40) to Defendants' Motion to Uphold (Doc. 39), arguing that Defendants failed to meet their burden of showing good cause why the need for confidentiality outweighed the public interest in open judicial proceedings. (Doc. 40) at 2; (Doc. 29) at 3-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 17, 2018, the previous Magistrate Judge entered an Order (Doc. 42) directing Defendants to file a Reply to Plaintiff's Response \"and address, in particular, Plaintiff's argument regarding the application of the right of public access doctrine in this case.\" (Doc. 42) at 1. On December 21, 2018, Defendants filed a Reply (Doc. 43) to Plaintiff's Response (Doc. 40), opining that \"[t]he public's right of access, while implicated, is overcome by Defendants' showing of good cause.\" The undersigned disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court only granted (Doc. 31) Defendants' Motion (Doc. 26) to the extent it allowed Defendants to file a Reply. Plaintiff noted that Defendants' Motion is silent as to Exhibit A-3 and provides no justification as to why it should remain sealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Defendants seem to concede in their Reply that Exhibit A-3 should not have been filed under seal. (Doc. 43) at 2. Plaintiff also notes that Exhibit A-2 is publicly available on the Securities and Exchange Commission website, and Defendants, again, concedes as such in their Reply. (Doc. 43) at 1, n.1. Plaintiff further notes that Defendants have provided no specific explanations, evidence, or declarations that demonstrate why the exhibits should be sealed. (Doc. 43) at 3. Indeed, the affidavits attached to the exhibits declare only that they are kept in the course of regularly-conducted business and adduce no evidence as to their confidential nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 28-1) at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
