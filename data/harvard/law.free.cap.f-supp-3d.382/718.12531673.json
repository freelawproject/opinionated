Doc. 7. At issue is whether the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") erred in finding Plaintiff not \"disabled\" and therefore unentitled to Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\"). This case is before the Court on Plaintiff's Statement of Errors (doc. 9), the Commissioner's memorandum in opposition (doc. 10), the administrative record (doc. 10),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

PageID 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After initial denial of his applications, Plaintiff received a hearing before ALJ Elizabeth A. Motta on October 14, 2016. PageID 78-99. The ALJ issued a written decision on February 28, 2017 finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 80-99. Specifically, the ALJ found at Step Five that, based upon Plaintiff's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform a reduced range of medium work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the\n   national economy that [Plaintiff] can perform[.]\" PageID 58-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review, making the ALJ's non-disability finding the final administrative decision of the Commissioner.

PageID 59, 62. The undersigned agrees with Plaintiff and finds reversible error in the ALJ's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"In determining whether an individual is disabled,\" an ALJ must consider a plaintiff's \"symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which the symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical and other evidence in the individual's record.\" Soc. Sec. Ruling 16-3p,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205180304\">\n    2017 WL 5180304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Oct. 25, 2017). An ALJ will \"use a two-step process for evaluating an individual's symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. First, an ALJ must \"consider whether there is an underlying medically determinable physical or mental impairment (s) that could reasonably be expected to produce an individual's symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. If so, the second step requires an ALJ to \"evaluate the intensity and persistence of those symptoms to determine the extent to which the symptoms limit an individual's ability to perform work-related activities[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Factors considered at this second step include: (1) plaintiff's daily activities; (2) the location, duration, frequency, and intensity of pain or other symptoms; (3) factors that precipitate and aggravate the symptoms; (4) the type, dosage, effectiveness, and side effects of any medication an individual takes or has taken to alleviate pain or other symptoms; (5) treatment, other than medication, an individual receives or has received for relief of pain or other symptoms; (6) any measures other than treatment an individual uses or has used to relieve pain or other symptoms (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , lying flat on his or her back, standing for 15 to 20 minutes every hour, or sleeping on a board); and (7) any other factors concerning an individual's functional limitations and restrictions due to pain or other symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. An ALJ \"will explain which of an individual's symptoms [he or she] found consistent or inconsistent with the evidence in [the] record and how [the ALJ's] evaluation of [plaintiff's] symptoms led to [the ALJ's] conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Objective Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court first finds error insofar as the ALJ found Plaintiff's statements \"not supported by objective medical evidence.\" PageID 59. Such a statement by\n   the ALJ is ambiguous in that it is not clear whether the ALJ means the record is devoid of objective evidence at all, or that the objective evidence of record is insufficient to support Plaintiff's allegations.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gayheart v.

Further, such conclusion \"lacks adequate explanation of which symptoms are inconsistent with the evidence and how [the ALJ's] evaluation of those symptoms led to his conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Little v.

The Sixth Circuit concludes that \"a psychiatric impairment is not as readily amenable to substantiation by objective laboratory testing as a medical impairment\" and \"consequently, the diagnostic techniques employed in the field of psychiatry may be somewhat less tangible than those in the field of medicine.\"\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v.

Failure to Seek Additional Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The undersigned also finds error in the ALJ's conclusion that Plaintiff's statements regarding the limiting effects of his symptoms are inconsistent with the record in light of his purported failure to seek \"additional treatment, such as counseling.\" PageID 62. Initially, the undersigned notes that Plaintiff, at the administrative hearing, testified that he does go to counseling (PageID 87), making the ALJ's conclusion in this regard questionable on the facts alone. Evidence of record also shows that Plaintiff had counseling at Day-Mont Behavioral Healthcare. PageID 712-13, 716-17. Aside from the foregoing, it is not entirely clear whether any additional treatment was available to Plaintiff and/or recommended\n   to him by a medical professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Regardless, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the ALJ's statement in this regard is otherwise supported by the record, he committed error by not following SSR 16-3p. Pursuant to SSR 16-3p, an ALJ should \"consider an individual's attempts to seek medical treatment for symptoms and to follow treatment once it is prescribed when evaluating whether symptom intensity and persistence affect the ability to perform work-related activities [.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205180304\">\n    2017 WL 5180304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. In that regard, \"if the frequency or extent of the treatment sought ... is not comparable with the degree of the individual's subjective complaints, or if the individual fails to follow prescribed treatment that might improve symptoms, [an ALJ] may find the alleged intensity and persistence of an individual's symptoms are inconsistent with the overall evidence of record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205180304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, an ALJ shall not \"find an individual's symptoms inconsistent with the evidence in the record on this basis without considering possible reasons he or she may not comply with treatment or seek treatment consistent with the degree of his or her complaints.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205180304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, an ALJ \"may need to contact the individual regarding the lack of treatment or, at an administrative proceeding, ask why he or she has not complied with or sought treatment in a manner consistent with his or her complaints.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205180304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On this particular issue, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that \"ALJs must be careful not to assume that a patient's failure to receive mental-health treatment evidences a tranquil mental state\" because \"[f]or some mental disorders, the very failure to seek treatment is simply another symptom of the disorder itself.\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

In determining the severity of Plaintiff's alleged symptoms, the ALJ concluded that \"his ability to engage in employment ... is not consistent with the severity of symptoms he reported.\" PageID 62. Because of such employment, and because Plaintiff's mental health providers did not discourage him from seeking employment, the ALJ found it \"reasonable to infer that [plaintiff's] lack of employment is not necessarily due to any disabling impairments, but could be a matter of choice, at least to some extent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1816634\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/874/1116/#p1121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has noted that an ALJ is not permitted to adjudge a\n   Plaintiff's statements based upon \"intangible or intuitive notion[s][.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.
