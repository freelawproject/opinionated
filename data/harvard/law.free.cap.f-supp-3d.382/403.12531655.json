The Court dispenses with oral argument because the materials before it adequately present the facts and legal contentions, and argument would not aid the decisional process.

Negron, and \"Queen Tut, a woman believed to be known as Carla A. Howell.\" (Original Compl. 1, ECF No. 1.) Goodman, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed an Answer (the \"Original Answer\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 14), and Negron, by counsel, filed a Motion to Dismiss (the \"Original Motion to Dismiss\"), (ECF No. 21). Steele opposed the Original Motion to Dismiss, (ECF No. 24), and Negron replied, (ECF No. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 23, 2018, Plaintiffs requested entry of default as to \"Queen Tut a/k/a Susan A. Lutzke.\" (ECF No. 30.) Because the Original Complaint did not name as a defendant \"Susan A. Lutzke,\" the Court denied Plaintiffs' request for entry of default. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. 9, 2018 Order, ECF No. 35.) On March 25, 2018, Plaintiffs moved to amend their Original Complaint, (ECF No. 36), and on April 11, 2018, the Court granted the motion, (ECF No. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 13, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 39.) The Amended Complaint names three defendants: Jason Goodman, Patricia A. Negron, and \"Susan A. Lutzke a/k/a/ 'Queen Tut' \" (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Am. Compl. 1, ECF No. 39.) Plaintiffs state eight counts against each defendant as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Count I:\n   </strong>\n   Defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (the defamation claim);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Count II:\n   </strong>\n   Insulting words, in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-45\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the insulting words claim);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Count III:\n   </strong>\n   Business conspiracy, in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-499\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-500\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the statutory conspiracy claim);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VI:\n   </strong>\n   Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VII:\n   </strong>\n   Personal trespass by computer in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and computer harassment in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the computer claim);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VIII:\n   </strong>\n   Unauthorized use of name and picture in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-40\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the unauthorized use claim); and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Count IX:\n   </strong>\n   Permanent injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs seek $ 6,000,000 in compensatory damages; $ 18,000,000 as \"[t]hree-fold [d]amages in accordance with \u00a7 18.2-500\" of the Virginia Code; $ 350,000 in punitive damages; prejudgment and postjudgment interest; and attorney's fees and costs. (Am. Compl. 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response to the Amended Complaint, Goodman filed Goodman's Motion to Dismiss and the Motion to Sever. On the same day, Goodman filed an Answer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 44.) Negron filed Negron's Motion to Dismiss. Lutzke did not respond to the Amended Complaint and has not made an appearance of any kind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs responded in opposition to Goodman's Motion to Dismiss and Goodman replied. Plaintiffs also responded in opposition to the Motion to Sever. Goodman did not file\n   a reply, and the time to do so has expired. Finally, Plaintiffs responded in opposition to Negron's Motion to Dismiss and Negron replied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 3, 2018, Plaintiffs requested entry of default as to Lutzke. (ECF No. 65.) On September 6, 2018, the Clerk entered default as to Lutzke. (ECF No. 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Various non-parties have also submitted documents in this matter. George D. Sweigert, a non-party proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   has filed seven declarations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 51, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60.) Sweigert also filed two Notices of Change of Address, (ECF No. 63, 67), and a Notice of Related Litigation, (ECF No. 68). On February 19, 2019, Sweigert filed a \"Notice of Motion to Intervene,\" (ECF No. 72), and then, on the same day, filed the Motion to Intervene,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 73). Goodman opposed the Motion to Intervene. Sweigert subsequently sent several letters to the Clerk's Office. (ECF Nos. 75, 77.) On March 18, 2019, Sweigert filed a \"Notice of Intent to File an Amended Motion,\" (ECF No. 81), but he has not filed any amended motion to date. In the interest of judicial efficiency, the Court will order Sweigert to file an Amended Motion to Intervene, should he still wish to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 29, 2019, Sweigert filed a document titled \"Preliminary Notification to the Government of Canada.\" (ECF No. 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, on March 15, 2019, non-party Jacqulyn Weaver\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a Declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 79.) On March 15, 2019, non-party Dean Fougere\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a \"General Affidavit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 80.) On March 18,\n   2019, non-party Steve Outtrim\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a \"Statement in Response to\" Goodman's Response opposing Sweigert's Motion to Intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 82.) Finally, on March 29, 2019, non-party Kevin Marsden\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a \"Statement in Response to\" Goodman's Response opposing Sweigert's Motion to Intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 83.) The Court will strike the filings that Weaver, Fougere, Outtrim, and Marsden submitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimberlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012680738\">\n    2014 WL 12680738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Summary of Allegations in the Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This action arises out of a series of allegedly defamatory statements that Defendants made against Plaintiffs beginning on June 15, 2017. (Am. Compl. 20.) The Court first provides context about the relevant parties to the action, followed by a summary of Defendants' actions and statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs: Steele and the Earth Intelligence Network\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Steele describes a long list of professional accomplishments, presenting himself as a former Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\") operations officer, a former civil servant, and the holder of various advanced degrees. (Am. Compl. 6.) Steele works to \"redirect[ ] the craft of intelligence away from spies and secrecy enabling war and waste towards open sources and methods favorable to peace and prosperity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8.) In support of this work, Steele formed and operated a company\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   that ultimately helped draft the \"NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Steele asserts, without elaboration, that \"[f]or over twenty (20) years, [Steele] has dedicated himself to teaching individuals and organizations about the value of holistic analytics, true cost economics, and Open Source Everything Engineering.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7.) Steele \"was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize\" based on this work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2006, Steele founded Earth Intelligence Network (\"EIN\"), a Virginia 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and Plaintiff in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9.) \"The original purpose and long-term focus of Earth Intelligence Network is to teach citizens the urgency of demanding holistic analytics, true cost economics, and Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE) as the foundation for enlightened self-governance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9.) In order to fulfill this purpose, EIN started the #UNRIG (sometimes UNRIG) project, \"an educational campaign to communicate to all citizens the possibility of an ethical, legal, non-violent restoration of integrity to the United States Government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs describe the #UNRIG campaign as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   a legitimate full-time effort to unrig the system, \"to restore integrity and truth to governance, with the informed will and wisdom of We the People at its heart\", and \"to enjoy a transparent government by 2022, that operates with honesty, respecting our planet and the human spirit, so that we may create a healthy, prosperous America rooted in truth with peace as our shared condition[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   87-88 (quotations in original without attribution).) In support of this mission, Plaintiffs \"acquired and professionally wrapped an RV, and began a national tour of the [c]ountry in furtherance of the 'Summer of Peace' campaign.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Public donations fund the #UNRIG campaign, and EIN \"is fully transparent and accountable to its donors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9.) Plaintiffs aver they \"account[ ] for every penny spent in a budget that was posted online.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   86 (providing a weblink).) Using the donations, Plaintiffs \"actively promote[ ] the mission of #UNRIG and communicate[ ] with all donors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Defendants: Goodman, Negron, and Lutzke\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Goodman operates \"various social media properties\" under the name \"Crowdsource The Truth\" or \"CSTT.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl. 11.) Plaintiffs quote Goodman, without attribution, describing CSTT as \"an independent news organization dedicated to truth in media and integrity in government. Our process is driven by a unique, open source fact checking 'truth engine' that has been described as a combination of investigative journalism, social media[,] and reality television.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Goodman creates and uploads videos through the various CSTT media properties, which have thousands of followers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Goodman solicits donations, advertises products and derives revenue from\" these videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Goodman often hosts guest speakers in these videos, including Negron and Lutzke.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs aver that Negron \"co-produced numerous videos uploaded to the CSTT YouTube channel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12.) She \"appeared and actively participated in virtually every video at issue in this action, one of which was even filmed at her home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Negron allegedly has over 24,000 followers on Twitter, where she allegedly republished defamatory statements made by Lutzke about Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Lutzke adopted the pseudonym \"Queen Tut\" as her online persona, using an image of an Egyptian bust\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   to represent herself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16.) Lutzke participated in numerous CSTT videos speaking as Queen Tut. In the videos, Defendants refer to Lutzke as Queen Tut and display a picture of the Egyptian statue to represent Lutzke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Actions Through September 1, 2017\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Steele planned on appearing in a CSTT live-stream broadcast on June 15, 2017, in which Goodman and Negron would interview Steele. (Am. Compl. 18.) The day before the scheduled interview, on June 14, 2017, Goodman and Negron published a video that reported, seemingly falsely, that a dirty bomb was present on a ship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of this event, and the ensuing FBI investigation, Steele \"immediately canceled the planned interview\" and informed Goodman via email that Steele did not wish to associate with Goodman any longer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   19.) According to Plaintiffs, \"in retaliation and reprisal for [Steele's] decision to no longer have anything to do with Goodman and CSTT, Goodman, Negron[,] and Lutzke began an unprecedented smear campaign against Plaintiffs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As part of this \"smear campaign,\" Goodman, Negron, and Lutzke produced and published at least a dozen videos between June 15, 2017 and September 1, 2017. On June 16, 2017, Goodman and Negron produced and appeared in a video in which Goodman states he \"made a big mistake\" with Steele. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   21 (quoting Goodman).) In a second video produced and published on the same day, in which both Goodman and Negron appear, Goodman makes disparaging remarks about Steele. Plaintiffs describe the video as \"scripted ahead of time,\" after Goodman and Negron \"discussed\n   the subject matter and content via email, telephone and/or text message. They agreed upon the thesis, theme and tone. Goodman and Negron [spoke] with one voice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   22.) In a June 20, 2017 video, Goodman and Negron appear together in a London hotel room, and Goodman accuses Steele of stealing from the CSTT audience at least three times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On June 26, 2017, Lutzke appeared in a CSTT video as Queen Tut to accuse Steele of fraud. The June 26, 2017 video description provides that \"Confidential Crowdsource contact Queen Tut believes [Steele] has perpetrated a deliberate fraud and details her position in this phone call.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   24 (purporting to quote Goodman).) The Amended Complaint includes a screenshot of the video, showing a stillshot of a man on the left (Goodman) and a photo of an Egyptian bust meant to represent Lutzke. In this video, Goodman states, \"I question if he,[sic] if any of his credentials are authentic. I think he's just a cheap con man.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   25 (quoting the June 26, 2017 video).) In the same video, Goodman states that Steele \"knows it's a useless campaign[;] he's just trying to suck $ 250,000 out of people.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting the June 26, 2017 video).) Lutzke agrees, stating, \"He's really conning people and he's trying to manipulate me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting the June 26, 2017 video).) Goodman accuses Steele of being \"involved in a pretty serious financial scam\" and of \"defrauding people across state lines,\" stating that \"a Rico\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   [sic] charge could be involved\" because \"it seems like he is doing things that are very criminally actionable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting the June 26, 2017 video).) Goodman describes Steele as displaying \"schizophrenic behavior\" and refers to him as \"the robber David who [s]teals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting the June 26, 2017 video).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Between June 15, 2017 and September 1, 2017, Goodman, Negron, and Lutzke published dozens of similar videos. The Amended Complaint provides great detail, including links, screenshots, and direct quotations excerpted from these videos. Goodman appears in all of the videos and is the primary speaker. Plaintiffs allege that Negron co-produced most of the videos, also appearing in many of them, thereby contributing to the insults against Steele and #UNRIG. Lutzke makes a guest appearance on many videos, insulting Steele directly. Lutzke also published derogatory information about Steele on her Twitter account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants' exact invectives vary over the course of the videos, sometimes focusing on personal insults against Steele\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sometimes making accusations against Steele and his organizations, including Plaintiff EIN. Goodman calls Steele a \"fraudster,\" and states that \"[Steele]'s lying.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   28, 45, 55 (quoting various videos).) He claims \"that the objective of the UNRIG campaign is to 'get money' for [Steele].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   41 (quoting an August 13, 2017 video).) Lutzke calls EIN's #UNRIG campaign \"a total scam\" and states that \"Robert David Steele and UNRIG are trying to raise money, as much money as they possibly can to fund their little scam.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   40, 46 (quoting multiple videos).) Negron calls Steele \"a serious con man.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   45\n   (quoting an August 26, 2017 video).) Negron further states: \"this is a serious fraud. I mean that it is a fraud. No question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   46 (quoting an August 26, 2017 video).) Defendants refer to \"the Electoral Reform Act\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   and describe it as part of Plaintiffs' scam. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   45 (quoting an August 26, 2017 video).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to these videos, the Amended Complaint describes several other online platforms through which Defendants publish disparaging comments regarding Plaintiffs, including Twitter and email. On August 11, 2017, for example, Goodman emailed Dr. Cynthia Ann McKinney,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that Steele \"has repeatedly made ignorant and even racist comments, has defrauded my audience of money, has personally and publicly insulted me and is actively attempting to co-opt your credibility to raise funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although some inconsistencies exist,\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   the videos and publications, amply excerpted in the Amended Complaint, share a consistent theme. Defendants persistently accuse Plaintiffs of perpetuating a scam and a fraud on CSTT viewers who donated to EIN's #UNRIG campaign, accusing Plaintiffs of stealing donors' money to personally enrich Steele or his allies\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   rather than using the funds for the #UNRIG mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Actions After September 1, 2017\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that a shift occurred after the filing of this action. While Goodman and Lutzke intensified their attacks against Plaintiffs, Negron ceased to participate in any subsequent video productions or appearances (with one exception). Although Plaintiffs concede Negron ceased her conspiring activities regarding video production with Goodman, Plaintiffs maintain that Negron and Lutzke continued to conspire to defame Plaintiffs through Twitter publications. Negron also limited her role to republishing some of Lutzke's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Between September 1, 2017 and December 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Goodman and Lutzke produced and published about ten videos containing defamatory statements about Plaintiffs. Many of the videos\n   reiterate the same kinds of statements made in previous videos. For example, in one video, Goodman states, \"Steele is not in fact engaged in a campaign to execute election reform.\" (Am. Compl. 50 (quoting a September 6, 2017 video).) Lutzke also alleges that Steele did not engage in his \"Summer of Peace\" campaign, claiming \"[t]hey never went anywhere. Basically, it never happened.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   52 (quoting a September 11, 2017 video).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants also acknowledge and discuss the ongoing litigation in their videos. In a September 23, 2017 video, Goodman and Lutzke \"accuse [Steele] of engaging in a 'conspiracy to suppress free speech.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   55.) Lutzke states that \"we were the ones who revealed his basic fraud that he's been perpetuating for a number of years using this electoral reform act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting a September 23, 2017 video).) In the same video, Goodman suggests that Steele \"is trying to raise money so he can buy RVs so he can crash them and buy soft drinks and give gifts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   56 (quoting a September 23, 2017 video).) Lutzke states, \"Steele is in a conspiracy to take down Crowdsource the Truth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   57 (quoting a September 23, 2017 video).) In a different video featuring Goodman and Lutzke, Goodman states \"we have very solid evidence of fraud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   60 (quoting a September 30, 2017 video).) Goodman describes himself as \"happy\" about the lawsuit \"go[ing] forward\" because the lawsuit will expose \"charity fraud and tax fraud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   62 (quoting an October 7, 2017 video).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Knowledge of the lawsuit does not appear to deter Goodman or Lutzke from attacking Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Well after actual notice of the lawsuit, communicated in the September 23, 2017 video described above, Goodman and Lutzke published other videos disparaging Plaintiffs. In one video, Goodman and Lutzke refer to Steele's \"fraudulent election reform campaign.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   61 (quoting a September 30, 2017 video). Lutzke calls this \"charity fraud...[T]hat's a fact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Goodman warns viewers that they, as donors, may face legal consequences:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   if someone tries to take a tax deduction on their donation to the Earth Intelligence Network, they themselves could be in legal jeopardy - you should consult your accountant and an attorney before you try to take a tax deduction on any donation made to this fraudulent 501c3. This is a public service announcement to members of the crowdsource community who have been victims of fraud - fraud executed by Robert David Steele.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 27, 2017, Goodman published a video containing an image of Steele's face superimposed onto a farm animal's rear end. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   65 (containing a screenshot from the video).) CSTT viewers can purchase t-shirts and coffee mugs featuring this image. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In a December 27, 2017 video featuring Goodman, Negron,\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Lutzke (as Queen Tut), Defendants discuss the costs Negron has expended on retaining counsel. Lutzke states that \"as soon as\" counsel for Plaintiffs takes \"any kind of action against Queen Tut,\" she \"will file a complaint with the Virginia State Bar and...have his license.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   70 (quoting a December 27, 2017 video).) Lutzke states that she sent\n   documents to the Court related to this case, although she has not yet made an appearance of any kind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that some of the videos incite violence against Steele. In one video featuring Goodman and Lutzke, Lutzke directly addresses Steele: \"you're a person who needs to be put down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   57 (quoting a September 23, 2017 video).) According to Plaintiffs, Goodman interjects to say \"legally speaking,\" and Lutzke then says: \"legally speaking[,] absolutely legally speaking[,] that you need to be put in a place where you can no longer affect human beings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting a September 23, 2017 video).) Goodman and Lutzke published a different video that includes an image of an RV exploding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   59 (containing a screenshot of a September 30, 2017 video).) The side of the flaming RV displays a picture of Steele and McKinney. This image also includes a cartoon figure holding a rifle, with an image of Steele's face superimposed onto the cartoon, standing in the foreground. Plaintiffs further aver that Goodman and Lutzke \"disclosed [Steele's] home address to their viewers and subscribers, and used Google Maps to show a photo of [Steele]'s home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Since December 2017, Goodman, acting alone, has continued to make allegedly defamatory statements against Plaintiffs. For example, he published at least four videos between February 2018 and April 13, 2018, the date of the filing of this Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   70- 73.) Goodman repeats similar accusations of fraud present in earlier videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Lutzke, similarly, has published, through Twitter and videos, negative commentary about Plaintiffs since December 2017. In one Twitter post, Lutzke calls Steele \"the greatest plagiarizer and liar on the internet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   78.) And according to Plaintiffs, Lutzke \"has now escalated the falsehoods to and [sic] include accusations that [Steele] protects pedophiles, defends child traffickers, wants JIHAD in the United States, has committed 'espionage' and 'treason', and [sic] etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Negron has neither produced nor appeared in any more videos since December 2017. Though not creating content, Plaintiffs aver that Negron continued to conspire with Lutzke to defame Plaintiffs, and that Negron republished some of Lutzke's Twitter publications as part of this conspiracy.

References to Steele as a \"con man\" and to UNRIG as a \"fraud\" do not exist in a vacuum or only as part of a litany of generic insults. Instead, the context in which Negron made the statements unmistakably indicates that Negron joined in and adopted as her own Goodman and Lutzke's accusations that Plaintiffs used EIN donations to personally benefit Steele, thus defrauding CSTT viewers who donated to EIN (through UNRIG). Because Plaintiffs contend that they accounted for \"every penny\" donated to EIN, (Am.

More importantly, even viewing the allegations in the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Steele certainly presents as a public figure for purposes of a defamation claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Because Steele is a public figure, to prevail in their defamation claim, Plaintiffs must ultimately prove that Negron made the statements with \" 'actual malice'-that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

But Plaintiffs allege that \"Goodman, Negron and Lutzke intentionally set out to destroy Plaintiffs' reputation with falsehoods.\" (Am. Compl. 86.)

(Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 23.) The Court finds otherwise. Though minimal, the Amended Complaint contains sufficient allegations for purposes of the instant motion. Plaintiffs contend that, as a result of Defendants' actions, Steele experienced \"pain and suffering, physical injury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   severe emotional trauma, insult, embarrassment, humiliation, public ridicule, anguish, stress and anxiety, [and] injury to reputation.\" (Am.

In response, Plaintiffs do not oppose dismissing these claims against Negron. Plaintiffs concede that \"[t]hese Counts are more properly directed to Goodman and Lutzke.\" (Resp. Negron Mot.

Unlike Negron's Motion to Dismiss, Goodman does not challenge all nine counts pled against him. Even liberally construing Goodman's Motion to Dismiss, as the Court must when evaluating a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   party's motion, Goodman raises three arguments challenging the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deabreu v.

First, Goodman invokes Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-223.2 (the \"Immunity Provision\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   which could create a possible defense for Count I (the defamation claim), Count III (the statutory conspiracy claim), and Count V (the tortious interference claim).\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, Goodman argues the Amended Complaint fails to show \"actual malice.\" Finally, Goodman disputes the facts as Plaintiffs allege them. For the\n   reasons below, each argument fails at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As to his first challenge under the Immunity Provision, Goodman cannot avail himself of its protection on this record. By its terms, the Immunity Provision \"shall not apply to any statements made with actual or constructive knowledge that they are false or with reckless disregard for whether they are false.\" VA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 8.01-223.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   But the Amended Complaint is replete with assertions that Goodman made the multitude of statements with actual knowledge of their falsity. Plaintiffs allege that, \"[d]espite their actual knowledge to the contrary, [Defendants] published false and defamatory statements that #UNRIG was a 'scam' and that Plaintiffs were defrauding and stealing from donors.\" (Am. Compl. 88.) Defendants, including Goodman, \"intentionally ignored online evidence...that proved their statements about [Steele] were false.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that \"Defendants' own videos...demonstrate that they actively reviewed Plaintiffs' websites and learned all about the #UNRIG campaign.\" (Am. Compl. 87.) Plaintiffs contend that the #UNRIG campaign \"accounted for every penny spent in a budget that was posted online.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   86 (providing a link).) These allegations plausibly support a conclusion that Goodman made the statements with knowledge of their falsity or with a reckless disregard as to their veracity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    556 U.S. at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   VA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 8.01-223.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, Goodman argues that he lacked actual malice. To show actual malice, Plaintiffs, as public figures, must ultimately prove that Goodman made the statement \"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p280\">\n    376 U.S. at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p280\">\n    84 S.Ct. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   But at this early juncture, the allegations against Goodman support a finding that Plaintiffs adequately allege malice on behalf of Defendants, including Goodman. Goodman argues that \"[f]ederal courts also routinely grant anti-SLAPP motions in cases involving the media where, as here, the reporter's newsgathering plainly demonstrates a lack of actual malice.\" (Goodman Mot. Dismiss 4, ECF No. 45.) But taking Plaintiffs' well-pleaded allegations as true, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to support their claim that Goodman made his statements with actual malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiffs aver that Goodman undertook this \"smear campaign\" as \"retaliation\" for Steele distancing himself from Goodman. (Am. Compl. 20.) Immediately after Steele cancelled an interview appearance on Goodman's CSTT production, Goodman produced and published dozens of videos insulting Steele and EIN and accusing them of fraud. According to Plaintiffs, Steele enjoyed a pristine reputation before these videos. This plausibly supports Plaintiffs' claim that Goodman acted in retaliation after Steele canceled a scheduled interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that, despite familiarity with Plaintiffs' websites and access to Plaintiffs' publicly-available online financial records, Defendants used these videos to claim- without evidence-that Plaintiffs defrauded donors. Goodman encouraged CSTT viewers to ask Plaintiffs for refunds for donations made, informing these donors that they may face \"legal jeopardy\" for their contributions to EIN and its #UNRIG campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, Goodman argues in his Reply to Plaintiffs' Response opposing Goodman's Motion to Dismiss, that \"the statements are true. They are based on fact, supported by evidence.\" (Reply Goodman Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Dismiss 1, ECF No. 52.) Goodman cannot prevail on the defense of \"truth\" due to the deference the Court must give Plaintiffs' allegations at this procedural stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kensington\n   </em>\n   , 684 F.3d at 467. Although Goodman may later raise this defense and challenge Plaintiffs' factual allegations, he cannot do so at this procedural juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   At this stage, Plaintiffs plead sufficient facts to show that Goodman cannot avail himself of the protections of the Immunity Provision and to establish malice for purposes of Goodman's Motion to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Goodman cannot dispute well-pleaded facts in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Because each of Goodman's arguments in Goodman's Motion to Dismiss turn on the Immunity Provision, an absence of malice, and disputing the facts as Plaintiffs plead them, the Court will deny Goodman's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Summary of Claims Surviving Rule 12(b)(6) Scrutiny\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As to Negron, the Court will deny in part and grant in part Negron's Motion to Dismiss. Five of the nine claims will proceed against Negron: the defamation claim; the statutory conspiracy claim; the common law conspiracy claim; the tortious interference claim; and the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. However, the Court will dismiss the following four counts against Negron: the insulting words claim; the computer claims; the unauthorized use claim; and the request for a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As to Goodman, the Court will deny Goodman's Motion to Dismiss.

Analysis: Motion to Sever\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In addition to Goodman's Motion to Dismiss, Goodman filed a Motion to Sever, asking to \"sever his trial from that of his [c]odefendants\" Negron and Lutzke. (Mot. Sever 1, ECF No. 46.) The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern severance. Goodman invokes two rules in his Motion to Sever: Rule 21, which does not apply,\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Rule 42. Rule 42 states, in relevant part: \"For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a separate trial of one or more separate issues, claims, crossclaims, counterclaims, or third-party claims.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In support of his Motion to Sever, Goodman claims that Plaintiff Steele and Defendant Lutzke have conspired against him to bring this action. He raises numerous allegations related to Steele's motivations in bringing this lawsuit. Goodman also accuses Lutzke of filing false paperwork with the Court. Goodman does not cite to any case law in support of his Motion to Sever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court, considering the record before it, cannot conclude that separate trials would increase convenience, avoid prejudice, or expedite and economize judicial resolution to this matter.
