Aponte's interference claim under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , based on Defendant Brown &amp; Brown of Florida, Inc.'s (\"B &amp; B\") termination of Aponte's employment\n   after he requested FMLA leave. The Court has carefully reviewed the facts to which the parties stipulated before trial, the trial testimony, the exhibits admitted at trial, the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by the parties, arguments submitted post-trial, and the relevant law. The Court issues the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 52. For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that B &amp; B has established its \"same decision\" affirmative defense and is entitled to judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case stems from B &amp; B's termination of Aponte's employment based on his failure to fulfill B &amp; B's licensing requirement. Aponte worked for B &amp; B for approximately eighteen months, from October 5, 2015 to March 3, 2017. (Doc. 44 at 37-38). B &amp; B is an insurance provider with over 285 profit centers and 10,000 employees across the United States, Canada, and England. (Doc. 70 at 80, 109, &amp; 145).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In August 2015, Aponte accepted B &amp; B's job offer for an Inside Sales/Sales Associate position in its Orlando, Florida office, notably the email containing the job offer did not state that Aponte was required to have a 2-20 license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 71 at 11 &amp; Plaintiff's Exhibit 6 (\"Pl.'s Ex.\")). During Aponte's employment, he worked in the Personal Lines Department and directly reported to his supervisor, Kathy Beck, the Personal Lines Manager, Team Leader.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 70 at 22, 42-43, &amp; 119). Beck reported directly to Peter Matulis, the Executive Vice President and Profit Center Leader in the Orlando office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25, 51, 80, 109, &amp; 119).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 5, 2015, Aponte's first day of work, he signed a job description which stated that a property and casualty 2-20 license was required for his position. (Doc. 71 at 14, 60-63, &amp; Pl.'s Ex. 8). On October 6, 2015, Beck emailed Aponte, confirming that his position required him to have a 2-20 license and instructing Aponte that he would need to obtain a 2-20 license within the next twelve months, no later than October 5, 2016. (Doc. 70 at 44-45; Doc. 71 at 15 &amp; Pl.'s Ex. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From the beginning of his employment, Aponte understood that this was a requirement for his job and that if he did not obtain the 2-20 license within a year, he would be terminated. (Doc. 71 at 60-63). This requirement did not change during his employment at B &amp; B. (Doc. 70 at 43). The requirements for obtaining a 2-20 license include: being fingerprinted, completing 200 hours of coursework, and passing the 2-20 exam. (Doc. 70 at 113 &amp; 201; Doc. 71 at 65). After completing the coursework, a person becomes eligible to take the 2-20 exam. (Doc. 71 at 104). To pass the examine, an examinee needs to score at least a 70%. (Doc. 70 at 113; Doc. 71 at 30, 71 &amp; Def's Exs. 18-21). The State of Florida allows examinees to take the 2-20 exam a maximum of five times within a year. (Doc. 70 at 85 &amp; 201; Doc. 71 at 74-75 &amp; 101). Aponte took the exam at a Pearson Vue testing center. (Def's Exs. 18-21). The center provided testing results immediately after an examinee completed the exam. (Doc. 71 at 85). If an examinee passed, the center would have immediately given him his 2-20 license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While Aponte did not possess a 2-20 license during his B &amp; B employment, he had previously obtained a 4-40 property\n   and casualty license in 2006. (Doc. 70 at 24-26 ; Doc. 71 at 8 &amp; Pl's Ex. 4). A key difference between the two licenses is how the sale is made. A 4-40 license limited Aponte to only conducting inside sales. (Doc. 70 at 25-26). In other words, Aponte could not solicit business and had to wait for customers to approach him. For example, at B &amp; B, he would take telephone calls requesting insurance quotes or other B &amp; B employees might bring him a lead from one of their commercial accounts of someone who was interested in obtaining personal lines insurance and Aponte would talk to the client. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In contrast, a 2-20 license allows its holder to solicit customers, or conduct outside sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23). An employee exceeding the scope of his license would lead to the State of Florida disciplining the employee and his employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). During Aponte's B &amp; B employment, he only conducted inside sales and did not exceed the scope of his 4-40 license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 &amp; 77). The 2-20 license is a B &amp; B requirement. (Doc. 70 at 25, 75-76, 122, &amp; 207-208; Doc. 71 at 101-102 &amp; Pl.'s Ex. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 19, 2016, Tina Cockayne, an Accounting-Team Resources Associate, emailed Aponte to remind him of the licensing requirement and to advise him to contact her or Beck if he anticipated any issues with the October 5 deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 70 at 176-178; Doc. 71 at 63-64 &amp; Defendant's Exhibit 7 at 2 (\"Def.'s Ex.\")). It is part of her job duties to monitor the licensing requirements of B &amp; B employees. (Doc. 70 at 130 &amp; 175-176). She primarily handles payroll and some human resources duties but has no managerial responsibilities at B &amp; B, such as making the decision to terminate an employee's employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117-118 &amp; 174-175). Aponte received the email but did not respond as the email did not request a response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177-178; Doc. 71 at 64 &amp; Def.'s Ex. 7). In August 2016, Aponte began to study three to four hours a day for the exam. (Doc. 71 at 69-70 &amp; 103-104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 22, 2016, Cockayne emailed Aponte again, requesting an update on his 2-20 license progress. (Doc. 70 at 49 &amp; 178; Doc. 71 at 64 &amp; Def.'s Ex. 7 at 1-2). He failed to respond to the email. (Doc. 70 at 178; Doc. 71 at 64 &amp; Def.'s Ex. 7). On October 3, 2016, two days before the deadline, Cockayne emailed Beck about Aponte's license status. (Doc. 70 at 50-52, 121-122, 179-181, &amp; Def.'s Ex. 7 at 1). She informed Beck that Aponte had failed to respond to her previous emails regarding his 2-20 license progress and she had contacted the Florida Department of Insurance. (Doc. 70 at 180, 192-193, &amp; Def.'s Ex. 7 at 1). She learned that Aponte had taken no steps to obtain his 2-20 license: he had not taken the required course, exam, nor been fingerprinted. (Doc. 70 at 179-181 &amp; Def.'s Ex. 7 at 1). Cockayne also stated: \"[t]his matter creates both internal and legal non-compliance issues. It is extremely important that either Angel's position is consistent with a 440 license, or that he obtain the 220 license immediately.\" (Def.'s Ex. 7 at 1). Cockayne copied Matulis and Graham Kolterjohn, B &amp; B's Senior Vice President in the Orlando office, on the email. (Doc. 70 at 50-51, 141-142, &amp; Def.'s Ex. 7 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the October 5 deadline came, Aponte had not obtained a 2-20 license. (Doc. 71 at 65). Aponte still had not made any effort to complete the requirements to obtain a 2-20 license because he could not afford the course and exam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-71). Despite Cockayne's July 19, 2016 email advising Aponte to notify Beck or Cockayne if he had any issues with the deadline, in October 2016, Aponte first informed\n   Beck that he had financial issues and could not pay for both the course and the exam. (Doc. 70 at 48 &amp; 60; Doc. 71 at 65-71 &amp; Pl's Ex. 17). On October 23, 2016, Matulis emailed Beck, inquiring as to why Aponte had not responded to Cockayne's October 3 email or taken any steps to obtain his 2-20 license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 70 at 52, 121-122, &amp; Def's Ex. 7 at 1). Instead of terminating Aponte's employment, B &amp; B offered to pay for his course and exam. (Doc. 70 at 33; Doc. 71 at 69). In October 2016, Aponte enrolled in a course paid for by B &amp; B. (Doc. 70 at 78; Doc. 71 at 28 &amp; 69).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 17, 2016, B &amp; B promoted Aponte to the Personal Lines Representative position and he received a merit pay increase authorized by Matulis. (Doc. 70 at 124-126, 137-138 ; Doc. 71 at 69 &amp; Pl's Ex. 11). B &amp; B promoted Aponte because a federal guideline required B &amp; B to review all of its employees and to make either a status change from exempt to non-exempt or position changes in compliance with federal law. (Doc. 70 at 125). Aponte still worked in the Personal Lines Department and reported to Beck. (Pl's Ex. 10). On November 17, 2016, Aponte signed a job description for this position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The job description did not specifically state that a 2-20 license was required but generally stated that a \"Property and Casualty license\" was required. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Aponte understood that this meant that he was still required to obtain a 2-20 license. (Doc. 71 at 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As Aponte's course was eight weeks long, he was unable to take the exam in October and November 2016 as he had to complete the course first. (Doc. 71 at 29). He completed the course in December 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 &amp; 104). However, he was unable to take the exam in December 2016 because there were no spots available for that month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). Aponte booked his first exam for January 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 11, 2017, Aponte took and failed the exam, scoring a 60%. (Doc. 70 at 55; Doc. 71 at 70-71 &amp; Def's Ex. 18). On January 20, 2017, Beck provided Aponte with a performance evaluation. (Doc. 70 at 60-63; Doc. 71 at 71-73 &amp; Pl's Ex. 14). Beck communicated to him that he was required to obtain his 2-20 license as soon as possible. (Doc. 70 at 62; Doc. 71 at 72 &amp; Pl's Ex. 14). On the performance evaluation form, it stated \"Obtain 220- this is required asap\" and Beck rated Aponte \"some, but below level required for role\" in the \"Licensing and educational requirements\" category, commenting that he was \"working on acquiring his 220 license.\" (Pl's Ex. 14 at 1-2). Aponte signed the evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In late January 2017 or early February 2017, Matulis met with Beck to evaluate the performance of the employees in her department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 70 at 55-57 &amp; 126). They discussed Aponte's licensing issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-127). Matulis directed Beck to inform Aponte that if he did not pass his next exam, B &amp; B would terminate his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57 &amp; 127-128). On January 31, 2017, Aponte took the exam and failed for the second time, earning a 61%. (Doc. 71 at 74 &amp; Def's Ex. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 2, 2017, instead of following Matulis' instructions, Beck spoke to and emailed Aponte about the licensing situation, offering him a 30-day probationary period to obtain his 2-20 license or he\n   would be terminated. (Doc. 70 at 30-31; Doc. 71 at 76-77 &amp; Pl's Ex. 17). In the email, Beck stated that \"I have decided to give you an additional 30 days from today, not a day more to acquire your 2-20 License by 3/2/2017.\" (Pl's Ex. 17). Beck handwrote \"3/3/17\" on the email and both she and Aponte signed it. (Doc. 70 at 64-65; Doc. 71 at 24 &amp; Pl's Ex. 17). However, thirty days from February 2, 2017, was March 4, 2017, a Saturday. (Doc. 70 at 31 &amp; 88; Doc. 71 at 24). Matulis learned about the email and Beck's deadline. (Doc. 70 at 32-33,78, &amp; 92). On February 18 and 24, 2017, Aponte took the exam and failed both times, scoring a 67% and 65%, respectively. (Doc. 71 at 81, 83, &amp; Def.'s Exs. 20 &amp; 21). While employed at B &amp; B, Aponte failed the exam a total of four times. (Doc. 71 at 71, 74, 81,83, &amp; Def's Exs. 18-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the week of February 20, 2017, Matulis directed Cockayne to contact Aponte on March 3, 2017 to inquire whether Aponte had obtained his 2-20 license. (Doc. 70 at 130-131, 161, &amp; 183-184). Matulis told her that if Aponte did not have the license on that day, Cockayne was to communicate Matulis' decision to terminate Aponte's employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130-131, 161, &amp; 183-184).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 24, 2017, Aponte booked a 2-20 exam for his fifth and final attempt for Friday, March 3, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. (Doc. 71 at 25-26 &amp; Pl's Ex. 18). Two days later, on February 26, 2017, Aponte became ill. (Doc. 71 at 26). His ulcerative colitis had flared up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71 at 93-95). Aponte noticed blood in his stool and started feeling abdominal pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). He began going to the restroom more frequently and was unable to walk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Previously in 2013, Aponte was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). Ulcerative colitis is a disease which affects the colon, intestines, and abdomen. (Doc. 70 at 34; Doc. 71 at 27 &amp; 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 27, 2017, Aponte was admitted to the hospital and was discharged on March 2, a total of four days. (Doc. 44 at 37; Doc. 70 at 33-34; Doc. 71 at 30-31 &amp; 35). This was the first time that he had been hospitalized during his B &amp; B employment. (Doc. 71 at 35). Aponte did not foresee his hospitalization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 &amp; 77). On February 27, 2017, Matulis first learned of Aponte's hospitalization. (Doc. 70 at 95). While Aponte was in the hospital, Beck visited him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-36). From February 28 to March 1, Beck exchanged emails with Cockayne about Aponte's status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37 &amp; Pl's Ex. 19). Beck informed Cockayne that Aponte had undergone a colonoscopy and biopsy and was waiting for the results. (Pl's Ex. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On Thursday, March 2, 2017, Aponte was released from the hospital. (Doc. 71 at 31). He was unable to drive himself home because he was on multiple medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32). On March 3, 2017, Aponte was physically and mentally unable to sit for his scheduled 2-20 exam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-34). He was experiencing pain in his stomach, feeling dizzy from his medications, and frequently using the bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-34). On that same date at 11:46 a.m., Aponte emailed Cockayne. (Doc. 70 at 152; Doc. 71 at 35-36 &amp; Pl's Ex. 22). The emailed stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Tina,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-27\">\n   I would like to know how can I file for a medical leave of absence (FMLA) [b]ecause of the recent stress I'm still in quite a bit of pain and unable to come to work [.] I have a follow-up appointment next Thursday. My results were not good and I'd rather not go into detail. My [d]octor can provide any information you may need. Please advise as to what would be the next steps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Pl's Ex. 22 at 1-2). Upon receiving the email, Cockayne contacted Brian Pinkalla, Director of Team Resources, Employment\n   Practices, for guidance. (Doc. 70 at 152-154, 185-187, 210 &amp; 212-214). Pinkalla provided consulting services for human resources-related issues to B &amp; B offices (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210), but he did not possess the authority to change a manager's disciplinary decision and lacked the power to terminate or discipline anyone other than employees under his direct supervision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221-222). Per Pinkalla's request, at 12:00 p.m., Cockayne forwarded Beck's February 2 probation email to Pinkalla. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-153, 185-187, 212-214 &amp; Pl's Ex. 23). Cockayne and Pinkalla spoke on the phone about the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185-187 &amp; 212-214). Pinkalla told her that Aponte's licensing situation and his FMLA request were separate issues as the decision had already been made to terminate Aponte based on his failure to obtain a 2-20 license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-154, 186-187, 217, &amp; 232-233). Therefore, Pinkalla told Cockayne that she could proceed with communicating Matulis' decision to terminate Aponte if he failed to obtain the license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-154 &amp; 186-187).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Later that afternoon, Cockayne and Aponte spoke on the telephone. (Doc. 70 at 161-163 &amp; 187-188; Doc. 71 at 37). Cockayne asked Aponte whether he had the license and he said no. (Doc. 70 at 161-163 &amp; 187-188). Cockayne then informed Aponte that his employment with B &amp; B was terminated as result of his failure to acquire a 2-20 license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161-163 &amp; 187-188). At 3:32 p.m., Cockayne emailed Aponte, stating that he had been terminated for failure to acquire his 2-20 license. (Doc. 70 at 161, 187-188, &amp; Pl's Ex. 22). After his termination, he never took the exam again. (Doc. 71 at 100-102). At the time of the trial, Aponte had never obtained his 2-20 license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 31, 2018, Aponte filed his four-count complaint against B &amp; B, alleging that B &amp; B violated the FMLA (Counts I and II); the Florida Civil Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20760.01\">\n    Fla.

(Doc. 1). On October 1, 2018, both parties filed their respective motions for summary judgment (Doc. 25; Doc. 26). While B &amp; B moved for summary judgement on all the claims (Doc. 25), Aponte only moved for partial summary judgment on certain issues. (Doc. 26). The Court granted in part and denied in part both parties' motions. (Doc. 52). As to B &amp; B's motion, the Court granted the motion as to Count II, Count III, and Count IV.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-23). This is the key issue left for the bench trial. As to Aponte's motion, the Court granted Aponte's motion on certain issues, finding that: (1) Aponte had a serious health condition under the FMLA; (2) Aponte was an FMLA-eligible employee and B &amp; B was an FMLA-covered employer; and (3) Aponte suffered an FMLA-qualifying absence when he was interned\n   and incapacitated in the hospital, and while he remained convalescing under doctors' care for at least one week post-hospitalization.

(Doc. 71 at 124-125). However, \"a causal nexus is not an element of an interference claim, but that the employer can raise the lack of causation as an affirmative defense.\"\n    <em>\n     Spakes v. Broward Cty.

(Doc. 70 at 130-131, 161, &amp; 183-184).

Cockayne and Pinkalla lacked the power to terminate Aponte and were merely carrying out Matulis' decision.

Moreover, while the parties debate this issue, the Court emphasizes that Matulis did not state that Aponte had to pass the exam by March 3, 2017, but that he had to obtain his 2-20 license by March 3, 2017 or be terminated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fr12\" name=\"fr12\">\n      12\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Unpublished opinions of the Eleventh Circuit constitute persuasive, not binding, authority.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11th Cir.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    R. 36-2 and I.O.P. 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fr13\" name=\"fr13\">\n      13\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Similarly, the Court is unpersuaded by Aponte's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Parris v.

However in\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    , the court held that the plaintiff's FMLA interference claim based on the plaintiff not being reinstated to her position could not go forward because the employer had shown that it would have refused to reinstate the employee for a reason wholly unrelated to her FMLA leave.\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203422416\">\n     2006 WL 3422416\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *19. Similar to the present case, the plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    also sought equitable relief, such as reinstatement.

However, the statute does not state that this is the only circumstance that would allow an employer to lawfully deny an employee's right to restoration. In addition, the statute only protects those employees who meet the definition of an \"eligible employee\" as defined by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202614\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202614\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(A).
