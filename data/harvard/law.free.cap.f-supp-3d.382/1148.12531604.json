However, understanding that the terms could not be changed is substantively different from asking questions about the terms and being refused an answer and has not been found in Washington courts to be a basis for procedural unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    Romney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174128\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/186/728/#p735\">\n    186 Wash.App. at 736-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=349%20P.3d%2032\">\n    349 P.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no procedural unconscionability when employees attempted to negotiate terms of arbitration agreement and were refused).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regarding undue pressure and lack of reasonable opportunity to consider the terms, Plaintiffs make a fair case that they were under some pressure to sign the arbitration agreements. Plaintiffs explain that by the time they received the package of documents containing the agreements, \"each had been led to believe by Movement that employment was virtually guaranteed and each had taken significant steps in reliance on an offer of employment by Movement, including stopping looking for other work.\" Dkt. 14 at 13 (citing Dkt. 17, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17; Dkt. 16, \u00b615). Mordue had incurred expenses in reliance on his prospective employment, and Hoober \"was pressured to complete the new hire paperwork quickly in order to participate in training that was taking place shortly after the paperwork was sent to her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Movement argues that the agreements are enforceable because Plaintiffs each voluntarily executed the arbitration agreements and failed to exercise the option to opt out of arbitration within thirty days of signing. Dkt. 7 at 6-7. On one hand, the opt-out provision was clearly indicated under the heading \"Opt Out Rights\" in the last paragraph of the agreement and features a minimally burdensome procedure. Hoober Agreement \u00a7 13; Mordue Agreement \u00a7 13. During the thirty-day period, Plaintiffs arguably could have reviewed the agreements and consulted counsel to make a more informed choice.\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   , 153 Wash.2d at 349,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20773\">\n    103 P.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that a week was ample opportunity to consider and consult counsel about arbitration agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the other hand, under the Court's reading of the contracts, the opportunity to opt out is not costless. Plaintiffs do not address the opt-out provision in their briefing. Section 13 of the Hoober Agreement states that \"If you opt out, you will not receive the consideration provided to those who sign the Agreement and do not opt out thereafter,\" and section 13 of the Mordue Agreement states that \"If you opt out, you will not receive the consideration provided to those who sign the Agreement and do not opt out thereafter, including the ability to raise disputes through the arbitration process.\" The meaning of \"consideration\" is not defined in the Agreement;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   consideration in a contract for employment is typically pay. Moreover, while neither section 13 nor any other section of the Hoober's Agreement referred her to the Team Leader Agreement for additional information on the opt-out provision's impact on her rights, section 8 of her Team Leader Agreement, titled \"Choice of Law and Forum/Jurisdiction\" states that \"should Employee opt out of the Employee Arbitration Agreement, the Parties agree that any litigation between the Parties may only be brought in federal district court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina....\" Dkt. 21-1 at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Court's reading, the contract operates to make litigation substantially less appealing, both based on the cost of travel to a distant forum and because the question of what substantive law would apply in the North Carolina federal district court is unclear. Because the opt out provision is somewhat confusing and misleading, the Court finds it does not advance Movement's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is concerning that Hoober was under some pressure to complete her forms quickly and that Mordue was asked to expend substantial funds on reliance on the offer of employment before the contract was presented. However, neither Plaintiff argues that they asked questions or asked for additional time to consider the agreements or consult counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   , 153 Wash.2d at 350-51,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20773\">\n    103 P.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that if employee can show employer had threatened to fire him if he did not sign the agreement despite his indication of a lack of understanding, those facts would support a claim of procedural unconscionability).

Dkt. 14 at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Movement makes separate arguments regarding the Hoober Agreement and the Mordue Agreement. Movement argues that the Choice of Law provision Hoober references is contained in her Team Leader Agreement and does not apply to her arbitration agreement. Dkt. 22 at 10. The section of Hoober's Team Leader Agreement titled \"Choice of Law and Forum/Jurisdiction\" states in part that \"[t]he Parties agree that this Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with North Carolina law.\" Dkt. 21-1 at 12-13. Regarding the Mordue Agreement, Movement argues that \"[t]he application of North Carolina law to determine the meaning and enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement does not in any way prejudice Mordue\" because the agreement is enforceable under Washington or North Carolina contract law. Dkt. 22 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Movement calls Plaintiffs' argument, that compelling arbitration would preclude relief under Washington wage and hour laws, \"outrageous\" and argues that it \"appears to be based on a deliberate failure to read the plain language of the Agreements\" because both arbitration agreements provide that the arbitrator is authorized \"to award any remedy or relief that would have been available to the Parties, in their individual capacity, had the matter been heard in a court having jurisdiction over the claim,\" to specifically include attorneys' fees and costs. Dkt. 22 at 11 (citing Hoober Agreement \u00a7 8; Mordue Agreement \u00a7 8). The Court construes Movement's arguments as an admission that their intent in contracting and their position as to the contracts' correct interpretation is that all rights and relief available under Washington law are available in arbitration. Therefore, any provisions in either Mordue or Hoober's contract are severed to the degree they contradict this admission. This finding applies to both the agreements to arbitrate and any jointly executed instrument which may be read as one contract under Washington law, consistent with Movement's position that nothing in the Team Leader Agreement precludes substantive relief under Washington law in arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cedar River Water &amp; Sewer Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4298050\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/178/763/#p784\">\n    178 Wash.2d at 784-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20P.3d%201065\">\n    315 P.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, \"[a] subject-matter exclusion may also be nominally mutual, yet have the impermissible effect of being so one-sided and harsh that it is substantively unconscionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs argue that because the agreements limit all claims which would be brought by employees to individual arbitration, but Movement can and does initiate lawsuits against its employees, sometimes joining multiple employees as defendants despite the arbitration agreements' provisions prohibiting class arbitration, the agreements are sufficiently one-sided as to be substantively unconscionable.

Dkt. 22 at 6. In the Court's reading it is similar to Plaintiffs' arbitration agreements in requiring\n   the type of claims an employee would likely bring against an employer to be arbitrated, but different in that it does not include an individual arbitration provision, and so suit against multiple employees would not violate a mutual duty of individual proceedings. Dkt. 18-4 at 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Regarding Movement's suit against multiple employees in the remaining cases, Movement explains that the arbitration agreements \"specifically excluded from arbitration claims seeking injunctive relief.\" Dkt. 22 at 6. While Plaintiffs do not argue their arbitration agreements contain an exception for injunctive relief such that they may be subject to suit, Hoober's Team Leader Agreement includes a paragraph titled \"Remedies\" which provides that Movement can seek injunctive relief for breach of that agreement. Dkt. 21-1 at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Plaintiffs appear potentially subject to a suit for injunctive relief.

Dkt. 22 at 7 (citing Dkt. 18-1 at 3; Dkt. 18-2 at 3; Dkt. 18-3 at 3). If Movement had not done so, it appears that the employees could have invoked the mutual duty to arbitrate the remaining claims on an individual basis once the injunctive relief claims were resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs' complaint prays for back wages, damages, prejudgment interest, and costs and fees, not injunctive relief. Dkt. 1, \u00a7 VIII. Plaintiffs do not provide examples of the type of injunctive relief an employee would seek such that the Court may evaluate, even in a hypothetical case, whether the opportunity to seek injunctive relief against multiple defendants is so one-sided that it is unconscionable. While there may be other factual scenarios in which unequal access to injunctive relief against multiple defendants would be clearly unconscionable, the Court finds that on the facts at bar, Plaintiffs have not met their burden as the party opposing arbitration to show that an exception in favor of Movement for injunctive relief is unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Romney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174128\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/186/728/#p735\">\n    186 Wash.App. at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=349%20P.3d%2032\">\n    349 P.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Third, both the Mordue Agreement and the Hoober Agreement feature confidentiality provisions which state \"[a]ll statements and information made or revealed during the arbitration process are confidential and neither you nor the company may reveal any such statements or information, except on a need-to-know basis or as permitted or required by law.\" Hoober Agreement \u00a7 10; Mordue Agreement \u00a7 10.
