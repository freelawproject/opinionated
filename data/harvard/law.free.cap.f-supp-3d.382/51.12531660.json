The Government moves to admit into evidence at trial telephone records that it alleges are associated with a phone number used by the Defendant's alleged co-conspirator, Ahmed Abu Khatallah, who was tried in this Court on virtually identical charges in\n   2017. The Government seeks admission of the records under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), the business-records exception to the prohibition on hearsay evidence. It also moves to admit certification from Mohamed Ben Ayad, the CEO of the cell-phone carrier Libyana Telecommunications, attesting to the authenticity of the records based on the factors set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203505\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Al-Imam opposes both requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government moved to admit these same phone records into evidence in advance of Abu Khatallah's trial. At that time, the Court held a hearing regarding the Government's acquisition of the records and Mr. Ayad's certification. Based on its factual findings, the Court concluded that the Government had met its burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the records were admissible. Here, Al-Imam renews objections to the introduction of the records made by Abu Khatallah and identifies perceived flaws in the Court's prior assessment. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the Government's motion. Both the telephone records and Ayad's \u00a7 3505 certification are admissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Based on this precedent and the full factual record illuminating the process by which the certification was obtained, the Court concluded that Ayad was a qualified person under the statute, even though there was no way for him to conduct a line-by-line comparison of the records to Libyana's database or personally attest to the records' accuracy or how they were gathered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Al-Imam spies a problem with this holding. He argues that the Court followed precedent regarding the first three elements of \u00a7 3505(a)(1) -that the records were kept in the regular course of business as part of the business's regular practice and were made at or near the time of the relevant event-and erroneously applied it to the fourth element: that the records, if not original, were a duplicate of the original. In other words, Al-Imam contends that, whatever qualifications Ayad had to certify Libyana's record-keeping practices, he had no way to know that these records were duplicates of actual Libyana records created by those practices. More specifically, because Ayad did not have first-hand knowledge of how the records were acquired or whether they were doctored in the interim, he could not attest that they were duplicates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 3505's requirement that a witness attest to a record being a duplicate was not designed to be as rigid a threshold as Al-Imam suggests. Congress enacted \u00a7 3505 as a \"simple, inexpensive substitute for the cumbersome and expensive procedures\" of live-witness testimony under Rule 803(6). H.R. Rep. 98-907, at 3 (1984):\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rep. 98-907, at 3 (1984). While nothing in the text of Rule 803(6) mirrors \u00a7 3505(a)(1)(D)'s requirement of certification that a document is an original or duplicate, the Rule does require a \"qualified witness\" to testify; this parallels \u00a7 3505's \"qualified person\" requirement. As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   , \"qualified witness\" is interpreted broadly.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272948\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/278/1/\">\n    278 F. Supp. 3d at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, for example, a witness is qualified to testify that a record was made at or near the time of an occurrence based on general familiarity with a business's record-keeping procedures, even if the witness knows nothing about the creation of the particular record itself.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, a person is qualified to offer such testimony\n   even if the records were created by another entity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Adefehinti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n    510 F.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no reason to conclude that a similarly permissive principle does not obtain when assessing a person's qualifications to attest that a record is a duplicate of the original.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ayad helped create the format of the Libyana database and was familiar with how it worked. Agent O'Donnell presented him with documents bearing several important indicia of Libyana phone records. And Ayad was able to pull records for the same phone number-albeit for a different time period. That intimate familiarity with the system, combined with indicia on the records themselves, led him to conclude that the records were indeed duplicates. Against the strong weight of authority that a person is \"qualified\" to attest to when a record was created based on general knowledge of a system and indicia on the documents themselves, the Court concludes that Ayad was qualified to certify that the records were duplicates of Libyana's original records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   True, a foundational witness under Rule 803(6) typically will have printed or copied the records from the business's files herself. But nothing in the Rule or in \u00a7 3505 requires such near-metaphysical certainty. The circumstances of this case are no doubt unusual, if not extraordinary. But, at bottom, the question for the Court is straightforward: has the Government shown, by preponderance of the evidence, that these records are reliable and authentic business records? In\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that, all told, the Government had met that burden, and Al-Imam provides no new reason to reverse course. As discussed, his argument that Ayad was not qualified to certify all of \u00a7 3505 requirements does not withstand scrutiny in light of the facts and the law governing business records. The Court therefore again concludes that the records are admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Certification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Government also seeks to introduce Ayad's certification.

In that case, the Court contrasted these affidavits with \"a certificate authenticating an official record-or a copy thereof,\" which are non-testimonial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n    at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ayad's attestations do not go to any fact to be proven at trial; rather, they merely lay a foundation for the introduction of the phone records themselves. It is the phone records, and not the certification, that will be introduced as substantive evidence against Al-Imam. Ayad's certification \"do[es] not contain any information about [the] defendant[ ], the relative merits of the charges against [the] defendant[ ], or any factual support for the charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Qualls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3608835\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/553/241/#p246\">\n    553 F. Supp. 2d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Al-Imam contends that these authorities are inapposite because their reasoning hinged on the routine nature of the certifications at issue whereas the circumstances of this case compel a different result. He analogizes Ayad's certification to a hypothetical discussed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Melendez-Diaz\n   </em>\n   in which a clerk attests to an unsuccessful search for a particular record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n    557 U.S. at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; this, he contends, is a more apt comparison than\n   <em>\n    Melendez-Diaz\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that the Confrontation Clause was not implicated by a clerk's attestation that a document is a copy of a court record. Not so. In offering the hypothetical regarding a failed search for a record, the Supreme Court explained that the clerk's statement would be substantive evidence against a defendant whose guilt depended on the nonexistence of the record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the certificate the Supreme Court discussed was testimonial inasmuch as it went to a fact to be proven at trial-an element of the offense. That characteristic is what likened it to the affidavits at issue in\n   <em>\n    Melendez-Diaz\n   </em>\n   : certifications of forensic analysis finding cocaine used in a drug case. By contrast, Ayad's certification does not \"provid[e] evidence against a defendant,\" and parallels a clerk's affidavit authenticating or providing a copy of an otherwise admissible record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n    at 322-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A clerk could by affidavit\n   <em>\n    authenticate\n   </em>\n   or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible record, but could not ...\n   <em>\n    create\n   </em>\n   a record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thus, Al-Imam is incorrect that Ayad's certification, like a clerk's attestation of a failed search, includes \"implicit[ ] assumptions and conclusions about the nature of the underlying record.\" Opp'n to MIL at 8. This is little more than a repurposing of his primary contentions that the certification is insufficient and the records are problematic. Any assumptions or conclusions go not to a fact to be proven at trial regarding Al-Imam's guilt, but to the authenticity of the records-a matter of their admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Likewise misplaced is Al-Imam's invocation of the D.C. Circuit's discussion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Adefehinti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n    510 F.3d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2007). At the outset, the Circuit embraced the logic underpinning the unanimous case law that certifications are admissible without implicating the Confrontation Clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n    at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so doing, the court explained that procedural safeguards\n   ensure that a party can challenge the trustworthiness of records introduced via certification. The Circuit continued that, \"[i]n an appropriate case the challenge could presumably take the form of calling a certificate's signatory to the stand.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Al-Imam suggests that this portion of\n   <em>\n    Adefehinti\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that if the certificates themselves lack indicia of trustworthiness, then the Sixth Amendment is implicated; he insists that this is such a case and he must have the opportunity to cross-examine Ayad because the \"the circumstances of Ayad's certification of the 'original or duplicate' requirement manifestly indicates a lack of trustworthiness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opp'n to MIL at 8. But\n   <em>\n    Adefehinti\n   </em>\n   discussed these procedural protections to highlight how the advance-notice requirement for certificate-based introduction of business records mirrors 803(6)'s exception for excluding business records that indicate lack of trustworthiness: by requiring advanced notice, the opposing party can contend that the records are untrustworthy, including by questioning the certificate's signatory.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n    510 F.3d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit's emphasis on procedural protections designed to allow a party to challenge introduction of the records is not tantamount to a suggestion that the Sixth Amendment\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   the Government to put the signatory on the stand. As discussed, the certification is not testimonial, and Al-Imam has not attempted to secure Ayad's presence to demonstrate purported untrustworthiness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638835,3567556\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/319/\">\n    at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Adefehinti does not argue that the court ever\n   <em>\n    thwarted\n   </em>\n   any effort to call any of the certifying custodians[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, the Supreme Court has clearly stated that the applicability of the Confrontation Clause does not turn on the reliability or trustworthiness of the testimony to be proffered.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bullcoming v.

Thus, Al-Imam cannot be correct that\n   <em>\n    Adefehinti\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that he has the right to confront Ayad because of perceived untrustworthiness in the certification. If that were the case, every defendant would have a Confrontation Clause right to cross-examine a certification's signatory, and any exceptions would swallow the rule. That cannot be squared with\n   <em>\n    Adefehinti\n   </em>\n   's embrace of the unanimous case law holding that certifications of business records do not implicate the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Al-Imam contends that Ayad's certification should be excluded pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 403, which allows the Court to \"exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, [or] misleading the jury,\" among other things. The rule \"tilts, as do the rules as a whole, toward the admission of evidence in close cases.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cassell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699755,9417715\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/788/\">\n    292 F.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Al-Imam explains that because \"Ayad is not qualified to discuss\" whether the records were manipulated\n   before or after they were provided to the Government, \"admitting his certification, which purports to answer that question ... would be unfairly prejudicial.\" Opp'n at 9. Al-Imam's contention is premised on the notion that it would be unfairly prejudicial for a jury to see a certification that the records are duplicates of Libyana records. Ayad's certification does not attest to the accuracy of the records or conclude that they were not manipulated; it merely lays a foundation for what they are and why they were admitted. Nothing unduly weighs in favor of a conclusion that they are accurate or that they were not manipulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

First, while the Sixth Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Baker\n    </em>\n    noted that a testifying postal inspector had \"compared photocopies of the documents presented at trial with actual Postal Office records to ensure that they were official records,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3387528\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/513/#p518\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3387528\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/513/#p518\">\n     at 519\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the opinion does not indicate that he compared the photocopies with the particular underlying records-as opposed to other records to examine indicia of authenticity.
