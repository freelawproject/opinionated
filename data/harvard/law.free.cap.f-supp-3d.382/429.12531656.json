Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, a manufacturer and seller of personal care products for women and men and the owner of the registered trademark VAGISIL, brings this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) seeking reversal of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board decision dismissing plaintiff's opposition to defendant's application to register the VAGISAN mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After completion of discovery, pretrial proceedings, and full briefing, the matter came before the Court on December 4, 2018 for a bench trial. There, the parties stipulated various undisputed facts and presented substantial testimonial and documentary evidence. Each party presented two witnesses. Testifying for plaintiff were a marketing and consumer survey expert, Mr. Hal Poret, and plaintiff's senior vice president and general manager of over-the-counter brands for North America, Ms. Stacey Feldman. In response, defendant presented its own marketing and consumer survey expert, Dr. Itamar Simonson, and defendant's head of international key account management, Ms. Angela May Thevessen. After the close of evidence and presentation of counsel's oral arguments on December 7, 2018, the matter was taken under advisement. Set forth here, pursuant to Rule 52, Fed. R. Civ. P., are the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Plaintiff, Combe Inc., is a Delaware corporation that manufactures and sells personal care products for women and men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Plaintiff has sold a variety of feminine personal care products for the vaginal area under the VAGISIL mark in the United States since 1973. Products sold by plaintiff under the VAGISIL mark have included medicated anti-itch creams and wipes, intimate washes, emergency contraceptives, moisturizers, deodorant powders, and screening kits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3. On October 17, 1978, plaintiff obtained its first trademark registration for the VAGISIL mark. That registration bears United States\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%201104172\">\n    Registration No. 1104172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and covers \"pharmaceutical preparations, namely, medicated creams\" in Class 5. Plaintiff also subsequently obtained registrations for the VAGISIL mark that cover powders, wipes, washes, moisturizers, and screening kits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   4. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") did not require evidence of acquired distinctiveness or \"secondary meaning\" for any of plaintiff's trademark applications for the VAGISIL mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   5. Since 1991, products sold using the VAGISIL mark in the United States have totaled over one billion dollars in sales revenue. In addition, since 1991 the VAGISIL brand has had between 55% and 60% market share in the feminine anti-itch cream segment and between 50% and 69% market share in the feminine powder segment. Since 2010, the VAGISIL brand has had at least 94% market share in the medicated wipes segment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   6. Marketing data from retailers that have sold VAGISIL-marked products during the past year reflect that in the broad intimate-health product category, VAGISIL-marked anti-itch cream ranks fifth in sales revenue and VAGISIL-marked wash ranks sixth. In the anti-itch cream segment of the intimate-health category, VAGISIL-marked anti-itch cream is ranked first in both units sold and sales revenue. In the anti-itch wipe segment, VAGISIL-marked wipes occupy the top two ranks in both units sold and sales revenue. In the intimate wash segment, VAGISIL-marked washes are ranked first and second in sales revenue and first and third in units sold. In the intimate powder segment, VAGISIL-marked powder ranks first in both units sold and sales revenue. In the moisturizing lubricant segment, VAGISIL-marked moisturizing lubricant ranks third in both units sold and sales revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   7. VAGISIL-marked products are sold nationwide in a wide assortment of dollar stores, drug stores, grocery stores, mass merchandising stores, pharmacies, and e-tailers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   8. On average, the prices of VAGISIL-marked products range between $ 3.00 and $ 7.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   9. Consumers of VAGISIL-marked products are women who fall into a wide variety of age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   10. Consumers exercise different levels of care in selecting and purchasing feminine personal care products for the vaginal area. Some consumers conduct research before buying such products, and certain companies, including plaintiff, use doctors to educate consumers about different vaginal conditions and products that treat those conditions. Other consumers purchase these products hastily because consumers are embarrassed by the products and the highly personal conditions they treat, and thus the consumers do not want to spend much time at the shelf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   11. Since 1993, plaintiff has spent over $ 350 million advertising and promoting VAGISIL-marked products to the general consuming public through numerous forms of media, including print, television, radio, and the Internet. This level of spending is similar to that of other major sellers of intimate-health products, including KY and Plan B, and exceeds the advertising spending by some of VAGISIL's key competitors, such as SUMMER'S EVE and REPLENS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   12. In addition, since 2008, plaintiff has spent over $ 75 million on other forms of marketing to promote VAGISIL-marked products, including events, public relations campaigns, coupons, samples, and displays in stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   13. Since the 1980's, plaintiff has advertised and promoted VAGISIL-marked products with over ninety different commercials that have aired on prominent television stations and cable networks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   14. Since the 1970's, plaintiff has advertised and promoted VAGISIL-marked products on over one hundred radio stations, including many prominent networks and satellite radio stations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   15. Since the late 1970's, plaintiff has advertised and promoted VAGISIL-marked products in a wide variety of printed publications, including consumer print books, women's health and beauty books, trade publications, and prominent, nationally circulated magazines and newspapers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   16. Plaintiff also digitally advertises and promotes VAGISIL-marked products on health and beauty websites, including Wed MD and Vogue.com, and social media websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Between June 2016 and May 2018, plaintiff's advertisements for VAGISIL-marked products on Facebook generated approximately 124 million impressions,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the advertisements appeared on Facebook users' computer screens approximately 124 million different times. Since April 2015, plaintiff's website Vagisil.com, which advertises and promotes VAGISIL-marked products, has been viewed over 7.2 million times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   17. The VAGISIL brand has been mentioned in several popular, nationally televised television programs, including\n   <em>\n    South Park, Saturday Night Live\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    The Big Bang Theory.\n   </em>\n   The VAGISIL brand was the subject of an entire skit on\n   <em>\n    Saturday Night Live.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   18. The VAGISIL brand has also been the subject of unsolicited media attention in articles in leading national publications, including\n   <em>\n    The New York Times\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    The Washington Post.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   19. Defendant, Dr. August Wolff GmbH &amp; Co. KG Arzneimittel, is a German limited liability partnership that manufactures and sells medicinal, cosmetic, and dermatological products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   20. In 1998, defendant began to sell in Germany a variety of feminine personal care products for the vaginal area under the VAGISAN brand. Defendant later expanded its sale of VAGISAN-branded products into other countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Defendant owns trademark registrations for the VAGISAN mark in Germany and more than a dozen other countries. Products sold by defendant under the VAGISAN brand include, among others, suppositories to restore vaginal pH and to regenerate vaginal flora, moisturizing cream, intimate wash lotion, protective ointment, and nutritional supplements. In Europe, parts of the Middle East, and Asia, defendant sells VAGISAN-branded products in pharmacies, health and beauty stores, drugstores, and online shops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   21. Defendant is not currently selling, and has never in the past sold, VAGISAN-branded products in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   22. On January 24, 2012, defendant filed Application Serial No. 79111922 with the PTO to register the mark VAGISAN for \"pharmaceutical preparations, namely, vaginal moisturizers, vaginal anti-fungal preparations, vaginal washes; sanitary preparations for medical use; diet pills, diet capsules, diet liquid medications\" in Class 5 and \"soaps, perfumery, essential oils, cosmetics, hair lotions\" in Class 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   23. Defendant's registration application displays the VAGISAN mark in standard characters and does not include any stylization, colors, company/house name, packaging, or any other elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   24. On March 7, 2013, plaintiff filed Opposition No. 91209708 before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\"the TTAB\") against defendant's application for the VAGISAN mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   25. On June 19, 2017, the TTAB issued a final decision dismissing plaintiff's opposition\n   against defendant's application for the VAGISAN mark on the ground that plaintiff had failed to prove (i) that defendant's use of the VAGISAN mark in United States commerce would create a likelihood of confusion with plaintiff's VAGISIL mark or (ii) that defendant lacked a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   intent to use the VAGISAN mark in United States commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   26. On August 21, 2017, plaintiff filed this action appealing the TTAB's decision to this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and asserting additional counts of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and dilution under the Lanham Act; trademark infringement under the Virginia Trademark and Service Mark Act \u00a7 59.1-92.12,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and trademark infringement and unfair competition under Virginia common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   27. On January 2, 2018, defendant moved to dismiss all counts of plaintiff's Complaint, except for the count appealing the TTAB's decision, on the ground that defendant currently does not use the VAGISAN mark in United States commerce and has no imminent plans to do so. By Memorandum Opinion and Order issued March 28, 2018, defendant's motion to dismiss was granted, and all counts of the Complaint were dismissed except for plaintiff's appeal of the TTAB decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Combe Inc. v. Dr. August Wolff GmbH &amp; Co. KG Arzneimittel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525109\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/414/\">\n    309 F. Supp. 3d 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   28. After all Counts of plaintiff's Complaint other than the TTAB appeal had been dismissed, plaintiff retained Mr. Hal Poret to conduct two consumer surveys to test: (i) whether the VAGISIL mark is famous (\"the Fame Survey\") and (ii) whether there is a likelihood of confusion between the VAGISIL and VAGISAN marks (\"the Confusion Survey\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   29. Mr. Poret is a professional consumer survey researcher and consultant who has designed, conducted, and analyzed over one thousand consumer surveys, hundreds of which involved trademarks. Mr. Poret's surveys and expert opinions have been admitted as evidence by numerous federal courts, including the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   30. The Fame Survey questioned three hundred United States consumers, both women and men, age eighteen and older, and tested both aided and unaided awareness of the VAGISIL mark in connection with vaginal care products. Unaided awareness is a measure of the number of consumers who express knowledge of a brand name without being shown the brand name. Aided awareness is a measure of the number of consumers who express recognition of a brand name after being shown the brand name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   31. In the unaided portion of the survey, respondents were asked to list all brands of vaginal care products that they had ever seen or heard of. In total, 38.7% of all respondents named VAGISIL in this unaided portion of the survey. VAGISIL was named more frequently than any other brand, with SUMMER'S EVE being named the second greatest number of times by 26% of all respondents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   32. Next, in the aided portion, respondents were shown a total of eight brand names, one at a time and in random order, and were asked whether or not they had ever seen or heard of the name in connection with any vaginal care product. The brand names shown to respondents in this portion included VAGISIL; other well-known brands MONISTAT and SUMMER'S EVE; lesser-known brands REPLENS, LUVENA, SWEET SPOT, and VAGI-GARD; and a fictitious brand VAGIZOX, which served as the control. In total, VAGISIL was recognized by more respondents than any other brand name shown in the survey, with 90% of all respondents recognizing VAGISIL. Only 5.3% of respondents stated they had seen or heard of the control, VAGIZOX, in connection with any vaginal care product. Accordingly, the Fame Survey reported a net awareness rate of 85% for VAGISIL; that is, it reflected that 85% of respondents recognized VAGISIL specifically because of the mark's fame and not because of other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   33. The Confusion Survey questioned four hundred female consumers of vaginal moisturizers, vaginal washes, or vaginal anti-fungal products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   34. The Confusion Survey utilized the well-established\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   format for likelihood of confusion surveys. Specifically, the survey first presented the VAGISAN mark to the two hundred respondents who were in the test group and then asked those respondents a series of standard\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   questions to measure various forms of confusion between VAGISAN and other brand names.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Confusion Survey never mentioned or showed the VAGISIL mark to respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   35. The Confusion Survey showed the test group respondents the VAGISAN mark as the mark appears on defendant's application to register the mark: in a plain, block letter format, without any trade dress, stylization, special font, colors, company name, packaging, or any other distinctive elements and with the description \"vaginal moisturizers, vaginal washes and vaginal anti-fungal products.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   36. The Confusion Survey was also administered to two hundred respondents in a control group, who were shown the fictitious name VAGIPUR instead of VAGISAN. VAGIPUR was shown to the control group respondents in a plain, block letter format, without any trade dress, stylization, special font, colors, company name, packaging, or any other distinctive elements and with the description \"vaginal moisturizers, vaginal washes and vaginal anti-fungal products.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   37. When presented with the VAGISAN mark, 37% of the respondents in the test group named VAGISIL in response to the confusion questions. In the control group, 18% of the respondents named VAGISIL after they were shown the VAGIPUR mark and were asked the confusion questions. Accordingly, the Confusion Survey reported a net confusion rate of 19% between VAGISAN and VAGISIL; that is, it reflected that 19% of respondents\n   confused VAGISAN with VAGISIL specifically because of the marks' similarity and not because of other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   38. Defendant did not present any survey evidence to rebut plaintiff's survey measurements of the VAGISIL mark's fame or the rate of confusion between the VAGISAN and VAGISIL marks. Instead, defendant introduced Dr. Itamar Simonson's criticisms of the Fame and Confusion Surveys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   39. Dr. Simonson is a professor of marketing and consumer decision-making and has an expertise in the field of researching consumer behavior, including consumer survey methodology. Dr. Simonson has also conducted many consumer surveys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   40. Dr. Simonson submitted an expert report and gave testimony at trial in which Dr. Simonson opined that the two surveys submitted by plaintiff were unreliable because the surveys were flawed in certain key respects. In particular, Dr. Simonson opined that the Fame Survey used an improper control and that the Confusion Survey failed to replicate market conditions and used an improper control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   41. Defendant submitted evidence reflecting that certain marks that are similar to VAGISIL are used by third parties in connection with goods sold in United States commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following table includes the names of these third-party marks, as well as the evidence of sales revenues and advertising expenditures that correspond to each of the marks.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-53\"><strong>Mark</strong> <strong>Sales Revenues</strong> <strong>Advertising</strong> <strong>Nature of Products</strong> <strong>Expenditures</strong> 1.

Further, defendant's counsel purchased the VAGICARE product from a Canadian website using Canadian dollars and could not identify any United States websites or stores that carry the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   42. In addition, during the underlying proceeding before the TTAB, defendant's counsel purchased one product sold under each of the following marks: VAGICREAM,\n   VAGI-CARE, and VAGI-SILK. There is no evidence that these products continue to be sold in the United States, that these products have ever been sold to anyone in the United States other than defendant's counsel, or that these products have been advertised to consumers in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   43. Plaintiff purchased the marks VAGISTAT, VAGISTAT-1, VAGISTAT-3 in May 2017 and has begun to sell VAGISTAT products in packaging labeled \"VAGISTAT by VAGISIL Brand.\" Those marks were previously used by a different company in connection with the sale of a product to treat yeast infections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   44. Several prominent mass merchandising and drug stores, with nationwide locations, sell a generic vaginal anti-itch cream that is labeled \"Vagicaine\" and is also marked by the store's private-label brand (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , EQUATE, UP &amp; UP, RITE AID, and CVS). These stores have sold millions of dollars in \"Vagicaine\" products since 2009. Specifically, Rite-Aid has sold $ 2,545,090 of RITE-AID-branded \"Vagicaine\" products since 2009; CVS has sold $ 1,380,979 of CVS-branded \"Vagicaine\" products since 2016; Target has sold [sales figure submitted under seal] of UP &amp; UP-branded \"Vagicaine\" products since 2013; and Walmart has sold $ 8,622,304 of EQUATE-branded products since 2014.

Consequently, for purposes of determining the registrability of an applied-for mark in a \u00a7 1071(b) action, \"[a]ny limitations on usage must appear in the application,\" and \"evidence of the mark's actual, narrower use in the marketplace is irrelevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Seacret Spa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20880367\">\n    2016 WL 880367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Seacret Spa\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning is persuasive, and thus guides the analysis here, because if the district court determines that the applied-for mark is registrable, the markholder receives rights and protections in the mark that cover all possible presentations and usages of the mark, restricted only by the limitations in the application itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, \"[i]f the registrant ... obtains a standard character mark without claim to any particular font, style, size or color, the registrant is entitled to depictions of the standard character mark regardless of font style, size, or color.\"\n   <em>\n    Citigroup Inc. v.

Instead, the district court, like the TTAB, must base its likelihood of confusion analysis on the description of the applied-for mark and any limitations on usage that are included in the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Seeking to avoid this conclusion, defendant argues that the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Swatch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083785\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/150/#p155\">\n    739 F.3d at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , rejected this approach by holding that a district court in a \u00a7 1071(b) action should consider actual marketplace use. This argument fails because\n   <em>\n    Swatch\n   </em>\n   involved not only an appeal of the TTAB's registrability determination pursuant to \u00a7 1071(b), but also a trademark infringement claim, which renders\n   <em>\n    Swatch\n   </em>\n   distinguishable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swatch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083785\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/150/#p155\">\n    739 F.3d at 159-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In a trademark infringement claim, the focus of the likelihood of confusion inquiry is whether \"the defendant's\n   <em>\n    actual practice\n   </em>\n   is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.\"\n   <em>\n    CareFirst of Maryland, Inc. v.

In sharp contrast, the issue at the heart of a registrability determination is whether a mark, as delimited in the application, is registrable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Octocom Sys., Inc. v.

In short, when a case involves only an appeal of the TTAB's registrability determination pursuant to \u00a7 1071(b) and not also an infringement claim, it makes little sense to consider actual use of the mark, for the reasons already stated. The Fourth Circuit's consideration of such actual use evidence in a \u00a7 1071(b) action in\n   <em>\n    Swatch\n   </em>\n   is therefore distinguishable and is not controlling here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To recapitulate, analysis whether VAGISAN is likely to cause confusion with VAGISIL, and is thus ineligible for registration, proceeds by applying each of the nine likelihood of confusion factors to the parties' marks.

The Fourth Circuit has made clear that even a suggestive mark's conceptual strength is diminished if many third parties in the same field as the mark holder have used a portion of the text of the senior mark in their own marks.\n   <em>\n    CareFirst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931919\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/263/#p267\">\n    434 F.3d at 269-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the conceptual strength of the suggestive mark \"CareFirst\" was weakened by \"substantial third-party use of the words 'Care,' 'CareFirst,' 'First,' and 'First Care' in the health care industry\"); 2 MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION \u00a7 11:90 (5th ed. 2019) (\"Third party registrations are relevant to prove that some segment of the composite marks which both contesting parties use has a normally understood and well-recognized descriptive or suggestive meaning, leading to the conclusion that that segment is relatively weak.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In the instant case, defendant has submitted evidence of approximately sixty-six third-party marks containing \"vagi-\" as a prefix, including sixteen marks used in commerce, eleven live registrations and applications, and thirty-nine applications and registrations that are cancelled, expired, or otherwise \"dead.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Findings of Fact \u00b6\u00b6 41-16. This evidence reflects that a significant number of third parties have at one time or another used a mark that is similar to VAGISIL, many of which were used in connection with vaginal care products. Indeed, the number of similar third-party marks introduced by defendant in this case is comparable to the amount that other courts have deemed sufficient to weaken the distinctiveness of a mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petro Stopping Centers, L.P. v.

Thus, this evidence of similar third-party marks serves to weaken the conceptual strength of VAGISIL because if the \"mark were truly a distinctive term, it is unlikely that so many other businesses in the ... industry would independently think of using the same mark or similar variants of it.\"\n   <em>\n    CareFirst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931919\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/263/#p267\">\n    434 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In response, plaintiff advances two arguments aimed at showing that this evidence of third-party marks is entitled to little weight. First, plaintiff argues that these third-party marks are not sufficiently similar to VAGISIL to weaken VAGISIL's conceptual strength because none of them contain a \"vagi-\" prefix, then an \"s\", then a vowel, and then a consonant. This argument fails because plaintiff has pointed to no authority for the proposition that third-party marks must share such a close degree of similarity to be relevant. To the contrary, courts have concluded that extensive third-party use of a component of the plaintiff's mark, such as the prefix, undermines the conceptual strength of the plaintiff's mark as a whole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Second, plaintiff argues that the evidence of similar third-party marks submitted by defendant is insufficient to weaken the strength of VAGISIL because most of these third-party marks are commercially\n   insignificant. This argument fails in the conceptual strength context\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it is well-established that, even without evidence of commercial impact, the widespread use of similar marks by third parties is \"powerful on its face\" to weaken the inherent distinctiveness of the plaintiff's mark.\n   <em>\n    Juice Generation, Inc. v.

Cir. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is so because similar third-party marks \"are useful to demonstrate the sense in which a term is used in ordinary parlance and they can show that a particular term has been adopted by those engaged in a certain field or industry and that said term has less than arbitrary significance with respect to certain goods or services.\"\n   <em>\n    Spraying Sys.

In short, the evidence of third-party marks in this case is significant, despite the commercial insignificance of many of the marks, because it diminishes the \"linguistic or graphical 'peculiarity' \" of plaintiff's VAGISIL mark, which it the focus of the conceptual strength inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In sum, although VAGISIL is a suggestive mark, the prevalent use of similar \"vagi-\" prefix marks by third parties weakens the conceptual strength of VAGISIL.

The Fourth Circuit has explained that evaluation of the commercial strength of a mark should take into account the same factors used in the conceptually similar \"secondary meaning\" test, namely \"(1) advertising expenditures; (2) consumer studies linking the mark to a source; (3) sales success; (4) unsolicited media coverage of the product; (5) attempts to plagiarize the mark; and (6) the length and exclusivity of the mark's use.\"\n   <em>\n    Grayson O\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276739\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/307/#p314\">\n    856 F.3d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Perini Corp. v.

The results of the Fame Survey provide substantial empirical data to reinforce the conclusion that the VAGISIL brand is well-recognized by consumers. In the unaided portion of the Fame Survey, three hundred United States consumers, both men and women, were asked to list all brands of vaginal care products that they had ever seen or heard of. VAGISIL was named by a total of 38.7% of the survey respondents, which was a far greater level of unaided awareness than any other brand that was mentioned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the aided portion of the Fame Survey, the survey respondents were shown eight brand names, one at a time and in random order, and were asked whether they had ever seen or heard of the name in connection with any vaginal care product. The eight names included VAGISIL, along with an assortment of well-known vaginal care product names, lesser known but commonly available product names, relatively unknown product names, and a fictional product name, VAGIZOX, which served as the control. VAGISIL was recognized by 90% of all respondents, which was a far higher rate of recognition than any of the other seven brand names received. Only 5.3% of respondents stated they had seen or heard of the control, VAGIZOX, in connection with any vaginal care product. Accordingly, the Fame Survey reported a net awareness rate of 85% for VAGISIL;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   it reflected that 85% of respondents recognized VAGISIL specifically because of the mark's fame and not because of other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The results of the Fame Survey are substantial and certainly support a finding that the VAGISIL mark is commercially famous. Indeed, the 38.7% level of unaided awareness and the 85% rate of net aided recognition that VAGISIL received in the survey far surpass the degree of recognition from similar surveys that courts have found sufficient to demonstrate the commercial strength of a mark.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v.

Therefore, the results of the Fame Survey are persuasive, empirical evidence of the VAGISIL mark's commercial strength and, along with the powerful sales and marketing data examined above, clearly demonstrate that VAGISIL is a famous mark that enjoys substantial commercial strength.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Seeking to diminish the force of this evidence, defendant argues (i) that the existence of similarly named third-party marks weaken the commercial strength of VAGISL and (ii) that plaintiff's Fame Survey suffers from certain defects that call into question the level of consumer awareness of VAGISIL reported by the survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   These arguments are dispensed with in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   First, defendant argues that the use of marks containing a \"vagi-\" prefix by third parties demonstrate that plaintiff's VAGISIL mark is commercially weak. This argument fails because it is well-established that the existence of similar third-party marks alone is insufficient to demonstrate that a mark is commercially weak; the impact of third-party marks on the commercial strength of the senior mark depends wholly on the extent to which they are used and promoted by third-parties and are recognized by consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reason for this principle is simple. Evidence that other sellers in the same industry as the plaintiff extensively use marks that are similar to the plaintiff's mark shows that \"consumers may not 'associate [the plaintiff's] mark with a unique source,' \" and that plaintiff's mark is thus commercially weak.\n   <em>\n    Variety Stores\n   </em>\n   , 888 F.3d at 664 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Grayson O\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276739\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/307/#p314\">\n    856 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   315 ).

In sum, the evidence reflects that none of these third-party marks are used in commerce in connection with products that are extensively sold, advertised, or otherwise recognized by consumers and that some of these marks were used in connection with products that are not sufficiently similar to VAGISIL-branded products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the evidence of third-party use submitted by defendant is entitled to minimal weight and certainly does not diminish the strong evidence of VAGISIL's commercial strength.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CAE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499316\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/660/#p685\">\n    267 F.3d at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    Scarves by Vera\n   </em>\n   , 544 F.2d at 1173-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In addition to these commercially insignificant marks, defendant also introduced evidence that several prominent mass merchandising and drug stores have generated substantial sales in connection with a generic vaginal anti-itch cream that is sold in packaging labeled \"Vagicaine.\" Notwithstanding the significant sales of these \"Vagicaine\" products, this evidence is entitled to little weight because the packaging of each of these generic \"Vagicaine\" products prominently features the store's private-label\n   brand (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , EQUATE, UP &amp; UP, RITE AID, and CVS). Courts have sensibly concluded in trade dress infringement cases that consumers focus on these well-known, store-specific signatures to identify the store as the source of the generic, private-label products and to distinguish these generic products from the name brand products they are designed to imitate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeil Nutritionals, LLC v.

Supp. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (D.N.J. 1989). Applied here, this principle points persuasively to the conclusion that consumers do not think of \"Vagicaine\" as a source-identifying brand; rather, consumers recognize the \"Vagicaine\" label only as a signal that the generic product seeks to imitate VAGISIL's anti-itch cream.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the presence of the \"Vagicaine\" label on the packaging of generic, private-label vaginal anti-itch cream products does not materially diminish VAGISIL's strength as a source-identifier because consumers recognize the store-specific signatures, and not the \"Vagicaine\" label, as the source-identifying element of the \"Vagicaine\" products' trade dress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendant's second set of arguments aimed at attacking the evidence of VAGISIL's commercial strength include two criticisms of the methodology utilized by Mr. Poret's Fame Survey. First, defendant argues that the aided portion of the Fame Survey used a poor control, which caused the survey to report an inflated net rate of consumer recognition of VAGISIL. In particular, according to defendant's expert, Dr. Simonson, the \"VAGIZOX\" control does not sound like a plausible name for a vaginal care product because \"-zox\" is an uncommon suffix for health, beauty, or feminine care products. Thus, Dr. Simonson explained, the VAGIZOX control would not adequately measure or capture spurious awareness-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the tendency of respondents to answer that they are aware of a brand name even if they have not have heard of it-because respondents would be able to tell VAGIZOX is a fake brand name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This criticism is unpersuasive. The VAGIZOX control included a \"vagi-\" prefix, like other marks registered in connection with vaginal care products. And plaintiff adduced evidence at trial that other marks including \"-zox\" and \"-ox\" have been registered and used in connection with pharmaceutical products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the end, defendant presented no empirical evidence to support its argument that consumers find the \"-zox\" suffix strange or to demonstrate that a different control would have detected a higher level of spurious awareness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed,\n   Mr. Poret testified that the 5.3% awareness rate recorded in connection with the VAGIZOX control is consistent with his experience of measuring spurious awareness in brand recognition surveys. Thus, it appears that there is no basis to conclude that VAGIZOX was an implausible brand name or that it was an ineffective control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, defendant argues that the aided portion of the Fame Survey should have used more than one control to detect and measure spurious, mistaken awareness. According to Dr. Simonson, every potential brand name has certain idiosyncrasies that prevent it from serving as a proper control. Thus, it would have been preferable for the Fame Survey to have included additional fictitious control names so that the recognition rates of each of these controls could have been averaged together to produce a more reliable estimate of the spurious, mistaken awareness that occurred in the survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Although Dr. Simonson's recommendation appears to be conceptually sensible, it does little to undermine the reliability of the Fame Survey. Indeed, defendant presented no empirical evidence, such as a survey implementing Dr. Simonson's views, to demonstrate that using multiple controls would have measured a materially higher rate of spurious awareness. Furthermore, as Mr. Poret testified at trial, the inclusion of existing but relatively unknown brand names in the aided portion of the Fame Survey served a control-like function and showed that the VAGIZOX control was not materially underestimating the rate of spurious awareness present in the survey. In particular, the fact that the survey reported meager recognition rates of between 5% and 18% for SWEETSPOT, LUVENA, and VAGI-GARD demonstrated that the survey was not reporting inflated, artificially high recognition rates for unknown marks. Thus, the 85% net recognition rate of VAGISIL cannot be explained by spurious awareness, and there is no ground on which to conclude that the inclusion of additional control terms in the Fame Survey would have materially altered this result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In any event, the force of defendant's two criticisms of the aided portion of the Fame Survey is significantly blunted by the convincing results of the survey's unaided portion, which defendant has not attempted to attack. Clearly, the fact that 38.7% of survey respondents named VAGISIL as a brand name they knew without any type of prompting goes a long way to dispel the concern that the aided portion's report of an 85% net awareness rate of VAGISIL is unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In summary, the above evidence of VAGISIL's sales, marketing, unsolicited media attention, and brand recognition by consumers persuasively demonstrates that VAGISIL is a famous mark that has attained substantial commercial strength in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Importantly, the parties dispute whether conceptual strength or commercial strength carries more weight in the overall determination of a senior mark's strength.

Thus, because both marks are registered as standard character marks, which do not limit the marks to any particular appearance or stylization in commerce, the manner in which the VAGISIL and VAGISAN marks are currently displayed to consumers in the marketplace does not influence the similarity factor in this registrability determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Compared as a whole, the marks VAGISIL and VAGISAN are closely similar in sight and sound.

Both VAGISIL and VAGISAN connote the vaginal area.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   part 1.A. One of defendant's executives, Ms. Thevessen, testified at trial that the \"-san\" suffix of VAGISAN also refers to the Latin term for \"health.\" But she admitted that she did not know whether consumers would also perceive VAGISAN to connote \"health\" because defendant has not conducted any consumer studies on the issue. In any event, it is doubtful whether the additional intended connotation of VAGISAN,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   health, would be recognized by consumers given the average consumer's lack of Latin fluency and in light of what is clearly the dominant connotation of both marks: the vaginal area of a woman's body. Thus, the marks share a highly similar meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Accordingly, the close similarities in sight, sound, and meaning between the marks point persuasively to the conclusion that VAGISAN is sufficiently similar to VAGISIL to confuse consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendant attempts to counter this conclusion by arguing that the \"vagi-\" prefix that is common to both VAGISIL and VAGISAN is weak, and thus consumers will distinguish the terms based on minor differences in the non-common components of the marks. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the \"vagi-\" prefix is descriptive and thus conceptually weak, this argument fails for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   First, this argument conflicts with the \"anti-dissection\" rule that the Fourth Circuit has adopted with respect to analyzing the similarity of marks.

To the contrary, the evidence makes clear that VAGISIL is the only \"vagi-\" prefix mark that is currently used in United States commerce in connection with the sale of vaginal care products of which most consumers are aware. Thus, because consumers are not faced with multiple \"vagi-\" prefix marks in the marketplace, there is no basis here on which to conclude that consumers are conditioned to distinguish between VAGISIL and VAGISAN based on minor differences in the non-common portions of the marks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Third, the other cases cited by defendant that concluded there was no likelihood of confusion between marks containing the same so-called \"descriptive prefix\" are inapposite here because the marks at issue in those cases contained non-common components that were sufficient to make the marks as a whole dissimilar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, for the reasons already stated, when compared as a whole, VAGISAN is confusingly similar to VAGISIL.

Mr. Poret administered the Confusion Survey to four hundred female consumers of vaginal moisturizers, vaginal washes, or vaginal anti-fungal products. The Confusion Survey utilized the well-established\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   methodology\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   and first displayed the VAGISAN mark to the respondents who were in the test group and then asked those respondents a series of standard questions to measure various forms of confusion between VAGISAN and other brand names.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   After each of these\n   questions, the survey gave the respondents the opportunity to explain why they selected their answer. The Confusion Survey never mentioned or showed the VAGISIL mark to the survey respondents. Importantly, the test group respondents were shown the VAGISAN mark as the mark appears on defendant's application to register the mark,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   in a plain, block letter format, without any trade dress, stylization, special font, colors, company name, packaging, or any other distinctive elements. After being presented with the VAGISAN mark, 37% of the respondents in the test group named VAGISIL in response to the confusion questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Confusion Survey was also administered to respondents in a control group, who were shown the fictitious name VAGIPUR instead of VAGISAN. VAGIPUR was shown to the control group respondents in a plain, block letter format, without any trade dress, stylization, special font, colors, company name, packaging, or any other distinctive elements. In the control group, 18% of the respondents named VAGISIL after they were shown the VAGIPUR mark and were asked the confusion questions. Accordingly, the Confusion Survey reported a net confusion rate of 19% between VAGISAN and VAGISIL;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it reflected that 19% of respondents experienced confusion that was caused specifically by the marks' similarity and not by other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Confusion Survey provides persuasive empirical evidence of actual confusion between the parties' marks. First, the\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   survey format used by the Confusion Survey has been widely accepted by courts and commentators as a reliable approach for surveying consumer confusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reliability of the\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   format used in the Confusion Survey stems, in part, from the fact that the survey displays only the allegedly infringing mark and at no point shows or mentions the senior mark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   This feature is particularly important where, as here, the plaintiff's senior mark is strong and widely-recognized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valador\n   </em>\n   , 242 F.

First, defendant argues that the Confusion Survey is entitled to little weight because the survey did not replicate the marketplace conditions under which consumers are most likely to encounter the VAGISAN mark. In particular, defendant's expert, Dr. Simonson, testified that in order to obtain an accurate measurement of consumer confusion, the survey needed to display the VAGISAN mark (i) with the packaging used by defendant in other countries and (ii) side-by-side with the VAGISIL mark, as the products might appear if they were sold on the same shelf of a store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   This criticism is unpersuasive because it ignores the principle, already discussed extensively, that \"the relevant inquiry in a registration proceeding involves the mark and usage described in the application rather than as they appear in the marketplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Seacret Spa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20880367\">\n    2016 WL 880367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (holding that the probative value of an expert's testimony was \"severely limited\" because the testimony was based on a study of the use of the \"SEACRET\" mark in the marketplace rather than the uses described in the application). To be sure, it is true that in the context of a trademark infringement claim, a likelihood of confusion survey must replicate market conditions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Water Pik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073657\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/1136/#p1155\">\n    726 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1146-47 ;\n   <em>\n    Valador\n   </em>\n   , 242 F. Supp. 3d at 462. But this is so \"for the simple reason that trademark infringement occurs if 'the defendant's\n   <em>\n    actual practice\n   </em>\n   is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Valador\n   </em>\n   , 242 F.

In contrast, in the instant \u00a7 1071(b) action, the only issue is whether the mark for which defendant applied is registrable, not whether any particular use of defendant's mark constitutes infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, as the TTAB has repeatedly and correctly concluded, the only scientifically sound format for a survey designed to test the likelihood confusion in a registrability proceeding is to display the applicant's mark as it appears in the registration application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OMS Invs., Inc. v.

The parties agree that an effective control serves the essential function of estimating the rate of survey responses appearing to reflect confusion that are in fact explained by survey \"noise,\"\n   <em>\n    i. e.\n   </em>\n   some factor other than genuine confusion. Of particular importance in this case, which involved the well-known mark VAGISIL, the control needed to measure the survey's \"demand effect,\" which relates to the number of survey respondents who would guess VAGISIL in response to the survey stimulus because they believe it is the expected answer. The parties also agree that to be effective, the selected control needed to be as similar to the test stimulus, VAGISAN, as possible but could not share the characteristic whose influence is being tested. Dr. Simonson, defendant's expert, opined at trial that the control used by Mr. Poret, VAGIPUR, violated these principles and was thus an improper control because it was not sufficiently similar to VAGISAN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   This criticism is entitled to little, if any, weight. Although it is conceivable that a different, more similar control could have been selected, the control used by Mr. Poret was adequate to measure survey \"noise.\" In this case, plaintiff's hypothesis was that VAGISAN is confusingly similar to VAGISIL because both marks (i) begin with \"vagis-\", (ii) followed by a vowel (iii) and then a consonant. Thus, an effective control needed to be similar to VAGISAN without meeting those three criteria. VAGIPUR satisfied this requirement. Like VAGISAN, it began with \"vagi\" and thus also connoted the vaginal area of a woman's body. And as Mr. Poret noted, using a control beginning with \"vagi\" would capture the tendency of VAGISAN's \"vagi-\" prefix or the topic of vaginal care products to cause people to name VAGISIL. In addition, VAGIPUR held constant the length of VAGISAN and also included a consonant, then a vowel, and then a consonant after \"vagi.\" Thus, the VAGIPUR control maintained a proper degree of similarity to the test stimulus without overlapping with the three criteria constituting the hypothesis tested by the survey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The results of the Confusion Survey further support the conclusion that the survey used an effective control. Mr. Poret testified that based on his substantial experience conducting\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   studies, the 18% \"noise\" level captured by VAGIPUR was certainly robust. Furthermore, because defendant did not conduct its own survey using a different control, there is no empirical basis on which to conclude whether or to what degree a different control would have captured a materially higher level of survey noise. Accordingly, the evidence at trial convincingly establishes that the Confusion\n   Survey used an adequate, even if imperfect, control and that the 19% net rate of confusion reliably reported the confusion caused by the similarity of VAGISAN to VAGISIL and not by other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Defendant's third criticism is that plaintiff's expert, Mr. Poret, improperly tabulated certain survey respondents as confused when calculating the gross and net rates of confusion reported by the Confusion Survey. In this respect, defendant argues that a survey respondent in the test group who answered VAGISIL in response to the three\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   questions designed to test confusion should not have been counted as confused if the respondent's answer to the follow-up \"why?\" question reflects that the respondent answered VAGISIL for reasons other than the similarity of VAGISAN. This argument fails because, as both parties' experts (Mr. Poret and Dr. Simonson) testified, an effective control already serves the function of estimating the number of respondents that will name VAGISIL for reasons other than the similarity between VAGISAN and VAGISIL. Thus, sifting through the respondent's open-ended responses, in addition to using a control, would improperly double-count survey \"noise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Moreover, as Mr. Poret persuasively explained at trial, the methodology advocated by defendant is scientifically inferior to using an effective control. Survey respondents are lay people who do not always know the actual reason that VAGISIL came to their mind when they saw the survey stimulus, and they often give explanations that are difficult to interpret objectively. Measuring the rate of confusion among survey respondents in the manner proposed by defendant is thus unreliable and calls for subjective judgment by the survey-administrator as to whether the respondents were truly confused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   As already discussed, the Confusion Survey used an effective control term to account for survey \"noise.\" Accordingly, because all four hundred respondents were asked identical questions after the test group was shown VAGISAN and the control group was shown VAGIPUR, the difference between the two groups' rate of naming VAGISIL must be caused by the similarity of VAGISAN to VAGISIL and not by other reasons.

On the one hand, the evidence reflects that some consumers are embarrassed about vaginal dryness and other conditions treated by the parties' products. These consumers do not want to talk about the conditions treated by the parties' products, not even with physicians, and do not want to be seen buying the products that treat those conditions. As a result, such consumers often purchase the parties' products-which are sold over the counter for as little as $ 3.00-hastily without spending much time at the shelf to examine the products carefully. On the other hand, the evidence also shows that some consumers spend time prior to purchase carefully researching the parties' products and the conditions that those products are designed to treat. For example, plaintiff and other companies provide resources that educate women in a confidential setting about vaginal dryness and how the parties' products help to treat this condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Viewed in its entirety, this evidence reflects that consumers of the parties' products vary widely in their sophistication about the parties' products and the degree of care with which consumers purchase such products, as is characteristic of the market for most ordinary retail goods.

But this packaging is not reliable evidence of actual marketplace use in the United States because one of defendant's executives, Ms. Thevessen, testified that defendant has not yet determined what stylized format, wording, design elements, colors, or other distinctive trade dress defendant will use to display the VAGISAN mark on packaging in United States commerce.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Water Pik, Inc. v.

In contrast, the commercial strength of the plaintiff's mark is not diminished by third-party marks that are not extensively used, sold, and advertised in the marketplace. This apparent incongruity is entirely sensible given the entirely distinct issues that are at the heart of the conceptual strength and commercial strength inquiries.

But the evidence also reflects that in May 2017 plaintiff purchased these VAGISTAT marks and has begun to sell VAGISTAT products in packaging labeled \"VAGISTAT by VAGISIL Brand.\" As a consequence, the VAGISTAT marks are no longer third-party marks, and the packaging in which VAGISTAT products are now sold actually reinforce the strength of the VAGISIL brand. Moreover, even before plaintiff bought them, the VAGISTAT marks were used in connection with yeast-infection products, with which plaintiff's products did not compete. Thus, evidence concerning the use of the VAGISTAT brands is irrelevant to the analysis of VAGISIL's commercial strength.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    The conclusion that the third-party marks relied upon by defendant are commercially insignificant finds further support in the Fame Survey conducted by Mr. Poret. In the unaided portion of the survey, less than 1% of respondents named any third-party \"vagi-\" prefix mark as a brand that they had seen or heard of. One respondent out of three hundred, or 0.3% of all respondents, named Vagicare, and one respondent out of three hundred, or 0.3% of all respondents, named Vaginex. This empirical evidence reinforces the conclusion that the third-party marks submitted by defendant are commercially insignificant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    To illustrate this point, in the unaided portion of the Fame Survey, 1.7% of the respondents named EQUATE, Walmart's private-label store brand for generic products, as a brand they had seen or heard of in connection with the sale of vaginal care products.
