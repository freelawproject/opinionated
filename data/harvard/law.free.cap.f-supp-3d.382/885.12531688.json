Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Dkt. 6.) For the reasons addressed below, Defendant's motion is granted and the complaint is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff LeDuc Gifts &amp; Specialty Products, LLC (LeDuc), is a Minnesota limited liability corporation. Until 2018, LeDuc's primary business model was designing, manufacturing, and selling thermal tumblers. Defendant New Thermo-Serv, Ltd. (NTS), is a Texas limited partnership that also sells thermal tumblers. NTS's principal place of business and general partner are located in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, one of LeDuc's related entities, 4Brava, LLC (4Brava), entered a partnership with DSC Products Holding, LLC (DSC). The partnership created and sold thermal tumblers for mass-market retailers. The relationship between LeDuc and DSC deteriorated in 2015 when Daniel Sachs, the owner of DSC, allegedly embezzled funds from the partnership and misappropriated LeDuc's trade secrets. LeDuc contends that Sachs unlawfully duplicated and made minor improvements to LeDuc's molds and manufacturing equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   LeDuc and 4Brava commenced lawsuits against Sachs and DSC in June 2015 (the \"Sachs litigation\"). As the Sachs litigation proceeded in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Sachs offered to sell thermal tumbler molds and equipment to NTS. NTS purchased the molds and equipment from Sachs in the fall of 2016. A draft asset purchase agreement (APA) acknowledges the ongoing Sachs litigation. But the final APA does not refer to the litigation. NTS used the molds and equipment purchased from Sachs to sell thermal tumblers, ultimately competing with LeDuc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After learning of the 2016 sale between Sachs and NTS, LeDuc and 4Brava sent cease and desist letters to NTS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   NTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   continued to use the molds and equipment and to sell the competing tumblers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   LeDuc initiated this lawsuit on October 4, 2018, alleging claims against NTS for misappropriation of trade secrets, unjust enrichment, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, and tortious interference with contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   NTS moves to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. In opposition to the motion, LeDuc delineates six contacts with Minnesota which, LeDuc argues, justify the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over NTS. These proffered contacts are (1) NTS's negotiations of the APA with Sachs; (2) NTS's communications with Aroplax, the company storing the molds and equipment; (3) NTS's communications with LeDuc about the molds it purchased from Sachs; (4) Sachs's performance of the APA, including shipping the molds and equipment from Minnesota; (5) NTS's sale of thermal tumblers to Minnesota customers; and (6) NTS's alleged interference with LeDuc's business, which caused harm to LeDuc in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), a \"plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction exists,\"\n   <em>\n    K-V Pharm. Co. v. J.

Because Minnesota's long-arm statute, Minnesota Statutes Section 543.19, extends jurisdiction to the maximum limit permitted by due process, a federal court in Minnesota need only determine whether its exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process.\n   <em>\n    Wessels, Arnold &amp; Henderson v.

The third factor, the relation of the contacts to the cause of action, can be satisfied by either general or specific jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Burlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650295\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/1100/#p1102\">\n    97 F.3d at 1102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specific personal jurisdiction, the type of personal jurisdiction asserted here, \"is jurisdiction over causes of actions arising from or related to the defendant's actions in the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Wessels, Arnold &amp; Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414597\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/1427/#p1431\">\n    65 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1432 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Primary Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When analyzing personal jurisdiction, courts give significant weight to the nature and quality of the asserted contacts, the quantity of contacts, and the relation of the contacts to the cause of action. Each ground for personal jurisdiction that LeDuc advances is analyzed here in light of these primary factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Negotiation and Performance of the APA and Related Communications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   LeDuc contends that NTS's activity related to the APA establishes personal jurisdiction. First, LeDuc alleges that by negotiating the APA, NTS became aware of the ongoing litigation between DSC and LeDuc in Minnesota. Second, LeDuc alleges that NTS communicated with Aroplax and LeDuc, which are Minnesota companies. Third, the APA was performed in Minnesota because, LeDuc asserts, NTS purchased products that were shipped from a Minnesota storage location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When the assertion of specific personal jurisdiction is based on a contract, courts consider the \"terms of the contract and its contemplated future consequences,\" including whether the contract is for the development or sale of any products in the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Fastpath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148796\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/816/#p821\">\n    760 F.3d at 821-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A contract may form the basis of specific personal jurisdiction when it expressly contemplates multiple events in the forum state, including, for example, submission of purchase orders and payment to the forum state, delivery of the product to the forum state, and customer pick-up in the forum state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells Dairy, Inc. v. Food Movers Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682030\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/515/#p519\">\n    607 F.3d 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519-20 (8th Cir. 2010). In contrast, a contract that is negotiated outside the forum state and requires payments and delivery of the product to a non-forum state is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dairy Farmers of Am. v. Bassett &amp; Walker Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645827\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/472/#p478\">\n    702 F.3d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478-79 (8th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The circumstances surrounding a contract are generally insufficient, without more, to support a court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. For example, \"scattered emails, phone calls, and a wire-transfer of money\" are not sufficient contacts for personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Viasystems, Inc. v. EBM-Papst St. Georgen GmbH &amp; Co., KG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415001\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/589/#p594\">\n    646 F.3d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (8th Cir. 2011). Similarly, the storage location of materials that are the subject of the contract is not a dispositive\n   factor in the analysis of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viracon, Inc. v. J &amp; L Curtain Wall LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044295\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/929/878/#p884\">\n    929 F. Supp. 2d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884-85 (D. Minn. 2013) (explaining that when the plaintiff chooses the storage location, not the defendant, the chosen location does not amount to the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   purposefully availing itself of the privileges of the forum state).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   NTS's conduct relating to the contract, the APA, includes negotiation of the APA, conversations related to the APA, and performance of the APA. But this conduct is not of sufficient quality or quantity to establish minimum contacts with Minnesota. LeDuc does not allege that the APA was negotiated in Minnesota or that NTS made any payments to Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells Dairy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682030\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/515/#p519\">\n    607 F.3d at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, the final version of the APA omits all references to Minnesota.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the isolated conversations that NTS had with Aroplax and LeDuc are the type of scattered communications that the Eighth Circuit has rejected as a basis for specific personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viasystems\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415001\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/589/#p594\">\n    646 F.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the storage location of the equipment is of little significance to this analysis, particularly because there is no allegation that NTS chose the storage location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viracon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044295\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/929/878/#p884\">\n    929 F.

Sales to Minnesota Customers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   LeDuc next asserts that NTS's sales to Minnesota customers support this Court's exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over NTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A defendant's single, direct sale to the forum state may be sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pope v.

But a defendant's mere knowledge that a sale\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   occur in the forum state is not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.

That LeDuc experienced competitive harm in Minnesota does not establish that NTS targeted Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706350\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/785/#p794\">\n    614 F.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without more, the competitive harm that LeDuc experienced in Minnesota does not confer personal jurisdiction over NTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Cumulative Contacts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   None of LeDuc's proffered contacts is sufficient to confer specific personal jurisdiction over NTS. Nor are the contacts sufficient when considered together. Isolated conversations, nationwide sales, and a contract with, at best, tenuous Minnesota connections do not establish NTS's purposeful availment of the privileges of conducting business in Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fastpath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148796\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/816/#p821\">\n    760 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the contacts relate to LeDuc's asserted causes of action and, accordingly, satisfy the third\n   <em>\n    Land-O-Nod\n   </em>\n   factor, the remaining primary factors-the quality and quantity of contacts-disfavor this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over NTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Secondary Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to the preceding personal jurisdiction analysis, a court may consider the interest of the forum state in providing a forum for its residents and the convenience of the parties.\n   <em>\n    Land-O-Nod Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1123484\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/708/1338/#p1340\">\n    708 F.2d at 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But these factors are of secondary importance.\n   <em>\n    Burlington Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650295\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/1100/#p1102\">\n    97 F.3d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And when, as here, minimum contacts are not present, these secondary factors cannot overcome that deficiency.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p476\">\n    471 U.S. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 476-77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p476\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p476\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Digi-Tel Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9043377\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/519/#p522\">\n    89 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, neither secondary factor weighs strongly in favor of this Court's assertion of personal jurisdiction, if at all. The lack of any significant connection between the APA and Minnesota undermines LeDuc's argument that Minnesota has a strong interest in resolving this dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viracon, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044295\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/929/878/#p884\">\n    929 F. Supp. 2d at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing\n   that Minnesota's interest in providing a forum for its residents is minimal when the dispute has no real connection to the state). And, presumably, there are multiple witnesses for whom Minnesota is not a convenient forum, given that the APA is between non-Minnesotan entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For these reasons, LeDuc has not met its prima facie burden of establishing this Court's personal jurisdiction over NTS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis and all the files, records and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   1.

Nor did LeDuc supplement its briefing following the oral argument, despite LeDuc's representation to the Court that it would do so.
