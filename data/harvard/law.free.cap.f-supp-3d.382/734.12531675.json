By means of a License Agreement executed in 1997 (\"License\"), Vanderbilt University (\"Vanderbilt\") and Defendant Scholastic, Inc. (\"Scholastic\") joined forces to develop, market, and distribute an educational literacy program called Read 180 based on the cutting-edge work of Vanderbilt Professor Ted S. Hasselbring. Pursuant to the License, Scholastic used certain copyrightable software and related instructional materials, along with other materials it both obtained and created, to develop the \"Read 180\" program. It was wildly successful. Scholastic distributed Read 180 and paid Vanderbilt royalties under the License until 2015, when Scholastic sold that part of its business and assigned the License to Defendant Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company (\"HMH\"). However, Defendants' public exuberance about their success with Read 180 in connection with this sale led Vanderbilt to became suspicious that it was being exploited by Defendants. Vanderbilt conducted an investigation and now claims that it was deceived by the Defendants and has not been properly compensated for (1) components of Read 180 that are royalty-bearing under the License; (2) programs other than Read 180 that may be royalty-bearing because they are based on Vanderbilt-owned materials (\"Derivative Products\"); and (3) additional learning products that may have been surreptitiously developed by Hasselbring and Scholastic in violation of the License and Hasselbring's duties to Vanderbilt (\"Ancillary Products\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Vanderbilt brings claims for trademark infringement in violation of \u00a7 32(1) of the United States Trademark Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ; unfair competition, in violation of \u00a7 43(a) of the United States Trademark Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; as well as numerous Tennessee state law claims. Before the Court are (1) Scholastic and HMH's Motion to Dismiss the Second Through Fourth and Seventh Through Eleventh Counts of the Complaint (Doc. No. 87); and (2) Hasselbring's Motion to Dismiss Counts Nine and Ten of the Complaint (Doc. No. 89).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vanderbilt has filed responses in opposition (Doc. Nos. 96; 97), and Defendants have filed replies (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nos. 100; 101.) For the following reasons, both motions will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Allegations\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Vanderbilt, Faculty Research, and Professor Hasselbring\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vanderbilt is a private, non-profit Tennessee university known in part for bringing research innovations into the world marketplace. (Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7.) Tenure-track faculty are expected and encouraged to research, write, and create, and these activities fall within the scope and purpose of their employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) Vanderbilt contends that the technology and other creative works that its faculty create in their areas of study and research are \"works for hire\" under Tennessee law and federal copyright law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, as part of their employment, Vanderbilt faculty are subject to a written policy (\"Technology Policy\"), that provides, among other things, that almost all innovations in technology as defined by Vanderbilt (\"Vanderbilt Technology\") created by faculty members are assigned to and owned by Vanderbilt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) Under the Technology Policy in effect until 2016, \"[a]ll rights in non-scholarly Literary and Artistic Works created with the use of University funds or facilities, or that capitalize on an affiliation with the University, are granted to the University, and income distribution shall be handled in the same manner as technology. Commercial use of the University's name and marks requires prior University approval.\" (Doc. No. 85-2 at 10.) A superseding Technology Policy further explains that \"Vanderbilt Technology\" is broader than patentable intellectual property, and \"includes tangible or intangible inventions, in the patent sense, whether or not reduced to practice, and research results whether or not patentable or copyrightable. These research results include, for example, computer programs, integrated circuit designs, industrial designs, databases, technical drawings, biogenic materials, and other technical creations.\" (Doc. No. 85-1 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Vanderbilt relies upon its Center for Technology, Transfer and Commercialization (\"CTTC\") to protect and commercialize, as appropriate, the intellectual property\n   developed at the University. (Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6 10.) The CTTC is responsible for negotiating, on behalf of Vanderbilt, license agreements with commercial entities that are positioned to develop and commercialize the intellectual property advancements that Vanderbilt's faculty and staff create in the course and scope of their intellectual pursuits at the University. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Faculty members receive a significant share - between 40 and 50 percent - of royalties received by Vanderbilt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) The remainder is invested in the university. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To facilitate this process and safeguard Vanderbilt's rights, faculty are subject to Vanderbilt's Conflict of Interest Policy (\"COI Policy\"). (Doc. No. 85-4.) Under the COI Policy, Vanderbilt faculty are required, prior to undertaking consulting or any other activity or commitment that may create a potential conflict of interest, to disclose the activity or commitment in writing to the appropriate dean (and department chair), in sufficient detail and with appropriate documentation such that the dean and the department chair can determine whether a potential conflict exists. (Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 51.) In addition, faculty members are required to file annual reports disclosing consulting and other outside business relationships that they engage in during the year, including the number of days devoted to the activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hasselbring, a Tennessee resident, is currently an Emeritus Professor of Special Education in the Department of Special Education at Vanderbilt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.) The Letter Agreement (\"Hasselbring Employment Agreement\") between Hasselbring and Vanderbilt dated December 27, 2005 concerning his employment specifies that the above \"[p]olicies set forth in the Faculty Manual constitute part of the contractual relationship between [Hasselbring] and the University.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19; Doc. No. 85-3.) Accordingly, Vanderbilt alleges that at all times during his employment, Hasselbring was subject to Vanderbilt's Faculty Manual, COI Policy, and Technology Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Hasselbring's Development of Read 180 and Vanderbilt's License to Scholastic\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hasselbring's area of research and study at Vanderbilt was, among other things, the use of technology to enhance learning for students with disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) Beginning in 1985, Hasselbring and members of the Learning and Technology Center at Vanderbilt developed software that used student performance data to individualize and differentiate the path of computerized reading instruction in order to identify and help elementary and middle school students reading below grade level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) According to the Complaint, this software, which became the prototype for Read 180, was owned by Vanderbilt pursuant to the Technology Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between 1994 and 1998, Hasselbring and his Vanderbilt team tested their work in Orange County, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.) The Orange County Literacy Project successfully used the Read 180 prototype with more than 10,000 struggling students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Vanderbilt alleges that, at that time, the Read 180 intellectual property consisted of (1) a software-based multimedia instructional program designed to provide daily computer-based compensatory instruction for middle school aged students (the \"Software\"); (2) an interactive multimedia CD-ROM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   containing instruction materials in middle school literacy consisting of software, a library of terms and sentences, video, text, and graphics, all of which were designed to be used in conjunction with the software (the \"Literacy Unit\"); and (3) certain confidential key academic concepts and techniques that formed the pedagogical basis for the Literacy Unit (all collectively, the \"Read 180 Materials\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.) Because the Read 180 Materials were created within the course and scope of Hasselbring and his Vanderbilt team's employment, Vanderbilt considered all of the components to be works for hire assigned to Vanderbilt pursuant to the Technology Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Scholastic is a for-profit New York corporation that describes itself as the world's largest publisher and distributor of children's books and a leading provider of children's print and digital instruction materials sold throughout the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) The positive results with Read 180 in Orange County, Florida, led Scholastic to partner with Vanderbilt to license the software and launch Read 180 as a commercial product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.) Accordingly, Vanderbilt and Scholastic entered into the License effective January 1, 1997. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Vanderbilt granted Scholastic an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to the Read 180 Materials for the purpose of producing and marketing a literacy program (the \"Read 180 Literacy Program\") throughout the world that would embody the Read 180 Materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.) In exchange, Scholastic was to pay Vanderbilt escalating royalties on net sales as defined in the License. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) According to the Complaint, Vanderbilt and Scholastic recognized that Scholastic's development of the Read 180 Materials to a marketable state would likely result in the future creation of Derivative Products that were unknown and unforeseen at the time of contracting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) So that Vanderbilt could receive royalties on the Derivative Products, the parties agreed to the following language in Paragraph 6.2 of the License:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties recognize and agree that future improvements may result in products different in form, content, or medium from the [Read 180] Materials delivered to Scholastic under this Agreement. It is the express intent of the parties that regardless of the form of future improvements or derivative works, Vanderbilt shall receive royalties pursuant to Section 9 [of the License] on all software products based on or derived from the [Read 180] Materials, pro rata, pursuant to the future mutual agreement of the parties as to the amount of the Materials incorporated into such products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through the License, Scholastic launched the Read 180 Literacy Program in 1999, and it became the foundation of Scholastic's highly-successful Education Technology and Services business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) There have been several versions, updates, and new iterations of Read 180 produced since 1999, and, according to the Complaint, Read 180 continues to be the largest selling digital curriculum in the marketplace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Complaint alleges that, according to internal marketing materials, a number of other products have been based on or derived\n   from Read 180, including, but not limited to, System 44, FASTT Math, MATH 180, iRead, Expert 21, and Scholastic U. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Vanderbilt claims that these are Derivative Products or, if not, then Ancillary Products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the Complaint, Scholastic and HMH have repeatedly marketed these Derivative and Ancillary Products in a way that leaves \"little doubt\" that they \"are derived from and related to Read 180 [or that] Hasselbring authored them while in Vanderbilt's employ. Vanderbilt alleges that Scholastic and HMH's marketing extensively promotes Hasselbring and emphasizes his Vanderbilt connection in an effort to falsely imply to consumers that Vanderbilt is either a source of, affiliated with, or sponsors these products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) In addition, Vanderbilt alleges that Hasselbring has consistently held himself out as the author of the Derivative or Ancillary Products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.) In any event, Vanderbilt alleges that Hasselbring, Scholastic, and HMH knowingly failed to disclose Hasselbring's authorship of the Derivative or Ancillary Products to Vanderbilt and did not pay appropriate royalties to Vanderbilt based on the use of Vanderbilt Technology and intellectual property therein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Sale to HMH and Vanderbilt's Audit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   HMH is a for-profit Massachusetts corporation engaged in the business of publishing, marketing and selling pre-kindergarten through grade 12 educational content and related services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.) On May 15, 2015, Vanderbilt received a letter from Scholastic announcing the sale of Scholastic's Education Technology and Services business to HMH and requesting Vanderbilt's consent to the assignment of the License to HMH. (Doc. No. 85-5.) Vanderbilt consented to the assignment on May 27, 2015, under which HMH would assume all rights and obligations under the License. (Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6 34.) According to the Complaint, in connection with the sale, Scholastic and HMH made certain public representations about total sales and value of Read 180 products that were extremely surprising to Vanderbilt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) Specifically, press reports indicated that sales of the Read 180 Literacy Program exceeded one billion dollars, far greater than the sales figures for which Vanderbilt had been paid royalties under the License. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2016, after reviewing publicly-available financial information concerning the sale of Scholastic to HMH and the value of Read 180, Vanderbilt exercised its right under Paragraph 9.4 of the License to have the books and records of Scholastic/HMH audited with respect to performance under the License, and it retained the accounting firm RSM US LLP (\"RSM\") for this task. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In June 2016, RSM produced an initial audit report that covered the period of June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) RSM first estimated that Vanderbilt had been underpaid by at least $ 5.5 million for this five-year period for products that Scholastic and HMH had already agreed were royalty-bearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Second, RSM estimated that as much as $ 25 million in royalties could be owed on the Derivative and Ancillary Products - specifically, on sales of products derived from the Vanderbilt's licensed materials, including, but not limited to, System 44, FASTT Math, MATH 180, iRead, Expert 21, and Scholastic U. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39.) RSM also reached several additional conclusions: (1) Scholastic and HMH failed to pay Vanderbilt for any royalties generated by Canadian sales of Read 180; (2) Scholastic and HMH failed to pay royalties for the complete Read 180 Literacy Program as required by the License because they impermissibly carved out sales of certain\n   Read 180 components that they dubbed to the \"non-software\" components\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   while advertising the full Read 180 family of products, including the non-software components, as a single literacy program; and (3) Scholastic and HMH made improper deductions from Vanderbilt's royalty payments for supposed shipping and handling costs associated with Read 180 products. Vanderbilt therefore concluded that Scholastic/HMH owed it in excess of $ 30,000,000 under the License for all of these categories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Vanderbilt's Review of Hasselbring's Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Given RSM's audit findings, Vanderbilt (1) reviewed Hasselbring's conduct regarding his relationship with Scholastic and HMH, the License, the Read 180 Literacy Program, and the Derivative/Ancillary Products, and (2) evaluated Hasselbring's compliance with Vanderbilt's Technology Policy, COI Policy, and fiduciary obligations to the University. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.) According to the Complaint, Vanderbilt discovered that Hasselbring had negotiated and entered into a number of undisclosed agreements with Scholastic or HMH for the sharing or creation of intellectual property and Vanderbilt Technology, most of which, if not all, Vanderbilt claims that it owns pursuant to the Technology Policy (collectively the \"Undisclosed Hasselbring/Scholastic/HMH Agreements\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-50.) In addition, Vanderbilt alleges that it discovered that, in 2012, 2013, and 2014, Hasselbring incorrectly answered \"no\" when asked on his Vanderbilt COI Disclosure if he had a relationship with a business that had a contractual relationship with Vanderbilt or that paid royalties to him directly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) Vanderbilt claims Hasselbring knew those representations were false and that Vanderbilt would rely upon them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Vanderbilt, Hasselbring also answered \"no\" when asked if he was involved in an activity or relationship directly or indirectly involving Vanderbilt that created a conflict of interest/commitment or the appearance of a conflict of interest/commitment under Vanderbilt's COI Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.) Once again, Vanderbilt claims Hasselbring knew that representation was false and that Vanderbilt would rely upon it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Vanderbilt alleges that these attempts by Defendants to circumvent Vanderbilt's policies, obtain title to Vanderbilt Technology, and avoid paying a royalty to Vanderbilt, were on-going and continued even after HMH purchased Scholastic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition, the Complaint alleges that the Undisclosed Hasselbring/Scholastic/HMH Agreements (1) contained warranties representing that Hasselbring had the right to convey the Vanderbilt Technology he was supplying; (2) contained non-compete language preventing Hasselbring from otherwise monetizing the Vanderbilt Technology by creating similar products; (3) were styled as \"consulting agreements\" in order to hide the fact that Hasselbring was authoring technology that belonged to Vanderbilt under its Technology Policy or because the Technology was related to or derived from Read 180 Materials, and despite that Scholastic, HMH, and Hasselbring all knew that Hasselbring was not permitted under Vanderbilt's employment policies to directly convey intellectual property in exchange for a royalty; and (4) directed millions of dollars in on-going royalty payments to Hasselbring without providing any payment to Vanderbilt for the use of the Vanderbilt Technology or other intellectual property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56.) Vanderbilt claims Hasselbring continues to improperly earn millions of\n   dollars in royalties directly from the other Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Trademarks\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Complaint also alleges that Scholastic and HMH improperly used Vanderbilt's intellectual property, registered name, logo, and associated goodwill in the design, development, marketing, and promotion of the products discussed above, for the purpose of falsely implying to consumers that Vanderbilt was a source of or sponsor of the products or was in some way affiliated with the products.

A professor like Hasselbring is, of course, identified with his or her university employer in some ways, and the research that a professor conducts over the course of his or her career will always inform things that he or she may do outside that forum. The Court must therefore consider whether Vanderbilt has sufficiently alleged that Scholastic and HMH have used Vanderbilt's trademarks in connection with the Derivative or Ancillary Products in such a manner that goes beyond mere identification - that is, so that consumers might think that the Derivative or Ancillary Products are affiliated with or were made by Vanderbilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Complaint lists a family of trademarks that Vanderbilt has registered \"for numerous classes of goods and services.\" (Doc.

Advertising for the FASTT Math program states that \"FASTT Math is the result of over two decades of research conducted by Dr. Ted Hasselbring, Co-Director of the Learning Technology Center at Vanderbilt University. This research on using technology to provide instruction and intervention is the basis of the FASTT algorithm.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61(B)(b).) Until December 2017, this statement was also accompanied by a version of the Vanderbilt \"V\" logo as illustrated below:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61(B)(c).)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   e.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61(C)(b).)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Vanderbilt alleges that, for a significant period of time, Scholastic and HMH marketed Derivative or Ancillary Products by means of these and other advertisements and promotional materials. That is an alleged business use in an effort to sell products that Scholastic and HMH, not Vanderbilt, created. The Complaint further alleges that Scholastic and HMH not only used Vanderbilt trademarks, but did so in a manner that suggested the substantial involvement of Vanderbilt. This is most evident in the marketing of the FASTT Math program. (Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6 61(B)(b).) Scholastic and HMH promoted that \"FASTT Math\n   <em>\n    is the result of over two decades of research conducted by Dr. Ted Hasselbring, Co-Director of the Learning Technology Center at Vanderbilt University.

Vanderbilt is entitled to the favorable inference that the purpose of the logo was to reinforce the idea that Vanderbilt was affiliated with, directly contributed to, or created the FASTT Math program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court finds that, on a robust reading of the Complaint and drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, Vanderbilt has stated a Lanham Act trademark infringement claim. Direct references to twenty years of Vanderbilt research as the basis for specific Derivative or Ancillary Products, taken together with Hasselbring's well-known position at Vanderbilt and his Vanderbilt team, constitute plausible allegations that Defendants created a likelihood of confusion in the mind of consumers regarding whether Vanderbilt approved or produced the Derivative or Ancillary products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's conclusion\n   is bolstered because Vanderbilt further alleges that Scholastic and HMH have \"traded on Vanderbilt's extensive goodwill and reputation in an attempt to misrepresent to consumers that Vanderbilt sponsors or endorses Defendants' products, which is not true and is likely to cause confusion in the marketplace.\" (Doc.

However, no matter what degree of intellectual property and creative content Vanderbilt alleges Defendants misappropriated and used to create the Derivative or Ancillary Products, Vanderbilt has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   alleged, as required, either that Defendants were (1) selling actual repackaged Vanderbilt products or (2) passing their products off as actually physically produced by Vanderbilt.

Rather, Scholastic and HMH produced and sold the Derivative or Ancillary Products and are thus the alleged \"origin\" of the Derivative or Ancillary Products, regardless of whether they incorporated Vanderbilt's copyrightable intellectual property.

First, Vanderbilt's contention that\n   <em>\n    Dastar\n   </em>\n   is simply \"unpersuasive\" is wholly without merit in light of\n   <em>\n    Kehoe\n   </em>\n   in this Circuit and\n   <em>\n    Brainard\n   </em>\n   in this District (which go undiscussed in Vanderbilt's brief).

Judge Trauger aptly rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Brainard\n   </em>\n   , concluding that \"[i]t does not follow\" that\n   <em>\n    Dastar\n   </em>\n   intended that \"origin of goods\" should mean one thing when addressing protected intellectual property and mean something quite different when addressing works in the public domain.\n   <em>\n    Brainard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027197\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/561/922/#p934\">\n    561 F.Supp.2d at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Quite to the contrary,\" Judge Trauger concluded, \"the Court in\n   <em>\n    Dastar\n   </em>\n   set out to answer whether 'origin of goods' could be applied to the origin of creative content in all settings, and [it] found that it could not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027197\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/561/922/#p934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Dastar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p29\">\n    539 U.S. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p29\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]s used in the Lanham Act, the phrase 'origin of goods' is in our view incapable of connoting the person or entity that originated the ideas or communications that 'goods' embody or contain.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Vanderbilt essentially contends that this claim should be allowed to proceed as a false association claim and not just a false origins claim.

Accordingly, for Vanderbilt to have an ownership interest in the Derivative or Ancillary Products, it must establish that Defendants intended for those to have been joint works. Scholastic and HMH argue that Vanderbilt's declaratory judgment claim should be dismissed because Vanderbilt fails to allege this intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Complaint contains allegations that Scholastic and HMH knew of the obligations imposed by Hasselbring's employment relationship with Vanderbilt, and therefore knew that Vanderbilt would have an ownership interest in any Derivative or Ancillary Products that used Vanderbilt Technology or intellectual property created or conveyed by Hasselbring. To the extent Scholastic and HMH knowingly used Vanderbilt Technology and intellectual property in the Derivative or Ancillary Products, they intended a result in which Vanderbilt would be a co-owner, nevertheless they took steps to avoid compensating Vanderbilt by means of subterfuge. As just one specific example, Vanderbilt alleges that \"the Undisclosed Hasselbring Scholastic/HMH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Agreements were styled as 'consulting agreements' in order to hide the fact that Hasselbring was authoring technology\n   <em>\n    that belonged to Vanderbilt under its Technology Policy and/or because the Technology was related to or derived from Read 180 Materials.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6 56 (emphasis added).) Scholastic, HMH, and Hasselbring\n   <em>\n    all knew\n   </em>\n   , according to Vanderbilt, that Hasselbring was not permitted under Vanderbilt's employment policies to directly convey intellectual property in exchange for a royalty. However, Scholastic and HMH disguised their agreements to give Hasselbring \"cover\" for circumventing Vanderbilt and to hide \"the true nature of the transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522891\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/500/#p505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These allegations can be reasonably understood to mean that Defendants knew Vanderbilt would own a part of the Derivative or Ancillary Products, and they continued nonetheless. Vanderbilt is entitled to the favorable inference that Scholastic and HMH were intentionally creating a jointly-owned product and seeking to conceal it from Vanderbilt. At the very least, at this stage, Scholastic and HMH are not entitled to any greater competing inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Given that the claim is legally viable, the Court considers the\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factors. Here, the third and fourth factors have no particular relevance, but the first, second, and fifth factors favor continuing to exercise jurisdiction over Vanderbilt's declaratory judgment claim. There is an ongoing controversy between Vanderbilt and Defendants concerning alleged violations of Vanderbilt's rights, a significant part of which involves the use of Vanderbilt Technology and intellectual property in the Derivative or Ancillary Products. This cause of action will therefore help settle the controversy. It is almost always the case that if a declaratory judgment will help settle the controversy, then it will help clarify the legal relations in issue.\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/#p557\">\n    513 F.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 557 (6th Cir. 2008). Here, Vanderbilt's claim is fundamentally as much about its relationship with Defendants as it is about its attempt to recover from them. Accordingly, the second factor weighs in favor of retaining this claim. Finally, the court sees no alternative remedy that presents a notably more attractive option. In fact, resolving the issue of co-ownership separately from the remaining claims in this case makes little sense. The fifth factor therefore speaks against dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has \"never indicated how the\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factors should be balanced.\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/#p557\">\n    513 F.3d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.) On June 9, 2016, RSM produced an initial report that \"detailed findings for the audit period of June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) In this report, \"RSM estimated that Vanderbilt had been underpaid by at least $ 5.5 million for this five-year period only and estimated that as much as $ 25 million in royalties could be due on the Derivative and Ancillary Products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) More specifically, the RSM report detailed conclusions that Scholastic and HMH had (1) failed to pay full royalties under the License for products that had been previously agreed to be royalty-bearing; (2) failed to pay royalties for Derivative or Ancillary Products; (3) failed to pay royalties on any Canadian sales of Read 180; (4) improperly \"carved-out\" sales of certain Read 180 components to reduce royalty payments; and (5) made improper deductions from royalties for supposed shipping and handling costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-42.) RSM identified \"additional information\" that it would need to \"fully analyze and calculate the total amounts due\" to Vanderbilt to remedy these \"underpaid\n   royalties, unpaid royalties, and improper deductions/carve-outs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Based on these clear allegations, the Court finds that Vanderbilt \"discovered\" the unlawful acts or practices it alleges under the TCPA no later than the delivery of RSM's audit report on June 9, 2016. The RSM audit report reasonably put Vanderbilt on notice that it needed to protect its rights under the TCPA in a timely fashion. Vanderbilt argues that the statute of limitations was not triggered on June 9, 2016 because \"its investigation was ongoing\" and \"was not complete\" because it had \"no definitive information\" and RSM needed additional information to calculate the amounts due. (Doc. No. 96 at 18-19.) It is bold indeed to feature the RSM report so prominently in the Complaint and then dismiss it here as apparently having so little import. More importantly, Vanderbilt misunderstands the law. It is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the \"date of the ascertainable loss\" that begins that running of the statute of limitations under the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    Town of Smyrna, Tenn. v. Mun.

So for the purposes of this inquiry, it is largely irrelevant how much more time or information Vanderbilt needed to determine the\n   <em>\n    extent\n   </em>\n   of its alleged injury at the hands of Scholastic and HMH. It is clear that Vanderbilt had \"discovered\" the\n   <em>\n    existence\n   </em>\n   of the potential TCPA injury by June 9, 2016. Vanderbilt therefore had until June 9, 2017 to timely file a claim under the TCPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-18-110\">\n    Tenn.

(Doc. Nos. 96 at 19; 56-1.) Although not clearly worded, this is essentially an argument for application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, which tolls the running of the statute of limitations where the defendant has \"misled the plaintiff into failing to file [his] action within the statutory period of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Norton v.

Vanderbilt contends that the parties entered into the Tolling Agreement, dated July 28, 2017, that provides \"any\" limitations period that might apply to any claim is tolled. (Doc. No. 96 at 19 (citing Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6 59).) However, by its unambiguous language, the Tolling Agreement tolled only the \"time remaining\" on statute of limitations periods for claims that \"could be asserted,\" and \"[n]othing in th[e] Tolling Agreement\n   <em>\n    revive[d] a claim that was time barred ...\"\n   </em>\n   (Doc.

In other words, Vanderbilt alleges that Scholastic and HMH provided false information concerning products and sales\n   <em>\n    in breach of Section 9.2 of the License.\n   </em>\n   This is a breach of contract claim,\n   not a tort claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becker v.

(Doc. No. 85 at \u00b6 129.) This claim is supported by allegations detailing how the three Defendants executed deceptive \"consulting agreements\" designed to hide the true nature of their actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 130-141.)

These required Hasselbring, prior to undertaking consulting or any other activity or commitment that may create a potential conflict of interest, to disclose the activity or commitment in writing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hasselbring allegedly did not disclose his consulting agreements with defendants Scholastic and HMH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) For the reasons discussed above, this alone does not push these claims over the line to plausibility. However, the COI Policy also required Hasselbring to file annual reports disclosing consulting and other commitments he had engaged in during the past year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) The Complaint alleges that Hasselbring made \"affirmative misstatements\" regarding his relationship with Scholastic and HMH. Specifically, Hasselbring allegedly marked \"no\" on his 2012, 2013, and 2014 conflict of interest disclosure forms in response to questions concerning (1) whether he had a relationship with a business that had a contractual relationship with Vanderbilt or that paid royalties to him directly and (2) whether he was involved in an activity or relationship directly or indirectly involving Vanderbilt that created a conflict of interest or the appearance of such under the COI Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51-53.) These alleged specific false representations, for which Vanderbilt has provided a sufficient \"who, what, where, when and how,\" form the basis of well-pled fraud claims against Hasselbring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Hasselbring contends that Vanderbilt has not alleged any damages resulting from reliance on these alleged misstatements. Hasselbring's argument - premised on two cases from New York and Illinois - is that the allegations \"amount to a mere complaint that Vanderbilt couldn't sue earlier,\" which does not give rise to a fraud action. As a fallback position, Hasselbring argues that Vanderbilt's damages are too speculative in any event. The Court does not agree. Vanderbilt has alleged that it relied upon Hasselbring's representations that he was not engaged in royalty-earning activity with Vanderbilt-contracted entities. Vanderbilt has further alleged that it was damaged by Hasselbring's misrepresentations because it was unable to, upon learning of Hasselbring's actions, act to protect its rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 141.) In other words, Vanderbilt alleges that it would have been able to exploit the Vanderbilt Technology and intellectual property in a different manner if Hasselbring had not been deceptive. With all inferences drawn in favor of Vanderbilt, this damage could include lost royalties, negotiating leverage, market intelligence, and market share. At this stage, this is sufficient to allege reliance and resulting damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, the fraud and fraudulent concealment claims against Hasselbring shall proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Unjust Enrichment Claim (Count Ten)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In Tennessee, unjust enrichment is a quasi-contractual claim by which a court may impose a contractual obligation where one does not exist.\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Under the Court of Appeals precedent discussed above, the Court focuses on whether Vanderbilt's unjust enrichment claim alleges an implied in law or implied in fact contract. Vanderbilt alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   To the extent that Scholastic and/or HMH incorporated the [m]isappropriated Vanderbilt [t]echnology and [i]ntellectual [p]roperty or the confidential Read 180 Materials into the Ancillary Products that are otherwise outside the License Agreement, Scholastic and HMH have been unjustly enriched by their use of the Vanderbilt Technology and [i]ntellectual [p]roperty due to Hasselbring's unlawful conveyance of it to them. Moreover, upon information and belief, they have received millions of dollars from sales of the products containing Vanderbilt's misappropriated intellectual property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   As a result of the Undisclosed Hasselbring Scholastic Agreements, Hasselbring has realized millions of dollars in royalty payments for the Ancillary Products, which contain [m]isappropriated Vanderbilt [t]echnology and [i]ntellectual [p]roperty and/or the confidential Read 180 Materials. Th[ose] ... [m]aterials were not owned by Hasselbring and, therefore, he had no right to convey them to Scholastic and/or HMH.

No. 85 at \u00b6\u00b6 144-146.) This claim alleges the unauthorized use of Vanderbilt Technology and intellectual property in the Derivative or Ancillary Products. There is no allegation of any promise by Scholastic or HMH, in word or deed, to pay Vanderbilt for its alleged use of the misappropriated materials in the Derivative or Ancillary Products. Indeed, to the contrary, the Complaint is a tale of Scholastic and\n   HMH's alleged scheme to use those materials and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   pay Vanderbilt. This is the classic case of an implied-in-law unjust enrichment claim.

Accordingly, Vanderbilt contends that allegations of breach of fiduciary duty add an extra element that makes the unjust enrichment claim \"distinguishable from a garden-variety copyright claim.\" (Doc. No. 97 at 12.) The Court does not agree. In making such an allegation, Vanderbilt relies on both (1) the Employment Agreement and resulting relationship between it and Hasselbring and (2) the License, which are two\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   contracts. But recovery on a theory of unjust enrichment is premised upon whether there is \"\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   existing, enforceable contract between the parties covering the same subject matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Crye-Leike, Inc. v.

Vanderbilt's argument is therefore self-defeating. Further, even if Vanderbilt were somehow not relying on its contractual relationships, it makes no plausible fiduciary duty allegations concerning Scholastic or HMH aside from that they conspired with Hasselbring when he allegedly breached his duties. Vanderbilt has not advanced any law suggesting that Hasselbring's duties can be imputed to Scholastic and HMH.
