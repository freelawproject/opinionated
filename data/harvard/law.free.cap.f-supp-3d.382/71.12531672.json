For this reason, the Court must dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Consider first the statutory text. An expunged conviction cannot serve as the basis of a Section 922(g) violation unless the expungement \"\n   <em>\n    expressly provides\n   </em>\n   that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20) (emphasis added). The certificates setting aside Payne's convictions say nothing about firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26-2 at 3, 6. The YRA, however, does provide that an expunged conviction may still serve as the basis for a violation of D.C.'s felon-in-possession law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-906\">\n    D.C.

Thus, the issue here is whether it is the certificate, the YRA, or some combination of the two that serves as the \"expungement\" of a conviction. If it is the first, Payne cannot be convicted under Section 922(g). If it is either of the latter two options, he may be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Courts are split on this issue.
