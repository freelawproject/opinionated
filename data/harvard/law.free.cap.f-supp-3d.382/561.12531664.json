For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At issue in this motion to suppress are two interviews that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents conducted of Defendant Said Azzam Mohamad Rahim. This case stems from the FBI's investigation of the mobile application \"Zello.\" Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 1. The FBI began surveilling communications on Zello in the spring of 2016, after suspicions that the application was being used to support for terrorist organizations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc. 80, Ex. A). This surveillance led the FBI to believe that Rahim was using Zello to support and promote the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (\"ISIL\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FBI continued to surveil Rahim, eventually discovering that he was planning to travel to Amman, Jordan on March 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (citing Ex. C). Rahim argues that he was traveling to Jordan to see his daughter, who lives there with her mother; the Government, however, suspected he was traveling there to join a terrorist organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Relevant to this motion, the FBI conducted two interviews of Rahim before his arraignment on the charges he now faces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    A. Pre\n   </em>\n   -Miranda\n   <em>\n    Interview at DFW International Airport.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On Sunday, March 5, 2017, Rahim went to the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to travel to Jordan. Agents with the FBI and the Department of State Diplomatic Security Services (State Department) were stationed at the airport and planned to interview Rahim after he cleared the security check point. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 2. At that time, the agents had already obtained search warrants to seize and search Rahim's luggage. Doc. 80, Rahim's App'x, Ex. C. Before he went through security, Rahim attempted to obtain a boarding pass with an airline agent, but the airline refused to issue him a boarding pass at that time and instead instructed him to proceed to the departure gate to obtain one. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After passing through security, Rahim claims he was immediately detained by law-enforcement agents, identifying themselves as members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and escorted to a private room near his departure gate. Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 2. According to the Government, FBI Special Agent Dan Glick of the State Department approached Rahim at the security checkpoint and discovered from him that he had not yet received a boarding pass. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 2. FBI Special Agent Dwayne Golomb approached the two once Glick had helped Rahim collect his belongings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agents were wearing plain, unmarked jackets, and their firearms were not visible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Special Agent Glick then asked Rahim if he would be willing to speak with him in order to clear up any issues with the airline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Rahim agreed to voluntarily speak to the agents, stating he had no reason not to answer their questions. Doc. 80, Rahim's App'x, 153. The two agents accompanied Rahim to his gate. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 2. During this walk, Rahim \"maintained control of his passport, keys, wallet, and bag.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the gate, the agents led Rahim to a small room off of his gate's jet bridge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Special Agent Golomb directed Rahim to sit in a chair near the door to the room, and he and Special\n   Agent Glick sat across from Rahim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. The agents began the interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The interview began sometime around 3:00 p.m. Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 2. Rahim's flight was scheduled to depart at 4:10 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agents started by asking Rahim basic questions about his contact information (full name, telephone numbers, email address, place of business). Doc. 80, Rahim's App'x, Ex. F (DFW Interview Tr.), 1-4. The agents then told Rahim: \"we've got this questionnaire, you know, that we'd like you to answer voluntarily.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:25-5:2. The agents then officially introduced themselves and the respective agencies they work for.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Special Agent Golomb then informed Rahim that he should be truthful and honest in answering their questions and that \"lying to us technically is a Federal crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. They then proceeded to ask Rahim questions from the questionnaire. The agents' questions covered the reasons for his travel to Jordan, what family he had in Jordan, and questions about his knowledge of or association with certain terrorist organizations. Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 3. In total, the interview process lasted over an hour and twenty minutes, and by the time it was over, Rahim's flight had departed without him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At various points in the interview, Rahim asked about the status of his flight and whether he was going to be able to board the plane.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 80, Rahim's App'x, Ex. F (DFW Interview Tr.), 32. The agents assured him at multiple points that his flight had not departed yet and that they were working to find out why he had not received a boarding pass.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 79-80. The agents told Rahim that the problem appeared to be that the German-based airline did not clear him to fly and that, by answering the questions, the agents would potentially be able to help him obtain a boarding pass.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72, 93;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 80, Rahim's App'x, 153-54 (agents informing Rahim of the problem with the airline before the interview).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, towards the end of the interview, the agents requested, and Rahim consented to, a search of his luggage and a search of his cellphone. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 3. While these items were being searched, the agents \"chatted\" with Rahim about soccer and confirmed some of his biographical information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government claims any \"meaningful questioning\" had concluded at this point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government also points out that during the interview, airport and airline personnel passed by the room where the interview was taking place on a number of occasions (the Government counts twenty-two, exactly).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the agents finished searching Rahim's things, they informed him that his flight had already departed and that he could try to fly again the following day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is undisputed that Rahim was never read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights at this interview. Rahim also points out that at no time during the interview did the agents inform him that he was free to leave or that he had the option to not answer the agents' questions. Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 2-3. Rahim claims that the agents' representations that they were attempting to\n   help him obtain a boarding pass were a \"guise\" and that they never intended to let him travel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Indeed, after he left the interview room, Rahim was arrested while he was still at the airport in the drop-off area of the terminal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Rahim was arrested for allegedly making false statements to the agents during the course of that interview. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 4. He was then transported to the Dallas County Jail and held there overnight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rahim argues that his statements from this interview should be suppressed because the statements were made while he was in law-enforcement custody and subject to interrogation, requiring the law-enforcement agents to provide Rahim with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 4. The Government responds that there was no\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation because Rahim was not in custody when he made the statements. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    B. Post\n   </em>\n   -Miranda\n   <em>\n    Interview at Dallas FBI Headquarters.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rahim was arrested at approximately 4:50 p.m. on Sunday, March 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. He was accepted into custody at Dallas County Jail around 6:40 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Around 9:00 a.m. the next morning, federal agents transported him from the county jail to the FBI Dallas field office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He arrived there at around 10:00 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After he arrived, the agents started a second interview of Rahim. Two agents proceeded to question Rahim until around 10:56 a.m. One of the agents from the first interview was present at this one as well. The second agent was not present at the first interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This interview started at approximately 10:13 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This time, before the interview started, the agents read Rahim his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and Rahim stated he understood his rights. Gov't's Ex. 2, Custodial Interview. Rahim also signed a waiver stating he was read and he understood his rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agents explained to Rahim that he had been arrested for making false statements to federal agents in his prior interview. Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 3. This interview covered similar topics as the previous interview, but went into more depth on Rahim's use of the mobile app Zello and his association with terrorists organizations made through the app. Gov't's Ex. 2, Custodial Interview. After approximately forty-five minutes of questioning, Rahim appeared to ask for a lawyer; the agents asked him if this was the case and Rahim confirmed that he would like to speak to a lawyer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 3. The agents immediately stopped the interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the interview, Rahim was processed out of the FBI field office and transported to this courthouse. He arrived at approximately 12:00 p.m. and made his initial appearance in front of Magistrate Judge Toliver at 2:00 p.m.-the standard time that Judge Toliver conducts initial appearances. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rahim argues two grounds exist to suppress the post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements he made in the second interview: (1) there was an unreasonable delay between his detention and presentment to a magistrate, violating\n   <em>\n    Corley v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653414\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/303/\">\n    556 U.S. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653414\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/303/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653414\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/303/\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) ; and (2) the statements made in the second interview were the fruits of the illegally obtained pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements and thus inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Doc. 80, Br. Mot. to Suppress, 4. As for the first argument, the Government responds that while the post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   interview occurred after a six-hour delay in presentment-past the statutory\n   safe harbor in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203501\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) -the delay was not unnecessary or unreasonable. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 15-19. And with respect to Rahim's second argument, the Government counters that even assuming the first interview violated\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , Rahim's statements in the second interview were in fact voluntary under the circumstances and no deliberate two-step strategy was used to coerce the statements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 19-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court has received the parties' briefing and the relevant exhibits to decide this motion.

Here, the actual interrogation occurred in a backroom, away from the eyes of the traveling public. Although the video recording of the interview shows airport personnel and other government officials passing by the interview room during the interrogation, this is not as public as the location of questioning in\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant was in plain view of the public through glass walls of the interrogation room. It seems reasonable that a person would feel a greater degree of restraint when he or she is taken away from a public security checkpoint to a private room that is accessible and visible only to airport staff. However, the Court doesn't believe these circumstances rise to the level of other cases where courts found interrogations were custodial based on the location of the questioning; for example, in\n   <em>\n    Romero-Medrano\n   </em>\n   , the district court found a defendant to be in custody when officers woke him up early in his own home, removed him from his home (while still in pajamas), and escorted him to a police vehicle where he was interrogated.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272568\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/207/708/#p711\">\n    207 F.

The Court thus finds that this factor does not weigh substantially in favor of either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Nature of Questioning\n   </em>\n   -\"The\n   <em>\n    awareness\n   </em>\n   of the person being questioned by an officer that he has become the 'focal point' of the investigation, or that the police already have ample cause to arrest him, may well lead him\n   <em>\n    to conclude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    as a reasonable person\n   </em>\n   , that he is not free to leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Bengivenga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545915\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/845/593/#p595\">\n    845 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   597 n.16 (emphasis in original). In analyzing this factor, courts look to whether the officers indicated to the defendant that he or she was the \"focal point of their investigation,\" or that he or she was the suspect of a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romero-Medrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272568\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/207/708/#p711\">\n    207 F.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Romero-Medrano\n   </em>\n   , the district court found this factor weighed in favor of custody where the agents involved told the defendant that \"they knew a crime had been committed, and they advised him to tell the truth about his involvement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272568\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/207/708/#p711\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272568\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/207/708/#p711\">\n    at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, when the defendant is not told that he is the suspect of a crime, courts are less likely to find a custodial interrogation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528297\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/894/120/\">\n    894 F.2d at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, like in\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   , Rahim was never told that he was suspected of a crime, nor did the agents accuse him of lying during the interview.

Much like\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , \"the transcript of the interview, and the cooperative tone throughout, highlights that the conversation was as much an opportunity taken by [Rahim] to tell his story to the officers as it was an opportunity taken by the officers to get information from [Rahim].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986214\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/769/#p774\">\n    777 F.3d at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The fact the agents warned Rahim that being untruthful or dishonest in answering their questions is not accusatory; this was a warning about his statements going forward, not an insinuation that he was already suspected of committing some crime. The Court does not find that warnings about lying, before questioning even begins, color the questioning with an accusatory air. Rather, besides the casual asides, the agents did not appear to substantially deviate from the questionnaire form and did not once suggest Rahim was lying or the target of a criminal investigation.

Law Enforcement Did Not Violate the Prompt-Presentment Rule.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Rahim argues that his statements in the second interview-made after he was\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   -should be suppressed because law enforcement unreasonably delayed in bringing him before a magistrate. Doc. 80, Mot. to Suppress, 13-14. Because the Government concedes that the delay here was outside \u00a7 3501(c)'s six-hour safe-harbor window, the only issue is whether the delay was justifiable under the\n   <em>\n    McNabb\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mallory\n   </em>\n   line of cases.\n   <em>\n    Boche-Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063142\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/327/#p333\">\n    755 F.3d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reiterates that Rahim has the burden of demonstrating a violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063142\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/327/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The case law is clear that delays for the sake of delay, or delays for the purpose of interrogation run afoul of the\n   <em>\n    McNabb\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mallory\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063142\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/327/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, as explained above, reasonable delays unrelated to prolonged interrogation of the arrestee do not violate\n   <em>\n    McNabb\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mallory\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063142\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/327/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063142\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/327/#p333\">\n    at 336-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rahim was arrested on a Sunday afternoon, around 4:50 p.m.; the agents brought him to this Court at around 12:00 p.m. the next day. Doc. 83, Gov't's Resp., 5. Magistrate judges in this Court typically conduct initial appearances from 1:00-2:00 p.m. on\n   weekdays. At the time of Rahim's arrest, Magistrate Judge Toliver, who was assigned the case, held her initial appearances Monday to Friday at 2:00 p.m. Thus, the agent's here acted reasonably in bringing in Rahim when they did. Any delay that occurred because this Court was closed on Sunday or because of Judge Toliver's afternoon scheduling was not unreasonable. The Court finds that Rahim has not met his burden of showing law enforcement unreasonably delayed in bringing him before a magistrate in violation of\n   <em>\n    McNabb\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mallory\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    C.

Doc. 80, Mot. to Suppress, 14. But the Court has already found,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A, that there was no\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation regarding Rahim's first statements because that interview was noncustodial. Thus, the Court holds that Rahim's statements in the second interview are admissible, and Rahim's motion to suppress these statements is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Said Azzam Mohamad Rahim's Motion to Suppress (Doc. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The only account Rahim provides of this preinterview encounter is that \"[i]mmediately upon Rahim passing through security, he was detained by law enforcement agents identifying themselves as members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force and escorted to a private room a few hundred feet from his departing gate.\" Doc. 80, Br.
