And there is no dispute that after the defendant was stopped, a firearm was visible and was recovered from his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Merissa McCaw testified that on October 21, 2018, at approximately 4:30\n   pm, she was in one of two cars driven by members of the MPD Gun Recovery Unit (\"GRU\") in the Sursum Corda neighborhood in the District of Columbia. Tr. at 4-6; 27:20-23. Officer McCaw was seated behind the driver of the first car, Officer Wright, and there were two other officers in that vehicle. Tr. at 6:13; 20:25-21:10. A second car with four more police officers followed immediately behind. Tr. at 6:11-15; 43:14-16. The cars were unmarked, but the eight officers wore police vests, and the videotapes reveal that the word \"POLICE\" was clearly visible across their chests. Tr. at 8:2-7; Def.'s Ex. 2, Minsak Body Camera, 20:35:54.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   McCaw testified that at the time in question, they had entered what they understood to be a high crime neighborhood, with a \"large amount of drug dealing.\" Tr. 25:16-18, 27:8-12. She also testified that although she did not remember the specific incident that prompted the decision to send her team to that location, they were dispatched by their superiors in the wake of a \"firearms-related event\" that occurred earlier that day or the night before. Tr. at 27:20-23; 48:1-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer McCaw testified that their car was initially driving eastbound on M Street Northwest, and then made a right turn, heading southbound onto the 1110 block of First Place Northwest, where a group of individuals were congregated. Tr. at 16:7-11; 22:21-23:2. As the car entered the block, someone yelled \"Omaha,\" which is known to be a code word to indicate the presence of police. Tr. at 17:16-22. She stated that when she heard that word she began to watch the individuals on the block to see if anyone would react. Tr. at 20:7-14. She noticed that \"[o]f the individuals that were standing in the block, only two people changed their behavior\" - defendant and one other man separated from the group and began walking on the sidewalk head-on towards the officers' cars and away from the group. Tr. at 20-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer McCaw testified that as the two men walked by the first car, Officer Wright, who was seated directly in front of her, spoke to them from the open driver's window. Tr. 20:20-21:13. He \"identified himself as the police and asked if everything was good.\" Tr. at 21:2-3. The individuals kept walking and did not respond. Tr. at 21:12-15. Officer Wright then stopped the car and got out, and according to Officer McCaw, \"as he did so, Mr. Bridges took off running northbound, towards M Street.\" Tr. at 21:17-19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:15-17 (Question by the prosecutor: \"When Officer Wright exited the vehicle, was the defendant running at that time?\" Answer: \"As Officer Wright got out, Mr. Bridges took off running.\"); Tr. at 52:25-53:1 (\"I saw Officer Wright get out and Mr. Bridges take off.\"). Officer Wright and the other officers pursued the defendant on foot, Tr. at 22:18-20, while Officer McCaw got out of the back seat and took over the vehicle. Tr. at 39:8-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The body camera footage reveals that the following events then took place. Police officers chased defendant down the First Place block and around the corner onto M Street Northwest. Officer Denton yelled several times: \"Get on the ground now!\" Def.'s Ex. 3, Denton Body Camera, 20:35:51. The defendant eventually complied and dropped to a prone position on\n   the ground with his arms outstretched above his head.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20:35:57. As Officer Denton approached the defendant on the ground, a firearm was visible on the left side of defendant's waistband.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The officer then took hold of the defendant while he was on the ground and ordered him to \"turn on his stomach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Another officer is overheard saying \"1-800,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20:35:59, which Officer McCaw testified is a code word for the presence of a firearm. Tr. at 38:2-3. Once defendant was placed in handcuffs and turned over to face the officers, the firearm is again visible in the videotape on the left side of his waistband. Gov't's Ex. 1, Anderson Body Camera, 20:36:39; Gov't Ex. 12, Crime Scene Photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts are largely undisputed. Defendant did not object to the introduction of the testimony concerning why the officers had been directed to that location, and he does not dispute the characterization of the neighborhood as a high crime area. Tr. at 103:18-21; Def.'s Suppl. at 2. Nor does he dispute that someone yelled \"Omaha,\" Tr. at 45:20-24; 97:5-8, or that he then began to walk away from the group,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   49:12-16, although he maintains that his actions at that point could not have been viewed as suspicious since he was walking towards, and not away from, the police cars headed in his direction. Tr. at 96:25-97:2. The defense does not dispute that Officer Wright referred to himself as \"police\" when he spoke to the defendant from the driver's window as the defendant was walking past the car on the sidewalk. Tr. at 98:9-15. (Question by the Court: \"[T]hat put them on notice that they were the police. We agree to that[?]\" Counsel for the defendant: \"Right ....\"). And most importantly, he does not dispute that he ran away from the police officers. Tr. at 97:15-17. Instead, the focus of the defense argument at the motions hearing was: who initiated the chase? Tr. at 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Counsel for the defendant asserted that the defendant did not run until after the officer \"jumped out\" of the car, and therefore, his flight was provoked. Tr. at 104:12-13; Def.'s Suppl. at 5. According to the defense, Officer Wright \"ran out of [the] car,\" Tr. 96:5-6, and if the \"police created the situation which ... caused Mr. Bridges to run,\" his flight was not indicative of consciousness of guilt and was not enough to justify the stop. Tr. at 102:24-103:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But the defendant did not testify, and he did not introduce any other witnesses to describe the manner in which Officer Wright exited the car. The only testimony on that point was provided by Officer McCaw:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   QUESTION BY THE PROSECUTOR: Officer McCaw, when Officer Wright was getting out of the vehicle, did you have an opportunity to observe him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. Officer Wright or Mr. Bridges?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. Officer Wright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. Did Officer Wright pull his weapon?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. How would you describe the demeanor when Officer Wright was opening the door?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Fairly calm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Well, did he stop the car and essentially jump out, or he just pulled over and opened the door and ambled out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE WITNESS: It was somewhere between that casual ambling out and leaping out of the car. He sort of got out with a purpose, but I wouldn't say that it was leaping out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: Well, did he parallel park, or just pull the car over and got out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE WITNESS: He stopped the car, put it in park and then got out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Tr. 40:24-41:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Also, the defendant did not introduce any testimony on the question of who ran first. The only testimony in the record consists of Officer McCaw's multiple statements that the defendant took off \"\n   <em>\n    as\n   </em>\n   Officer Wright got out\" Tr. at 22:17 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:17-19; 52:25-53:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In support of his claim that \"[h]e did not run until an officer jumped out of his car,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Suppl. at 5, defendant introduced Officer McCaw's body camera footage and several still images of certain moments shown on the video. Tr. at 96; Def.'s Ex. 1, McCaw Body Camera; Def.'s Exs. 7-9, Still Images. The McCaw video reflects that the lead car in which Officer Wright and McCaw were travelling had just turned the corner at 20:35:34, and Officer Wright stopped the car and he got out at 20:35:44, and that he almost immediately began to run. The defendant is not visible at any point in Officer McCaw's body camera footage so it is not clear whether Officer Wright initiated the chase or whether defendant had already taken off by 20:35:44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant's Exhibit 8 is a still shot from McCaw's body worn camera video marked 20:35:44. Def.'s Ex. 8, Still Image. In the upper left-hand corner of the photo, one can observe Officer Wright's leg and foot just outside the car in what appears to be a position consistent with running.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 9, a still shot marked 20:35:45, depicts the officer now at the curb and running. Def.'s Ex. 9, Still Image. Based on this evidence, the defense argues that it was the officer's leaping out and running that prompted the defendant's flight. Tr. at 96:7-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But the photos do not establish that sequence - or any sequence - since defendant is not visible in any of Officer McCaw's body camera footage. The Court reviewed the body camera footage of the other officers on the scene and none capture the precise moment defendant began to run nor do they capture both Officer Wright's and defendant's movements in the same frame at the point the chase began. Therefore, the Court finds that the only evidence introduced by the defendant is inconclusive, and that it does not contradict the testimony in the record that the defendant bolted\n   <em>\n    as\n   </em>\n   Officer Wright got out of the car. And more important, whether the defendant broke into a run at the precise instant the car stopped, the door opened, and the officer placed his first foot on the ground, or he began to move purposefully towards the defendant, the legal analysis of the split-second interaction does not change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures ... and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. However, the Supreme Court has recognized an exception to the warrant requirement in that \"the police can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity 'may be afoot,' even if the officer lacks probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the defendant was seized after something else happened: he ran away.

Def.'s Suppl. at 4-5; Tr. at 95-96. The first problem with this argument is that there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that counsel is correct about when or why the defendant broke into a run. The defendant did not testify. None of the videotapes depict the precise point when the defendant took off. The one witness who did testify about the encounter resisted the \"jump out\" characterization. Tr. at 41:10-15. And the piece of evidence the defense proffered - a still photo taken from the body worn camera footage, simply shows that at a point in time when the officer was apparently running, the defendant was no longer visible in the frame. Def.'s Ex. 8, Still Image. Moreover the evidence in the record as a whole is equally consistent with a conclusion that the defendant began walking away when he was alerted by the signal \"Omaha\" to the possible presence of police on the block, but that he ran when it became crystal clear that the car belonged to the police, and they were definitely going to engage with the people on the block. The record shows that while the defendant was still merely walking, Officer Wright, who was wearing the labelled vest, addressed defendant from the open car window and identified himself as a police officer. Officer Wright then stopped the car and at that point, as Officer Wright got out, the defendant began to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even if one accepts defense counsel's assertion that the defendant's flight was specifically prompted by the fact that the officer got out of the car - \"with a purpose,\" as described by Officer McCaw, Tr. 41:14-15, or even with the sort of alacrity that might be consistent with the moniker, \"jump out\" squad, Tr. 53:4-8 - what we appear to have is flight prompted by police investigative activity and not otherwise\n   \"provoked,\" and therefore,\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   is directly on point.

So while the Supreme Court used the word \"unprovoked\" in its opinion, the defense is placing too much weight on the adjective here.

One could engage in a principled policy debate about the utilization and tactics of the Gun Recovery Unit, but the record here simply does not supply any factual basis to differentiate this case from the controlling authority.
