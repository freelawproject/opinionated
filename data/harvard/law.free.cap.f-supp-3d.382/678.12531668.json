MICHELSON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In March 2012, a woman was raped by a man who was, for most of the encounter, masked. At one point during their investigation into the crime, the police called the victim to the station. There, a police captain informed the victim that an arrest warrant was out for someone whose DNA matched DNA found on clothing worn by her assailant and recovered from the crime scene. Then, when the captain had to leave to take a phone call, the victim saw a photo on the captain's computer screen. The photo was of William Deshiree Thomas. Later, at Thomas' preliminary examination and at trial, the victim identified Thomas as her attacker. At trial, Thomas put on an alibi defense. Consistent with Michigan law, Thomas disclosed to the prosecution his list of alibi witnesses. Although the same Michigan statute required the prosecution to reciprocate, i.e., tell Thomas its rebuttal alibi witnesses, the prosecution did not provide Thomas with any such list. But, at trial, the prosecution was allowed to call in its case-and-chief a witness who testified contrary to Thomas' alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thomas believes that these two issues-the hint given to the victim at the police station and the surprise rebuttal alibi witness-warrant a writ of habeas corpus from this Court.

Thomas' defense was that whoever the intruder was, it was not him. While his DNA was on the do-rag, it also contained the DNA of two others. And\n   Thomas presented an alibi.

He asserts that the victim was able to identify him as her attacker because of the suggestion given by police when she came to the station and because she saw him on the news. He also asserts that the introduction of testimony that rebutted his alibi was fundamentally unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thomas' first claim is that the victim was only able to identify him because she was given a strong hint (or practically told) that he was the attacker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To fully understand Thomas' assertion, some additional background is necessary. About two weeks after the attack, the police called the victim to come down to the station. Once there, Daryl Green, a police captain, told the victim that they had a DNA match and that there was a warrant out to arrest the match. (ECF No. 12, PageID.567.) The victim explained to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   While I was in Captain Green's office, he took a phone call on his cell. He said, \"Excuse me,\" went out in the hallway, took a call. I was sitting there looking around and waiting for him. And I saw a picture on his computer screen, like the Judge's, kind of off, you know, I was-not even that much, really, kind of off at an angle, and it caught my attention because I recognized him, and I looked at it to see. So when Captain Green came back in, I asked him-I didn't ask him. Actually, I told him. I said, \"That's him, isn't it?\" And he was very non-committal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   He didn't say yes, no, or anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (ECF No. 12, PageID.568.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With that background, the Court can flesh out Thomas' claim. In Thomas' view, the victim was first told that the police were going to arrest someone whose DNA matched DNA found at the crime scene. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, PageID.23.) Then the victim was left alone with Captain Green's computer screen \"in plain view.\" (ECF No. 1, PageID.24.) According to Thomas, contemporaneously learning that the police were going to arrest the DNA match and seeing his picture on the captain's computer screen led the victim to conclude that he was her attacker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And absent that direction, Thomas argues, the victim may have never been able to identify him as the attacker. (ECF No. 1, PageID.25.) Indeed, Thomas points out, she was not able to describe her attacker in enough detail for a composite sketch. (ECF No. 1, PageID.25.) So, says Thomas, his due process rights were violated because police suggested to the victim he was the attacker. (ECF No. 1, PageID.26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected this claim. Here is what the state appellate court said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Thomas argues that the threshold inquiry in [\n   <em>\n    Perry v. New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    565 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ]-whether the identification was \"procured under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement\"-was satisfied in this case. He argues that law enforcement arranged the identification in the police captain's office by calling the victim to the office, telling her that the officers had an arrest warrant for her assailant on the basis of a DNA match, and then leaving her alone in the office with a photograph of Thomas on a computer screen. Although a police officer contacted the victim and requested her presence at the police station, she was not contacted to make an identification; Thomas had already been identified from the DNA match and there was no evidence that officers wanted the victim to examine the photo or confirm Thomas' identity as her attacker. Instead, it appears that the victim saw the photo by mere happenstance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The evidence shows that the captain was conversing with the victim when he was interrupted by a phone call. He stepped out of the office to take the call and, while he was absent, the victim noticed Thomas' photo on the computer screen even though the screen was angled away from her. Nothing on this record indicates that law enforcement used unnecessarily suggestive procedures to procure an identification. Accordingly, Thomas has not established the threshold inquiry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    People v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   , No. 321822,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206955182\">\n    2015 WL 6955182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Mich. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   That was an \"on the merits\" determination of Thomas' unduly-suggestive-identification claim. So \u00a7 2254(d) applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   And Thomas has not shown that the Michigan Court of Appeals unreasonably applied\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   or made unreasonable, material factual determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

Thomas says that there was improper police conduct in his case because\n   the police called the victim to the station, told her about the DNA match, and then left the computer screen in plain view. (ECF No. 13, PageID.1139.) But the testimony that Thomas cites does not clearly establish improper police conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q. Okay. And so ... you suggested that the Judge's computer screen is-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [THE VICTIM:] It's not quite like that because I was sitting on the other side of the [captain's] desk-of his desk.... It was off, you know, several feet and kind of angled, but, you know I'm sitting there while he's out in the hall.

This testimony does not show that the Michigan Court of Appeals' unreasonably thought \"the screen was angled away from\" the victim.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206955182\">\n    2015 WL 6955182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. And having reviewed the other evidence bearing on this issue (ECF No. 12, PageID. 568, 925, 1029), the Court cannot say it was unreasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to have found no improper police conduct. It follows that the Michigan Court of Appeals reasonably concluded that Thomas had not cleared the first requirement of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, Thomas has not cleared \u00a7 2554(d) and so his claim that the victim only identified him due to the events at the station does not warrant habeas corpus relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Warden says that Thomas' second claim for habeas corpus relief is time-barred. In his petition, Thomas clearly presented his second claim but only extensively briefed his first. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, PageID.1-2 (\"a. Identification Issue.... b. Alibi Rule Enforcement Issue.\").) Prior to the Warden's response, Thomas moved to amend his petition to fully brief his second claim. The Court granted that motion. (ECF No. 14.) The Warden claims that by the time Thomas filed his amended petition, AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations had run. (ECF No. 15, PageID.1171.) And, says the Warden, Thomas' second claim does not relate back to his first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court need not engage. It is not required to address statute of limitations before merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahart v.

App'x 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (6th Cir. 2005). In this case, the Court prefers the merits over procedure and, as will become apparent, that choice results in no prejudice to the Warden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To understand Thomas' second claim for habeas corpus relief, some additional factual and state-law background is necessary. As noted, Thomas presented an alibi to the jury. Thomas' then-girlfriend, Melissa Morrisey testified that around the time of the attack (around 9:00 p.m.), she and Thomas went to drop off her daughter at a babysitter's house. (ECF No. 12, PageID.684.) But Jeff Pergl's testimony was to the contrary. Pergl testified that he, his fianc\u00e9, and two others went with Morrisey to drop off her daughter at the babysitter's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (ECF No. 12, PageID.700.) And Pergl testified that Thomas was not with them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While conflicting testimony is nothing uncommon, Michigan has a special rule about alibi witnesses and rebuttal alibi witnesses. In particular, Thomas was required to notify the prosecution of the \"names\" of his alibi witnesses and to inform the prosecution where he claims to have been at the time of the offense; the prosecution was then required to disclose the \"names\" of its rebuttal alibi witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20768.20\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 768.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thomas did his part. But the prosecution did not provide Thomas with a list of rebuttal alibi witnesses before trial. Instead, the prosecution included Pergl on its general witness list and called Pergl in its case-in-chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With that background, Thomas' second ground for habeas corpus relief is more readily understood. He asserts that the prosecution's failure to identify rebuttal witnesses ahead of trial, coupled with the trial court's ruling that Pergl could nonetheless testify, violated his rights under the Due Process Clause as set out in\n   <em>\n    Wardius v.

Thomas argues that there was a lack or reciprocity in his case (he gave notice, the prosecution did not) and so permitting Pergl's testimony deprived him of rights under the Due Process Clause.

But if not, then this Court addresses the due process inquiry\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A case could be made for\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review or, perhaps, that Thomas failed to exhaust his claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   . In his brief to the Michigan Court of Appeals, Thomas did not expressly rely on\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   . Instead, he asserted that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing the prosecution to present Pergl despite the prosecution's failure to comply with Michigan's notice-of-alibi statute. (ECF No. 12, PageID.943.) To establish this last point (that the prosecution did not comply with the statute), Thomas argued that even if Pergl was formally a case-in-chief witness, the content of his testimony made him a rebuttal alibi witness in fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12, PageID.946.) Thomas' arguments prompted the Michigan Court of Appeals to treat Thomas' claim as presenting an issue of statutory interpretation. In particular, the Michigan Court of Appeals explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The notice provision plainly refers to witnesses that the prosecutor intends to call for the specific purpose of rebutting the defendant's alibi; it does not refer to the witnesses that the prosecutor intended to call in his or her case in chief to establish the elements of the crime, even though those witnesses' testimony will necessarily contradict the defendant's\n   alibi. Indeed, Thomas' interpretation of the statute would lead to an absurd result. If the prosecutor were prohibited from calling any witnesses that would contradict Thomas' alibi, then the prosecutor would have been prohibited from calling the victim because she testified that Thomas was in her home sexually assaulting her at a time when he claimed he was elsewhere. We will not give the statute such an absurd construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206955182\">\n    2015 WL 6955182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. And nowhere in the Michigan Court of Appeals' opinion does\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   make an appearance. And the Michigan Court of Appeals never mentions the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Even so, the Court believes that the state appellate court did adjudicate \"on the merits\" Thomas' claim that his rights under the Due Process Clause were violated when the prosecutor did not provide notice of rebuttal alibi witnesses before trial and then presented Pergl's testimony about Thomas' whereabouts. There are several reasons for this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, both Thomas (in his brief in the Michigan Court of Appeals) and the Michigan Court of Appeals cited\n   <em>\n    People v.

It would be reasonable to infer that the Michigan Court of Appeals reads cases its cites, read\n   <em>\n    Travis\n   </em>\n   , and thus was aware that Thomas' claim about Pergl's testimony implicated the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Arguably then, by finding no abuse of discretion by the trial court under the\n   <em>\n    Travis\n   </em>\n   factors, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that the trial court did not breach\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   ' reciprocity requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals' factual determinations also support that read of its opinion. In particular, the Michigan Court of Appeals stressed that there was no unfair surprise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   We further note that the intent behind the rebuttal notice requirement in MCL 768.20 is to prevent surprise at trial.... In this case, the prosecutor's first and second amended witness lists-which were both filed before Thomas filed his notice of alibi-both indicated that Pergl would be called as a witness in the prosecutor's case-in-chief. Further, Thomas' trial lawyer represented to the court that, on the basis of the witness' statements, there was going to be testimony from a prosecution witness that the witness was with Thomas' alibi witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, Thomas' trial lawyer was plainly aware that the witness might testify in a way that controverted Thomas' alibi witness.

The record also shows that the prosecutor did not give the notice because she did not intend to specifically rebut Thomas' alibi defense, but only intended to present her case-in-chief using the previously disclosed witnesses. Because Thomas knew who the prosecutor intended to call and had access to the clearly contradictory statements already provided by those witnesses, there was little-if any-harm occasioned by the failure to provide additional notice. In other words, knowing that the prosecutor intended to call Pergl and knowing what Pergl was likely to say should have been sufficient for Thomas' trial lawyer to evaluate whether he wanted to proceed with an alibi defense in light of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206955182\">\n    2015 WL 6955182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (paragraphing altered). Effectively, the Michigan Court of Appeals reasoned that even if the prosecution did not comply with the letter of the notice-of-alibi statute, the purpose of the statute-to eliminate unfair surprise to Thomas-was fulfilled on the facts of Thomas' case. And that is at least arguably an adjudication of the \"merits\" of Thomas' claim of reciprocity under\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407478\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/289/#p305\">\n    568 U.S. at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407478\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/289/#p305\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a state court rejects a federal claim without expressly addressing that claim, a federal habeas court must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   That threshold determination means that for this Court to grant Thomas habeas corpus relief on his due process claim, Thomas must show that the state court of appeals unreasonably applied\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   or rejected his claim based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Start with the state court's factual determinations.

As such, Thomas has not shown that the Michigan Court of Appeals unreasonably found that \"Thomas knew who the prosecutor intended to call and had access to the clearly contradictory statements already provided by those witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206955182\">\n    2015 WL 6955182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206955182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"In other words, knowing that the prosecutor intended to call Pergl and knowing what Pergl was likely to say should have been sufficient for Thomas' trial lawyer to evaluate whether he wanted to proceed with an alibi defense in light of the evidence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nor has Thomas shown that the Michigan Court of Appeals unreasonably applied\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   . To start, the facts there were quite different than here: the criminal defendant in\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   was precluded from introducing alibi testimony because he did not comply with the state's notice-of-alibi law; here, the prosecution was allowed to introduce rebuttal alibi testimony despite arguably not complying with the state's notice-of-alibi law. More importantly, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   was concerned with unfair surprise: \"The State may not insist that trials be run as a 'search for truth' so far as defense witnesses are concerned, while maintaining 'poker game' secrecy for its own witnesses. It is fundamentally unfair to require a defendant to divulge the details of his own case while at the same time subjecting him to the hazard of surprise concerning refutation of the very pieces of evidence which he disclosed to the State.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 475-76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173453\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/470/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So one reading of\n   <em>\n    Wardius\n   </em>\n   is that there is no due process violation when the prosecution fails to provide a reciprocal alibi notice but the criminal defendant is nonetheless aware of the rebuttal witnesses. And, as noted, that is what the Michigan Court of Appeals thought happened in Thomas' case.
