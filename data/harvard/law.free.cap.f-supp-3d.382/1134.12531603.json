Dkt. #19. This dispute originated when Puglia Engineering, Inc., purchased all the stock of San Francisco Ship Repair, Inc. (SFSR), quickly realized that the new venture was financially unsustainable, and then ceased all operations after just a few months. The Funds assert that the decision to pull the plug on SFSR amounted to a \"complete withdrawal,\" which triggered withdrawal liability to pay any \"unfunded vested benefits\" to multiemployer pension plans.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201381\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Funds assert that all Defendants are jointly and severally liable for Puglia Engineering and SFSR's withdrawal liability because they constitute a single \"employer\" under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act (MPPAA). This is because, according to the Funds, each non-individual defendant is a \"trade or business\" under the \"common control\" of Neil Turney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1301(b)(1). They also contend that Turney himself is jointly and severally liable as the sole proprietor of a business that leases property to Puglia Engineering. The Funds thus ask the Court to enter judgment in their favor for the outstanding amount of interim withdrawal liability payments, which comes to $ 1,034,184. The Funds also request an injunction ordering Defendants to make future interim withdrawal liability payments, which will come to roughly an additional $ 1.3 million before the parties engage in arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants Puglia Marine, LLC, Puglia Engineering of California, Inc., Bari Marine Holdings, LLC, 1410 Thorne Road, LLC, and Neil Turney (collectively \"the Control Group\") do not oppose the assertion that they are one employer for purposes\n   of withdrawal liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They are also relatively silent regarding whether they owe the amount of withdrawal liability claimed by the Funds. However, Defendants do ask the Court to adopt and apply an \"equitable exception\" to the MPPAA's requirement that withdrawing employers make interim payments until their liability can be litigated at arbitration. Defendants insist that several other circuits have wisely applied such an exception where making interim payments would irreparably harm the withdrawing employer. If the Court applies this exception, Defendants assert that their likely economic hardship supports denying the Funds' Motion or at least staying review pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Puglia Engineering is a third-party Washington corporation with 100% of its stock owned by its president, Neil Turney. Dkt. #18, at 8. On December 1, 2016, Puglia Engineering entered into a stock purchase agreement with BAE Systems Ship Repair, Inc. Through this agreement, Puglia Engineering obtained ownership of 100% of the stock of SFSR, a subsidiary of BAE Systems Ship Repair. However, a mere four days after Puglia Engineering took possession of the shipyard on January 2, 2017, it became clear that at least $ 15 million worth of repairs would be necessary to continue the venture. Rather than expend this large amount, Puglia Engineering ceased operating the shipyard on May 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before Puglia Engineering purchased its stock, SFSR was signatory to two collective bargaining agreements. The first was with Carpenters Local Union 2236, affiliated with the Northern California Regional Council of Carpenters. The second was with the Bay Cities Metal Trades Council of the Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO. Each CBA respectively required SFSR to report and pay pension contributions to the Marine Carpenters Pension Fund and the Pacific Coast Shipyards Pension Fund for each hour of covered work performed by union employees. SFSR reported and paid pension fringe benefit contributions to these funds after the CBAs were executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Puglia Engineering took ownership of SFSR's stock on December 1, 2016, it also adopted the terms and conditions of all the union contracts to which SFSR was bound. Dkt. #22, Ex. 5, at \u00b6 9.06. Specifically, the purchase agreement states that the Puglia Engineering shall have \"sole responsibility for all Liabilities arising under each such Union Contract and Benefit/Pension Plan\" and explicitly releases SFSR from \"any obligation or Liability....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although Puglia Engineering reported and paid fringe benefit contributions to the Funds while operating SFSR, this stopped once SFSR was shut down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April of 2017, both Puglia Engineering and SFSR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n   <em>\n    See In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puglia Engineering, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , United States Bankruptcy Court, Western District of Washington, Case No. 18-41324 BDL;\n   <em>\n    In re San Francisco Ship Repair, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , United States Bankruptcy Court, Western District of Washington, Case No. 18-41350 BDL. On April 20, 2018, the Funds filed proofs of claim in both bankruptcy proceedings claiming ERISA withdrawal liability. Dkt. #23, Exs. 14 &amp; 15. The Marine Carpenters Pension Fund claimed it was owed a total of $ 2,170,785.00, with quarterly payments of $ 49,520.00. Dkt. #14, Ex. 18. The Pacific\n   Coast Shipyards Pension Fund claimed it was owed $ 14,887,521.00, with quarterly payments of $ 295,208.00. Dkt. #23, Ex. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to owning all of Puglia Engineering's stock, Neil Turney also owns 100% of the stock in Puglia Engineering of California, Inc., and is the sole member of Puglia Marine, LLC, Bari Marine Holdings, LLC, and 1410 Thorne Rd., LLC. Dkt. #18, at 8; Dkt. #23, Exs. 8 &amp; 9. Turney also owns two parcels of real property in Tacoma, WA, that he leases to Puglia Engineering. Dkt. #23, Ex. 10. On May 7, 2018, the Funds sent written demands for payment of withdrawal liability to several of the non-bankrupt members of the Control Group, including Puglia Marine, LLC, Puglia Engineering of California, Inc., and 1410 Thorne Rd., LLC. Dkt. #23, Exs. 18 &amp; 19. The letters stated the amounts owing and that payment was due within 60 days of receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the members failed to pay by July 8, 2018, the date that the first installment was due,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Funds sent two additional letters notifying the members of the Control Group that they were in default. Dkt. #23, Ex. 20; Dkt. #23, Ex. 21. However, the quarterly installments due on October 8, 2018, and January 8, 2019, were also not paid, and no payments subsequent to those dates have been made either. Dkt. #23, at \u00b6\u00b6 10-14; Dkt. #22, at \u00b6 12. The Funds filed this action in October, 2018, to compel payment by the Control Group. Dkt. #1. The Control Group demanded arbitration on November 21, 2018. Dkt. #23, at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his declaration, Turney states that Puglia Engineering has not yet confirmed a plan of reorganization but that its assets are more than fully encumbered by the secured claims of Washington Federal Bank. Dkt. #32, at 2. Further, as a personal guarantor of Puglia Engineering's obligations, Turney asserts that his personal assets are also encumbered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201381\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the few cases to have applied this exhaustion exception in the MPPAA context, courts have coupled their analysis of irreparable harm with a discussion of the employer's likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    T.I.M.E.-DC, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    New York State Teamsters\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court held that collection of interim payments should be enjoined because the employer was\n   likely to succeed in their argument that withdrawal liability was not triggered when the employer ceased contributions during a labor dispute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1648212\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/580/621/#p633\">\n    580 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   626-31 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201398\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the Control Group has not moved for an injunction or provided any compelling argument that withdrawal liability was improperly assessed. Consequently, the Court will not excuse the Control Group from ERISA's administrative exhaustion requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief for Future Withdrawal Liability Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition to requesting an order compelling delinquent payments, the Funds also ask the Court to issue an injunction ordering the Control Group to make future interim withdrawal liability payments under threat of sanctions. The Funds argue that they are likely to succeed on the merits if the Control Group fails to make future payments for the same reasons that they are entitled to judgment for the payments that are already delinquent. The Funds contend that they will suffer irreparable harm if they are forced to forego the additional $ 1.3 million dollars that the Control Group will owe over the next year. The Funds also argue that the equities are in their favor because the Control Group is rightfully obligated to make its future payments and that it is in the public interest to discourage employers from shirking their withdrawal liability responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   An injunction is improper in these circumstances for several reasons. First, while the Funds ask that the Court impose the threat of sanctions, holding the Control Group in civil contempt for failing to make payments would serve no valid purpose. \"Civil contempt sanctions ... are employed for two purposes: to coerce the defendant into compliance with the court's order, and to compensate the complainant for losses sustained.\"\n   <em>\n    Whittaker Corp. v.

Here, there would be no need to use additional fines to get the Control Group to abide by the court's order because the possibility of a judgment with interest, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees is a natural deterrent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Indeed, the injunction proposed by the Funds is similar to a guaranteed monetary judgment in the future, but courts cannot use sanctions to enforce monetary judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shuffler v. Heritage Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1904118\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/720/1141/#p1147\">\n    720 F.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147 (9th Cir. 1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Civil contempt may also be used to \"compensate the contemnor's adversary for the injuries which result from the noncompliance\" with the court's order.\n   <em>\n    Falstaff Brewing Corp. v.

However, the MPPAA already allows a pension plan to move for a court order compelling delinquent payments.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201451\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). There is no need for a plan to be compensated twice. It thus appears clear that the Court could not back up an injunction with sanctions. But without sanctions, an injunction of this nature would amount to little more than a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, injunctive relief is inappropriate when there has been no alleged\n   violation of the law.\n   <em>\n    Tennessee Valley Auth. v.

While the Control Group has already missed several of its interim payments, it has not missed the payments that the Funds seek an injunction for. Assessing the \"likelihood of success on the merits\" in these circumstances where the cause of action has not even accrued is a purely hypothetical exercise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

Enjoining the Control Group here would be no different from ordering a party to a contract requiring monthly payments to pay the remaining installments. In both cases payment would be legally required, but an injunction would be unwarranted. Declaratory relief would be the proper remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For these reasons, the Court denies the Funds' request for injunctive relief. However, the Funds are correct that, if the Control Group is required to make the interim payments it has already missed, it is also required to meet its future withdrawal liability obligations. Consequently, the Court will issue a declaratory judgment that the Control Group is legally obligated to timely provide future interim withdrawal liability payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Funds' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and an Order to Pay the amount of $ 1,034,184 [Dkt. #33] is GRANTED.
