The plaintiff, Roger S. Fuller, Jr. (\"Fuller\"), filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, Roanoke Division, on December 20, 2017. ECF No. 1. The complaint alleged claims arising under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and pendent state claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ECF No. 1. The defendant, Carilion Clinic, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint (ECF No. 3), and the plaintiff then filed an amended complaint. ECF No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his second amended complaint, plaintiff Fuller asserted that he was employed by Carilion Clinic as a janitor and that he was at work when he found three burned, wooden stick matches and a signed piece of paper near the Carilion Clinic dentistry lab. ECF No. 38 at 4. Further, plaintiff Fuller indicated that he then notified the receptionist of the wooden stick matches and the signed piece of paper, and that Carilion Clinic police then arrived to investigate the incident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Carilion Clinic Police and Security Services Department is a private police department maintained by Carilion Clinic and authorized by the Virginia General Assembly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his second amended complaint, plaintiff Fuller alleged that Carilion Clinic police came to plaintiff's residence the following morning and staged a \"surround and call out,\" a swat-style arrest tactic, before entering the plaintiff's home and taking him to the Carilion Clinic police station for questioning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 12. The plaintiff filed a response in opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss the amended complaint (ECF No. 16), and the defendant then filed a reply to the plaintiff's response in opposition (ECF No. 17). This Court then entered a memorandum opinion and order finding that: (1) any actions by Carilion Clinic police outside of the real property owned, leased, or controlled by Carilion Clinic were not authorized by Virginia Code \u00a7 9.1-101, and does not constitute as state action; and (2) assuming without deciding that Carilion Clinic police is a state actor, the plaintiff presented enough evidence that Carilion Clinic may be liable under \u00a7 1983. ECF No. 23 at 8-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff then filed a motion to join additional defendants, Carilion Chief of Police Steve Lugar (\"Chief Lugar\") and Carilion Police Captain Ron Donelson (\"Captain Donelson\").

ECF No. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After completion of discovery, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. ECF No. 49. In their memorandum in support of summary judgment (ECF No. 50), defendants contended that \"there is no evidence that the Chief of Carilion's police department 'made a decision to arrest, interrogate, and imprison the plaintiff and that such a decision amounted to a constitutional deprivation'.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 51. Plaintiff Fuller stated that Captain Donelson was acting in performance of his official duties, outside of Carilion Clinic's jurisdiction, when going to plaintiff Fuller's home at the direction of Chief Lugar. ECF No. 52 at 7. In response to defendants' argument that Carilion Clinic police did not perform a \"public function,\" plaintiff Fuller stated that the public function test is not specific as to what duties or jobs the individual officers performed, but whether they are exclusively authorized to act in the first place.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to plaintiff Fuller, Captain Donelson was dispatched by Chief Lugar to plaintiff's home in furtherance of an investigation, which was consistent with the officer's authority granted by the Virginia General Assembly to deter and prevent crime, and to safeguard life and property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, plaintiff Fuller explained that plaintiff believed that he was under arrest and did not feel free to refuse to accompany the Carilion Clinic officers to the police station, reciting facts regarding the time, place, and purpose of the encounter by Carilion Clinic police, words used, general tone and demeanor,\n   the presence of multiple officers, and display of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 11-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lastly, plaintiff Fuller asserted that the following decisions, and omissions, by Chief Lugar, or his alleged delegee, Captain Donelson, as policymakers imputed \u00a7 1983 liability to Carilion Clinic: (1) authorization of plaintiff Fuller's arrest and transport outside of Carilion Clinic's jurisdiction; (2) failure to supervise the police interrogation of plaintiff Fuller, resulting in a deprivation of plaintiff's civil rights; and (3) a policy of regulating perceived employee misconduct under the guise of police investigation of potential or possible criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 15-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants filed a reply to plaintiff Fuller's response in opposition to their motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 54. The defendants first stated that the Court should decline plaintiff Fuller's attempt to revisit this Court's prior ruling that as a private police force, Carilion Clinic police cannot be acting under color of state law off premises.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, defendants contended that plaintiff Fuller cannot establish a policy on the part of Chief Lugar, or Captain Donelson, to treat plaintiff in an unconstitutional manner, eliminating\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability on behalf of Carilion Clinic.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, defendants contended that Carilion Clinic police were not performing a public function when at plaintiff Fuller's home, because this Court has ruled that \u00a7 1983 liability cannot apply to Carilion Clinic's off campus activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the deposition transcript from Chief Lugar, Chief Lugar asked Investigator Janney to \"go in and ask [plaintiff Fuller] if he would be willing to come [to Carilion Clinic] and talk to [Carilion Clinic police].\" ECF No. 52-5 at 6.

Lugar did not advise or warn Janney or Donelson to approach Fuller in a non-confrontational manner. Lugar did not have any portion of the police interview at Carilion recorded. Chief Lugar knew of a fire in the rehab on the evening of September 14th, but did nothing about it until more than 12 hours later after he came to work. He then ignored virtually every factual assertion in Crotts' report ... Instead Chief Lugar claims it was his understanding that there was an urgent situation with a homeless person on the loose setting fires within Carilion Clinic and he did not know that Fuller suffered from anxiety and Asperger's syndrome, but that Fuller was simply a witness. Chief Lugar's assessment not only strains credulity, but having been provided with the factual information by Officer Crotts and overseeing the investigation of the incident he is charged with the responsibility for insuring that the one and only witness/suspect has his constitutional rights protected. As a hands on Chief who likes to stay abreast of investigations, Chief Lugar failed to follow accepted standards of law enforcement as well as the Carilion Police Personnel Directives 3.01 or 4.13.

Moreover, the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence of encouragement by Chief Lugar to perpetuate such alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Therefore, Chief Lugar's alleged failure to supervise the police interrogation of plaintiff Fuller does not establish Carilion Clinic's liability under \u00a7 1983 based on the theory that there was an established policy or custom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Carilion Clinic's alleged policy of regulating perceived employee misconduct under police investigations does not establish Carilion Clinic's liability under \u00a7 1983 based on the theory that there was an established policy or custom.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In support of this theory, plaintiff Fuller asserted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   while Carilion's human resources department may not specifically direct the police department to conduct an investigation, there is clearly a custom or practice whereby the police makes investigative material, obtained under color of law, available to human resources personnel for use in their employment decisions.
