Biniaris was employed by Hansel from July 31, 2017 through March 13, 2018, and in her most recent position at Hansel she worked as a physical therapist. Am. Compl. \u00b6 11.

The lower back injury \"substantially limited one or more of [Biniaris's] major life activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 20, 2018, Hansel assigned Biniaris to a revised work schedule due to her injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hansel advances three arguments in support of its Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13. First, Hansel argues that Biniaris's Rehabilitation Act claim must be dismissed because the Rehabilitation Act does not apply to Hansel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Second, Hansel argues that, if the court concludes that the Rehabilitation Act applies to Hansel, then Biniaris's Virginians with Disabilities Act claim must be dismissed, because the Virginians with Disabilities Act does not apply to employers already covered by the Rehabilitation Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n. 4. Third, Hansel argues that both of Biniaris's claims should be dismissed because Biniaris's First Amended Complaint contains only conclusory allegations, and does not sufficiently allege that Biniaris is disabled, or that she was a \"qualified\" individual, as required to state a claim under both the Rehabilitation Act and the Virginians with Disabilities Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To be eligible for relief under Rule 12(c), the moving party must show that\n   its motion is made \"early enough not to delay trial.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Hansel filed its Motion on April 17, 2019, almost four months after Hansel filed its Answer to Biniaris's First Amended Complaint. ECF No. 12; ECF No. 8. The parties have already had a Rule 16(b) scheduling conference, and at the time Hansel filed its Motion the parties were approximately halfway through the discovery process, with trial scheduled to begin on August 20, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11. At this stage of the proceedings, it is not clear that Hansel's Motion was made \"early enough not to delay trial,\" considering the potential delay that would arise if Hansel's Motion was granted and Biniaris was permitted leave to amend her pleadings, thus requiring a new responsive pleading from Hansel and potentially a new Rule 16(b) Scheduling Conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is unnecessary ultimately to resolve this question of timeliness here, because the allegations in Biniaris's First Amended Complaint, accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to Biniaris, sufficiently state a claim for relief under the Rehabilitation Act. However, the timeliness of Hansel's Motion is of concern to the court and is addressed in this Memorandum Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Applicability of the Virginians with Disabilities Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Having concluded that the Rehabilitation Act applies to Hansel, the court must also conclude that the Virginians with Disabilities Act does not apply to Hansel. The Virginians with Disabilities Act specifically provides that it \"shall not apply to employers covered by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\" Va. Code \u00a7 51.5-41(f). Based on the facts in Biniaris's First Amended Complaint, Hansel is covered by the Rehabilitation Act, and so the Virginians with Disabilities Act does not apply to Hansel. Accordingly, Biniaris's Virginians with Disabilities Act claim is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   to file the claim in state court, should it later be determined that the evidence in this case fails to support Biniaris's allegations that the Rehabilitation Act applies to Hansel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sufficiency of Biniaris's Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For its final argument, Hansel argues that Biniaris has failed to sufficiently state a claim for disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. ECF No. 13 at 2. To state a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff terminated from her employment must establish that (1) she has a disability; (2) she is \"otherwise qualified\" for her employment; and (3) she was terminated \"solely\" by reason of her disability.\n   <em>\n    Halpern v.

Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Biniaris, Biniaris's allegations reasonably support a conclusion that Biniaris's injury was permanent in nature, given that Biniaris does not allege any specific time frame that she suffered from the back injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She has also alleged that the injury substantially limited one or more of her life activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Biniaris has pled sufficient facts to state a claim that she was \"disabled\" as the term is defined under the Rehabilitation Act, and Hansel may not seek relief through a Rule 12(c) Motion on these issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Biniaris has also pled sufficient facts to state a claim that she was \"otherwise qualified\" for her employment at Hansel. Under the Rehabilitation Act, \"[a] 'qualified' individual is one 'who, with, or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, ... meets the essential eligibility requirements' for participation in a program or activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Halpern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723788\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/454/#p461\">\n    669 F.3d at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the specific context of employment, a \"qualified\" individual is one who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform all of the essential functions of his or her employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Tyndall v.

Biniaris was injured on February 13, 2018, and on February 20, 2018, she received a revised work schedule due to her injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. She then continued working for Hansel until March 13, 2018, and during that time she alleges that her performance of her job functions met or exceed Hansel's expectations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. She was then terminated, purportedly for taking patient files outside of the office, and for having out-of-office patient visits-and not for any reasons related to her inability to perform essential job functions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, there are no facts before the court that Biniaris was unable to perform any of the essential functions Hansel assigned to her after her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although Biniaris was apparently restricted from performing \"physical\" consulting work following her injury, and although Biniaris alleges that this was an \"essential\" function of her job as a physical therapist, Biniaris has sufficiently alleged that Hansel failed to reasonably accommodate her, thus preventing her from performing this essential function.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; 48-49. To state a claim for failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must allege that (1) she was a qualified person with a disability; (2) the employer had notice of the disability; (3) the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation; and (4) the employer nonetheless refused to make the accommodation.\n   <em>\n    Hannah P. v. Coats\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520178\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/327/#p337\">\n    916 F.3d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (4th Cir. 2019). Biniaris alleges that she requested an accommodation from Hansel on February 20 and 26, 2018, which would have allowed her to perform \"physical\" consulting work despite her injury. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Hansel allegedly refused to accommodate Biniaris, and informed her that she could only return to her \"regular\" employment duties if she was \"released with no restrictions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48-49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on these alleged facts, Biniaris's inability to perform the essential function of \"physical\" consulting work does not prevent her from being consider a \"qualified\" individual, because she has sufficiently alleged that that Hansel failed to make a reasonable accommodation for her to allow her to perform this essential job function. Because Biniaris could allegedly perform all of the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation, she is a \"qualified\" individual under the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, because Biniaris has sufficiently alleged that she has a disability, and that she was a \"qualified\" individual for her position at Hansel, dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(c) is not warranted on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Hansel's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Biniaris's Rehabilitation Act claim goes forward at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court also opines that Hansel may not utilize a Rule 12(c) Motion at this late stage in the proceedings as a substitute for a motion for summary judgment or the discovery process. Biniaris filed her First Amended Complaint on December 11, 2018, and Hansel answered it on December 26, 2018. The Rule 16(b) Scheduling Conference was held on January 28, 2019, and discovery began. Discovery was the appropriate vehicle to ascertain the details and facts of the allegations, and discovery was well ongoing when this tardy Rule 12(c) Motion was filed on April 17, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Clerk is\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to forward a copy of this Memorandum Order to counsel for all parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    On May 14, 2019, Hansel filed a Local Civil Rule 7(E) Notice, indicating that it does not request a hearing on its Motion. ECF No. 16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In its Response to Hansel's Motion, Biniaris treated Hansel's Motion as one seeking summary judgment, ECF No. 14 at 3, and submitted several exhibits in opposition to summary judgment. Hansel has not moved for summary judgment, and discovery was ongoing at the time the Rule 12(c) Motion was filed. Accordingly, the court will not consider Biniaris's exhibits and will restrict its inquiry only to the pleadings, as required under Rule 12(c).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    notes 5, 6, 7, and 8 and accompanying text.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The Rehabilitation Act applies only to discrimination in a \"program or activity.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is not self-evident that Biniaris's employment constitutes a \"program or activity.\" However, the phrase \"program or activity\" is defined for the purposes of the Act to include \"all of the operations of an entire corporation, partnership, or other private organization, or an entire sole proprietorship, which is principally engaged in the business of providing education, health care, housing, social services, or parks and recreation.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3)(A)(ii). In this case, Biniaris alleges that Hansel provides physical therapy and consultation services. Am. Compl. \u00b6 12. Construing this fact in the light most favorable to Biniaris for the purposes of this Motion, the court concludes that Hansel is \"principally engaged\" in the business of providing health care. Therefore, the Rehabilitation Act's prohibition against disability-based discrimination applies to \"all of the operations\" of Hansel, including Biniaris's employment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The court declines to follow\n    <em>\n     Trageser v.
