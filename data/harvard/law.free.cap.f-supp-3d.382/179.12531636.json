Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 24, 2012, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Pereira with violating 21 U.S.C. section 841 (\" section 841\") and 21 U.S.C. section 846 (\" section 846\"). (Docket No. 3 at pp. 3-4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The indictment also charges Pereira with violating 18 U.S.C. section 2 (\" section 2\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 15, 2013, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging, among others, Pereira with conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of sections 841 and 846. (Docket No. 518 at pp. 3-4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The superseding indictment also charges Pereira with aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of section 841 and section 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following unsuccessful plea negotiations, Pereira's trial commenced in March 2014. (Docket No. 1278.) The jury found Pereira guilty of \"[c]onspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five [ ] kilograms or more of cocaine\" and \"[a]iding and abetting in possession with intent to distribute five [ ] kilograms of cocaine,\" in violation of sections 2, 841, and 846. (Docket No. 1445.) Pereira appealed the verdict to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. (Docket No. 1876.) The court of appeals held that the prosecutor's improper questions might have affected the outcome of the trial.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Pereira's First Motions for Change of Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 5, 2018, Pereira joined a co-defendant's motion for change of venue and severance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 2191 and 2197, and filed an independent motion for change of venue. (Docket No. 2193.) In the joint motion, Pereira argued that he \"has resided nearly all his life in the state of New Jersey\" and \"has had nearly no contact with our [Puerto Rico] jurisdiction before the instant charges were filed.\" (Docket No. 2191 at pp. 1-2.) He maintained that \"the alleged relevant events connected to the charged offense took place outside this jurisdiction\" and that \"[i]f the instant criminal case is permitted to remain in our jurisdiction, [Pereira] will be denied the opportunity to both investigate the instant charges as well as ... interview potential witnesses who ... reside outside our jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. According to Pereira, he \"will be placed in an unfair position as it will be unduly onerous, costly and burdensome for [his] potential witnesses to travel and stay in Puerto Rico during the pendency of the instant jury trial,\" and \"[t]his factor would make [his] witnesses unavailable, causing extreme irreparable prejudice to the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Pereira's additional motion for change of venue, he argued that he \"would be deprived of his constitutional rights, including due process, Fifth amendment rights, Sixth amendment rights, and other constitutional rights if he has to defend here in Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 2193 at\n   p. 2.) Pereira asserted that \"[a]ll principal allegations and evidence relevant to [ ] Pereira\" and \"[a]ll potential witnesses, and evidence for the defense of [ ] Pereira are located in New Jersey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.

Pereira asserts the same arguments as he contended in his earlier motions, arguing that he \"would be deprived of his constitutional rights, including due process, Fifth amendment rights, Sixth amendment rights, and other constitutional rights if he has to defend here in Puerto Rico from the allegations contained in the superseding indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.

The government asserts that \"the majority of witnesses who will testify concerning these events are directly tied to Puerto Rico, and they will testify about events that occurred in Puerto Rico as well as New Jersey and elsewhere.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882286\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/177/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The government's physical evidence is located in Puerto Rico, and all legal counsel live in Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882286\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/177/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court is centrally located to all attorneys and investigative agencies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882286\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/177/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, unlike Pereira, the government carries the burden of proof and must present evidence to prevail. The government \"called more than 20 witnesses [in Pereira's original trial], and the majority of these witnesses came from Puerto Rico.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882286\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/177/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The expenses associated with trial would be substantially higher to the government if this case were tried outside of Puerto Rico. Although Pereira's supplemental submissions identify possible defense witnesses who may not be able to travel to Puerto Rico for the new trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 2309 and 2314, the potential absence of those witnesses does not offset the other Rule 21(b) factors that weigh against Pereira's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
