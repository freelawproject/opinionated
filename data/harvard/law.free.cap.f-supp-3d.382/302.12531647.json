However, courts in this district have defined two classes of carriers-direct and indirect-both of which are covered by the Montreal Convention. \"[D]irect air carriers are those who operate aircraft, while indirect air carriers hold out a transportation service to the public under which they utilize the services of a direct carrier for the actual transportation by air.\"\n   <em>\n    Royal Ins. v.

Given these detailed assertions, EIW's conclusory claim that it played \"absolutely no role whatsoever in forwarding or transportation of that cargo,\" Gillespie Decl. at \u00b6 5, is inadequate to support its position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants' argument rests on their single assertion that EIW was not a carrier for this transaction because \"[i]n international aviation transportation, an entity's status as an air carrier is derived from an air waybill.\" Defendants' Memorandum in Support of Pre-Answer Motion for Dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint, Dkt. No. 26 (\"Def. Mem.\"), at 6. But Defendants do not offer a single legal authority that supports the proposition that the air waybill provides the sole, conclusive evidence of an entity's carrier status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even if the Court accepted Defendants' argument, the air waybill at issue in this case supports the conclusion that EIW was an indirect carrier for this transaction. The terms and conditions to the air waybill presented by EXPJapan define carrier as \"all carriers that carry or undertake to carry the cargo hereunder or\n   <em>\n    perform any other services incidental to such air carriage\n   </em>\n   .\" Declaration of Michael E. Stern, Dkt. No. 33 (\"Stern Decl.\"), at Ex. 1 \u00b6 1.1 (emphasis added). The terms and conditions also describe EIW as an indirect carrier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 1 \u00b6 17 (\"Expeditors, like all indirect air carriers ....\"). It is not clear to the Court how-under the definition of carrier provided in the air waybill itself-EIW's role in negotiating the rates for the shipment at issue in this case and providing Plaintiff with documentation regarding that shipment would not qualify as \"perform[ing] ... services incidental to such air carriage.\" Therefore, the Court finds, at this juncture, that Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that EIW was a carrier for the underlying transaction and that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint does not contain a single allegation connecting EIW or EXPJapan to the State of New York. Even a generous reading of Plaintiff's opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss reveals only a handful of averments which relate in any way to the Court's jurisdiction over EXPJapan. Plaintiff points to the two ways in which EIW was involved in the shipment at issue in this case-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , EIW's negotiation and execution of the Global Contract and its issuance of the monthly data file to GE. Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant Expeditors' Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 30 (\"Pls. Mem.\"), at 4. Plaintiff notes that the Global Contract-to which EXPJapan was not a party-contains a provision requiring that all actions \"arising out of or relating to this Contract must be brought in the state of New York.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. It also alleges that EXPJapan is a wholly owned subsidiary of EIW.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. And finally, it claims that \"the terms and conditions of [the] air waybill ... conclusively demonstrate[ ] that Expeditors Japan is acting as agent and on behalf of Expeditors International.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. These alleged facts are simply insufficient to constitute a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that the Court has personal jurisdiction over EXPJapan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff appears to argue that the Court can exercise personal jurisdiction over EXPJapan because EXPJapan was an agent or subsidiary of EIW, over whom the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Global Contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a subsidiary based on its jurisdiction over the parent company only when the subsidiary is an 'alter ego' or 'mere department' of the parent company.\"\n   <em>\n    Fagan v.

Mar. 25, 2011). But the fact that EIW may have been involved in the shipment at issue in this case is a far cry from adequately pleading that EXPJapan is EIW's alter ego. And the terms and conditions of the air waybill say nothing about the relationship between EIW and EXPJapan, other than simply referring to EIW and its subsidiaries and affiliates jointly as \"Expeditors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff claims that \"[w]ithout discovery, motions to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction are construed in plaintiff's favor.\" Pls.

It has not alleged\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   facts that would suggest a relationship between EIW and EXPJapan that would allow the Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over EXPJapan based on its alleged jurisdiction over EIW.

Defendant EXPJapan's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff has sufficiently pled compliance with the Montreal Convention.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants finally argue that the Court must dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for failure to comply with Article 31.2 of the Montreal Convention, which states that \"the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after discovery of the damage, and at the latest, within ... fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo.\" But Defendants' argument ignores the standard for a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Instead of arguing that the allegations in Plaintiff's complaint are insufficient, it instead claims that-as a matter of fact-\"[n]either plaintiff nor GE Medical Systems gave preliminary notice of claim to EXPJapan at all, and gave notice of claim to EIW ... only 18 or 19 days after its receipt of the cargo.\" Def. Mem. at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While Defendants may be correct that Plaintiff was required to provide notice of its dissatisfaction with the condition of the shipment-and that Plaintiff's failure to provide such notice may ultimately bar it from recovery-Defendants have offered no support for the contention that Article 31.2 of the Montreal Convention creates an affirmative pleading standard. Because the Court finds no support for that theory, it will not impose such a pleading standard in this case. Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, EXPJapan's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) is GRANTED and EIW's motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is directed to remove Defendant EXPJapan from the list of active Defendants in this case and to terminate the motion pending at Dkt.
