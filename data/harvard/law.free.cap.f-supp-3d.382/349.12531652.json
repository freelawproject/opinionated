But, ripeness bars Plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief with respect to the method and means of conducting the 2020 Census, at least at this time. The claim will be dismissed without prejudice to being reinstated at a later time. But, Plaintiffs' claim that there are insufficient funds available for the Bureau to conduct the 2020 Census, which, they allege, also will result in an Enumeration Clause violation, may be ripe for declaratory relief (assuming an evidentiary basis exists to support their allegations). And, it is plausible that this Court could fashion declaratory relief that would make it likely that sufficient funds will be appropriated to enable the final planning and execution of the 2020 Census to take place. Therefore, I find that Plaintiffs have standing, and I will deny Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to their insufficient-funding claim for declaratory relief. This claim will proceed, and targeted discovery will be permitted to determine whether there is an evidentiary basis for the declaratory relief they seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Why the Census Is Conducted\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When the United States Constitution was drafted in 1787, the Framers \"believed the correct apportionment of political power would be the 'fundamental ... instrument' of this republican government.\" Robert R.

In 1940, for example, when the undercount for the entire population was 5.4%, the undercount for blacks was estimated at 8.4% (and the undercount for whites at 5.0%). The problem of the differential undercount has persisted even as the census has come to provide a more numerically accurate count of the population. In the 1980 census, for example, the overall undercount was estimated at 1.2%, and the undercount of blacks was estimated at 4.9%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The Census Bureau has recognized the undercount and the differential undercount as significant problems, and in the past has devoted substantial effort toward achieving their reduction. Most recently, in its preparations for the 1990 census, the Bureau initiated an extensive inquiry into various means of overcoming the impact of the undercount and the differential undercount. As part of this effort, the Bureau created two task forces: the Undercount Steering Committee, responsible for planning undercount research and policy development; and the Undercount Research Staff (URS), which conducted research into various methods of improving the accuracy of the census. In addition, the Bureau consulted with state and local governments and various outside experts and organizations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Largely as a result of these efforts, the Bureau adopted a wide variety of measures designed to reduce the rate of error in the 1990 enumeration, including an extensive advertising campaign, a more easily completed census questionnaire, and increased use of automation, which among other things facilitated the development of accurate maps and geographic files for the 1990 census. The Bureau also implemented a number of improvements specifically targeted at eliminating the differential undercount; these included advertising campaigns developed by and directed at traditionally undercounted populations and expanded questionnaire assistance operations for non-English speaking residents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    517 U.S. at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations to record omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2020 Census and Plaintiffs' Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite these considerable concerns about conducting an accurate enumeration, Defendants' preparations and funding to undertake this Herculean task are, in Plaintiffs' view, abysmal.

The argument goes like this: Pursuant to Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, Congress has the authority to conduct the decennial census \"in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.\" Congress, in turn, has delegated the same authority to the Secretary, who \"shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year ... in such form and content as he may determine....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting the breadth of this authority, Defendants insist that the Secretary has absolute discretion over the conduct of the decennial census, and the courts are powerless to review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is hardly surprising that the Defendants make this argument, since, as noted, the Supreme Court also has spoken expansively of the discretion the Secretary enjoys when planning the decennial census. In\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The text of the Constitution vests Congress with virtually unlimited discretion in conducting the decennial \"actual Enumeration,\" and notwithstanding the plethora of lawsuits that inevitably accompany each decennial census, there is no basis for thinking that Congress' discretion is more limited than the text of the Constitution provides. Through the Census Act, Congress has delegated its broad authority over the census to the Secretary [of Commerce]. Hence, so long as the Secretary's conduct of the census is \"consistent with the constitutional language and the constitutional goal of equal representation,\" it is within the limits of the Constitution. In light of the Constitution's broad grant of authority to Congress, the Secretary's decision not to adjust [the results of the 1990 census to account for a differential undercount] need bear only a reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration of the population, keeping in mind the constitutional purpose of the census.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    517 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (internal citations and footnotes omitted). Chief Justice Rehnquist observed that the Supreme Court's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   deference arises not from the highly technical nature of [the Secretary's] decision, but rather from the wide discretion bestowed by the Constitution upon Congress, and by Congress upon the Secretary. Regardless of the Secretary's statistical expertise, it is he to whom Congress has delegated its constitutional authority over the census. For that same reason, the mere fact that the Secretary's decision overruled the views of some of his subordinates is by itself of no moment in any judicial review of his decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, some circuit courts have gone so far as to suggest that there simply is no law that establishes standards by which a court\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   review the Secretary's decision.

There is a little more to the statutes-they specify a timetable, and a procedure for translating fractional into whole seats-but they say nothing about how to conduct a census or what to do about undercounts. So nondirective are the relevant statutes that it is arguable that there is no law for a court to apply in a case like this-that you might as well turn it over to a panel of statisticians and political scientists and let them make the decision, for all that a court could do to add to its rationality or fairness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523575\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/958/1411/#p1417\">\n    958 F.2d 1411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1417-18 (7th Cir. 1992) (internal citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Senate of Cal. v.

Further, the beginning of the 2020 Census is a year or more away. Assuming there is sufficient continued funding appropriated by Congress and signed into law by the President (discussed below), then it is inevitable that many of the alleged deficiencies in staffing, census design, and testing will be addressed and, where deficient, corrected. This case is unlike\n   <em>\n    New York v. U.S. Department of Commerce\n   </em>\n   , which concerned \"final agency action\" that the defendants already had taken in deciding to include the citizenship question. Nos. 18-2921 (JMF) &amp; 18-5025 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p515\">\n    351 F.

Jan. 15, 2019). Here, if the Court were to interject itself into the Bureau's process during the critical final preparations, requiring-as Plaintiffs request-its monitoring and approval of the plans along the way, it is hard to imagine that this oversight would not hinder the process as opposed to facilitate it. Therefore, judicial intervention at this time likely would interfere with further administrative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Benefit of Further Factual Development\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, the Court clearly would benefit from further factual development before being called to evaluate whether the procedures finally approved for the 2020 Census are sufficient to survive an Enumeration Clause challenge (i.e., whether they bear a reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration). For example, completing the testing that the Bureau so far has postponed will provide essential information regarding the accuracy of digital\n   procedures that will be employed in the 2020 Census.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent this information, the Court would be forced to decide based on speculative assumptions advanced by the parties. Assuming adequate funding, the more-than-a-year remaining before the start of the 2020 Census will put to the test the new procedures the Secretary has planned to adopt, and the conduct of the Census itself will result in a preliminary population count that will determine whether the differential undercount that the Plaintiffs fear will adversely affect their federal and local representation and future federal funding. Again, this case stands in stark contrast to\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   , where \"the administrative and trial records\" were \"plainly sufficient to present the issues in a manner fit for judicial decision making.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p515\">\n    351 F.Supp.3d at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20190285\">\n    2019 WL 190285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *89. Therefore, the third element of ripeness also militates against hearing these claims at this time. Further, the inability of the Plaintiffs to cite any decision where a lawsuit such as this one has resulted in the sweeping relief that they seek here (an injunction requiring \"Defendants to propose and implement, subject to this Court's approval and monitoring, a plan to ensure that hard-to-count populations will be actually enumerated in the decennial census,\" Am. Compl. 21), speaks volumes about the authority (not to mention ability) of courts to second-guess the Secretary's planning of the decennial census as it is taking place, or the standards under which they might attempt to do so. Nonetheless, as Defendants themselves concede, Defs.' Reply 9, the fact that this aspect of Plaintiffs' claim is not ripe at present does not mean that it will not be ripe at some point in the future. For that reason, Plaintiffs' challenges to the methods and means the Bureau plans to employ in the 2020 Census will be dismissed without prejudice to being reinstated later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    The One Ripe Claim for Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The fact that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they are entitled to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the relief they seek does not mean that they are not entitled to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of it, assuming they can demonstrate evidentiary support for their allegations. This is because they also challenge the adequacy of the Bureau's funding, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-37, 79, and they also seek declaratory relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. As noted, the Court could issue a declaratory judgment that Congress has failed to appropriate sufficient funds for the Secretary to perform the Constitutionally required \"actual Enumeration\" of the population as of April 1, 2020. Indeed, \"Congress [has] committed [itself] to providing the level of funding that is required to perform the entire range of constitutional census activities, with a particular emphasis on accurately enumerating all individuals who have historically been undercounted.\" 1998 Appropriations Act\n   \u00a7 209(a)(9). Moreover, \"towards this end, Congress expects-(A) aggressive and innovative promotion and outreach campaigns in hard-to-count communities\" and \"(B) the hiring of enumerators from within those communities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unlike the challenge to the methods and means of conducting the 2020 Census, the non-funding claim is ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Notably, Defendants argued at oral argument that the Bureau's work is not disrupted at this time. They insist that \"Plaintiffs' claims are mooted day by day,\" as the Bureau's funding has increased, census centers have opened, a number of operations have been deployed successfully, and the Bureau no longer plans to rely on state administrative records. And, along with their Supplement, Defendants filed an affidavit from a Census Bureau official, ostensibly to show that the Bureau has funding. Reist Decl., ECF No. 61-1. But, as discussed, argument of counsel and the Reist Declaration are inappropriate for consideration in ruling on a motion to dismiss, where the facts that the Court may consider are circumscribed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Kerns v.

While Defendants are correct that the Court may take judicial notice of facts (if permitted by Fed. R. Evid. 201 ) in deciding a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Supp. 10-11, I agree with Plaintiffs that neither the Reist Declaration nor the appendix included with Defendants' Supplemental Memorandum may be judicially noticed.

For this reason, prior census cases, including Judge Furman's decision in the Southern District of New York, have held that such filings are evidence, appropriate for consideration on summary judgment but not on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v.

Given what must be done in 2019 to keep on track, this evidence actually demonstrates that there is a justiciable claim as to sufficiency of funding given the government shutdown (the longest in the nation's history, and still looming like a Damoclean sword if the three-week extension of a continuing resolution fails to result in congressional appropriation of lasting funding that is signed into law by the President\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   and appropriations lapse. While Plaintiffs' other claims could be addressed through post-census litigation, census funding obviously cannot be increased after the fact. Moreover, the federal government shutdown recent ended through a continuing resolution that only allows the Bureau to continue with already-funded operations for three weeks, but adds no additional funding beyond that already appropriated. Thus, given the prediction that, even by Defendants' estimate, current census funding will run out by April 2019 (if not earlier)-a full year before the 2020 Census-, \"delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry\n   </em>\n   , 523 U.S. at 733,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504230\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/726/#p732\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, \"judicial intervention\" would not \"inappropriately interfere with further administrative action\"-it will require no more than elementary school arithmetic to demonstrate (from the Bureau's existing estimates) what funds are needed to complete the 2020 Census, and the shortfall the funding lapse has caused. Finally, narrowly targeted discovery that will not unduly interfere with the Bureau's preparations (while the current funding lasts) will accomplish whatever factual development is needed of the impact of the lapse of funding.
