The Court has carefully considered the Motion, Plaintiff Shawn Cheshire (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Cheshire\")'s Opposition [DE 24], Defendant's Reply [DE 25], and the record in this case. The Court held oral argument on the Motion on June 14, 2019. The Court is otherwise fully advised in the premises. For the reasons stated herein, the Court will grant the Motion to Compel Arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 15, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this action against Defendant for noncompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201281\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (\"ADAAG\"), 28 C.F.R. Part 36. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA and ADAAG through its failure and refusal to adequately enforce its existing policies and procedures, as well as its failure to implement appropriate new policies, procedures, and auxiliary aids for the visually impaired. Thus, Plaintiff alleges Defendant has prohibited her from safe and independent use of Defendant's facilities and has excluded her from the benefits and services offered by Defendant. [DE 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's claims relate to her membership at LA Fitness, which is governed by a Membership Agreement (\"Agreement\") containing written terms and conditions, including an arbitration provision. The Agreement was signed electronically by Gregory Anderson (\"Anderson\"), Plaintiff's significant other, while Plaintiff was present. It is undisputed that, after signing, Anderson received a hard copy of the document. [DE 24-5] at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant now moves to enforce the arbitration provision and compel arbitration, arguing that Plaintiff manifested her assent by allowing Anderson to sign the Agreement on her behalf. In response, Plaintiff argues that (1) she did not unambiguously manifest her assent to the\n   Agreement and did not authorize Anderson to act as her agent, therefore making the contract as a whole invalid; (2) she did not have sufficient notice of waiver of the right to proceed in a judicial forum, thus making enforcement of the arbitration provision unconscionable; and (3) Defendant waived any right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , places an agreement to arbitration on equal footing with all other contracts and reflects a \"liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    CompuCredit Corp. v.

In response, Plaintiff does not dispute that Anderson received a hard copy of the Agreement nor that she used Defendant's facilities. Instead, Plaintiff argues that she did not manifest her assent to the Agreement because Anderson was not authorized to sign a membership agreement on her behalf, and she believed the agreement to be for recurring purchase fees only and not a membership. Further, Plaintiff argues that Defendant waived its right to enforce the arbitration provision through participation in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Whether apparent authority exists depends on a third party's reasonable belief that \"a particular person...has authority to enter into negotiations or to make representations to his agent\" based on conduct by the principal.\n   <em>\n    Lowell Hous.

Here, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court concludes that it was reasonable for Defendant's employee to assume Anderson's apparent agency and authorization to sign the Membership Agreement on Plaintiff's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff stated that she was at LA Fitness to process her membership, but that she was never specifically asked to sign a membership agreement. Plaintiff and Anderson both stated that Anderson was present to pay for Plaintiff's membership by having the recurring fees charged to his card, and also to walk Plaintiff through her workout. They did not verbally or through writing request or inform Defendant's employee that Anderson was going to sign any documents on Plaintiff's behalf or that Anderson was authorized to represent Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, they demonstrated this assent through their actions. Plaintiff asked to join LA Fitness and stated that Anderson, who accompanied her, would be paying for her membership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Anderson stated and held out that his role was that of payor for the membership. Defendant's employee observed that Plaintiff allowed Anderson to sign and initial, in her presence, his own name and initials in the membership contract. Anderson initialed the arbitration provision itself. After Anderson signed the contract, Defendant gave him a hard copy of the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon drawing inferences from the circumstances, the LA Fitness employee could have reasonably believed Anderson had the \"authority to represent the alleged principal [ (Plaintiff) ] in regard to the transaction in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20155\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20155\">\n    at 190-191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.
