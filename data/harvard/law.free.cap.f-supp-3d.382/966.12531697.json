The United States opposes the motions filed by Padilla and Mendez (hereafter, \"Defendants\"). (ECF No. 43.) The Court held a hearing on the motions on December 6, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50.) For the reasons articulated on the record during that hearing, and for the reasons set forth in this Order, the Court DENIES the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Along with Defendant Jose Luis Romero, Padilla was charged in Count One of an Indictment, issued on April 19, 2018, with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 846 ; and was charged in Counts Two, Three, and Four of the Indictment with distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (ECF No. 19 at 1-3.) Mendez was charged in Counts One, Three, and Four of the Indictment. (ECF No. 19 at 1-3.) The government, on November 1, 2018, dismissed Count Three of the Indictment as to Padilla and Mendez only. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38.) Padilla filed the instant motion to suppress on October 9, 2018. (ECF No. 36.) Mendez filed a joinder to Padilla's motion that set forth additional arguments applicable to Mendez only. (ECF No. 39.) Mendez subsequently pleaded guilty to Count One of the Indictment, and his sentencing hearing is currently pending. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81; ECF No. 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    i. November 27, 2017 Application for Tracking Warrant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During an investigation into methamphetamine distribution in the Sacramento area, a special agent for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") named Amie Anderson applied to a magistrate judge on November 27, 2017, for a warrant to install a global positioning system (\"GPS\") tracking device on a 1996 Chevrolet Impala with California license plate 6FZU625. (ECF No. 36 at 7; ECF No. 39-1 at 2-10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Agent Anderson's application identified the driver of the Impala as an individual named Anthony Blanks, who was present during an alleged narcotics transaction involving Romero. (ECF No. 36 at 7; ECF No. 39-1 at 6-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    ii. April 9, 2018 Probable Cause Affidavit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following months of subsequent investigation of the suspected drug trafficking organization, including law enforcement observations generated from the tracking device installed on the Impala (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 9), Agent Anderson swore out a probable cause affidavit on April 6, 2018, which was filed with the Court on April 9, 2018 (ECF No. 1, Apr. 9, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This affidavit was made in support of search warrants for three residential properties in Sacramento, California; a gray Nissan Murano with California license plate 7WGS486; and the Impala. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 1, Apr. 9, 2018.) Agent Anderson's affidavit was also made in support of a criminal complaint as well as arrest warrants for\n   Romero, Mendez, and Blanks. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 2, Apr. 9, 2018.) The affidavit identified Romero as \"a pound-level methamphetamine distributor in the Sacramento area\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 10, Apr. 9, 2018), named Mendez as one of Romero's suppliers and the owner of the Murano (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 72, Apr. 9, 2018), and named Blanks as another of Romero's suppliers and the registered owner of the Impala (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18, Apr. 9, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Agent Anderson's April 9 affidavit included the following information. On October 24, 2017, a confidential source working for federal law enforcement agencies initiated a request for a controlled purchase of methamphetamine from Romero, with the transaction scheduled to occur the following day around noon. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 13, Apr. 9, 2018.) Ten minutes before the controlled drug purchase was set to occur on October 25, federal agents observed the Impala arrive at Romero's home, where its driver met with Romero. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 16, Apr. 9, 2018.) The Impala and its driver departed from Romero's residence prior to the controlled purchase, which took place at around 12:25 p.m., and appeared to conduct counter-surveillance maneuvers before parking at 5120 25th Street in Sacramento. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19-20, Apr. 9, 2018.) At the time of the affidavit, the Impala was registered to Anthony Blanks at 7390 Cranston Way in Sacramento. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 18, Apr. 9, 2018.) About half an hour following the confidential informant's controlled purchase of methamphetamine from Romero, the Impala and its driver returned to Romero's residence and picked up Romero. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, Apr. 9, 2018.) Three minutes later, law enforcement agents observed the Impala parked at an O'Reilly Auto Parts store a short distance away on Fruitridge Road. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 22, Apr. 9, 2018.) Romero went inside the store while the Impala's driver initially stayed inside the vehicle. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 22, Apr. 9, 2018.) While the driver remained inside the Impala, a Sacramento Police Department patrol officer contacted the driver. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 22, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following this apparently uncoordinated and unexpected local law enforcement contact (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 24, Apr. 9, 2018), the Impala's driver joined Romero inside the auto parts store (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 22, Apr. 9, 2018). A federal law enforcement agent then took \"several digital photos of both subjects\" while they were inside the store. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 23, Apr. 9, 2018.) After this surveillance concluded, \"BLANKS was identified as the driver of the Impala based on an agent's observations and comparison with a DMV photo of BLANKS.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 23, Apr. 9, 2018.) Federal agents then corroborated their identification of Blanks as the person driving the Impala that day by speaking with the Sacramento Police Department dispatcher who recorded the patrol officer's contact with the Impala's driver while it was parked outside the O'Reilly Auto Parts store. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 24, Apr. 9, 2018.) The Sacramento Police Department not only confirmed that Blanks was the Impala's driver at the time of the contact, but also informed federal agents that Blanks was a member of Sacramento's Norte\u00f1o street gang. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 24, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Federal agents continued to monitor the man they had identified as Blanks and observed him, along with Romero and Mendez, engage in numerous subsequent activities suggestive of an active conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Specifically, agents observed this individual drive the Impala to and from Romero's residence just prior to controlled methamphetamine purchases from Romero on December 4, 2017. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 32-42, Apr. 9, 2018.) The individual identified as Blanks drove the Impala at times of day consistent with his having received telephonic\n   contact from Romero \"several times near the time of the controlled purchase.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 45, Apr. 9, 2018.) The same is largely true of law enforcement observation of the individual identified as Blanks on February 13, 2018, with the addition on this date of Mendez appearing to act as a courier between the individual identified as Blanks and Romero. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 49-56, Apr. 9, 2018.) Federal agents also concluded that the individual they identified as Blanks tried to hide his Impala from law enforcement detection by covering it with a tarp at an address other than his primary residence. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 69, Apr. 9, 2018.) And on March 6, 2018, as Agent Anderson was surveilling the man she believed to be Blanks, that individual approached her and took a photograph or video of her with his phone. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 70, Apr. 9, 2018.) The individual thought to be Blanks then followed Agent Anderson's vehicle for about half a mile after she terminated surveillance. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 71, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The DEA subpoenaed records of various cellular phone numbers that communicated with Romero at times which suggested that the owner of the numbers was coordinating methamphetamine distribution with Romero. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 81-85, Apr. 9, 2018.) The subscriber account for each of these numbers contained some variation of the name \"Nick Cole\" along with a mailing address that contained some variation of the number thirty-eight. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 81-85, Apr. 9, 2018.) Agent Anderson averred that based on her training and experience, she believed that these cellular phone numbers were used by the person who agents had identified as Blanks. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 86, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The magistrate judge who reviewed Agent Anderson's affidavit found that it established probable cause,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to search the residence of the individual identified as Blanks (5120 25th Street in Sacramento) and to arrest the individual thought to be Blanks. (ECF No. 1 at 24, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Warrant Execution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Federal law enforcement agents executed the warrant to search 5120 25th Street on April 10, 2018; however, when they encountered the individual they believed to be Blanks inside the residence, they discovered that his name was not actually Anthony Blanks. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 11, Apr. 10, 2018; ECF No. 43 at 2.) Instead, following some initial confusion, the individual inside the residence at 5120 25th Street identified himself as Salvador Padilla. (ECF No. 43 at 2.) \"[O]nly then did the agents realize that the man they had been following on surveillance for six months and believed was Anthony Blanks was actually Salvador Padilla.\" (ECF No. 43 at 2.) The federal agents executing the warrants nonetheless arrested Padilla, \"based on probable cause that he had committed various offenses of the federal criminal code.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 93, Apr. 10, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    iv. April 10, 2018 Probable Cause Affidavit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That same day, following execution of the warrants for which she had previously applied, Agent Anderson swore out a new probable cause affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant issued for Padilla. (ECF No. 1 at 21, Apr. 10, 2018.) The April 10 affidavit attributed substantially the same conduct to Padilla as the affidavit filed the day before had attributed to Blanks. Specifically, the April 10 affidavit set forth law enforcement's observation of multiple contacts Padilla had with Romero both before and after Romero sold a pound of methamphetamine to an undercover agent on October 25, 2017, including almost the same sequence of subsequent events involving Padilla, Romero, the Sacramento Police Department patrol officer, and the O'Reilly Auto\n   Parts store on Fruitridge Road with the exception of any reference to the Norte\u00f1o gang. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-28, Apr. 10, 2018.) The April 10 affidavit also described: (i) multiple contacts Padilla had with Romero both before and after Romero sold a pound of methamphetamine to an undercover agent on December 4, 2017 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 36-50, Apr. 10, 2018); (ii) multiple contacts Padilla had with Romero and Mendez prior to another controlled methamphetamine purchase from Romero on February 13, 2018 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 51-63, Apr. 10, 2018); (iii) Padilla's attempts to evade law enforcement surveillance and detection by moving the Impala to a location other than his residence and by covering it with a tarp (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 71, Apr. 10, 2018); (iv) Padilla's efforts to record and follow Agent Anderson as she surveilled him on March 6, 2018 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 72-73, Apr. 10, 2018); and (v) the strategy of attempting to evade digital detection through the use of multiple cellular phone numbers registered to a variant of the name \"Nick Cole\" at different Sacramento-area addresses, all of which contained a variant of the number thirty-eight (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 83-88, Apr. 10, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, Agent Anderson did more than simply replace every instance of the name \"Blanks\" in the April 9 affidavit with the name \"Padilla\" in the April 10 affidavit. The April 10 affidavit stated that federal law enforcement agents obtained independent evidence during their execution of the search warrant at 5120 25th Street suggesting that Padilla was, in fact, the person previously believed to be named Blanks. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 94, Apr. 10, 2018.) This evidence included: (i) the fact that Padilla was renting a bedroom inside 5120 25th Street for $ 450 per month in cash; (ii) the certificate of title for the Impala, issued to Blanks and located inside Padilla's bedroom; (iii) Padilla's driver license, located inside the bedroom; and (iv) one of the cellular phones that agents had been tracking, also located inside the bedroom. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 94, Apr. 10, 2018.) The cellular phone in question rang from underneath the sheets of Padilla's bed when Agent Anderson dialed a number that she knew to be registered to an account in the name of Nick Colt in Sacramento, and that had been used to communicate with Romero around the time a government agent asked Romero if he could purchase two pounds of methamphetamine. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 81-82, 94, Apr. 10, 2018.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Agent Anderson's April 10 affidavit requested the issuance of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant for Padilla, which was granted that same day. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 95, Apr. 10, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    i. Defendants' Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Characterizing it as fruit from a poisonous tree, Padilla filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained against him that derived from the initial warrant to track the Impala that had been based on the misidentification of Padilla as Blanks. (ECF No. 36 at 9.) Padilla argues that either (i) \"the identification of Mr. Blanks by his DMV photo was accurate, in which case Mr. Padilla should not have been arrested,\" or else (ii) \"the identification of Mr. Blanks was inaccurate and false (as the subsequent affidavit claims) and cannot form the basis for the warrant - much less probable cause to arrest Mr. Padilla.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (ECF No. 36 at 7.) According to Padilla, all the evidence obtained from the warrants reliant upon the agents' misidentification of Padilla as Blanks must be suppressed because the original warrant to track the Impala was only issued on the basis of probable cause that depended on this false identification. (ECF No. 36 at 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Padilla also argues that pursuant to legal principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to probe the factual background of agents' misidentification of him as Blanks. (ECF No. 36 at 3-4 (\"A defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if s/he 'makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Craigshead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3119145\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/1073/#p1080\">\n    539 F.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1080-81 [sic] (9th Cir. 2008))).) Padilla argues that the correct identity of the individual driving the Impala throughout the agents' surveillance of this drug trafficking organization was \"plainly material\" to the magistrate judge's finding of probable cause in the April 9 affidavit. (ECF No. 36 at 4.) Padilla also argues that this misidentification was reckless because law enforcement agents failed to take certain steps to verify that they had correctly identified the Impala's driver as Blanks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 5 (\"There is no evidence that the agents ever attempted to go to 7390 Cranston Way, the known address of Mr. Blanks.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Padilla's co-defendant, Mendez, filed a motion a short time later that joined in Padilla's suppression motion. (ECF No. 39 at 1.) Mendez's motion asks the Court to \"traverse the [November 2017] mobile tracking warrant and suppress all evidence collected against Mendez as a result of the DEA's use of the mobile tracking device.\" (ECF No. 39 at 5.) Mendez argues that the Court should suppress \"any observation and surveillance intel gathered against Mendez as a result of knowing the Impala's location on relevant dates and times, including any evidence collected on February 13, 2018.\" (ECF No. 39 at 5-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Government's Opposition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government filed a single opposition to both motions in which it disputes Defendants' argument that the misidentification of Padilla as Blanks was an intentional or reckless error. (ECF No. 43.) The government instead characterizes the misidentification as a mere mistake that does not mandate a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   evidentiary hearing. (ECF No. 43 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Specifically, the government points out that \"any misidentification of the two men was reasonable\" because Padilla and Blanks are similar in \"height, weight, build, and age.\" (ECF No. 43 at 6.) In support of that argument, the government points the Court's attention to the following images: a California Department of Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\") database image of Blanks (ECF No. 43-1 at 1, 54); an image of Padilla's California driver license (ECF No. 43-1 at 1, 56); and a surveillance image of Padilla and Romero taken by law enforcement agents on October 25, 2017, while the two men were inside the O'Reilly Auto Parts store on Fruitridge Road (ECF No. 43-1 at 1, 58). The government also argues that even if Padilla had been correctly identified in Agent Anderson's original probable cause affidavit, that affidavit would still have supplied probable cause to support the warrants approved by the magistrate judge. (ECF No. 43 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court held a hearing on Defendants' suppression motions on December 6, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50.) The Court heard compelling oral argument from both sides, expressed doubt that the warrants must be suppressed as violative of the Fourth Amendment, and took the matter under submission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    iv. Subsequently Filed Investigator Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Following the December 6, 2018 hearing, Padilla filed a report from a private investigator named Robert Hessee. (ECF No. 53.) Hessee's report sets forth the content of an interview Hessee conducted with Blanks on September 15, 2018, in which Blanks told Hessee that he has known Padilla for many years, that Blanks owns the Impala at issue in this case, and that Blanks drove it frequently between October 2017 and March 2018. (ECF No. 53-1 at 1.) According to Hessee's report, Blanks does remember driving to the O'Reilly Auto Parts store on Fruitridge Road, but \"does not remember the specific date that he drove the car to and from O'Reilly auto parts.\" (ECF No. 53-1 at 1.) Finally, Blanks's statement to Hessee disclaims any previous gang contact or affiliation as well as any knowledge of the name \"Nick Cole\" that was used to register the multiple cellular phones that agents tracked over the course of the investigation. (ECF No. 53-1 at 1.) The Hessee report contains information that Padilla stated he would introduce into evidence through live testimony in the event of a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. (ECF No. 53 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Fourth Amendment states that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. The Supreme Court has clearly articulated the procedure to be followed when, as here, a defendant brings a Fourth Amendment challenge to a law enforcement officer's probable cause affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant's request. In the event that at that hearing the allegation of perjury or reckless disregard is established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, and, with the affidavit's false material set to one side, the affidavit's remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. at 155-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"A defendant is entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing only if he makes a two-fold showing: intentional or reckless inclusion or omission, and materiality.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The driver of the Impala identified himself as Blanks to a Sacramento Police Department officer during an apparently unrelated proactive contact with the driver (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 24, Apr. 9, 2018), a proactive contact that occurred on the same day that federal agents observed the driver engage in activity consistent with narcotics distribution (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 16-21, Apr. 9, 2018). Furthermore, Padilla's appearance on October 25, 2017, was consistent with the data regarding Blanks's appearance in the DMV database that agents used to make their initial erroneous identification. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 23, Apr. 9, 2018.) The DMV database listed Blanks as five feet, eleven inches tall and weighing more than 200 pounds. (ECF No. 43-1 at 54.) The database further demonstrated that Blanks had a shaved head at the time his photograph was taken. (ECF No. 43-1 at 54.) Padilla's physical appearance at the time he was photographed with Romero inside the O'Reilly Auto Parts store on October 25, 2017, was similar in that he appeared to be about six feet tall and over 200 pounds. (ECF No. 43-1 at 56, 58.) While not entirely bald, Padilla's hair was not so outgrown on this date that it would have caused a reasonable person to question whether Padilla was a different man from the individual in the driver's license he provided to local law enforcement. (ECF No. 43-1 at 56, 58; ECF No. 1 \u00b6 24, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court also notes that it has observed Padilla in person more than once, and has compared his in-court appearance to the DMV database image of Blanks that the DEA agents used to identify him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 6; ECF No. 43-1 at 54.) Padilla's appearance is more than sufficiently similar to Blanks's DMV image such that a reasonable person could believe they are one and the same individual. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43-1 at 54,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43-1 at 58);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera v.

It was negligence, not reckless disregard for the truth, for the affiant in that case to overstate the number of the\n   defendant's prior drug convictions because the affiant \"simply did not know how to read the California rap sheets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545386,10545339\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/701/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A rap sheet is composed of objective conviction data which yields a binary answer to the question of how many prior convictions are associated with a particular defendant. While it is true that the question of whether Padilla is the person depicted on Blanks's driver license also yields a binary answer, the visual information that Agent Anderson and her colleagues interpreted in misidentifying Padilla as Blanks is much more subjective and open to varying degrees of interpretation than is the information on a criminal rap sheet. It includes data points like skin tone, eye placement, hair style, body weight, and height. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43-1 at 54, 56, 58.) If it was not reckless disregard for the truth for the\n   <em>\n    Dozier\n   </em>\n   affiant to misinterpret objective data contained in a defendant's printed criminal history, it was not reckless for the DEA team in this case to arrive at an inaccurate identification based on visual data that is more subjective and calls for more nuanced interpretive conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Furthermore, Agent Anderson is not the only person who misidentified Padilla as Blanks. The Sacramento Police Department officer who contacted the Impala's driver on October 25, 2017, appeared to make the same mistake Agent Anderson did. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 24, Apr. 9, 2018.) So did the other federal agents on surveillance that day. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 23, Apr. 9, 2018;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 2.) This distinguishes the instant case from\n   <em>\n    Chesher\n   </em>\n   , on which Defendants rely. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 5.) The reckless disregard for the truth in\n   <em>\n    Chesher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1470623\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/678/1353/#p1362\">\n    678 F.2d at 1360-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , came from the affiant's failure to uncover the facts about the defendant's Hells Angels membership despite the affiant speaking with another law enforcement officer who knew those facts and had written a report incorporating those facts. Contrastingly, Defendants in the instant case present no evidence that any law enforcement agent knew of Padilla's correct identity at the time of Agent Anderson's April 9 affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. at 155-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring a defendant's offer of proof of reckless disregard at this stage to be \"substantial\"). And while\n   <em>\n    Chesher\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that such proof is a prerequisite for a finding of reckless disregard, the fact that there is zero evidence that any non-affiant officer had knowledge of Padilla's correct identity undermines\n   <em>\n    Chesher\n   </em>\n   's applicability here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, Apr. 9, 2018.) Along the same lines, the fact that Agent Anderson simply made the same mistake that an unaffiliated Sacramento Police Department officer made further undercuts Defendants' contention that the misidentification of Padilla as Blanks had a sinister motive or was driven purely by a desire to effectuate an arrest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Application of the Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Burnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1677977\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/816/1354/#p1358\">\n    816 F.2d at 1357-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , also compels the Court's conclusion. The reckless disregard for the truth found in\n   <em>\n    Burnes\n   </em>\n   was a product of the affiant including in a probable cause affidavit information about the frequency of vehicle visits to a suspected drug distributor's house - information that was directly contradicted by a written investigation report prepared by the same agency to which the affiant belonged.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1677977\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/816/1354/#p1358\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the instant case, there is no evidence that anyone within the DEA - or within the Sacramento Police Department, for that matter - possessed information contrary to what Agent Anderson and her colleagues believed regarding the identity of the Impala's driver. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, Apr. 9, 2018.) Indeed, all the agents associated with the DEA and the Sacramento Police Department came to the same conclusion that Blanks was the Impala's driver on October 25, 2017. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, Apr. 9,\n   2018.)

Though the affiant certainly could have done more investigatory work to discern whether the bottle did, in fact, contain ephedrine, the affidavit still withstood a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   challenge because \"the conclusion as to the contents of the bottle was made based on the observations and the combined experience of two veteran narcotics investigators.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1677977\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/816/1354/#p1358\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1677977\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/816/1354/#p1358\">\n    at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Agent Anderson's repeated misidentification of Blanks as the Impala's driver was also based on conclusions derived from her own observations and from those of fellow law enforcement officers. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, Apr. 9, 2018.) While the surveillance team could have done more to \"check[ ] or record[ ] the facts relevant to [Agent Anderson's] probable cause determination\" by re-verifying its identification of Blanks every time he appeared during the team's surveillance, their failure to do so does not make Agent Anderson more reckless than the affiant in\n   <em>\n    Burnes\n   </em>\n   who similarly could have engaged in more investigatory spadework prior to concluding that ephedrine was probably in the bottle he observed.\n   <em>\n    Burnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1677977\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/816/1354/#p1358\">\n    816 F.2d at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Ninth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Garcia\n   </em>\n   compels the same conclusion.

The affidavit in that case was not made\n   recklessly because the probable cause it established was based on other pieces of reliable data, such as tips from informants who had visited the residence multiple times and corroboration through official police and driving records,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038967\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/1205/#p1214\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and \"[l]aw enforcement officers acting in reasonable reliance on [such information] need not track down every piece of information that might potentially be relevant before filing a warrant affidavit,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038967\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/1205/#p1214\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038967\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/1205/#p1214\">\n    at 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even if Agent Anderson harbored doubts that Blanks was the Impala's driver being surveilled by the DEA team in late 2017 and early 2018 - and there is no evidence she did have any such doubts until the warrants were executed in April 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 2) - the fact that the team's initial identification of the driver was based on informant tips (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 12, Apr. 9, 2018) and official driving records (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23, Apr. 9, 2018) meant that the team was under no subsequent obligation to go searching for information that might undercut its initial identification,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038967\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/1205/#p1214\">\n    397 F.3d at 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hessee Investigation Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Nothing in the report from Robert Hessee (ECF No. 53-1) alters the above conclusions. The most the Hessee report establishes is the theoretical possibility that law enforcement agents may have observed the true Anthony Blanks, instead of the true Salvador Padilla who agents mistakenly thought was Blanks, driving the Impala on October 25, 2017. (ECF No. 53-1 at 1 (stating that Blanks owns the Impala in question, drove it frequently between October 2017 and March 2018, and may have driven it to the O'Reilly Auto Parts store on October 25, 2017, but cannot remember specifically whether he did so).) This report, which presumably represents Padilla's most convincing evidence that it may have actually been Blanks - not Padilla misidentified as Blanks - who agents observed on October 25, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53 at 1 (\"Should the Court have granted an evidentiary hearing, the defense would have sought to introduce this information [contained in the Hessee report] through witnesses.\"), is certainly not a \"substantial\" preliminary showing of reckless disregard for the truth sufficient to merit an evidentiary hearing,\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For as the Court previously noted, it has had ample opportunity to compare Padilla's in-court appearance with the photograph taken of Padilla inside the O'Reilly Auto Parts store on October 25, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43-1 at 58), and finds that there can be no reasonable dispute that Padilla is that person. Accordingly, even if Blanks did attest that he definitely drove his Impala to the O'Reilly Auto Parts store at some point on October 25, 2017 - which, of course, Blanks does not do (ECF No. 53-1 at 1 (\"Anthony does not remember the specific date that he drove the car to and from O'Reilly auto parts....\")) - the Court would still find that the person agents observed engaging in activities suggestive of narcotics distribution on that date (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 25-26, Apr. 9, 2018), and thereafter photographed inside the O'Reilly Auto Parts store (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 23, Apr. 9, 2018; ECF No. 43-1 at 58), was Padilla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, to the extent Padilla proffered the Hessee report to demonstrate that the DEA team may have unwittingly observed the true Anthony Blanks during the controlled purchases that occurred on December 4, 2017, and February 13, 2018, the report again fails to rise to the required level of being a \"substantial\" preliminary showing that agents' misidentification of their target on those dates was reckless.\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Hessee report states that Blanks drove his Impala to \"places like DMV, smog check, and does remember O'Reilly auto parts.\" (ECF No. 53-1 at 1.) Nowhere does Blanks suggest that on December 4, 2017, he may have driven the Impala from Padilla's residence to Romero's residence at 2930 32nd Avenue in Sacramento, to the Michoacano restaurant on Franklin Boulevard, or to the taqueria on the northwest corner of Franklin Boulevard and Fruitridge Road, each of which are locations where surveillance teams saw the Impala on that day prior to Romero selling methamphetamine to an undercover agent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 35-42, Apr. 9, 2018.) Nor does Blanks intimate that on February 13, 2018, he could have driven the Impala from Padilla's residence to any of the locations where Padilla was observed interacting with Romero or riding in Mendez's vehicle prior to another controlled methamphetamine purchase. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52, 54-58, Apr. 9, 2018.) Finally, nowhere in the Hessee report does Blanks imply that he was ever at the location on Sunrise Mist Way where, on March 6, 2018, agents saw the individual they thought was Blanks allegedly attempting\n   to hide the Impala from law enforcement surveillance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 67-71, Apr. 9, 2018.) Just because Blanks may have driven the Impala to the DMV, to get a smog test, or to O'Reilly Auto Parts over a five-month period (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53-1 at 1) says next to nothing about whether he may have been in the Impala on the specific days and at the specific locations set forth in Agent Anderson's probable cause affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This conclusion is underscored by the fact that the Hessee report reveals no connection between Blanks and the cellular phone numbers that Agent Anderson's affidavit connected to Romero and Padilla. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53-1 at 1 (\"Anthony Blanks does not know and has never heard of 'Nick Cole.' \").) These numbers were central to the affidavit's factual predicate establishing probable cause because of the frequency and temporal proximity with which they communicated with Romero while agents observed the individual they thought was Blanks coming and going from Romero's residence around the time Romero sold methamphetamine to an undercover agent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 43-48, 81-86, Apr. 9, 2018.) That Blanks had nothing to do with these cellular phone numbers makes it even less likely - indeed, vanishingly so - that agents actually saw the true Anthony Blanks do the things that Agent Anderson's April 10 affidavit eventually attributed to the true Salvador Padilla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Thus, concluding that the evidence from the Hessee report merits a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether Agent Anderson's affidavit recklessly identified Padilla as Blanks would eviscerate the requirement that Padilla first make a \"substantial preliminary showing,\"\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that agents' misidentification of Padilla was made with a \"high degree of awareness of probable falsity,\"\n   <em>\n    Senchenko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22311\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1153/#p1158\">\n    133 F.3d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    iv.

Evidence of Padilla's Participation in Narcotics Trafficking Conspiracy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Excised of the information relating to the misidentification of Padilla as Blanks, Agent Anderson's affidavit sets forth facts that are sufficient to establish probable cause that evidence of narcotics crimes would be found at the locations and in the vehicles listed within it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1\n   \u00b6 1, Apr. 9, 2018.) This is because, following the DEA team's initial misidentification of the Impala's driver as Blanks, the \"Blanks\" moniker acted as merely a shorthand label that Agent Anderson's affidavit used to refer to the individual that she and her colleagues observed engaging in multiple activities consistent with illegal narcotics trafficking. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 7 (\"The information [in the April 10, 2018 probable cause affidavit] was virtually the same beyond the agent changing the name Anthony Blanks to Salvador Padilla in every instance....\").) The evidence is clear that this particular person - whether referred to as \"Blanks,\" \"Padilla,\" \"driver of a 1996 Chevrolet Impala with distinctive rims,\" \"O'Reilly Auto Parts customer photographed by DEA agents on October 25, 2017,\" or by any other label - is the individual the DEA team surveilled who played a central role in the targeted drug distribution conspiracy. There is simply nothing specific to Anthony Blanks that was material to the probable cause established by Agent Anderson's affidavit, which stated that the DEA team began surveilling the Impala and its driver based on a reliable tip from an informant that the team's target - Romero - received his drugs from a supplier who drove the Impala and lived in Romero's neighborhood. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 12, Apr. 9, 2018.) The DEA team was not alerted to the Impala's importance because it was registered in Blanks's name or at an address associated with Blanks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16-17, Apr. 9, 2018 (describing the DEA team's initial contact with the then-unidentified driver of the Impala).) Following this initial tip, the Impala's driver's actions - not his name or criminal history or whether he was associated with a gang (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 24, 30-31, Apr. 9, 2018) - created the probable cause to believe that he was involved in a narcotics distribution conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Specifically, on October 25, 2017, the Impala's driver left his residence at 5120 25th Street and drove to Romero's residence ten minutes prior to a scheduled controlled purchase of methamphetamine from Romero by the DEA team's informant. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, Apr. 9, 2018.) Romero and the Impala's driver met with one another at Romero's residence. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 16, Apr. 9, 2018.) After this brief meeting with Romero, the Impala's driver engaged in counter-surveillance driving maneuvers on his way back to his residence at 5120 25th Street. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20, Apr. 9, 2018.) The DEA's informant purchased methamphetamine from Romero shortly after that. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 19, Apr. 9, 2018.) The Impala's driver then returned to Romero's residence in the Impala, picked up Romero, and the two of them went to the O'Reilly Auto Parts store together. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, Apr. 9, 2018.) All this occurred on the same day that Romero and a phone number falsely registered to \"Nick Cole\" engaged in extensive communications in close temporal proximity to the controlled purchase. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 43, Apr. 9, 2018.) Agent Anderson's affidavit stated that based on her training and experience, \"individuals who traffic in narcotics often provide false names when subscribing telephone numbers to avoid law enforcement detection.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 26, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Much the same occurred on December 4, 2017. Following a request for drugs from an undercover agent to Romero (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, Apr. 9, 2018), Romero communicated with a phone number falsely registered to \"Nick Cole\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 44-46, Apr. 9, 2018) around the same time the Impala's driver left his residence at 5120 25th Street and drove to Romero's residence (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 46, Apr. 9, 2018). After a brief meeting between the Impala's driver and Romero outside Romero's residence, Romero told the undercover agent\n   that the methamphetamine would be available by 6:00 p.m. that night. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, Apr. 9, 2018.) Around that appointed time, the driver once again left his residence in the Impala and made a number of stops around South Sacramento before driving to Romero's residence. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 39, Apr. 9, 2018.) The undercover agent's purchase of methamphetamine from Romero occurred around the same time the Impala's driver returned to his residence at 5120 25th Street (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 41, Apr. 9, 2018), which the driver then left once again shortly after Romero called another phone number also registered to \"Nick Cole\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 47-48, Apr. 9, 2018). The Impala's driver and Romero met one another at an Express Mart Food Store a matter of minutes following this controlled purchase and telephonic communication. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 47, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This same general pattern of behavior largely occurred again on February 13, 2018. The undercover government agent requested methamphetamine from Romero, followed shortly thereafter by telephonic communication between Romero and a phone number registered to \"Nick Cole.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 53, Apr. 9, 2018.) The Impala's driver then drove the vehicle to Romero's residence, where the two men met in person. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 55, Apr. 9, 2018.) Romero then confirmed with the government agent that Romero would have the requested methamphetamine shortly. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 56, Apr. 9, 2018.) However, on this date as opposed to the other controlled purchases, the Impala's driver did not meet with Romero again prior to the controlled purchase. This time, the Impala's driver met first with Mendez, who drove to Romero's residence directly after meeting with the Impala's driver. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 57-59, Apr. 9, 2018.) Once Mendez met with Romero there and left, Romero contacted the government agent and sold the agent methamphetamine. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 60-61, Apr. 9, 2018.) Mendez then returned to Romero's residence. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 62, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Miranda\n   </em>\n   illustrates why the above facts establish probable cause for the issuance of the warrants in this case.

(ECF No. 1 \u00b6 17, Apr. 9, 2018.) If anything, the Impala's driver expended more time and energy on counter-surveillance than the defendant/supplier in\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Miranda\n   </em>\n   , because the Impala's driver went so far as to attempt to identify and photograph surveilling DEA agents.

This is notably similar to the Impala's driver's itinerary on December 4, 2017, when he met with Romero shortly after Romero received a request for drugs, drove back to his residence, then returned to Romero's residence at around the same\n   time that Romero was due to sell the methamphetamine. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 35-42, Apr. 9, 2018.)

This additional detail includes: telephonic evidence suggesting that the Impala's driver was utilizing a number of cellular phone numbers registered using fake information (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 81-86, Apr. 9, 2018); evidence that the Impala's driver had concealed the Impala under a tarp at a different address from his residence, which officers reasonably interpreted to be an \"attempt[ ] to hide his vehicle from law enforcement officers\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 69, Apr. 9, 2018); and evidence that the Impala's driver tried to identify and photograph surveilling DEA agents (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 52, 70-71, Apr. 9, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Given the above, it is clear that Agent Anderson's April 9 probable cause affidavit - once excised of all information relating to Blanks's identity - still contains sufficient evidence establishing probable cause to believe that searching the Impala's driver's residence at 5120 25th Street would yield evidence of an ongoing narcotics distribution conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440657\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/973/#p977\">\n    306 F.3d at 978-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that repeated proximity to narcotics distribution along with counter-surveillance maneuvers can \"easily establish[ ] probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant for\" the residence of an alleged drug supplier).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    ii. November 27, 2017 Affidavit in Support of Application for GPS Tracking Warrant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants specifically challenge Agent Anderson's November 27, 2017 affidavit as failing to establish probable cause to install a GPS tracking device on the Impala. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 7-9; ECF No. 39 at 5-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Defendants, the lack of probable cause underlying this first tracking warrant requires most of the subsequent evidence obtained in the investigation to be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. (ECF No. 36 at 9; ECF No. 39 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants' argument fails because Agent Anderson's November 27, 2017 affidavit still established probable cause, once stripped of information relating to Padilla's misidentification as Blanks, to believe that the 1996 Impala was being used to engage in illegal activities related to drug trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%20466\">\n    624 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   474 ; (ECF No. 39-1 at 5). As set forth above, the facts known to the DEA team in October and November 2017 consisted generally of the following: a reliable tip from an informant that the Impala's driver served as Romero's source of drug supply and lived near Romero (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 12, Apr. 9, 2018); telephonic and in-person communication between the Impala's driver and Romero close in time to when the informant purchased methamphetamine from Romero (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20-23, 25-26, Apr. 9, 2018); counter-surveillance\n   driving engaged in by the Impala's driver as he departed Romero's residence (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 17, Apr. 9, 2018); and Agent Anderson's conclusion after years of experience investigating illegal narcotics activity that the Impala was being used to ferry narcotics to Romero (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 90, Apr. 9, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   That this factual predicate would be sufficient to meet the \"not terribly demanding\" threshold to establish probable cause for installation of a GPS tracking device on the Impala,\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1240946\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/688/#p691\">\n    427 F.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is illustrated by\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Miranda\n   </em>\n   (the applicability of which the Court explained above) and\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Lopez\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202152766\">\n    2015 WL 2152766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, agents used \"records lawfully obtained from the phone company, the motor vehicles department, and\" a local port of entry to determine that \"someone driving [the defendant's] car spoke over the phone with the target of an ongoing drug investigation.\" Agents listened in a few days later as the defendant, using coded language that apparently referred to narcotics as \"beans,\" spoke to the investigation target.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. Noting that the coded language used by the defendant and the investigation target \"could well refer to perfectly innocuous activity,\" the court nonetheless credited the investigating agent's interpretation that the code referred to drug transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Accordingly, the court upheld the validity of a warrant authorizing installation of a GPS tracking device on the defendant's vehicle that had been supported by this probable cause showing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Agent Anderson's November 27, 2017 probable cause showing is, if anything, stronger than that found to establish probable cause in\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Lopez\n   </em>\n   . First, Agent Anderson's affidavit did not need to rely on triangulating various publicly available records to implicate the Impala in a drug trafficking scheme, as the agents in\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202152766\">\n    2015 WL 2152766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, had to do. This is because Agent Anderson had something better: a particularized tip from an informant considered to be reliable who was familiar with the drug trafficking organization being investigated and who told agents that Romero's supplier lived in Romero's neighborhood and drove a 1996 Chevrolet Impala with silver rims. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, Apr. 9, 2018.) Significantly, this information provided by the informant was corroborated by the DEA team's own investigating agents on October 25, 2017. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-17, Apr. 9, 2018.) Second, the DEA team actually observed this Impala and its driver engage in activity consistent with narcotics distribution on October 25, 2017 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 19-21, Apr. 9, 2018), whereas the probable cause in\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202152766\">\n    2015 WL 2152766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3, was predicated almost entirely on recorded phone conversations overheard by investigating agents. The DEA team in this case saw the Impala operating as a tool of narcotics distribution, as opposed to merely inferring - as the agents in\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202152766\">\n    2015 WL 2152766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, did on the basis of recorded phone conversations - that they \"would find evidence of a crime by tracking [the target] car.\" Third, the investigating team in the instant case uncovered telephonic evidence that, when viewed through the prism of Agent Anderson's extensive law enforcement experience, suggested that the owner of the phone in question was engaging in illegal narcotics distribution. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, Apr. 9, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   None of the above evidence relies in any way on the identity of the Impala's driver who was subsequently photographed, and mistakenly identified as Anthony Blanks, by law enforcement agents on October 25, 2017. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, Apr. 9, 2018.) The driver of the Impala could have been identified as anybody or as nobody on that day, and probable cause to affix a GPS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   tracking device to the Impala would still have existed. This is because the evidence of the Impala being used to traffic illegal narcotics that was unrelated to Blanks's identity nonetheless constituted a \"substantial basis\" to conclude that probable cause existed.\n   <em>\n    Krupa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836099\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1174/#p1177\">\n    658 F.3d at 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163485\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/257/#p271\">\n    362 U.S. at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163485,6163782\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/80/725/\">\n    80 S.Ct. 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly, since the Court finds that the original November 27, 2017 warrant to install a GPS tracking device on the Impala was supported by probable cause, Defendants' argument that all subsequent evidence collected in this investigation is the inadmissible fruit of that November 27, 2017 poisonous tree (ECF No. 36 at 9; ECF No. 39 at 5) must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Probable Cause to Arrest Padilla\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants argue only briefly that there was no probable cause to arrest Padilla when the investigative team encountered him upon execution of their search warrants on April 10, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 3 (\"Despite the agent's positive identification of Anthony Blanks while driving the Impala and during alleged drug transactions with Romero, agents arrested Salvador Padilla.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This is likely because the same probable cause that existed to search the Impala's driver's residence on April 10, 2018, also sufficed to arrest the Impala's driver when law enforcement officers encountered him in his residence on that date and recognized him as the person they had been surveilling for months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giordenello v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163831\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/480/#p485\">\n    357 U.S. 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485-86,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163831\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/480/#p485\">\n    78 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163831\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/480/#p485\">\n    2 L.Ed.2d 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958) (noting that the Fourth Amendment's probable cause standard \"of course applies to arrest as well as search warrants\"); (ECF No. 43 at 2 (stating that agents realized upon execution of the search warrants that the individual they had been surveilling was Padilla, not Blanks); ECF No. 36 at 3 (\"Subsequent to Mr. Padilla's arrest, the agent altered the affidavit by replacing Blanks [sic] name with Padilla's.\"); ECF No. 1 \u00b6 93, Apr. 10, 2018 (\"Investigators took PADILLA into custody based on probable cause that he had committed various offenses of the federal criminal code, as set forth below.\")). There was substantial evidence known to agents at the moment they came upon the Impala's driver on April 10, 2018 that this individual - whatever his name - had committed narcotics offenses, including his telephonic and in-person interactions with Romero before and following the controlled drug purchase on October 25, 2017 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-26, Apr. 9, 2018); his counter-surveillance driving maneuvers on that date (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20, Apr. 9, 2018); his telephonic and in-person interactions with Romero before and following the controlled drug purchase on December 4, 2017 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 32-42, 44-48, Apr. 9, 2018); his interactions with a surveilling DEA agent prior to the first controlled drug purchase on February 13, 2018 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 49-53, Apr. 9, 2018); his telephonic and in-person interactions with Romero and Mendez prior to the second controlled drug purchase on February 13, 2018 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 53-62, Apr. 9, 2018); and his attempts to conceal the Impala and to photograph surveilling DEA agents on March 6, 2018 (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 68-71, Apr. 9, 2018). This is more than sufficient to supply probable cause to arrest Padilla on April 10, 2018 because, \"under the totality of the[se] circumstances, a prudent officer would have believed that there was a fair probability that [Padilla] committed a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1240946\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/688/#p691\">\n    427 F.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Agent Anderson's affidavit states that after they encountered the Impala's driver inside 5120 25th Street on April 10, 2018, agents developed further evidence pointing to Padilla being the true identity of the Impala's driver who had committed the various acts they observed over the preceding months. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 94.) This\n   additional evidence adduced on April 10, 2018, however, is irrelevant to the Court's finding that Agent Anderson's April 9 affidavit established probable cause to arrest Padilla when he was recognized as the Impala's driver once contacted by law enforcement inside 5120 25th Street on April 10, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
