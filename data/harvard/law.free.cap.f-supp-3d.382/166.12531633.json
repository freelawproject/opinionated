(Docket No. 23.) The United States and Thuna oppose Lilly's motion. (Docket Nos. 33 &amp; 41.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Lilly's motion for restitution. (Docket No. 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 8, 2018, Thuna pled guilty to a one-count information charging Introduction into Interstate Commerce of Misbranded Drugs with Intent to Defraud, in violation of 21 U.S.C. sections 331(a), 333(a)(2), and 352(a), with forfeiture provisions. (Docket Nos. 3 &amp; 4.) According to the plea agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   During the period of January 2007 to May 2011, Martin Thuna caused [Droguer\u00eda de la Villa, Inc. (\"DDLV\") ] to\n   introduce and deliver for introduction into interstate commerce misbranded drugs, that is, wholesale shipments of prescriptions [sic] drugs with false labeling (pedigrees and transaction histories) in order to mislead and defraud the [Federal Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") ] of its lawful regulation of the legitimate drug supply chain. The prescription drugs distributed by DDLV in the manner stated above were in turn sold at retail level and paid in part by health care benefit programs. The parties have stipulated that for Sentencing Guideline purposes, the offense conduct caused a loss of more than $ 1,500,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Docket No. 4 at p. 13.) The plea agreement stipulates that \"the Court may impose restitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. The plea agreement also states that \"the parties [ ] agree that restitution is not proper in this case, since there are no readily identifiable consumers and health care benefit programs related to this offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 11, 2018, Lilly requested that the Court recognize Lilly as a victim of Thuna's criminal conduct pursuant to the VWPA and the CVRA and award Lilly restitution. (Docket No. 23 at p. 1.) Lilly argues that Thuna \"proximately harmed Lilly when he caused misbranded Lilly pharmaceuticals to be introduced into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. Lilly asserts that Thuna's conduct \"undermined the image and brand name of Lilly, the trust doctors and patients place in those brands, and the legitimate efforts of Lilly to recoup its investment in life saving new drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. Lilly maintains that Thuna's conduct also \"harmed Lilly by displacing sales of its legitimate products\" and that Lilly's \"lost wholesale sales total[ ] at least $ 2,099,018.01.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
