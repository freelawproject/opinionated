Based on our review of the received claim documentation, we must regretfully decline to pay for your loss. Our reasons for this declination of coverage are explained below, followed by pertinent provisions of the policy.

A CT scan of her brain was clear and she was discharged the next day, May 11, 2017. The medical records further revealed Ms. Mosley's sepsis was caused by the infected port related to her ongoing treatment with chemotherapy.

Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that Ms. Mosley's fall on May 10, 2017, is somehow related to the agreed-upon cause of her death: sepsis stemming from a bacterial infection in Ms. Mosley's port.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21, at 4 (\"But for the accidental fall\n   that caused the fatal infection and resulting sepsis, [Ms. Mosley] undoubtedly would have lived longer.\"). But even assuming the fall qualifies as an \"Accidental Bodily Injury\" under the Policy's terms, Plaintiffs fail to connect the fall to the agreed-upon cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To support an alleged causal nexus between the fall and the sepsis, Plaintiffs point to three exhibits attached to their response: the death certificate, the state medical examiner's investigation report, and an affidavit from Deborah Davis, Ms. Mosley's daughter. The death certificate and investigation report are both certified by Dr. Niblo-who the parties agree is the only qualified medical expert in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18, at 12 (\"Because no qualified medical expert (other than the medical examiner) evaluated Mosley upon her death and can testify on behalf of Plaintiffs regarding the specific cause of her death, Plaintiffs can present no admissible evidence to show that Mosley's death is covered under the Policy.\"); Doc. 21, at 5 (\"[Defendant] admits that the State Medical Examiner is the only expert who can testify as to causation. Plaintiffs agree!\"). The death certificate lists \"sepsis\" as the \"immediate cause (final disease or condition resulting in death)\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Ms. Mosley's death, while the investigation report lists sepsis as the \"probable cause\" of her death. Doc. 21-1; Doc. 21-2, at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The death certificate lists \"bacteremia from infected port\" as a \"condition[ ] ... leading to\" sepsis, while the investigation report states that the fatal sepsis was \"due to bacteremia from infected port.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104101\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/73/865/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The death certificate also includes a line for an \"underlying cause (disease or injury that initiated the events resulting in death)\"-but this line is blank. Doc. 21-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Both the certificate and the report include space for \"significant conditions\" that contributed to death but did not result in the underlying cause of death, and in these sections \"acute on chronic right subdural hematoma\" is listed. Doc. 21-1; Doc. 21-2, at 1. The investigation report links this hematoma with Ms. Mosley's fall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21-2, at 1 (listing \"acute on chronic right subdural hematoma status post fall\" under \"significant observations\"). The death certificate also includes details about Ms. Mosley's fall in a section for information about injuries, but the fall is not connected to any causation information above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21-1 (noting that Ms. Mosley suffered an injury from a fall). Finally, both the death certificate and the investigation report list Ms. Mosley's \"manner of death\" as \"accident.\" Doc. 21-1; Doc. 21-2, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Most salient to Plaintiffs' argument is the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of any information on the death certificate and investigation report connecting Ms. Mosley's May 10th fall to her death. Again, the parties agree on the cause of Ms. Mosley's death-sepsis brought about by an infected port. How the fall is relevant to the cause of death or the death itself, however, is unaddressed by these documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the only \"evidence\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   of a causal nexus between the fall and Ms. Mosley's death that Plaintiffs offer is an affidavit from Ms. Mosley's daughter, Deborah Davis, in which Ms. Davis avers that Ms. Mosley's port was uninfected prior to her fall on May 10, 2017, and that-\"[b]ased on [Ms. Davis's] observations and beliefs\"-Ms. Mosley's death resulted from her \"accidental fall.\" Doc. 21-4, at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ms. Davis's affidavit is problematic for myriad reasons. First, \"[a]n affidavit ... used to .. oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant ... is competent to testify on the matters stated.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). \"Under the personal knowledge standard, an affidavit is inadmissible if the witness could not have actually perceived or observed that which [s]he testifies to.\"\n   <em>\n    Argo v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Kan., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046717\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/1193/#p1200\">\n    452 F.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \"[A]t the summary judgment stage, statements of mere belief in an affidavit must be disregarded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046717\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/1193/#p1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While some of Ms. Davis's assertions in the affidavit are based on her observations, several are, at least in part, premised on her beliefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21-4. Thus, parts of the affidavit are likely inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   More significantly, Plaintiffs give no indication that Ms. Davis is qualified to make judgments about Ms. Mosley's health or the cause of Ms. Mosley's death. Ms. Davis is not included on the Plaintiffs' Expert Witness List,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 23, and Plaintiffs nowhere claim that Ms. Davis is a doctor or medical expert.

It is precisely this lack of evidence that renders\n    <em>\n     Highley\n    </em>\n    inapposite.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In the cases cited, the courts applied the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") to the disputes. However, these cases are persuasive, as their facts and governing legal standards are sufficiently analogous to those at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The Policy's \"independent of\" language also poses problems for Plaintiffs' causation argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    pp. 1194-97. Ms. Mosley's injuries from her fall-specifically, an \"[a]cute on chronic right subdural hematoma\"-are listed on the death certificate and investigation report as \"significant conditions contributing to death,\" but not \"resulting in the underlying cause.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 21-1; Doc. 21-2, at 1. But the hematoma is not the only \"significant condition\" listed in these documents; rather, the documents also list \"leukemia,\" \"cardiovascular disease,\" and \"diabetes\" as significant conditions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also supra\n    </em>\n    Section I. Even if the Court were to treat these significant conditions as \"causing\" (in the broadest sense) Ms. Mosley's death, Plaintiffs would still fail to show entitlement to coverage under the Policy because Ms. Mosley's death would not satisfy the Policy's definition of \"Accident\" or \"Accidental.\" To be an \"Accident\" under the Policy, the event must be, among other things, \"independent of illness, disease or other bodily malfunction.\" Doc. 21-3, at 17. To say that Ms. Mosley's death was caused by fall-induced injuries\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    leukemia, cardiovascular disease, and/or diabetes is to say that her death was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    accidental, as the Policy defines it. This would also be in line with cases examining Oklahoma law's treatment of accidental death policies that require an insured's death be directly caused by an accidental bodily injury that is independent of all other causes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20137261\">\n     2015 WL 137261\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6 (\"[R]elying on Oklahoma case law, the Tenth Circuit has distilled a general rule that is applicable here: if 'death resulted because the accident aggravated the effects of the disease, or the disease aggravated the effects of the accident,\n    <em>\n     with both the disease and the accident acting [as] concurring causes of death\n    </em>\n    ,' there is no coverage under a policy that provides benefits for a death that occurs as a direct result of an injury caused by an accident, independent of all other causes.\" (emphasis added) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Flores v.
