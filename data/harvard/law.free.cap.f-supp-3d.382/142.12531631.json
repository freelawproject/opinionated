(collectively \"Plaintiffs\") bring this lawsuit against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), and several officials in their official capacity (collectively \"Defendants\"), challenging ICE's policy and practice of conducting civil immigration arrests inside of state courthouses in Massachusetts. In Count 1 of the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   [1], Plaintiffs challenge ICE Directive No. 11072.1, entitled \"Civil Immigration Actions Inside Courthouses\" (the \"Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive\"), dated January 10, 2018, under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(C). The APA commands a reviewing court to \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action ... found to be ... in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\" Plaintiffs contend that at the time the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\") was enacted, all those appearing in court on official court business enjoyed a common law privilege against civil arrest. They argue that the INA does not explicitly extinguish this common law privilege and therefore must be interpreted to be constrained by it. Therefore, Plaintiffs contend, any ICE policies which permit civil courthouse arrests are in excess of the power granted by the INA and must be set aside by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants dispute the existence of a common law privilege against civil arrest in courthouses, and, alternatively, argue that any such privilege was superseded long before the codification of the current immigration scheme. Further, Defendants argue, if such a privilege existed in the past, Plaintiffs nonetheless lack both constitutional and prudential standing to bring this claim. Finally, the government contends that if Plaintiffs do have standing and the common law privilege exists, Congress nonetheless extinguished the privilege when it passed the INA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the court is Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   [5], which seeks to preliminarily enjoin Defendants from implementing the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive and from civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on official business while they are going to, attending, or leaving the courthouse. Finding that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit, are likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claim as to those not in federal or state custody when they arrive, and are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs' favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest, Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   [5] is ALLOWED. Defendants are enjoined from implementing the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive and from civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on official business while they are going to, attending, or leaving the courthouse. The court's order does not limit ICE's criminal arrests of such individuals or its civil arrests of individuals who are brought to Massachusetts courthouses while in state or federal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Statutory and Regulatory Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1952, Congress enacted the INA, governing, among other things, the presence of non-citizens (deemed \"aliens\" in the INA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ) in the United States and the associated procedures for removing those present in the United States without federal authorization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   INA, Pub.

The FAQ Responses note further that \"[f]ederal, state, and local law enforcement officials routinely engage in enforcement activity in courthouses throughout the country,\" that the actions \"are consistent with longstanding law enforcement practices nationwide,\" and that because individuals entering courthouses are typically screened for weapons, \"civil immigration enforcement actions taken inside courthouses can reduce safety risks to the public, targeted alien(s), and ICE officers and agents.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9.

Br. at 8-11 [34].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The court considers Plaintiffs' injury-in-fact first. Defendants argue that\n    Plaintiffs do not face a threat that the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive will be applied against them, and moreover, that they have no right to assert a claim against removal on behalf of others who may be subject to such removal.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8. But this is not the injury that Plaintiffs are claiming. Plaintiffs \"are not asserting incidental injury from Defendants' general enforcement of the immigration laws, but direct injury from Defendants' actions targeting courts for federal immigration enforcement.\" Pls.' Rep. Br. at 9 [41]. Defendants aptly summarize the DAs' complaints that \"the ICE Directive increases their costs, diverts their resources, and makes their prosecutions more 'time consuming and difficult.' \" Defs.' Br. at 9 [34] (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 80, 82 [1] ). The DAs claim that ICE civil arrests\n    <em>\n     in state courthouses\n    </em>\n    , the sole forum in which they can prosecute cases, are hindering the DAs' ability to carry out their primary functions as District Attorneys, and Chelsea Collaborative claims that these civil arrests impair their members' ability to protect themselves through the state courts from unlawful actions of other individuals. For example, Plaintiffs allege that survivors of domestic abuse are \"reluctant to file for civil protective orders against abusive partners or appear [in] court as witnesses in criminal cases against their abusers.\" Moshier Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. 14 [7-14]. Fears concerning ICE's presence from victims and witnesses \"have been more prevalent since the ICE policy was announced.\" Foley Decl. \u00b6 6, Ex. 12 [7-12]. Victim Witness Advocates can no longer advise victims that their fear of arrest during the court process is unfounded. Foley Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, Ex. 12 [7-12].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Defendants argue that a state prosecutor does not suffer an injury in fact merely because a federal law-enforcement action (or threat of it) increases the time or costs associated with state prosecutions, and assert that they know of no case in which a court has found standing to challenge a federal law on this basis. Defendant conflates two issues, however. Federal prosecutions may well routinely burden state prosecutions (or vice versa), without there being a legal claim that may be asserted. But the inquiry here is whether there is a cognizable injury for purposes of Article III standing. The court agrees with Plaintiffs that being unable to reliably secure the attendance of defendants, victims, and witnesses hinders the ability of the DAs to prosecute crimes and Chelsea Collaborative's members to secure their rights under state law and amounts to a particularized injury sufficient to constitute injury-in-fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Matter of\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     C.

CPCS's core function of representing criminal defendants is impeded when its clients are apprehended by ICE prior to appearing in court and proceedings are interrupted or altogether cannot continue. That alone is enough to constitute injury-in-fact. Further, CPCS declares that \"time and resources have been consumed by...assisting defense attorneys whose clients have been impacted by this ICE enforcement policy.\" Klein Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. 11 [7-11].

The unwillingness of those at risk of ICE civil arrest to visit courthouses injures the DAs and Chelsea Collaborative members and is alleged be a direct result of the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive. The DAs report that concerns from witnesses and victims about ICE's presence \"have been more prevalent since the ICE policy was announced.\" Foley Decl. \u00b6 6, Ex. 12 [7-12]. Before ICE began civilly arresting people at courthouses, Chelsea Collaborative helped members file suit, and helped members in litigation by filling courtrooms with supporters. Vega Decl. \u00b6 6, Ex. 10 [7-10]. Now, Chelsea Collaborative struggles to persuade noncitizen members to go to court as victims, witnesses, or supporters. Vega Decl. \u00b6 9, Ex. 10 [7-10]. According to Chelsea Collaborative, the \"reluctance to attend court began soon after ICE's increase in targeted enforcement actions in courthouses.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p168\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive \"has caused a strain both on [Chelsea Collaborative's] personnel and [their] budget such that [they] are unable to effectively carry out many of [their] other goals and missions.\" Vega Decl. \u00b6 22, Ex. 10 [7-10].

However, CPCS is not complaining that its clients are voluntarily choosing not to attend court, but that ICE is civilly arrested their clients when these individuals come to state court to attend state proceedings against them. These arrests cause CPCS to expend resources to respond to civil courthouse immigration enforcement. CPCS contends that defense attorneys inside courthouses regularly discover that clients are arrested prior to entering the courthouse to appear at criminal proceedings, causing a default judgment to enter.

Over two days of hearing on this preliminary injunction, counsel for the government repeatedly argued that ICE was not conducting courthouse arrests in the manners described by Plaintiffs. Specifically, counsel represented that \"generally\" ICE does not arrest civil litigants, witnesses, or victims at courthouses. If this is the case, then to enjoin the applicability of the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive as to civil arrests of courthouse attendees other than criminal defendants will cause no significant harm to the government. Plaintiffs, in comparison, and the public in general will suffer harm each day that witnesses and victims refuse to participate in proceedings, as detailed above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Plaintiffs also contend that without an injunction, state criminal defendants who are arrested by ICE coming or leaving the courthouse will be prevented from attending proceedings against them, impairing the DAs ability to prosecute cases and increasing CPCS's costs in representing criminal defendants. According to Defendants' counsel, ICE's general policy is not to arrest criminal defendants until the conclusion of the hearing that they are attending in state court. Counsel acknowledged, however, that ICE would make courthouse arrests before the targeted individuals leave the courthouse. They contend that ICE's inability \"to arrest fugitive aliens at the one place at which it can reliably find them in Massachusetts\" would harm both the public and the federal government, and that arrestees, officers and the public would be safer if arrests are conducted in courthouses where individuals are screened for weapons. Defs.' Opp. at 26 [34].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The court credits Defendants' safety concerns, as well as the public's need to be protected from dangerous criminal aliens. But Defendants' attempt to justify civil courthouse arrests on these grounds, and on the fact that Massachusetts courts do not recognize civil detainers, and that Federal, state and local law enforcement activity concerning criminal matters \"routinely\" occurs in courthouses, ignores a critical distinction regarding the challenged arrests. Plaintiffs here seek only to enjoin civil, not criminal, arrests.
