Plaintiffs bring claims for securities fraud and common-law fraud against Defendants based on alleged misrepresentations in this Agreement. Defendants now move for summary judgment on a number of grounds. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motions because (1) Plaintiffs have failed to establish their alleged loss was caused by Defendants' conduct and (2) Plaintiffs failed to plead an equitable-fraud claim. Plaintiffs' claims are therefore\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    A. Factual History\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This dispute stems from a written purchase agreement (hereinafter the \"Agreement\") between Plaintiffs Tammy O'Connor and Michael Stewart, and Atherio, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Atherio). Under this Agreement, Plaintiffs sold their interest in their technology-consulting company, Red River Solutions, to Atherio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 118-2, Pls.' App., 7-70 (the Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the summer of 2012, Plaintiffs began marketing their company for sale through an investment banker and a transactional lawyer. Doc. 124, Defs.' Resp., 5. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiffs began negotiating the sale of the company with representatives from Atherio. Over the course of eleven months, the two sides negotiated and finalized the Agreement whereby Atherio would purchase Plaintiffs' interest in Red River Solutions in exchange for $3.15 million, stock in Atherio, and other compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 95, Def. Cory's Resp. to Pls.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mot. for Summ. J., 5. The deal closed sometime between June 25 and June 27 of 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs now allege fraud claims against Defendants Jason Cory, Thomas Farb, and Greg Furst in relation to this Agreement. During the negotiation and closing of the transaction, Defendant Cory was Atherio's Chief Executive Officer. Defendants Farb and Furst also held executive positions at Atherio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs base their fraud claims on alleged misrepresentations in the Agreement regarding the resignation of Thomas Farb as Atherio's Chief Financial Officer. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., 26-39. Sometime in the summer or fall of 2012, Plaintiffs claim they were told that Farb would be Atherio's CFO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 124-4, Defs.' App'x, 21 (Deposition of Tammy O'Connor). Farb signed an employment agreement with Atherio on or around December 28, 2012. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 9; Doc. 156, Pls.' App'x, 122 (unsigned employment agreement). This employment agreement contains a number of provisions relevant to Plaintiffs' fraud claims. To start, the employment agreement specified Farb would be paid a base salary of at least $250,000 per annum, as well as a guaranteed annual bonus of not less than $200,000. Doc. 156, Pls.' App'x, 123. The employment agreement also provides that upon Farb's voluntary resignation from Atherio for \"Good Reason,\" Farb would be entitled to a number of severance benefits, including a \"lump sum payment equal to two times Executive's base salary ... payable in full within thirty (30) days of such Involuntary Termination,\" and guaranteed bonus payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-29; Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 9-10 (Plaintiffs calculate the total severance pay owed Farb at $1,020,500). However, Farb was entitled to these severance benefits only \"[i]n the event of his Involuntary Termination.\" Doc. 156, Pls.' App'x, 128. Under the employment agreement, \"Involuntary Termination\" included a situation where Farb \"voluntarily resigns from the Company for any of the following reasons ('Good Reason')[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One of the reasons was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The deterioration of Executive's relationship with the Company's Board of Directors, Chairman, President and/or Chief Operating Officer ..., which determination shall be made by Executive in his sole discretion, so as to make performance of Executive's responsibilities impossible or impracticable, which is not rectified to Executive's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) day's written notice thereof to the Company from Executive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\u00b6 VIII.A.2.d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the months leading up to the close of the Agreement, Farb's relationship with Cory and Atherio deteriorated. This seems to be due to the fact that Farb was not being paid. Doc. 156, Pls.' App'x, 715 (Deposition of Farb). On June 5, 2013, Farb sent written notice to Cory stating that he was invoking the \"Involuntary Termination\" Section (VIII.A.2.d) in his employment agreement. Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst's App'x, 499-503. Plaintiffs assert that this written notice triggered the \"Good Reasons\" portion of the employment agreement that entitled Farb to over $1 million in severance benefits. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 14-15. Defendants argue this merely triggered a reconciliation period whereby Farb and Atherio had thirty days (until July 5, 2013) to cure the employment relationship. Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst's Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Summ. J., 8. After Farb sent this notice, he and Cory continued to negotiate regarding his employment status and compensation structure going forward. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 15 (citing Pls.' App'x, 286, 289, 295, 298). Also during this time, Defendants were sending Plaintiffs disclosures listing the employment status of Atherio's executives, including Farb. Doc. 156, Pls.' App'x, 387.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Agreement has an effective date of June 25, 2013, but the transaction was not fully funded until June 27, 2013. Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst's Mot. Summ. J., 8 (citing Farb &amp; Furst's App'x, 2). The delay appears to be caused by the status of Farb's employment and Atherio's lenders. Atherio needed two lenders to complete the transaction: SunTrust (the senior lender) and Prudent Capital (the mezzanine lender). Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst App'x, 531. However, before the lenders would agree to finance the transaction, the executives at Atherio, including Farb, had to revise their employment agreements and waive rights under their old agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Leading up to the close, Farb and Cory were vigorously disputing what a new agreement for Farb would look like, how much equity he would get under such an agreement, and what Farb's new title at Atherio would be. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 19-23 (collecting correspondence between Farb and Cory). But it appeared that both realized Farb needed to be at Atherio for the Agreement to close. Doc. 156, Pls.' App'x, 391-92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 26, 2013, a day after the Agreement was signed, Farb signed a new employment agreement. Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst's App'x, 504-509. In that agreement, Farb waived any rights under his original employment agreement with Atherio, including any deferred compensation or severance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Farb would continue working at Atherio through September 2013, but he would no longer be the CFO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (noting his title changed to \"Executive Vice President, Corporate Development\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 27, 2013, Farb entered into another agreement, this time with Atherio Investments, LLC and Atherio Investments Management, LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 510-19. Under this second agreement, to which Atherio, Inc. was not a party, the parties agreed to use \"reasonable efforts\" to effectuate an assumption agreement with Atherio, Inc. whereby the two Atherio LLCs would assume a portion of Farb's deferred compensation previously owed under his original employment agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that none of this information was disclosed to them before or during the close of the transaction. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 22. Further, Plaintiffs claim that these releases were part of a scheme to temporarily remove the $1 million liability of severance benefits Atherio owed Farb.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants formed, controlled, and operated these Atherio LLCs as vehicles to conceal Atherio's liability to Farb in order to ensure Plaintiffs would go through with the sale of their company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants argue that (1) Farb released any right to severance before these agreements were made so no severance obligation was ever owed and (2) the assumption agreement was never entered into and thus was never a liability for Atherio. Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst's Mot. Summ. J., 11; Doc. 144, Cory's Br. Summ. J., 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs' fraud claims are based on (1) Defendants' failure to disclose that Farb may not have been Atherio's CFO at the close of the Agreement and (2) Defendants' failure to disclose an alleged severance obligation owed to Farb and the assumption agreements related to the obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against Defendants on June 23, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1,\n   Pls.' Compl. Plaintiffs' current Second Amended Complaint alleges causes of action under federal securities laws, Texas securities law, and common law fraud and unspecified statutory law fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37, Pls.' 2d Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This Order succeeds the Court's previous Rule 56(f) Order (Doc. 152). As will be explained below, the Court ruled in that Order that Plaintiffs' claims are limited, based on a nonreliance clause, to representations made in the Agreement. In that Order, the Court also dismissed Plaintiffs' Texas securities act claim based on the choice-of-law clause in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants Farb and Furst filed their motion for summary judgment on September 27, 2018 (Doc. 140). Defendant Cory filed his amended motion for summary judgment on September 28, 2018 (Doc. 142). Plaintiffs filed their response on November 5, 2018 (Doc. 156). Cory filed his reply on November 19, 2018 (Doc. 165). Farb and Furst filed their reply on that same day (Doc. 167). With the motions now ripe for review, the Court will consider whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Courts must grant summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Doc. 142, Cory's Mot. for Summ. J.; Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst's Mot. for Summ. J. Some of their arguments overlap; some do not. The Court will address their arguments together where possible, and separately where it cannot. Additionally, some of their grounds for summary judgment have been addressed in the Court's previous orders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 152, Rule 56(f) Order, &amp; Doc. 157, Mem. Op. &amp; Order on Mot. for Leave to Am. The Court will not reconsider those rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs have two claims remaining: (1) a federal securities-fraud claim under \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act and (2) a common-law fraud claim under Delaware law. These claims are based on misrepresentations or omissions Defendants made in connection with Atherio's Agreement to purchase Plaintiffs' company, Red River Solutions. Importantly, as the Court held in the Rule 56(f) Order, the nonreliance clause in the Agreement limits both of Plaintiffs' fraud claims to representations specifically made in that Agreement. Doc. 152, Rule 56(f) Order. Thus, Plaintiffs' claims have been restricted to three misrepresentations in the Agreement, all related to Farb's resignation as CFO of Atherio and alleged severance obligations owed to Farb after his resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants all move for summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiffs cannot support certain elements of their fraud claims. Specifically, Cory argues that there were no misrepresentations in the Agreement and that, even if there were, they would not be material. Cory also argues he did not have a duty to disclose information related to Farb's employment situation. Next, all Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adduced evidence of loss causation-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the alleged fraud here legally caused Plaintiffs' economic loss. Cory further argues there is no evidence that Plaintiffs justifiably relied on the alleged representations. And Farb and Furst argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate sufficient evidence to create a fact issue on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Additionally, Defendants argue other defenses entitle them to summary judgment. Cory argues Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because (1) Plaintiffs released their claims against Cory in a separate agreement, (2) Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and (3) Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead alleged misrepresentations based on certain provisions in the Agreement and failed to plead an equitable-fraud claim. Further, Farb and Furst argue Plaintiffs' claims sound in contract, not tort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court will first address Defendants' arguments that Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead certain facts and claims. The Court will then turn to Defendants' challenges to Plaintiffs' proof of the elements of their claims. Finally, the Court will analyze Defendants' defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    A. Adequacy of Pleadings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    i. Pleadings Based on Misrepresentations of the Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Cory argues that, in response to the Court's Rule 56(f) Order, Plaintiffs altered their pleadings and argued for the first time that Defendants violated representations made in \u00a7\u00a7 4.3 and 4.6 of the Agreement. Doc. 144, Cory' Br. Summ. J., 47-49. Plaintiffs counter that their allegations related to these sections of the Agreement and Farb's severance obligation are sufficiently detailed in their second amended complaint. Doc. 156, Pls.'

Doc. 165, Cory's Reply, 9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Cory bases this argument on two factual propositions. First, Cory asserts the severance obligation was never an obligation because Farb never resigned. Doc. 144, Cory's Br. Summ. J., 21. Farb sent Cory an official resignation letter on June 5,\n   2013-20 days before the alleged June 25, 2013 closing date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The resignation letter, according to Cory, triggered a thirty-day period in Farb's employment agreement under which Atherio and Farb could rectify the situation to Farb's \"reasonable satisfaction.\" Doc. 145, Cory's App'x, 112 (Farb's Employment Agreement). After this thirty-day period, if Farb was not satisfied, his resignation would become effective.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642025\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/228/#p238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Cory argues, Farb's resignation would not become effective until July 5, 2013, and that is only if the situation could not be rectified. Doc. 144, Cory's Br. Summ. J., 21. And, to add, Farb's employment agreement did not require the severance obligation to become payable until thirty days after the effective resignation date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642025\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/228/#p238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Cory presses that any obligation owed to Farb would not have to have been paid until August 4, 2013, at the earliest, and therefore there was no alleged severance obligation to disclose leading up to the close.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, Cory argues the Agreement could not close unless Farb first released or amended his employment agreement. Doc. 165, Cory's Reply, 10. Cory cites to email chains between him and Farb discussing the need to revise Farb's employment agreement in order to obtain necessary funds from investment firms to close the transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One of Atherio's main lenders, Prudent Capital, required that the executive employment agreements (including Farb's) be revised, presumably to remove large potential liabilities presented by those agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs agree with this point. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 19. Cory thus argues that the close of the transaction is proof that the severance obligation was never paid because the transaction could never have closed with such an obligation on Atherio's books. Doc. 165, Cory's Reply, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs point to evidence they argue indicates that the severance obligation should have made it into the financial disclosures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs first provide expert testimony on GAAP requirements. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 38. Plaintiffs' expert, Byers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that once Cory received the initial resignation letter on May 31, 2013, Atherio was required to determine whether to accrue or disclose this potential liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Byers has opined that \"Atherio violated accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, U.S. GAAP, by not recording at least $405,300 no later than May 31, 2013, for a severance accrual and not disclosing the risk of potential loss of at least $1,055,542.\" Doc. 155, Defs.' Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   to Exclude, 1-2.

Resp., 39. Plaintiffs cite to the side agreements between Atherio, Farb, and Atherio-related entities that were made on or immediately before the closing of the Purchase Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, these side agreements shifted the severance liability owed to Farb to these other entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs were never told about these agreements (a fact that Defendants do not appear to dispute).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From this, Plaintiffs press that Farb was, in fact, owed some form of severance, and that Atherio and Defendants were attempting to cover up this liability to appease Plaintiffs and their investors, thus allowing the transaction to go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, in their surreply,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs cite to testimony from Defendants' accounting expert, Carradine. Doc. 174-1, Pls.' Surreply, 4. Plaintiffs argue Carradine's testimony shows that (1) GAAP presumes financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis (i.e., recognizing liabilities when they are\n   <em>\n    incurred\n   </em>\n   , not just when they are\n   <em>\n    paid\n   </em>\n   ) and (2) if there was a severance obligation, it should have been recorded as a current liability and disclosed to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. And because Defendants did not do so, their financial disclosures were not in compliance with GAAP and thus \u00a7 4.6 was a misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   After considering the arguments above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have cited sufficient evidence to create a triable issue as to whether this section of the Agreement is a misrepresentation. Plaintiffs have introduced evidence that, without informing Plaintiffs, Farb sought to leave the company and invoke the severance portion of his employment agreement. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 14-15. This severance obligation was substantial-totaling over $1 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And, while Cory may be right that Farb was never owed any severance (or that he wasn't owed this amount until after the close), the issue of whether Atherio's financial statements needed to disclose this pending liability is better left to accounting experts and the appraisal of trial testimony. The Court thus will not grant summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    b.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Section 4.3(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Atherio represented in \u00a7 4.3(a) of the Agreement that, among other things, it had no outstanding stock rights or \"agreements of any character\" obligating Atherio to issue stock. However, as discussed in Part III.A.i.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds Plaintiffs failed to plead a fraud claim with respect to this section. The Court will not reach the parties' other arguments related to this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capitalization Table\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs last allege that Defendants misrepresented Farb's employment status as Atherio's CFO in a capitalization table provided in disclosures before the transaction closed. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 42-43. With its disclosures for the Purchase Agreement, Defendants provided\n   capitalization tables representing the outstanding and issued equity interests of Atherio to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In one of the tables, entitled \"Ownership by Management Post Mezzanine Financing,\" the executives of Atherio are listed with their corresponding titles and equity interests; Farb is listed as Chief Financial Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc. 156-4, Pls.' App'x, 496). Plaintiffs argue this was a misrepresentation because Farb was no longer Atherio's CFO on June 26, 2013, one day before the transaction's mezzanine financing came in, and Plaintiffs were never told this fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Cory argues a different side to the story. He asserts that, despite sending his resignation letter on June 6, 2013, Farb never considered changing his CFO title until June 26, 2013. Doc. 165, Cory's Reply, 20. Cory stresses that even though the transaction was not funded until June 27, 2013, the effective closing date was June 25, 2013 (the date listed on the Agreement).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc. 145, Cory's App'x, 9, and expert testimony). Thus, Cory concludes that Farb was CFO through the close of the Agreement and the capitalization table was not a misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, Cory asserts that Farb continued to act as CFO of Atherio until September 2013 when a new controller was hired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court will not grant summary judgment on this ground. Whether, as Cory claims, Farb was the CFO at the close and was expected to continue as CFO after the close is an issue replete with factual disputes. The Court believes Plaintiffs have brought forth sufficient evidence on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Reliance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Cory argues that Plaintiffs have not shown evidence of justifiable reliance. Doc. 144, Cory's Br. Summ. J., 37. Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp. Under Rule 56(e), when a party fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the Court may: (1) give an opportunity to respond; (2) consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion; (3) grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials show that the movant is entitled to it; or (4) issue any other appropriate order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because the Court is granting summary judgment on other grounds, the Court will not reach Cory's reliance argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Loss Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have failed to prove loss causation.

After\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed the use of this test.\n   <em>\n    Lormand v.

But these cases, like\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   , are fraud-on-the-market cases. And the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Greenberg\n   </em>\n   's loss-causation standard difficult to apply here; fraud-on-the-market cases focus on the effect a price-inflating misrepresentation and subsequent disclosure has on a security's price in the marketplace.

Instead, Plaintiffs argue being \"duped into investing in a business that was less valuable than represented\" caused their loss. Doc. 156, Pls.'

Nuveen brought securities-fraud claims against the City of Alameda for misrepresentations made when Nuveen purchased notes from the city. The notes were issued to refinance debt and complete construction on a municipal telecommunications system. Revenue to repay the notes was to be secured from revenue generated by the new telecom system, and the potential refinancing and sale of the system. But the system was a failure due to competition from competing telecom providers, combined with the 2008 recession. Nuveen lost around $10 million of its $20 million investment. Nuveen claimed that the city misrepresented and inflated the projected performance of the telecom system. Nuveen argued that \"because the Notes would not have been issued 'but for' the City's fraudulent misrepresentations, the loss causation requirement is satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703101\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1111/#p1119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703101\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1111/#p1119\">\n    at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Ninth Circuit rejected Nuveen's argument that \"but for\" causation was sufficient to prove loss causation, even in a case involving the sale of securities in an inefficient market.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703101\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1111/#p1119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court rejected this argument because it \"renders the concept of loss causation meaningless by collapsing it into transaction causation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703101\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1111/#p1119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McGonigle v.

In other words, evidence of but-for causation-that fraud induced the sale-was not enough.

Defendants, in response, argue Plaintiffs misstate the law because they conflate loss causation with transaction causation. Doc. 165, Cory's Reply, 18-21; Doc. 167, Farb &amp; Furst's Reply, 7-10. As the Court noted above, it seems to be clear that loss causation and transaction causation are separate elements that require different proof. Thus, it is not sufficient for a plaintiff to show she was \"duped\" or induced into a transaction to prove loss causation. Plaintiffs also argue that the \"requirement that a plaintiff exclude the affect of market forces applies only to fraud-on-the-market cases.\" Doc. 156, Pls.'

Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 49-50. Plaintiffs cite a few pieces of evidence to support their argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (1) Atherio failed to properly manage its debt without Farb as CFO;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (2) If Farb had stayed on as CFO, Atherio would not have lost two purported investors, which contributed to Atherio's collapse; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (3) If Farb was CFO he would have prevented Cory from committing fraud and damaging the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540860\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/418/#p426\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because of the Court's previous ruling on the nonreliance clause,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 152, Mem. Op. &amp; Order, the Court considers only the facts underlying intracontractual misrepresentations. Thus, as an initial matter, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs' argument that the \"Defendants' representation of a competent management team\" has no bearing here because this is not a representation in the Agreement. The Court will not consider any arguments based on representations made outside the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Turning to the relevant misrepresentations, the Court first considers Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants misrepresented Farb's continued role with Atherio post-close. For Plaintiffs to show loss causation as to this misrepresentation, Plaintiffs must show that Farb's resignation as CFO was at least a substantial factor in bringing about their economic loss-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the devaluation of Atherio.\n   <em>\n    Nuveen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703101\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1111/#p1119\">\n    730 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1120 ;\n   <em>\n    McCabe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540860\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/418/#p426\">\n    494 F.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs cite a few pieces of evidence to support this claim. First, Plaintiffs point to an email written by Farb, dated June 27, 2013-on or shortly after the Agreement closed-in which Farb allegedly admitted that the management team of Atherio was unprepared to run the company. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 50 (citing Doc. 151-5, Pls.' App'x, 1147). Plaintiffs seem to be referring to Farb's statement in the email that Atherio's officers \"have been so focused on the deal side and the financing, we haven't done any planning for when we own the companies.\" Doc. 151-5, Pls.' App'x, 1147. It is unclear how this email would show that Farb's resignation as CFO post-close would cause Atherio to collapse-on the other hand, as Defendants point out, this may actually belie Plaintiffs' argument that Farb's resignation was a cause of their loss. Specifically, this seems to be more of a gripe with Farb's performance as CFO. And other arguments Plaintiffs make in their response betray their contradicting position here-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , their claim in the very next page of the response that \"Farb willfully prepared financial statements that concealed his resignation, failed to disclose Atherio's Severance Obligation, and therefore violated GAAP.\" Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 51 (citing Doc. 37, Pls.' Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 154-64). It is illogical for Plaintiffs to argue on the one hand that Farb was improperly \"manipulating financial data\" to misrepresent Atherio's performance and, on the other hand, insist that Farb as CFO was a necessary element to Atherio's success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs' additional evidence that Farb's alleged resignation was the cause of Atherio's collapse is likewise unavailing. Plaintiffs contend that \"Farb's departure caused two 'high probability' investors to back out, impairing Atherio's ability to perform the basic business functions of\n   accumulating capital.\" Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 50. Plaintiffs support this with an email from Farb to Cory relaying Farb's discussions with potential investors. Doc. 151-4, Pls.' App'x, 590-91. While Farb did tell Cory that one investor was \"high probability to invest\" but he appeared to be backing out with Farb leaving, Farb also told Cory the investor was concerned that another officer, Mark Dinkel, appeared to be backing out.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540860\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/418/#p426\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Farb concluded \"Jason, I think there is a message here-pull your team together and get Mark firmly in the company.\" The second investor (who planned to contribute only $30,000) similarly expressed concern about Farb leaving Atherio, but was also \"very put off\" by an unrelated press release sent out by Atherio.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540860\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/418/#p426\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, this email alone is insufficient to support Plaintiffs' argument that alleged Farb's title change caused these investors to back out-let alone led to Atherio's demise. Plaintiffs have pointed to no other evidence that shows (1) that these investors did, in fact, back out, (2) that other intervening causes (such as Cory's inability to pull a team together) did not overpower any effect Farb's alleged resignation had on this one investor, and (3) that Atherio's failure-and thus Plaintiffs' economic loss-occurred\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   these investors did not sign on. Moreover, another issue with Plaintiffs' argument is that Defendants' evidence shows Farb continued to work at Atherio for months after the close. Doc. 145, Cory's App'x, 297-98. And his role at Atherio appeared to be the same in those months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 299-301. This undercuts any argument that the investors backed out because Farb left Atherio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that Farb would have prevented Cory from committing bank fraud if he were CFO at the time Cory submitted inflated receivables to their lender. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 50. The Court notes, again, that this position contradicts Plaintiffs' previously stated position that Farb fraudulently prepared financial statements in violation of GAAP,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51, and concealed monetary obligations from Plaintiffs. Furthermore, the Court finds Plaintiffs' contention that \"Farb would have prevented\" Cory from submitting fraudulent documents to Sun Trust highly speculative. The deposition testimony Plaintiffs cite for this argument actually reveals that Farb was aware of Cory's actions and \"went and counseled Jason repeatedly to go to the banks immediately, advise them that we were in default, which we're required to do.\" Doc. 151-5, Pls.' App'x, 720 (Dep. of Thomas Farb). And Farb then testified that he resigned\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   Cory's behavior and reported his actions to \"the board and Prudent and Sun Trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Farb never testified, as Plaintiffs claim, that he would have prevented Cory from committing fraud; instead, Farb did as he said, and resigned as CFO because he was unwilling to help Cory. Further, it is merely speculative that Farb would have done anything different as CFO of the company, compared to his position as an executive vice president at the time Cory committed the alleged fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Lastly, the Court finds Plaintiffs' weakest argument supporting loss causation relates to the hypothetical severance obligation owed to Farb. As discussed in the background section, it is clear that Farb and Atherio entered into an agreement to shift the amount of severance he was owed to another Atherio entity. There is a fact issue over why this was done. But even if the Court assumes the worst-that the severance obligation was fraudulently concealed from Atherio's books to facilitate the close of the Agreement-it is equally clear that this severance obligation was never paid. And because the obligation to Farb was never paid, Atherio's value could not have been affected by it. Thus, the\n   facts underlying the fraud-the existence of this undisclosed liability-could not have been a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs' economic loss. Plaintiffs argue, without evidence, that the fact that this obligation wasn't paid is proof that Atherio was poorly managed, unable to meet its obligations, and heading towards failure with Cory at the helm.

First, Cory cites Stewart's deposition as evidence Stewart knew Farb had resigned shortly after the close in July 2013. Doc. 144, Cory's Br. Summ. J., 51. When asked when he learned that Farb was no longer CFO of Atherio, Stewart stated: \"Probably July [2013] when they couldn't pay our bills. We knew that we didn't have anyone running the financial back office of Atherio.... [A]nd they told us he had left and they were looking for a controller.\" Doc. 145-13, Cory's\n   App'x, 280-81 (Stewart's Dep.). And when asked \"so almost immediately after the close, you learned that Farb was no longer CFO,\" Stewart responded: \"I was told Farb wasn't there, that he had resigned and he was gone. And they immediately started falling apart.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Cory next points to portions of O'Connor's deposition. When asked when she learned of Farb's resignation, O'Connor responded: \"Let's see. We sold at the end of June 2013. I can't specifically give you a date and time. Potentially that fall. I honestly-again, it was five years ago. I honestly don't know the answer to it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When asked when he learned that Farb resigned, he testified: \"We figured out he resigned somewhere at the beginning of the 202 [proceeding] when we started reading his resignation papers.\" Doc. 156-5, Pls.' App'x, 863. Because that proceeding was initiated in January 2015, Plaintiffs argue the lawsuit was timely. Stewart also testified he never learned about the \"side agreements\" involving Farb's severance obligation until discovery during this litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Reviewing the arguments and evidence presented by the parties, the Court finds there is a genuine fact issue as to when this cause of action accrued.

Cory's Release Defense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Cory next insists that he alone is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs released their claims against him in a previous agreement (the \"Release\"). Doc. 144, Cory's Br. Summ. J., 12-17. Plaintiffs, in response, argue that they are not bound by the Release because they never signed it or agreed to be bound by it, and that they never gave anyone authority to sign it on their behalf. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 47-48. Cory counters that (1) Furst had both actual and apparent authority to enter into the Release on Plaintiffs' behalf and (2) Plaintiffs should be bound by the Release because they had knowledge of and accepted benefits from that agreement. In their surreply, Plaintiffs argue that (1) Furst's testimony is inadmissible and should be not be considered and (2) while they may have had knowledge that an agreement was being reached to allow Cory to depart from Atherio, they did not know it involved a release of claims. Doc. 174-1, Pls.' Surreply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court will not reach this issue at this time. Because the Court is granting summary judgment against Plaintiffs' claims and because Cory has a counterclaim remaining based on the Release (Doc. 161) that the Court is unwilling to resolve on these motions, the Court will instruct the parties, in an order to follow, on how to proceed with this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    E. Claims Sounding in Contract, Not Tort\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Farb and Furst's final argument is that Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because they sound in contract, not tort. Doc. 140, Farb &amp; Furst's Mot. for Summ. J., 20-21. Plaintiffs respond first by noting that the parties contractually agreed that Plaintiffs could bring a fraud claim without being subject to a \"bootstrapping\" argument. Doc. 156, Pls.' Resp., 55-56. Plaintiffs respond second by asserting that their fraud claims arise from Defendants breach of a separate tort-law duty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs\n   have not bootstrapped a fraud claim here.

The parties dispute what is required to satisfy the causation element.
