Newman, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Social Security disability benefits appeal is before the undersigned for disposition based upon the parties' consent. Doc. 7. At issue is whether the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") erred in finding Plaintiff not \"disabled\" and therefore unentitled to Disability Insurance Benefits (\"DIB\"). This case is before the Court on Plaintiff's Statement of Errors (doc. 10), the Commissioner's memorandum in opposition (doc. 11), Plaintiff's reply (doc. 12), the administrative record (doc. 5),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before reaching the merits of Plaintiff's appeal, the Court feels compelled to take pause and address a preliminary matter. At the Social Security hearing below, ALJ Motta submitted that, \"[District Courts] don't read evidence ...\" and reiterated, on the record, \"None of them read the evidence to the detail that the ALJ does.\" PageID 958.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   These statements are, at a minimum, troubling and inaccurate. Social Security cases make up a significant portion of federal court litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Southern District\n   of Ohio's Dayton seat of court, federal law clerks serving magistrate Judges spend a substantial percentage of their time devoted to reviewing and analyzing Social Security Appeals. Unbeknownst to many, countless hours are spent by District Court Judges, Magistrate Judges, and their law clerks pouring through medical records to ensure that each claimant receives a fair and appropriate review under controlling law. In most appeals, these medical records are several hundred pages in length. Each record is carefully and thoroughly considered as part of the appellate review process in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   These realities stand in stark contrast to the ALJ's blithe assertion. On a disability benefits appeal, District Courts are\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to determine whether an ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Necessarily involved in this determination is a thorough review of the medical evidence of record.\n   <em>\n    Hephner v. Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"926420\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/574/359/\">\n    574 F.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1978) (\"In determining whether the Commissioner's findings are supported by substantial evidence, the Court must consider\n   <em>\n    the record as a whole\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). Indeed, after such a review, this Court frequently finds ALJs' non-disability findings unsupported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   District Courts are hesitant to reward immediate benefits on remand, but this is not due, as the ALJ avows, to a derelict review of the evidence. Rather, District Courts are conscientious about overstepping the heightened standard, which requires\n   <em>\n    overwhelming\n   </em>\n   proof of disability, before the granting of immediate benefits on remand.\n   <em>\n    Mowery v.

PageID 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After an initial denial of her application, Plaintiff received a hearing before ALJ Carol Bowen on June 1, 2011. PageID 97-127. ALJ Bowen issued a written decision on August 1, 2011 finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 131-47. The Appeals Council granted Plaintiff's request for review, vacated ALJ Bowen's non-disability finding, and remanded the case to the ALJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   for further proceedings.

The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review, PageID 1022, and Plaintiff filed an appeal with this Court, PageID 966.

ALJ Motta issued a written decision on June 14, 2017 again affording little weight to Dr. Kim's opinion and finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 847. Specifically, ALJ Motta found at Step Five that, based upon Plaintiff's RFC to perform a reduced range of light work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   including a limitation of frequent handling, \"there were jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy that [Plaintiff] could have performed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2039525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review of ALJ Motta's decision, making her non-disability finding the final administrative decision of the Commissioner.

PageID 983-84. Dr. Kim was the only physician to review Plaintiff's 2011 EMG results documenting moderate bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and, based on that review, limited Plaintiff to occasional handling. PageID 761.

PageID 984.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On remand, ALJ Motta flouted these instructions. She unilaterally concluded -- without obtaining the mandated additional medical evidence -- that the EMG results and Dr. Kim's \"mildly positive\" findings could not support his opinion that Plaintiff was capable of occasional handling.
