Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-39-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 40-39-218 (2018). Pending before the Court are the cross motions for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff John Doe and Defendant David B. Rausch, Director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\"TBI\") [Docs. 28, 45]. Both motions have been fully briefed [Docs. 31, 40, 48, 51, 54, 57], counsel presented their arguments on March 11, 2019, and the motions are ripe for determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 28] will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   and the Defendant's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 45] will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts as set forth in the Amended Complaint are largely undisputed. In 2006, Plaintiff was charged with several sex offenses involving a minor victim, described as eleven (11) years old, in the State of North Carolina [Doc. 52 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 15, 2006, Plaintiff pled guilty to the charge of Indecent Liberties with a Child, in violation of N.C. Stat. 14-202.1 [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9]. As a consequence of his guilty plea and conviction, Plaintiff was required to and did register as a sex offender on the State of North Carolina's Sex Offender Registry [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11]. After relocating to Tennessee, Plaintiff was required to and did register as a sex offender on the State of Tennessee's Sex Offender Registry (the \"Registry\") [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12]. Plaintiff has continued to report annually with the Registry and complied with the requirements of the Act [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff admits that when he goes in for his annual reporting, he asks the officer of the registering agency whether there have been any changes to the registration form [Doc. 45-2 at p. 8]. Plaintiff is given the opportunity to ask questions and the officer always answers any questions he has [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 9-10]. Plaintiff denies that he has had any logistical difficulties with the actual reporting process, other than instances\n   when he has been short on funds and the registering agency has allowed him to pay his annual registration fee late [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 10-11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Tennessee first adopted a sex offender registration law in 1994 [Doc. 52 at \u00b6 20]. The 1994 law was repealed and replaced in 2004 [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21]. The Act has been amended several times since 2004, including the 2014 Amendment of which plaintiff complains [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22]. Prior to the 2014 Amendment, registrants who were not subject to the lifetime registration requirement could apply to the TBI for removal from the Registry after ten years [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23]. In 2014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-39-207\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-39-207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   was amended to state as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (g)(1) An offender required to register under this part shall continue to comply with the registration, verification and tracking requirements for the life of that offender, if that offender: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (C) Has been convicted of an offense in which the victim was a child of twelve (12) years of age or less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-39-207\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-39-207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1)(C). Thus, prior to the 2014 Amendment and at the time of his guilty plea, Plaintiff was required to remain on the registry for only ten (10) years [Doc. 52 at \u00b6 23]. The effect of the 2014 Amendment requires that he comply with the Act for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Generally speaking, the Act requires sex offenders to provide correct, detailed personal information to the state database of sex offenders, some of which is included in an internet-accessible public sex offender registry [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21]. Offenders must report in-person annually to verify and update their registration information [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21]. The Act imposes geographic restrictions on where registered offenders may live, work, or \"be upon or remain\" or \"stand [or] sit idly\" [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-39-207\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-39-207\">\n    at \u00b6 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040-39-211\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-39-211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (d) ]. Registered offenders must provide advance notification of travel outside of the state or country [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-39-204\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-39-204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ; Doc. 56 at pp. 14-15]. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Act may subject an offender to fines or felony criminal charges [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040-39-208\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-39-208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40-39-211 ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the ten-year anniversary of his initial registration, Plaintiff contacted the TBI requesting his removal from the Registry [Doc. 52 at \u00b6 15]. The TBI informed Plaintiff that it needed additional information based on a 2014 Amendment which required a registered offender to remain on the Registry for life if the offense involved a victim twelve (12) years of age or younger [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16]. With the assistance of counsel, Plaintiff submitted the requested information [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17]. The TBI denied Plaintiff's request to be removed from the Registry, citing the 2014 Amendment [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to his request to be removed from the Registry, the Plaintiff held a good job as a sales representative, which required that he make deliveries within a varying geographical area [Doc. 56 at p. 4]. Plaintiff was \"completely straight\" with his employer, who was aware of plaintiff's status on the Registry [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 6-7]. The company made accommodations for deliveries to places that Plaintiff could not go, such as schools, to be handled by other employees [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7]. However, when Plaintiff learned that he would not be removed from the Registry, his employer was no longer willing to continue those accommodations indefinitely and Plaintiff was terminated [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 6, 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to the job loss, Plaintiff testified that he is not able to attend many family functions that take place in a park or to travel out of state without receiving advance permission from both Tennessee and the visiting state [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 12-15]. Plaintiff is not allowed to decorate his house for holidays such as Halloween or\n   Christmas [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 16-17]. Plaintiff complains that his picture is published in certain local newspapers sold at convenience stores - \"a Thrifty Nickel-type deal\" - that includes a section on individuals listed on the Registry [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 19-20]. Finally, Plaintiff complains that his status as a sex offender is listed on his photo identification [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The instant case was filed on May 19, 2017 [Doc. 1].

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether Plaintiff's Claims are Time-Barred\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant raises a timeliness argument that must be addressed first. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claims are barred by the one-year statute of limitations for civil rights claims in Tennessee,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-3-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's cause of action accrued when the changes to the statute became applicable to him [Doc. 40 at pp. 3-5; Doc. 48 at pp. 4-5]. Because the 2014 Amendment of which he complains\n   became effective on July 1, 2014, Plaintiff knew or should have known at that time that he was subject to the lifetime registration requirement. However, he did not file this action until May 19, 2017, almost three years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that the discovery rule applies and notes that he did not contact the TBI about removal from the Registry until the ten-year anniversary of his initial registration, or in 2016 [Doc. 51 at pp. 1-3; Doc. 54 at pp. 2-4]. Thus, he argues that he was not harmed until the TBI denied his request for removal from the Registry. Because this action was filed within one year of his rejection for removal from the Registry, Plaintiff contends that this action is timely. Plaintiff also notes that he was not eligible to apply for removal from the Registry until 2016, ten years after his conviction, and thus he could not have sued to correct a \"non-existent wrong\" prior to that time [Doc. 51 at p. 3; Doc. 54 at p. 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is well settled that in Tennessee claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are subject to a one-year statute of limitations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-3-104\">\n    Tenn.

It directly regulates where registrants may go in their daily lives and compels them to interrupt those lives with great frequency in order to appear in person before law enforcement to report even minor changes to their information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant points to earlier challenges to Tennessee's sex offender registry law,\n   <em>\n    Cutshall v.

Defendant is correct that the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   challenged several provisions of the Michigan sex offender statutes, whereas the instant case deals with a challenge to the Tennessee sex offender law and those laws are not identical. And, Defendant is also correct that there are factual differences in the impact of the Tennessee statute on the Plaintiff and the impact of the Michigan statute on the\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs. Further, the Court notes that the instant case challenges one provision of the Act - the 2014 Amendment which retroactively requires Plaintiff to comply with all other provisions of the Act for life. Nonetheless, the Court finds that a careful review of the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   - and other authority - as it relates to the instant record is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   a. Does the 2014 Amendment Inflict What Has Been Regarded in History and Tradition as Punishment?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Act, like the Michigan statute in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , resembles the ancient punishments of banishment and shaming by grouping sex offenders into two categories of \"sex offenders\" and \"violent sex offenders.\" Plaintiff argues that, pursuant to the 2014 Amendment, he is now treated as a \"violent sex offender\" who must register for life simply based on the age of the victim, rather than on an individualized assessment of his risk of future violations. Although Plaintiff agreed at the time of his guilty plea to be subject to the requirements of the Act for a period of ten years, he is now subject to the requirements of the Act for life [Doc. 31 at pp. 10-11]. Defendant points out that Plaintiff is not classified as a \"violent sexual offender,\" rather, he is listed as an \"offender against children\" and this information is already publicly available based on his conviction of \"Indecent Liberties with a Minor\" [Doc. 40 at p. 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   describes legal punishment as follows: (1) it involves pain or other consequences typically considered unpleasant; (2) it follows from an offense against legal rules; (3) it applies to the actual (or supposed) offender; (4) it is intentionally administered by people other than the offender; and (5) it is imposed and administered by an authority constituted by a legal system against which the offense was committed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting H.L.A. Hart,\n   <em>\n    Punishment and Responsibility\n   </em>\n   4-5 (1968)). The\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the Michigan statute specifically resembled the punishment of banishment as it related to the geographical restrictions on where registrants could live or work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    at 701-702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   court found that the Michigan statute resembled \"traditional shaming punishments\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   by publishing tier classifications based on \"the state's estimation of present dangerousness without providing for any individualized assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally,\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   concluded that the Michigan statute resembles the punishment of \"parole/probation\" because of the numerous restrictions on where registrants can live and work and the requirement that they report in person, rather than by phone or mail.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the instant case, the requirements of the Act do not impose pain, but they do impose unpleasant consequences on Plaintiff that flow from a criminal conviction and are administered by the TBI. Yes, Plaintiff's criminal conviction is a matter of public record, but the Act requires Defendant to publish that information, along with much personal information about each registrant - date of birth, home and work addresses, driver's license number, license plate number and description of all vehicles, etc. - on a publicly accessible website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Code Ann. 40-39-206(d). Plaintiff testified that his name and photograph are often included in local news publications about sex offenders and his status as a sex offender is printed on his identification. These provisions resemble the traditional punishment of shaming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   More importantly, although Plaintiff lives where he wants to live, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the geographic restrictions on where he can work have had a substantial impact on him. Plaintiff testified that he lost a good job because he could not make deliveries to schools and his employer was unwilling to make exceptions for him indefinitely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Sex Offenders are forced to tailor much of their lives around these school zones, and, ...they often have great difficulty in finding a place where they may legally live or work.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiff cannot attend family gatherings that take place in a public park. He testified, \"I'm very close with family, and it's really horrible that I'm not allowed - I've just got to sit at home while everybody is keeping touch\" [Doc. 56 at p. 13]. Plaintiff has been forbidden from decorating his house for holidays. As Plaintiff testified, \"[y]ou can't call it anything other than punishment when you put somebody under house arrest for a holiday\" [Doc. 56 at p. 16]. He has been told by officers on more than one occasion, \"[t]hey don't want to see my porch light, they don't want to see decorations, and they better see my face ... when they knock on my door, which means I am stuck in my house for the entire day of Halloween\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 16-17]. With respect to this restriction, Plaintiff commented, \"I never found that in the rules, but this is a man carrying a gun with handcuffs that can take me to jail. And, you know, yeah, I'll have my day in court, but how long am I going to sit in jail before that?\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"surely something is not 'minor and indirect' just because no one is actually being lugged off in cold irons bound....those irons are always in the background since failure to comply with these restrictions carries with it the threat of serious punishment, including imprisonment\"). Thus, the restrictions of the Act also resemble the traditional punishment of banishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the reporting and travel requirements, similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , are much like the punishment of probation or parole. Registrants must update changes in their information within 48 hours,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-39-203\">\n    Tenn.

Code Ann. \u00a7 40-39-204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and Plaintiff must obtain advance permission to travel to another jurisdiction [Doc. 56 at pp. 14-15]. Because of the travel restriction, Plaintiff did not attend his sister's college graduation because it was not \"worth going through all the hoops to go\n   up there and turn around and come back\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 15-16]. Registrants must disclose any \"electronic mail address information, any instant message, chat or other Internet communication name or identity information that the person uses or intends to use.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-39-203\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-39-203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7). As another court has noted, while this type of provision is not so restrictive as to prohibit the use of the Internet and social media, the Act provides law enforcement a supervisory tool to monitor registered sex offenders using email and social media.\n   <em>\n    Millard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267123\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/1211/#p1223\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this provision \"resembles the supervisory aspects of parole and probation, and complements and continues the states' comprehensive supervision of registered sex offenders even after they are released from the express provisions of their parole or probation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267123\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/1211/#p1223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, the Court agrees that the restrictions of the Act are much like traditional punishment, particularly when those restrictions are imposed for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   b. Does the 2014 Amendment Impose an Affirmative Disability or Restraint?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, much like restrictions in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the Act \"places innumerable and significant restrictions on registrants\" [Doc. 31 at p. 11]. As noted above, the Act places restrictions on where registrants may live, work, or \"be upon or remain.\" Much like the restrictions in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the Act puts \"significant restraints on how registrants may live their lives.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff is restricted on where he can live, work, gather with family, travel, and how he can celebrate holidays. He must report in-person annually for as long as he is on the registry, now for life pursuant to the 2014 Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267123\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/1211/#p1223\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . True, as Defendant points out, Plaintiff lives where he wants to live and he does not have children, thus avoiding some of the obstacles faced by the\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs. Nevertheless, the Act's restrictions are \"direct restraints on personal conduct,\" particularly \"since failure to comply with these restrictions carries with it the threat of serious punishment, including imprisonment.\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This factor also weighs in favor of punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   c. Does the 2014 Amendment Promote the Traditional Aims of Punishment?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Act promotes the traditional aims of punishment because it serves as a permanent incapacity for someone required to register for life [Doc. 31 at pp. 12-13]. The\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   court opined that the Michigan statute advanced the traditional aims of punishment: incapacitation, retribution, and specific and general deterrence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court gave this factor little weight because \"many of these goals can also rightly be described as civil and regulatory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While this factor does not strongly weigh in Plaintiff's favor, it is not without some heft. The restrictions on living, working, loitering, and traveling impose certain incapacities on Plaintiff that are now permanent by operation of the 2014 Amendment. The restrictions are retributive as they are imposed based solely on Plaintiff's offense of conviction and not on any present assessment of his potential to reoffend. And some of the Act's restrictions are intended to deter recidivism, such as limiting his access to places where children may be. The Court finds that the Act generally promotes the traditional aims of punishment, particularly as those restrictions now apply to Plaintiff for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   d. Does the 2014 Amendment Have a Rational Connection to a Non-Punitive Purpose?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the 2014 Amendment does not have a rational relation\n   to a non-punitive purpose because Defendant cannot present proof that the Amendment accomplishes the legislative findings set forth in the Act. Plaintiff notes that the Act has no provision for an individualized assessment of whether any registrant is likely to reoffend [Doc. 31 at pp. 14-15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   cited this as \"a most significant factor\" in determining whether the effects of the statute are punitive.\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    538 U.S. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The legislative findings set forth in the Act include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 \"Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are violent sexual offenders who present an extreme threat to the public safety.

Code Ann. \u00a7 40-39-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Thus, the Act articulates several non-punitive purposes: protecting public safety, reducing recidivism, and public scrutiny of criminal justice and mental health systems that interface with sex offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The difficulty, much like in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , is that the present record is bereft of any factual support that the restrictions of the Act accomplish those goals. Defendant has presented no information or studies to show how the residential, work, or travel restrictions of the Act have protected public safety or reduced recidivism by registered offenders. Nor is there any information or attempt to link the restrictions of the Act to the success of the criminal justice or mental health systems in dealing with those offenders. Instead, these stated legislative purposes appear to be supported by popular stereotypes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056135\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/696/#p699\">\n    834 F.3d at 704-705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , rather than any individualized assessment of dangerousness. Most importantly, as applied to Plaintiff, there is no evidence or argument that the restrictions of the Act have kept him from re-offending or that requiring him to comply with the Act for life will do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274372\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/951/#p958\">\n    249 F.Supp.3d at 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[a]n individualized\n   assessment helps to ensure that a statute's particularly harsh disability or restraint is rationally related to a non-punitive purpose\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922661\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/556/#p560\">\n    823 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   575 ). Rather, they have cost him a good job and isolated him from family gatherings. While the Court does not conclude that the Defendant\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   demonstrate that the restrictions of the Act are rationally related to a non-punitive purpose, the Defendant has not done so in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 960 (\"[t]he lack of evidence eliminates the possibility that the [defendant's] action was rational\").

Is the 2014 Amendment Excessive With Respect to This Purpose?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Act is excessive because the Defendant cannot show that the Act's negative effects are counterbalanced by any positive effects [Doc. 31 at pp. 15-16]. As with the previous factor, the record is silent as to any positive effects of the Act. There is no information on how the living, working, loitering, traveling, and reporting restrictions have improved public safety or prevented recidivism. There is no information in the record on how these restrictions on Plaintiff have brought any positive effects. Nor has there been any attempted argument that requiring Plaintiff's compliance with the Act for life, rather than just ten years, has or will produce any positive effects.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267123\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/1211/#p1223\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]hese sweeping registration and disclosure requirements - in the name of public safety but not linked to a finding that public safety is at risk in a particular case - are excessive in relation to [the statute's] expressed public safety objective\"). The Court cannot speculate whether the Defendant\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   produce such information or not. Based on the present record, the Defendant has not shown that the negative effects of the Act are counterbalanced by any positive effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   f. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant suggests that the Act's restrictions may inconvenience the Plaintiff, but they do not impose a\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   burden [Doc. 57 at p. 2]. Defendant argues that the instant case is \"more akin to\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   \" where the Tenth Circuit rejected an Ex Post Facto challenge to the Oklahoma Sex offender Registration Act. The\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   plaintiff challenged the residency, reporting, and loitering restrictions of the Oklahoma statute and the Tenth Circuit concluded that these provisions did not have a punitive effect.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922661\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/556/#p560\">\n    823 F.3d at 560-61, 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, the Plaintiff challenges one provision - the requirement that he must comply with\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   restrictions of the Act for life. While each restriction, considered in isolation, might be characterized as an inconvenience, the Court considers their cumulative lifetime impact on Plaintiff in light of the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   Court's instruction that the above factors are merely \"useful guideposts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    538 U.S. at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the actual effect of lifetime compliance with the Act is punitive as it relates to Plaintiff. The Act has limited where he can live, work, gather with family, and travel without any individualized assessment of whether those restrictions are indeed necessary to protect the public from any future crimes he may commit. There has been no showing that the benefits to the State outweigh the negative consequences to Plaintiff. There has been no individualized attempt to justify the continued imposition of these restrictions on Plaintiff for life. Moreover, the State has not presented any countervailing evidence to refute the Plaintiff's \"clearest proof\" of the punitive effects of the Act on him. The Court finds that the retroactive imposition of lifetime compliance with the Act is an unconstitutional Ex Post Facto law as applied to the\n   Plaintiff. Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, the Court makes plain what has been implicit in the foregoing analysis: the challenge to the 2014 Amendment is an \"as applied\" challenge and the Court's conclusion is that the 2014 Amendment is unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiff. \"In an as-applied challenge, the plaintiff contends that application of the statute in the particular context in which he has acted, or in which he proposes to act, would be unconstitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Women's Medical Prof. Corp. v.
