Jones, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff Judy A. Atkins brings this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that her former employer, defendant Smyth County Virginia School Board, and her former coworker, defendant Kevin Leonard, discriminated against her by creating a hostile work environment and constructively discharging her because of her sex. Atkins also brings a claim of assault under state law. The defendants have moved to dismiss the Complaint. For the reasons that follow, I will grant the Motion to Dismiss in part, and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Complaint alleges the following facts, which I must accept as true for the purpose of deciding the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Judy A. Atkins began working for defendant Smyth County Virginia School Board (\"School Board\") as a substitute teacher, and she later became a full-time cook in the cafeteria at Atkins Elementary School in Atkins, Virginia. In 2008, she became the school's Cafeteria Manager. In this role, she was responsible for preparing menus; ordering, storing, and preparing food; supervising cafeteria employees; and the accounting and reporting of the cafeteria's operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Atkins became the Cafeteria Manager, defendant Kevin Leonard, a custodian employed by the School Board at Atkins Elementary School and Atkins' estranged brother-in-law, began a pattern of stopping what he was doing whenever he saw her and staring, leering, and gawking at her. He would also snarl, grimace, and mumble in a menacing tone at her. This conduct disturbed and frightened Atkins and interfered with her ability to work. Leonard also behaved this way towards other women who worked in the cafeteria, as well as female teachers and staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Atkins reported this conduct to her supervisor, Phillip Griffin, and the school principal, Gary Roberts. Atkins alleges that they responded that \"boys will be boys,\" \"he's harmless,\" and \"that's just how he is,\" and they did not take any action to stop Leonard's conduct. Compl. \u00b6 19, ECF No. 1. Another cafeteria employee, identified by Atkins as \"Employee Buck,\" told Griffin that Leonard's conduct frightened her, and Griffin responded that \"that's how he is,\" and took no action. Compl. \u00b6 20, ECF No. 1. Leonard's conduct continued, and Buck resigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Leonard would move garbage cans from the dining area to the back of the kitchen, he would routinely and intentionally bump the garbage can against Atkins' chair or desk while she was seated at it, although there was space for him to pass without touching her. He also snarled and grimaced at her. This conduct frightened Atkins and interrupted her work. Leonard also set up a table in the kitchen for his meals and breaks, where he stared and gawked at Atkins and other women working in the kitchen. Atkins reported this behavior to Griffin, but he dismissed it as insignificant and took no action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Leonard's conduct became more frequent and intimidating to Atkins in 2016 and 2017. During this time, Leonard continued to stare, gawk, and snarl at her. In addition, the following events occurred between September and November 2017. Leonard forcefully pushed a garbage can into Atkins from behind her, almost knocking her off her feet, while snarling and scowling. Leonard also regularly used a leaf blower to blow trash and gravel onto Atkins' and other cafeteria workers' vehicles. He also placed trash and paper under the windshield wipers of Atkins' and other women's vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On a day when the cafeteria was using disposable dishes and utensils, Leonard demanded that Atkins \"get her rear end over at the dishwasher and wash dishes.\" Compl. \u00b6 24(c), ECF No. 1. Leonard always became angry and abusive towards Atkins when the school used disposable products in the cafeteria because it increased his workload. Atkins reported this incident to Griffin, who did not address Leonard's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Atkins was giving Halloween candy to students, Leonard forcefully grabbed the cart in her hands and jerked her out of the cafeteria doorway, yelling, \"get your hindend out of the way and go do your\n   job.\" Compl. \u00b6 24(d), ECF No. 1. Atkins suffered strained tendons as a result of this incident. When Atkins was moving a garbage can to clean under it, Leonard rushed at her and threw the garbage can towards her, almost knocking her over. He also made a fist and threatened to punch her, but stopped before hitting her. Atkins reported these encounters, along with Leonard's continued bullying and gawking, to Griffin and Roberts, but they did not take any action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One day when Atkins arrived at work, she found that her computer was not working. The school's technical support determined that the power cords and inputs had been switched. Another day, Atkins discovered that a tray of strawberries that she had left in the refrigerator had been dumped on the floor. Atkins suspected that Leonard had interfered with her computer and the strawberries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In late October 2017, Atkins and two other female cafeteria workers met with Griffin to discuss the school's response to their complaints regarding Leonard's behavior. Griffin told them that the matter had been considered and no changes would be made, and that they could file a written grievance if they were unsatisfied with this result. On the same day, Atkins' husband came to the school to confront Leonard regarding his continued harassment of Atkins. At that time, Atkins was not aware of her husband's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Atkins filed a written grievance regarding Leonard's behavior, which was denied because the harassment and bullying was not sexual in nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because of Leonard's continued employment at the school and the fear and anxiety Atkins felt in her workplace, Atkins resigned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, Atkins filed the present Complaint against the School Board and Leonard. The Complaint asserts that the action is brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202000\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)-2 (\"Title VII\"). Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. Count One of the Complaint alleges that the School Board is vicariously liable for Leonard's conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior; Count Two alleges that Leonard's conduct constituted sexual harassment in violation of Title VII; Count Three asserts a state law claim of assault against Leonard; Count Four contends that Adkins was constructively discharged because the School Board failed to adequately investigate or take any action against Leonard; and Count Five alleges that Leonard's conduct created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Atkins alleges that she suffered lost wages, loss of earning capacity, inconvenience,\n   anxiety, depression, nightmares, headaches, nausea, panic, and other forms of emotional pain and suffering as a result of Leonard's conduct toward her. She seeks back pay, front pay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees. The defendants have moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The Motion to Dismiss is ripe for decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Federal pleading standards require that a complaint contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must \"state[ ] a plausible claim for relief\" that \"permit[s] the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct\" based upon its \"judicial experience and common sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

She also alleges that his conduct towards her was because of her sex. In their Motion to Dismiss, the defendants contend that Atkins has failed to state a hostile work environment claim against the School Board because Leonard's behavior was not based on her sex and was not sufficiently severe or pervasive, and because his conduct was not imputable to the School Board. They also argue that to the extent Atkins brings Counts Two and Five against Leonard, she has failed to state a claim under Title VII because it only proscribes acts by employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it is unlawful for an employer \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). \"Since an employee's work environment is a term or condition of employment, Title VII creates a hostile working environment cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

To state a hostile work environment claim, a female plaintiff must show that the alleged conduct \"(1) was unwelcome, (2) was based on her sex, (3) was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive work environment, and (4) was imputable to her employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Ocheltree v.

However, I find that at the motion to dismiss stage, Atkins has alleged facts making it plausible that Leonard's conduct was because of her sex. Atkins was not required to show that Leonard was motivated by sexual desire or that he used sex-specific language. Instead, she alleges that Leonard's conduct was directed only at female employees - she alleges that his leering, snarling, and grimacing was directed at her and other female employees, and he used a leaf blower to blow trash onto female employees' vehicles. She also alleges that other women were frightened by Leonard's conduct and joined her in raising complaints about it.

However, I find that although some of Leonard's alleged conduct may not be sufficiently severe or pervasive, Atkins has alleged conduct sufficient to show that a reasonable person would perceive the environment to be hostile. Atkins has alleged that Leonard's conduct occurred frequently - he leered at her whenever he saw her, and he routinely hit her chair with a garbage can while she was seated at it. In addition, Atkins has alleged conduct that was physically threatening - Leonard hit her from behind with a garbage can; threw a garbage can at her; forcefully pulled a tray from her hands, causing injury; and raised his arm and threatened to punch her. Moreover, the physical contact that Leonard made with Atkins on multiple occasions, although with a garbage can rather than his person, is severe conduct that plausibly interfered with her work performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to the fourth element - whether the alleged harasser's conduct\n   was imputable to the employer - the employer's liability depends on the status of the harasser.\n   <em>\n    Vance v.

The defendants focus on Atkins' written grievance, which she alleges the School Board investigated but denied after determining that the alleged conduct was not sexual in nature. They argue that in light of this determination, remedial action was not required, and the School Board was not negligent in controlling working conditions. I disagree with the defendants and find that Atkins has alleged facts making it plausible that the School Board was negligent. First, the employer need only know of the harassment for the conduct to be imputed to it; employees are not required to satisfy the elements of a hostile work environment claim when notifying their employers of harassment. Moreover, although the School Board investigated Atkins' written grievance, it failed to take any remedial action, and it failed to investigate or take remedial action in response to Atkins' various verbal complaints regarding Leonard's conduct. Accordingly, Atkins has alleged facts making it plausible that the School Board was negligent in controlling working conditions and thus Leonard's conduct can be imputed to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For these reasons, Atkins has stated a hostile work environment claim against the School Board. However, to the extent that she also brings Counts Two and Five against Leonard, she has failed to state a claim against him because Title VII only governs acts by employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In Count Four, Atkins' final claim arising under Title VII, she alleges that she was forced to quit her employment as a result of the School Board's failure to investigate and respond to her complaints regarding Leonard's conduct. She also asserts that under the working conditions she has alleged, a reasonable person would have quit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Title VII encompasses employer liability for a constructive discharge.\n   <em>\n    Pa.

They note that the last date that Leonard allegedly harassed Atkins was in November 2017, but she did not resign until sometime after she filed her written grievance on January 22, 2018. They contend that because at least two months passed between Leonard's conduct and her resignation, the conduct could not have been sufficiently intolerable. However, I find that even assuming Atkins has shown that her working conditions were objectively intolerable, she has not alleged facts sufficient to show that the School Board's actions were intended to force her to quit. Instead, she alleges that the School Board failed to act in the face of her complaints because it did not find that Leonard's conduct constituted harassment. Moreover, she alleges that her supervisors responded to employee Buck's complaints about Leonard in the same way that they responded to hers, making it less likely that the School Board's intent in dismissing complaints about Leonard was to force Atkins to resign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, Atkins has failed to state a constructive discharge claim against the School Board, and to the extent that she also brings this claim against Leonard, it fails because Title VII does not govern his conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I next turn to Atkins' state-law claims of assault and respondeat superior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Count Three, Atkins alleges that Leonard assaulted her on two occasions - when he hit her from behind with a garbage can, almost knocking her off her feet, and when he grabbed a cart from her hands when she was handing out Halloween candy, jerking her out of the cafeteria doorway. She also alleges that the School\n   Board is vicariously liable for this conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The defendants have not moved to dismiss Count Three as against Leonard, but they have moved to dismiss it as against the School Board, arguing that the doctrine of sovereign immunity shields the School Board from state tort law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In Virginia, a governmental entity is generally immune from liability for torts associated with the performance of governmental functions.\n   <em>\n    Niese v.
