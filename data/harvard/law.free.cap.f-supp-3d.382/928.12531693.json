This motion concerns expert testimony about the DNA sample collected from the right rear door handle of the rental car in which the two men were shot. Elmore moves to exclude testimony by Phillip Hopper from the Serological Research Institute (\"SERI\"), who used a probabilistic genotyping program called Bullet to inform his conclusion that there is \"very strong support\" for the proposition that Elmore contributed DNA to the sample. Elmore's challenge does not require me to decide whether probabilistic genotyping in general or Bullet in particular are reliable and accepted methods of DNA analysis. Instead, the question before me is whether Bullet was validated to analyze the mixture at issue here. Because Bullet was only validated to analyze complex mixtures of up to four contributors, and because Hopper did not reliably conclude that only four people contributed DNA to this mixture, this evidence is not reliable. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Given the genotypes of the contributors, no more than eight alleles could appear at any one locus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20Harv.%20J.L.%20%26%20Tech.%20275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hopper explained in his testimony that SERI often uses DNA profiles of employees and friends during validation studies. A 2018 study found that analysts underestimated 64% of known five-person mixtures and 100% of known six-person mixtures-and characterized all of the mixtures as containing DNA from four individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Krane Decl. \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even with the improvement in amplification technology, other factors present challenges to accurately identifying the number of contributors. The challenge of allele sharing is \"frequently exacerbated by samples that have degraded or which originally contained only a small amount of DNA.\" Kwong at 278. As Hopper testified at the hearing, degradation occurs when DNA breaks off between the bases, which usually happens to larger pieces first. This process occurs naturally over time, although freezing DNA can slow it down. Amplification kits are unable to copy DNA past the point where the breakage has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Probabilistic Genotyping and Bullet\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Probabilistic genotyping is a statistical technique used to analyze DNA mixtures. In 2018, SERI validated the probabilistic genotyping program Bullet for use with two-, three-, and four-person mixtures. Hopper Decl. \u00b6 14. SERI did not seek to validate Bullet for use with five-person mixtures. According to Hopper's testimony, one key advancement of Bullet is its ability to consider the possibility that some alleles are not detectable because they have dropped out of the mixture. Due to degradation or simply low quantities of DNA, not all of a contributor's alleles will necessarily be detectable at every locus. Old technologies excluded individuals as contributors to a sample if just one of that individual's alleles was missing from the sample. By considering dropout, Bullet can account for the likelihood that a person\n   might have contributed even if some alleles are absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bullet calculates a dropout rate based on the serologist's conclusion about how many individuals contributed DNA to the mixture being analyzed. By default, Bullet takes the sum of all the detected peaks and divides it by the number of contributors that the serologist has input, resulting in a probability that dropout has occurred at each individual locus. The serologist can also set a different dropout rate. Very high peaks, which indicate little or no degradation and few if any minor contributors, might suggest that the probability of dropout is zero. With a probability of zero, Bullet will not consider any genotypes that include alleles not detected in the mixture. By contrast, a probability of one will allow for the possibility that any number of alleles might have dropped out and make it effectively impossible to exclude any genotype as a possible contributor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taking this information into account, Bullet then analyzes the genotypes that are possible at a given locus. The program assigns a probability that a given genotype is present compared to others and ultimately produces a likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is a ratio of two probabilities: (1) the probability of the DNA evidence originating from the suspect and unknown persons, and (2) the probability of the DNA evidence originating entirely from unknown persons other than the suspect. Hopper Decl. \u00b6 11. Bullet calculates a likelihood ratio at each locus tested and then multiplies them together in order to arrive at an overall likelihood ratio.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20Harv.%20J.L.%20%26%20Tech.%20275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SERI developed an internal scale to assign a word statement to explain the likelihood ratios Bullet produces.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.

Opposition (\"Oppo.\") [Dkt. No. 2031] 2. Hopper used the recently validated Bullet to conduct the second analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Report. Hopper was aware that a colleague had already analyzed the same items, but he performed his own analysis and did not know that Harmor had concluded that five people contributed to the mixture. Hopper Decl. [Dkt. No. 2031-1] \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26. One mixture was weak and incomplete and thus\n   unsuitable for comparison, and Hopper excluded Elmore as a possible contributor to others. 2018 Report 8-9. The following sections refer to his testing of the right door handle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Amplification and Number of Contributors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, Hopper combined the extracted DNA that remained from Harmor's analysis with the DNA that was extracted from the swabs the government sent with its retesting request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total, he had 0.65 nanograms of DNA to test; SERI recommends that 1 nanogram of DNA be used with GlobalFiler whenever possible. Next, he amplified the alleles using the GlobalFiler kit. Hopper Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 18. The amplified DNA was then loaded onto a genetic analyzer, which displayed each fragment on a graph. Hopper testified that the new graph showed fewer alleles than the 2012 one had, indicating that degradation had taken place in the more than six years since the prior testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Hopper then determined the number of DNA contributors, starting by counting the number of peaks on the electropherogram, each of which represents an allele.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hopper Decl. \u00b6 19. There were seven alleles at two loci: D19S433 (\"D19\") and D22S1045 (\"D22\"). Gov't Ex. 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hopper Decl. \u00b6 19. Because nearly all human beings possess no more than two alleles at a given locus, and because seven was the highest allele count, Hopper concluded that the sample was a mixture of \"at least four contributors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Hopper used the term \"at least\" because \"outside of laboratory controlled conditions, it is impossible to know with certainty the number of contributors to a mixture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The actual number of contributors can be larger than the apparent number because of degradation, allele sharing, and the presence of homozygote contributors.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Hopper ruled out certain signs that might have indicated more than four contributors, starting with peak height imbalance.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-23. The peak heights of alleles from the same contributor are expected to be within about 60 percent of one another. Hopper Decl. \u00b6 20. As a result, when alleles at the same locus have materially different heights, those alleles likely come from different contributors, suggesting more contributors than the number of alleles would otherwise indicate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Hopper did not see peak height imbalance that would cause him to alter his conclusion. At D19, there were two alleles with taller peaks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 3. Because the heights of those peaks were within 60 percent of each other, Hopper concluded that likely came from the same contributor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   although those allele heights could have resulted from allele sharing or the presence of homozygotes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hopper concluded that any of the remaining peaks could pair together in a genotype because they were all fairly short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In analyzing the number of contributors, Hopper also considered stutter peaks and peaks that were below the detection threshold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hopper Decl. \u00b6 21. Below-threshold peaks can be caused by an allele that is present only in a small quantity or an artificial peak created during the amplification process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   He disregards\n   peaks that are below the analytical threshold \"even though it is possible that those disregarded peaks represent alleles from minor contributors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There was one below-threshold peak at D22, and considering that peak would have raised the total number of alleles to eight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Gov't Ex. 3. But because a four-person mixture can result in a locus with eight alleles, this below-threshold peak did not impact Hopper's estimate of contributors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hopper Decl. \u00b6 21. At the hearing, I asked Hopper about a red line appearing to the left of the first peak at D22. He indicated that it could be relevant to his analysis, but he was not able to say what it was without being able to magnify it on the computer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Regarding the two persons of interest-Turner and Elmore-Hopper did not see evidence of allele sharing that would cause him to conclude that there were more than four contributors to the mixture (assuming that both Turner and Elmore contributed).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hopper Decl. \u00b6 23. Turner and Elmore shared no alleles at the two loci where seven alleles were present, and \"all four of their alleles [were] present\" at each of those loci.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Regarding any remaining unknown contributors, Hopper could not rule out the possibility of allele sharing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For all of these reasons, Hopper decided to move forward with his analysis based on his conclusion that there were four contributors to the mixture. He reiterated throughout his testimony that while there could have been more contributors, he decided on the number four because he saw no compelling reason to conclude that it was higher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Likelihood Ratio\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Hopper then used Bullet to calculate a likelihood ratio. Hopper Decl. \u00b6 27. He made several inputs before Bullet conducted the analysis. First, he input his conclusion that the mixture contained four contributors. Second, he assumed that Turner was a contributor to the mixture based on his conclusion that \"the mixture is at least 18 billion times more likely\" if it originated from Turner and three unknown individuals than if it originated from four unknown individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Third, he invoked Bullet's ability to account for dropout at the six loci where Elmore's alleles were absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to Elmore, Hopper concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Assuming Isiah Turner is a contributor to the mixture, the DNA evidence is at least 270 thousand times more likely if it originated from Isiah Turner, Reginald Elmore (item 21A-1), and two unknown, unrelated individuals than if it originated from Isiah Turner and three unknown, unrelated individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29; 2018 Report 8.

Hopper Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After Elmore moved to exclude this testimony, for the purposes of comparison Hopper asked Bullet to calculate a likelihood ratio based on the assumptions that five individuals contributed to the mixture and one was Turner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.

Elmore argues that I must exclude Hopper's opinions because Bullet is not validated to analyze samples like the one at issue here, which according to Elmore likely has more than four contributors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mot. 14. The government counters that just because five-and six-person mixtures are often mischaracterized as four-person mixtures does not mean that this mixture was mischaracterized. Oppo. 6. Having reviewed the papers, heard the experts' testimony, and considered the argument of counsel, I find that the government has not met its burden to show Bullet performed an analysis that it was validated to perform. For a number of reasons, Hopper did not reliably conclude that only four individuals contributed DNA to the mixture at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, the body of research in the record before me shows that five-person mixtures are underestimated as four-person mixtures at a troubling rate-a rate much higher than that associated with four-or three-person mixtures. These errors occur because \"the more individuals present in a mixture, the more likely it is the mixture will hide indications of subsequent individuals, as the relative proportion of present versus absent alleles at each locus increases with each new contributor.\" Krane Decl. \u00b6 13. In other words, as Krane testified, the difficulty in identifying the number of contributors to a complex mixture increases significantly more with each additional contributor. GlobalFiler has improved analysts' ability to accurately identify some complex mixtures by allowing them to evaluate the alleles at more loci.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Krane Decl. \u00b6 13 (citing a study finding that if all alleles from every contributor are visible and there are no other complicating factors, known three-person mixtures are underestimated only in 0.2% of samples). But there remains a high rate of error, particularly for mixtures above four contributors.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. A post-GlobalFiler study revealed that 64% of known five-person mixtures and 100% of known six-person mixtures were underestimated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Most were misidentified as containing DNA from four contributors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Perhaps more importantly, SERI itself has demonstrated an inability to distinguish five-person mixtures from four-person mixtures. During the GlobalFiler validation study, it did not correctly identify a single five-person mixture. Hopper asserted that these errors occurred because \"by coincidence,\" the individuals who contributed DNA to the study shared alleles. But a 100% rate of error\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   gives no confidence in SERI's ability to be accurate if faced with the same coincidence in the real world. During his testimony, Hopper qualified his conclusion about the number of contributors many times over, honestly acknowledging the many reasons why the mixture might have more contributors than four. Indeed, SERI's executive director and chief forensic serologist concluded in 2012 that there were at least five contributors to the mixture. There is simply not enough evidence to conclude reliably that this mixture is a four-person mixture accurately identified by SERI instead of a five-person sample underestimated by SERI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Three facts specific to the sample at issue here cast further doubt on the reliability of Hopper's conclusion. First, he had only 0.65 nanograms of DNA to test, which is 35% below the amount recommended for use with GlobalFiler. Second, more than six years elapsed between the first testing and the second, and Hopper testified that the sample showed signs of degradation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Report 8 (\"Due to the presence of weak typing results at some loci, it is possible that minor components of the mixture have dropped out in the larger loci.\"). Indeed, a side-by-side comparison of the fifteen loci amplified in 2012 and the same ones amplified in 2018 shows more alleles in the prior testing. Both the low quantity of DNA and the degradation of the sample impact the detectability of alleles, which in turn impacts the dropout rate, which in turn underlies all of Bullet's calculations. Finally, there are two loci with seven alleles-and one of those loci has a below-threshold peak that could represent an eighth allele. If that is the case, the sample can be a four-person mixture\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   no two contributes share alleles at that locus, no contributor is a homozygote at that locus, and no additional alleles have dropped out at that locus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The government argues that exclusion of the testimony is not appropriate; instead, Elmore can challenge Hopper's analysis and conclusions during cross-examination. But the number of contributors is a foundational part of every calculation Bullet performs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   If that input is in doubt, the reliability of the entire analysis is necessarily in doubt. To corroborate Hopper's conclusion about the number of contributors, the government put forth the results he obtained after running Bullet with a\n   five-person mixture input.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oppo. 6-7. But Bullet was not validated to test five-person mixtures, and I will not rely on that result for any purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   DNA evidence can have a powerful effect on a jury's evaluation of a criminal case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   John W. Strong,\n   <em>\n    Language and Logic in Expert Testimony: Limiting Expert Testimony by Restrictions of Function, Reliability and Form\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Or.%20L.%20Rev.%20349\">\n    71 Or. L. Rev. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367 n.81 (1992) (\"There is virtual unanimity among courts and commentators that evidence perceived by jurors to be 'scientific' in nature will have particularly persuasive effect.\") (citing cases). If SERI could accurately identify five-person mixtures and if it had validated Bullet to analyze them, then it might have a reliable understanding of how underestimating a five-person mixture impacts the likelihood ratio. That understanding could improve the reliability of Hopper's conclusion on the number of contributors or make it appropriate to allow the government to present two likelihood ratios: one based on four contributors and a second based on five. Then the other problems identified in this Order, such as Harmor's changed testimony, the small testing sample, and the signs of degradation, would be ripe for cross-examination. But there are simply too many reasons to question the reliability of Hopper's conclusion on this foundational issue, which brings the entire analysis outside the parameters of Bullet's validation at SERI. This testimony is not reliable, and it is not admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Elmore's motion to exclude is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The appeal did not impact the case against Elmore, and he requested to be tried separately at the preexisting trial date.
