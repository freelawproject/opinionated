As such, the Court takes judicial notice of the '435 patent's prosecution history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A review of the prosecution history for the '435 patent reflects that the inventor and his counsel did disclose the International Search Report to the PTO, and the search report identifies the Emanuel reference and Emanuel's foreign counterparts. (Doc. No. 61-2, Ex. A at 38-39, 111, 114-16.) Indeed, LG's own allegations acknowledge that the named inventor and his counsel submitted a copy of the International Search Report to the PTO, and the PTO issued an \"acceptance of application\" form indicating that the International Search Report was included in the file. (Doc. No. 17, Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 215, 217.) Thus, both the prosecution history, and LG's own allegations contradict LG's assertion that the International Search Report was not disclosed to the PTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In response, LG argues that this is not fatal to its counterclaim because the counterclaim is also based on the inventor's failure to disclose the Emanuel reference itself along with Emanuel's foreign counterparts and two examination reports. (Doc. No. 74 at 8-11.) But a review of the prosecution history shows that the inventor and his counsel disclosed the International Search Report to the PTO, and the search report specifically identified the Emanuel reference as a published U.S. patent application, listed the relevant portions of the Emanuel reference, and stated what claims in the application for which it is relevant. (Doc. No. 61-2, Ex. A at 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   LG argues that under the PTO's Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (\"MPEP\") rules, the mere submission of a search report is insufficient to satisfy an applicant's duty to disclose in a national stage application. (Doc. No. 74 at 8-9.) In making this argument, LG specifically relies on MPEP \u00a7 609.03 and 1893.03(g). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) MPEP \u00a7 609.03 provides: \"The examiner will consider the documents cited in the international search report in a PCT national stage application when the Form PCT/DO/EO/903 indicates that both the international search report and the copies of the documents are present in the national stage file.\" MPEP \u00a7 609.03 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   MPEP \u00a7 1893.03(g). LG notes that in the \"notice of acceptance of application\" form (the Form PCT/DO/EO/903) for the '435 patent, the PTO examiner only noted that\n   a copy of the international search report itself was present. (Doc. No. 74 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   LG is correct. In the Form PCT/DO/EO/903 at issue, the PTO examiner only notes that the international search report is present in the file. (Doc. No. 61-2, Ex. A at 38-39.) The form does not mention any copies of references being present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nevertheless, a further review of section 609.03 reveals that the listing of the Emanuel in the international search report was still sufficient to disclose that reference for consideration by the PTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   MPEP \u00a7 609.03 provides a list of three scenarios \"regarding references listed in the search report of the international application.\" MPEP \u00a7 609.03. The third scenario concerns references listed in an international search report that will not be considered by the PTO absent further action by the applicant. MPEP \u00a7 609.03 \u00b6 6.55. Section 609.03 instructs the examiner, when appropriate to notify the applicant that: \"The listing of references in the PCT international search report is not considered to be an information disclosure statement (IDS) complying with 37 CFR 1.98. 37 CFR 1.98(a)(2) requires a legible copy of [certain references]....

A at 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The first and second scenarios listed in section 609.03 pertain to situations \"where copies of [the] references are not required under 37 CFR 1.98,\" such as for U.S patent application publications like the Emanuel reference. MPEP \u00a7 609.03 \u00b6\u00b6 6.53, 6.54. In both of these scenarios, section 609.03 explains that the reference will be considered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.98\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the submission of the international search report listing the Emanuel reference as a published U.S. patent application should have been sufficient to disclose that reference to the PTO and for the PTO to consider it under section 609.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In response, at the hearing, LG noted that the examiner did not list Emanuel as one of the references considered on the PTO-892 form for the '435 patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 61-2, Ex. A at 29.) But this is of no consequence because section 609.03 explains that if a reference is properly disclosed through an international search report \"[t]here is no requirement that the examiner list the documents on a PTO-892 form.\" MPEP \u00a7 609.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   LG also noted that its inequitable conduct counterclaim is also based on the inventor and his counsel's failure to disclose Emanuel's foreign counterparts and two examination reports.
