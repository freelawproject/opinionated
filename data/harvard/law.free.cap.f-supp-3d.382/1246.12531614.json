At about 10:20 a.m. on May 7, 2015, Miles was riding in a bus driven by Yolanda McKinney. Miles, who had driven the bus route in the past, was showing McKinney the route. Miles and McKinney were both employed by the City of Birmingham Department of Public Works. Miles worked as a \"crew leader.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Sellers was a commercial truck driver, operating a tractor-trailer for A &amp; S Services Group, LLC, which is not a party to this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sellers was driving westbound on U.S. Highway 78. McKinney entered Highway 78 from Daniel Payne Drive, turning right onto the highway and heading in the same direction as Sellers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Highway 78 is a four-lane highway, with two lanes traveling in the same direction on each side of a median separating the northbound and southbound traffic. Sellers was in the left lane of the two southbound lanes when McKinney entered the highway ahead of him, turning from Daniel Payne Drive into the right southbound lane. McKinney, intending eventually to turn left, moved into the left southbound lane, ahead of Sellers. The front of Seller's truck struck the driver's side of the bus. The bus overturned and skidded on its side. Plaintiff\n   Miles alleges that Sellers was driving in excess of the 50-mile-per-hour speed limit. Sellers has testified that he was driving 50 to 55 miles per hour. McKinney has testified that she saw the truck coming in the left lane, but she thought the truck was a safe distance behind her. The plaintiff has testified that after McKinney turned the bus off Daniel Payne Drive onto Highway 78, she (McKinney) pulled over to the right shoulder of the highway to look for something. The bus remained there several minutes and then was struck by Sellers' truck. (Doc. 44-14, Trial Transcript, pp. 18-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A lawsuit was filed in the Jefferson County Circuit Court by Sellers and the passenger in Sellers' truck, Christina Gordon, against defendants McKinney and the City of Birmingham. Plaintiff Miles as\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a party in that action. Sellers settled his action against the City and McKinney before trial. Gordon's negligence claim proceeded to trial, and a jury found McKinney negligent. Plaintiff Maria Miles filed the instant action against Sellers and CGI in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, alleging negligence, wantonness,\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , negligent entrustment, and negligent hiring, supervision, and training. The case was removed to this court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In responding to the instant motion for summary judgment, plaintiff conceded that defendant CGI is entitled to summary judgment on all claims, and that Sellers is entitled to summary adjudication of the wantonness claim against him. Consequently, the motion for summary judgment in favor of CGI on all claims against it is due to be granted, and the motion is also due to be granted on the claim that Sellers acted wantonly. The court is left to evaluate plaintiff's sole remaining claim of negligence against Sellers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant Sellers asserts that the negligence claim against him is due to be dismissed because: (1) the plaintiff is barred from recovery because she was contributorily negligent, and (2) the plaintiff is barred from recovery by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   because a jury determined that the driver of the bus, McKinney, was negligent and that finding is binding on the plaintiff in this action. In response, the plaintiff asserts that no negligence on the part of the bus driver can be imputed to the plaintiff, and that the elements of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   under Alabama law are not met where the other lawsuit involved different parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Contributory Negligence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant Sellers seeks summary adjudication of plaintiff's negligence claim on the ground that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.

The appellate court affirmed, noting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [The defendant truck driver] made a prima facie showing that Serio was contributorily negligent, entitling it to a summary judgment based on that defense, by establishing that she pulled into the path of the large oncoming truck when she could not have failed to see it had she looked to her left before, or as, she moved forward into the intersection. Her own testimony established that she consciously appreciated the danger posed by pulling onto a highway on which the vehicles traveling have the right-of-way, without first making sure that no vehicle was approaching too closely. She admitted that there was no reason she could not have seen the tractor-trailer truck before she pulled out, given the prevailing conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The danger of pulling out from a stop sign onto a public highway traversed by two-way traffic having the right-of-way and traveling at highway speeds, without making a final observation to one's left sufficiently attentive to detect in the daylight the impending arrival of a truck of such size as to be inescapably obvious to one taking the precaution of making such an observation, is self-evident, and all reasonable people would logically have to conclude that Serio would have, or should have, consciously appreciated that danger when she drove forward into the intersection. Despite Serio's somewhat ambivalent explanation, \"I did not think I saw anything, and I pulled out.... I mean, I didn't see anything. I can't imagine pulling out if I had seen a big truck coming there,\" she essentially acknowledges that an adequate observation to her left would have revealed the approaching truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461312\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/941/960/\">\n    941 So.2d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The plaintiff argues, and the court agrees, that the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Serio\n   </em>\n   is relevant only to the question of whether McKinney, the driver of the bus, was negligent by changing lanes in front of the truck. Even if the comparison between\n   <em>\n    Serio\n   </em>\n   and the instant case compels a conclusion that\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   was negligent, the defendant can prevail only if the court decides\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that McKinney was negligent as a matter of law and that the negligence can be imputed to the plaintiff bus passenger. In support of his argument that McKinney's negligence can be imputed to Miles, Sellers contends that the plaintiff was more than a mere passenger, but was McKinney's supervisor, training her on the bus route. Sellers relies on\n   <em>\n    Shannon v.

The defendant points to the testimony of McKinney, who stated that Miles was \"giving instructions\" to her regarding driving the route. McKinney testified at the state-court trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: Okay. And Ms. Miles, who was in the vehicle with you, she was giving you instructions as to what to do, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: Okay.

In opposition, the plaintiff argues that any negligence by McKinney cannot be imputed to her, and that, even if it could, the issue of negligence and causation are questions of fact to be submitted to the jury and should not be determined by the court on a motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 47, p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Shannon\n   </em>\n   , the sole case relied upon by the defendants in support of imputing the negligence of a driver to a passenger in the vehicle, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed and remanded based upon a jury instruction for contributory negligence where the plaintiff, a passenger, had been giving the driver route instructions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527914\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/291/159/\">\n    279 So.2d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   This evidence clearly shows that the appellant-plaintiff did have a voice as to the route which the driver followed, however, there is absolutely no evidence from which the jury would have found that the appellant-plaintiff had any control over the speed at which the automobile was traveling, the yielding or failure to yield the right of way at intersections, or any other of the elements which contribute to the manner in which the automobile proceeded along the route he selected. It should be noted that the word 'direction' referred to in the above quote from\n   <em>\n    Johnson [v.

The control exercised by the passenger must be over some element contributing to the operation of the automobile which bears a direct relationship to the cause of the accident. It would certainly be improper to maintain that a passenger who had assumed the control of the regulation of the car's air conditioner was chargeable with the driver's negligence in an accident caused by the latter's excessive speed. It is no less improper to charge a passenger with the negligent manner in which the driver operates an automobile over a route selected by such passenger when the passenger has assumed only the direction of the route. A navigator of an airplane is not responsible for a pilot making a faulty landing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The appellant-plaintiff Shannon in the instant case had assumed control over only the route followed by the driver, and this court has been unable to find any evidence in the record from which the jury could have found any causal connection between the route followed and the cause of the accident and injuries. For this reason the control exercised by appellant-plaintiff was not of such a nature as to authorize the imputation of the driver's negligence to the passenger-appellant-plaintiff Shannon under the factual setting of this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Shannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527914\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/291/159/\">\n    279 So.2d at 432-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court finds that Miles's role in giving McKinney instructions on what route\n   to follow is analogous to the role of the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Shannon\n   </em>\n   . There is no evidence that Miles had any responsibility for McKinney's ability to steer, brake, turn, or change lanes. There is no evidence that Miles was \"directing\" McKinney in the moment-to-moment operation of the bus. Even though the defendant refers to Miles as McKinney's supervisor, there is no evidence that anything Miles had authority over had any causal connection to the accident that caused her injuries. The facts presented here do not create a situation in which the court can say, as a matter of law, that all reasonable people would find that the plaintiff was exercising such extensive control over the actual operation of the bus that she herself was contributorily negligent. Based upon all of the arguments and evidence offered in support of and in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the motion to dismiss the plaintiff's negligence claim on the basis of the affirmative defense of contributory negligence is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Res Judicata\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant asserts that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   because the Jefferson County Circuit Court, after a jury trial, determined that McKinney and, through\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , the City of Birmingham were \"negligent and responsible for\" the collision from which Miles's claims arise.

Because Sellers settled his claim, it was never adjudicated on the merits.

Certainly McKinney was not acting as an agent of Miles, and neither the City nor McKinney was representing Miles's interests during the state-court trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is clear that neither the City nor McKinney \"adequately represented\" Miles's interests in the prior suit. Indeed, it is obvious that the City and McKinney had interests adverse to Miles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Enforcing against Miles the judgment rendered against them in the state-court action would effectively deny Miles of due process of law by stripping her of a valuable claim without having had an opportunity to present it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whisman v.

Accordingly, there is no identity of parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even if the parties could be deemed to be the \"same,\" the res judicata argument would be without merit because the causes of action in the two lawsuits have not been shown to be the same. While the negligence asserted by Miles involves the same evidence and arises from the same nucleus of operative fact as the negligence claim asserted by Gordon in the prior case, each injured person owns a \"cause of action\" for her injuries that is personal to herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Multiple persons injured in a single event\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   accrue a cause of action, personal to each injured person; they do not share a single cause of action. Thus, Gordon's cause of action for her injuries is not the same cause of action that Miles alleges for her own personal injuries. The share some of the same evidence and events, but each is unique to each plaintiff. Accordingly, the court finds that the third and fourth elements of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   have not been met and the defendant is not entitled to summary adjudication on the plaintiff's claims on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Consistent with the foregoing discussion of the evidence presented by the defendant in support of the motion for summary judgment and the plaintiff's submission in opposition, the motion for summary judgment is due to be granted in part and denied in part. Because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding negligence and causation, defendant Sellers is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Miles's negligence claim against him. Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment (doc. 42) is due to be and hereby is DENIED as to the plaintiff's claim of negligence against Sellers. Because the plaintiff concedes that the wantonness claim against Sellers is due to be dismissed, the motion is GRANTED as to the wantonness claim against Sellers.
