Morgan's report and recommendation (\"R&amp;R\"), which denied P\u00e9rez's motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 146;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 137 &amp; 143. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   P\u00e9rez's motion (Docket No. 146).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 15, 2019, the Court issued a Memorandum and Order adopting the magistrate judge's R&amp;R, which denied P\u00e9rez's motion to suppress. (Docket No. 143.) Now, P\u00e9rez requests that the Court reconsider its decision. (Docket No. 146.) According to P\u00e9rez, the Court incorrectly relied on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tanguay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228411\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/44/#p49\">\n    787 F.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49-51 (1st Cir. 2015), and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gifford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077673\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/727/92/#p99\">\n    727 F.3d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (1st Cir. 2013), in concluding that the confidential informant's tip sufficiently establishes probable cause for the search warrant without further corroboration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1. P\u00e9rez provides a detailed review of the facts in\n   <em>\n    Tanguay\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gifford\n   </em>\n   and contends that his case is distinguishable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not explicitly provide for motions for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898987\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/288/\">\n    741 F.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 n.2 (1st Cir. 2014) (citation omitted) (\"[M]otions for reconsideration in criminal cases are not specifically authorized either by statute or by rule.\"). The First Circuit Court of Appeals, however, applies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) (\" Rule 59(e)\") to motions for reconsideration arising in the criminal context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673520\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/42/#p53\">\n    573 F.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (1st Cir. 2009) (applying Rule 59(e) to a motion for reconsideration in a criminal case). Although P\u00e9rez does not identify the statutory source for his motion for reconsideration, the Court applies the Rule 59(e) legal standard to P\u00e9rez's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 59(e), a district court will alter its original order only if it \"evidenced a manifest error of law, if there is newly discovered evidence, or in certain other narrow situations.\"\n   <em>\n    Biltcliffe v. CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921934\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/925/#p930\">\n    772 F.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 930 (1st Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). A motion for reconsideration does \"not provide a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures [or] allow a party [to] advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Iverson v. City of Bos.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046501\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/94/#p104\">\n    452 F.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104 (1st Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). \" Rule 59(e) does not exist to allow parties a second chance to prevail on the merits ... [and] is not an avenue for litigants to reassert arguments and theories that were previously rejected by the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson Int'l v. P.R. Hosp. Supply, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420378\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/439/#p441\">\n    322 F.R.D. 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (D.P.R. 2017) (Besosa, J.) (citations omitted). \"Stated another way, a motion for reconsideration is not properly grounded in a request for a district court to rethink a decision it has already made, rightly or wrongly.\"\n   <em>\n    Mor\u00e1n-Vega v. Rivera-Hern\u00e1ndez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8930956\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/381/31/#p36\">\n    381 F.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   P\u00e9rez's motion for reconsideration is unavailing because he neither demonstrates\n   a manifest error of law, nor presents newly discovered evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biltcliffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921934\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/925/#p930\">\n    772 F.3d at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court relied on the legal standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    Tanguay\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gifford\n   </em>\n   in its Memorandum and Order, not\n   <em>\n    Tanguay\n   </em>\n   's and\n   <em>\n    Gifford\n   </em>\n   's underlying facts. (Docket No. 143.) Factual distinctions and alternative legal interpretations, however, do not amount to \"a manifest error of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Long Reef Condo. Homeowners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , No. 2011-0051,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201823040\">\n    2017 WL 1823040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 n.2 (D.V.I. May 5, 2017) (\"[T]he factual distinctions between the cases noted by Defendant do not establish that the Court committed a manifest error of law or fact.\"). Any new argument set forth in P\u00e9rez's motion for reconsideration is based on formerly available evidence and thus could and should have been presented to the Court prior to its opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iverson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046501\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/94/#p104\">\n    452 F.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . P\u00e9rez can no longer raise these arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046501\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/94/#p104\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, all arguments that were previously submitted to the Court in P\u00e9rez's earlier motions cannot be reconsidered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harley-Davidson\n   </em>\n   , 897 F.2d at 616. Having already addressed P\u00e9rez's arguments in the Court's decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 143, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   its Memorandum and Order adopting the magistrate judge's R&amp;R denying P\u00e9rez's motion to suppress (Docket No. 143), and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   P\u00e9rez's motion for reconsideration.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons stated, P\u00e9rez's motion for reconsideration (Docket No. 146) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
