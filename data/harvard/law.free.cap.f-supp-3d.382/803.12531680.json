Plaintiff, Doyle Thornton Teno, III, responded in opposition. (Doc. 45.) The Meads and Iwanski both filed replies. (Docs. 46, 47.) By leave of Court, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply to Iwanski's reply. (Doc. 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff and three of the four Defendants in this case hold positions with Anderson County, Tennessee. Plaintiff is the Delinquent Tax Attorney and Deputy Trustee for Anderson County. Iwanski is the Trustee of Anderson County, in which capacity he supervises Plaintiff's duties as Deputy Trustee. Iwanski is also the Chairman of the Anderson County Finance Committee, which is responsible for the office in which Plaintiff's Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Form W-2 is kept. Emert and Steve Mead are both members of the Anderson County Board of Commissioners. The fourth Defendant, Leslie Mead, holds no position with Anderson County but is married to Steve Mead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Emert ran against incumbent Anderson County Mayor Terry Frank in the May 1, 2018, mayoral primary election. Iwanski and the Meads supported Emert's candidacy. (Doc. 27 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime before April 5, 2018, Iwanski got a copy of Plaintiff's IRS Form W-2 from the Anderson County Finance Department and a copy of Plaintiff's IRS Form 1099 from the Anderson County Clerk and Master's Office. The people who gave him the documents said that Iwanski was the only person to have asked for and gotten these documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 8, 2018, the Meads were distributing campaign material supporting Emert at a campaign event in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Included in those materials was an eleven-page, fifty-three-paragraph document titled \"Things You Need to Know About [Mayor] Terry Frank\" (the \"Campaign Document\"). Paragraph 25 of the Campaign Document discusses Plaintiff's IRS Form 1099, his IRS Form W-2, and his compensation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   New Delinquent Tax attorney [Plaintiff Teno] has used a full-time county job with county benefits and other full-time county employees to do this work that he gets paid for independently by the Clerk and Master.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (see 1099s to Doyle Teno)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Before Myron Iwanski was appointed Trustee, Mr. Teno was the highest paid county worker by the hour. Unfortunately, no one really knew how many hours he worked since he mostly worked at home and had the Trustee's staff do his work and mailings.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1099 for last year was $ 120,000 (from Clerk and Master) &amp; also got W-2 for about $ 40-50,000\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and received full county benefits. And now he is demanding 10% commission on collected late taxes instead of the commission-approved 1%. He also refuses to turn over any of the Title Reviews he has charged for ... and wants them automatically assessed\n   and charged before they are ever done to everyone paying late taxes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Doc. 27 \u00b6 26 (emphasis added; errors in original) (quoting Campaign Doc. \u00b6 25).) Plaintiff alleges the foregoing paragraph implies that Plaintiff's Forms 1099 and W-2 were attached to the Campaign Document. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff alleges the Meads and Emert were \"acting as agents of Defendant Iwanski\" when they \"obtained, inspected, disclosed and used Plaintiff's confidential Tax Return and Return Information,\" including his W-2 and 1099. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Meads continued to distribute the Campaign Document after April 8. Emert used excerpts of the Campaign Document in his campaign materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants on April 23, 2018. (Doc. 1.) In his Second Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\"), he asserts causes of action against Defendants for (1) inspecting and disclosing his confidential tax information in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 7431, and (2) invasion of privacy and unreasonable intrusion into private affairs under Tennessee common law. (Doc. 27 \u00b6\u00b6 36-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Meads filed a motion to dismiss (Doc. 29) and a memorandum in support (Doc. 30). Emert sought and obtained leave of Court to join the Meads' motion. (Docs. 36, 39.) Iwanski filed a separate motion to dismiss relying on the grounds set out in the Meads' motion and memorandum. (Doc. 37). Plaintiff responded in opposition to both motions. (Doc. 45.) The Meads filed a reply. (Doc. 46.) Iwanski also filed a reply (Doc. 47), to which Plaintiff filed a sur-reply (Doc. 51) by leave of Court (Doc. 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A party may move to dismiss a claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

Nor does Plaintiff point to factual allegations in the Complaint that would make it plausible to conclude they fit into the \u00a7 6103 categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Instead, Plaintiff argues he may bring a Section 7431 action against the Meads and Emert because they were acting as Iwanski's agents. There are two problems with this argument. First, although the Complaint asserts that the Meads and Emert were Iwanski's agents, it contains no factual allegations to support such a conclusion. The Court is not bound to accept as true this bare assertion of a legal conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    478 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Court sees no grounds for extending liability to agents, even if the Meads and Emert were Iwanski's agents. Section 6103(a) applies to officers and employees of prohibited persons, but it makes no mention of agents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff also points to no legal authority authorizing the extension of Section 6103's categories to agents. Agency is, in any case, a common-law construct under which a principal may be bound by the actions of his or her agents-not the other way around.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Federated Fin. Reserve Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306686\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/961/#p965\">\n    144 F.3d 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 965 (6th Cir. 1998) (discussing common-law theories of agency under which principal may be liable for agent's actions). There is neither legal support nor logic for extending liability under Section 7431 to persons not included in Section 6103 merely because those persons are alleged to be agents of someone who is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Equally unavailing is Plaintiff's argument that the Meads and Emert should be liable under Section 7431 because they and Iwanski \"conspired and facilitated a violation of \u00a7 6103.\" (Doc. 45 at 7.) Just as Plaintiff has not shown there can be liability under \u00a7 7431 for \"agents,\" he has failed to provide any basis for predicating a cause of action for a violation of \u00a7 7431 on theories of conspiracy or facilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Last, Plaintiff argues that the Meads and Emert only got Plaintiff's tax information \"because Anderson County maintained copies of its employees tax returns for the purpose of tax administration.\" (Doc. 45 at 7.) This argument does nothing to change the fact that the Meads and Emert, themselves, are not within any of the categories of Section 6103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court concludes the Meads and Emert are not persons who may be sued under Section 7431. Plaintiff's disclosure claims against the Meads and Emert will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Disclosure Claim Against Iwanski\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Iwanski likewise argues that Plaintiff neither pleads nor shows that he is within any of the categories of persons in Section 6103(a) against whom a Section 7431 action may be brought. In his response, Plaintiff argues Iwanski comes within the statute in two ways: first, under Section 6103(a)(2), as an officer or employee of the state of Tennessee; and second, under Section 6103(a)(3), as a person who had access to returns or return information under subsection (n).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    a. U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a)(2): Officer or Employee of the State\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For Section 6103(a)(2) to apply, Iwanski must be an \"officer or employee of any State ... who has or had access to returns or return information under this section or section 6104(c).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). According to Plaintiff, Iwanski's role as Anderson County Trustee makes him an officer or employee of the state of Tennessee. The Complaint alleges the \"office of Trustee is a state of Tennessee constitutional office and an elected county official\" with certain duties set out by statute. (Doc. 27 \u00b6 13 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208-11-101\">\n    Tenn.
