However, as the ALJ also discussed, the various medical opinions in the record, including those of her treating orthopedist and her treating podiatrist, assessed mostly normal functionality with little or no limitations in these areas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nevertheless, the ALJ chose to incorporate certain limitations assessed by Rina Davis, M.D., one of Tammy's former treating providers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.

To be sure, the ALJ could have said more about how and why he chose not to fully credit Tammy's testimony. But plaintiff goes too far to claim that the ALJ's discussion amounts to only \"one short paragraph.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Rather, a review of the ALJ's written decision shows that the ALJ's credibility assessment is bound up in his review of the medical evidence. For instance, the ALJ candidly acknowledged that Tammy testified to being severely physically limited in nearly all physical areas, to being unable to sit for longer than 10-15 minutes, to stand for too long, or to walk very far. R. at 18-19. The ALJ also acknowledged plaintiff's claim that the subjective experience of pain emanating from these limitations caused her difficulty concentrating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   However, the ALJ then juxtaposed these claims of severity with the repeated, mostly normal findings by the various medical providers in the record. R. at 19-20. For instance, Dr. Lorensen noted that plaintiff reported being able to shower and dress herself and that she enjoyed fishing as a hobby.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. The ALJ also noted Dr. Lorensen's observations that plaintiff did not need an assistive device or any help getting on or off the exam table, and could \"rise from a chair without difficulty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   These mostly normal findings, of course, would tend to undermine a claimant's testimonial assertion that performing any of those feats amounts to a painfully difficult, if not painfully impossible, task.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alexandrea R.R. v.

R. at 19. The same goes for plaintiff's own treating podiatrist, who indicated that plaintiff \"has no\n   limitations for lifting, carrying, standing, or walking\" following her recovery from foot surgery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In light of this discussion, the ALJ properly rejected Tammy's assertions of concentration problems. R. at 20. Among other things, the ALJ noted that plaintiff's treatment records reflect normal cognitive functioning, and that records from her primary care provider \"note no functional limitations with respect to her daily living.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In fact, the ALJ noted that treatment records found elsewhere indicated that plaintiff even attempted to \"fix the brakes on her car\" in April of 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Of course, none of these things, considered individually, provide a sufficient basis on which to reject a claimant's testimony of severe limitations and disabling pain. But considered together, they tend to cast doubt on the notion that Tammy is as severely limited as she claimed to be in her testimony. And where, as here, a claimed inability to concentrate results from the alleged severity of those limitations, an antecedent factual determination by the ALJ that those limitations are not as severe as plaintiff claims would tend to support a conditional factual conclusion that the claimed inability to concentrate is not as severe as plaintiff claims, either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, \"credibility findings of an ALJ are entitled to great deference and therefore can be reversed only if they are patently unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Pollino v.
