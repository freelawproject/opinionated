Bataillon, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court following plaintiff's presentation of its case at trial. At the end of plaintiff's case, the Court listened to motions and arguments from the parties. The Court determined that plaintiff C.R. Bard Inc. (hereinafter \"Bard\") had not presented sufficient evidence regarding its claims and, therefore, issued a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) at the close of plaintiff's case. The Court made some findings on the record but also told counsel it would follow up with a written memorandum and order and a judgment. Prior to the filing of this Court's memorandum and order, the plaintiff filed an appeal of the rulings this Court made at the close of the plaintiff's case in chief for infringement. With this memorandum and order, the Court enters judgment, and any deadline for appeal of the Court's rulings shall be calculated from this date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bard filed its original application on April 25, 2006; it's '417 patent on July 2, 2013; it's '460 patent on October 1, 2013; and its '478 patent, the method patent, on August 12, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   D.I. 192,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States Patent Office permitted Bard to patent its \"means of identification\" concept, and it also issued Bard's method patent. At issue in this infringement action is a port which is a power injection port, with an identifiable feature by x-ray, and an identifiable feature that is separate for the device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   AngioDynamics, Inc. (hereinafter \"Angio\") filed with the Food and Drug Administration (hereinafter \"FDA\") in August of 2006 and used Bard as a predicate device. Angio received approval from the FDA. First approval included a round port with a sticker and a hospital wrist band, and there were no indicators that the port was power injectable. However, there was a problem identifying the type of port after insertion. Thereafter, Angio developed the scalloped shape device and it is radiographic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case has lingered in the district court since 2015. The parties have hotly disputed discovery, legal issues, two claims construction orders and multiple motions for summary judgment. In the interim, administrative hearings and appeals were taken including a decision in the Federal Circuit. Bard contends the infringing products include a scallop shape and/or a radiopaque CT marking and extraneous identification materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n   <strong>\n    LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if \"the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for [a] party\" on an issue.

R. Civ. P 50(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the purpose of its ruling, the Court considers the evidence presented during the plaintiff's case in chief and the evidence produced in the context of the multiple motions for summary judgment filed by both parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout the exhausting motion practice for this case, the Court gave the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, relying on the weight of evidence that may be provided by the plaintiff's expert witness. After the plaintiff presented its evidence about its alleged invention and infringement, the Court finds the defendant's position is correct as a matter of law. Fundamentally, after listening to the evidence presented to the jury and considering the evidence for the previous motions for summary judgment, the Court finds this patent is about labeling, not invention and not technology.\n   <em>\n    Praxair Distrib., Inc. v. Mallinckrodt Hosp. Prod. IP Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516897\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1024/#p1032\">\n    890 F.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1032 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\"Claim limitations directed to the content of information and lacking a requisite functional relationship are not entitled to patentable weight because such information is not patent eligible subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"). It is clear from the evidence, or lack of evidence, that the labeling does not change the port and labeling is old technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to Bard's disclosure of its power injectable port and indicators, the FDA had issued warnings and reported patient complications with vascular ports being used for power injections. After the FDA warning the standard of medical care required practitioners to identify ports capable of power injection before beginning such procedures. The plaintiff understood this news as an opportunity to create a new market - the power injectable vascular port authorized as a new medical device by the FDA. It tested its vascular ports to determine whether they could withstand the pressure and flow rate necessary for power injection. Bard's port, along with others in the industry, were able to qualify for power injection use without essential modification. Bard's marketing team was also astute enough to understand that labeling its vascular ports would give it a competitive advantage. To that end, it decided to further enhance its market share by obtaining a patent for its labeling. It identified three means of labeling: radiographic, extraneous, and otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It also pursued a method patent that outlined a procedure for identifying its patented power injectable ports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After consideration of the evidence, the Court finds that the \"means of identification\" patent claims were no more than features that identified a power injectable port device, externally and/or subcutaneously. The method claim was no more than a recitation of the standards of medical care required following the FDA warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The accused devices use the same letters Bard uses to identify its power injectable vascular ports, CT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letters CT are recognizable by the medical profession because most power injection procedures are used to inject contrast material in preparation for Computer Tomography Scans (commonly referred to as CT Scans ). The accused products etch the letters in titanium ports and use radiopaque foil in plastic valves. Both practices took Bard and the defendant, Angio, a matter of months to test, manufacture and market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Angio, in its initial attempt to identify its power injectable port, created a scalloped shape. The testimony demonstrated that the significance of this shape was not sufficiently clear to users while the CT marking was unmistakably clear. After seeking a legal opinion, Angio marketed a series of power injectable ports that were marked with the letters CT. Thereafter, Bard sued for infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Angio contends that Dr. Timothy Clark's opinions relied on incorrect law. Dr. Clark addressed the claim limitations, but according to Angio, Dr. Clark did not address the Court's claim construction. On cross-examination, Dr. Clark admitted he did not rely on Judge Robinson's claim construction regarding the term vascular access port or access port.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript,\n   <em>\n    D.I. 445\n   </em>\n   , 913:2-914:20. When an expert fails to apply the correct claim construction, the testimony does not create triable issues of fact.\n   <em>\n    Weiner v. NEC Electronics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 102 F3rd 534, 542 (Fed. Cir. 1996) and\n   <em>\n    Quest Licensing Corp v. Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   , 2017 Westlaw 239345 *3 (D. Del. 2017), aff'd\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20Fed.%20Appx.%20819\">\n    726 Fed. Appx. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Del. 2018). The Court agrees that Dr. Clark did not clearly articulate that he followed the claims constructions issued by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, Angio moved for infringement of the '478 method patent contending that Bard failed to offer sufficient evidence that a single person or entity had performed all steps of the claimed method. The Court agrees Bard did not show that Angio took actions with respect to all steps of the claimed methods. Bard failed to do so, and thus this claim fails. Bard also contends that the reference should be \"entity\" and not separate out physicians, and hospital, and hospital staff, as they all constitute one entity when determining if all the steps are made in compliance with the law.\n   <em>\n    Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Tech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707011\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/915/#p921\">\n    572 U.S. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580969,12707011\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2111/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580969,12707011\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2111/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (all the steps claimed in the patent must be performed or attributable to one person, or by a person who exercises all the control, and all steps must be carried out).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akamai Tech., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331183\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1020/#p1022\">\n    797 F.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (\"Where more than one actor is involved in practicing the steps, a court must determine whether the acts of one are attributable to the other such that a single entity is responsible for the infringement. We will hold an entity responsible for others' performance of method steps in two sets of circumstances: (1) where that entity directs or controls others' performance, and (2) where the actors form a joint enterprise\"). Dr. Clark, argues Angio, did not introduce any evidence of infringement by directing the actions of multiple actors. The Court agrees and will also grant the JMOL motion of non-infringement of the '478 Patent on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, the Court finds there is a failure of proof on the method issue. Bard introduced some evidence regarding a patient at University of Pennsylvania having issues related to the ports. However, the evidence presented that a Smart Port was implanted in that hospital and that the additional required steps taken there is pure speculation. The Court finds there is insufficient evidence, lack of relevant evidence and lack of foundation for this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Likewise, there is a failure of proof regarding Xcela's being a vascular access for the structured power injection. No one testified in that regard. The only mention is the FDA's indication for power injection, but even Dr. Clark admitted the decision by the FDA was irrelevant to infringement. D.I. 445, Transcript, 828:20-25. Bard provided no testing results on Xcela. The Court will likewise grant JMOL on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The law is clear, one cannot obtain a patent that simply labels a product, especially if the label is no more than alphabetic letters. Each of the patent claims in this lawsuit rely on the identification of alphabetic letters or words to identify a device. Furthermore, the defendant cannot infringe a patent by simply marking a product with letters that identify its use, nor with a unique shape. This product is not covered by a copyright or trademark protection for the letters \"CT\", nor a design patent covering the product's shape. The defendant did not infringe the Bard's patent because the patent does not prohibit either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, the Court notes the following. There is no contention that any of Angio's vascular ports structurally infringe Bard's ports. Bard believes it can prevent Angio from designing the shape of a port and advertise it as unique for power injection. Bard does not have a design patent. Furthermore, Angio cannot infringe a patent by simply providing instructions for the use of its non-infringing devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court concludes that the '478 method Patent recites claims that are routine well understood and conventional standards of care present before the claimed invention. \"Claim limitations directed to the content of information and lacking a requisite functional relationship are not entitled to patentable weight because such information is not patent eligible subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Praxair Distrib.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516897\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1024/#p1032\">\n    890 F.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The shape of the power injectable ports is only protected by a design patent or trademark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Bard has no claim. The extraneous identification materials (I.D. bracelet, I.D. cards, key chain tags, etc.) are not an intrinsic part of the vascular access port and provide no structural function.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any claims under the patent that rely on this claim are unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence supports that identifying ports capable of power injection by means of the medical record, patient history, product materials or radiograph was routine, conventional and required by the standard of medical care existing at the time of the alleged invention. The Court agrees that this is ineligible patent subject matter. The Court determines, as it stated on the record that it has no \"evidence in the record at all that this is not an abstract idea or that all limitations that were outlined in my order with respect to letters and instructions are\n   even - are even addressed. In fact, everything that you've done has supported the problem that you have with the letters. All you've done is identified your product.

Second, Bard has shown it has radiographic properties suitable for power injection. Bard contends that the scallop shape is an indicator of these claims. The Court disagrees. The evidence demonstrates that doctors did not sufficiently recognize scalloped shape as a power injectable port.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second alleged infringing feature under the '460 patent are extrinsic indicators identifying the port as power injectable. The evidence is clear that these extrinsic indicators are merely printed material which includes a bracelet and a key tab identifying the product as power injectable. The Court finds these extrinsic indicators are in fact printed material and unpatentable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the '417 patent Bard contends the infringed extrinsic indicators are the scallop shape, the radiopaque letters CT and the device can be identified by palpation. The Court finds the letters and shape are not eligible for patenting as discussed herein. As to whether the shape gives rise to the additional means of identification by palpation, Bard's expert, Powers, admitted that Bard did not invent palpation, as it was well known. D.I. 444, Transcript - Powers, 579:9-22. Essentially, the expert admitted that none of the alleged infringing means of identification were new or original. On redirect, Mr. Kelly Powers\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q.

They were structured for power injection more than a year before the filing date of the patents?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Right. But I mean as I've said from my own experience just a couple weeks ago we had a patient came into our facility with, I think it was a Vortex port, called the 1-800 number that the patient provided with the ID card and we were instructed not to inject the port.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q. You didn't provide any evidence of that, right, in your report?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A. Are you implying that that's not so?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. I'm just asking, Doctor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. It occurred two weeks ago. My report goes back to December of 2017 during your deposition and that deposition occurred following the issuance of my report. So, I don't know how I could have included it in my report after the issuance of my report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. There were no instances -- there were no other instances of that, that issue in your reports, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. Not in my reports, but it certainly happened multiple times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. But you haven't provided any evidence of that, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Other than my 22 years of experience practicing as an interventional radiologist implanting ports.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. Okay. And we saw before, with respect to, put back up 3.68 again. So, with respect to Smart Port, we agree that the separated features is not what makes Smart Port power injectable?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q. And the same would be true of Vortex? Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Transcript, D.I. 445, 909:15-912:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court finds this case is nothing but a labeling issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bard used a bracelet, identification card and a key ring. These items are external to the device. They used these to show how to use the Power Port. But the power injectable ports had been in existence for quite some time. Likewise, Bard did not invent CT (computed tomography ), nor did it sell CT machines. Bard did not invent the power injection machines or power injection procedures. Bard does not sell the power injection machines. There were power injections as early as 1992; there were titanium ports as early as 1992; the Vortex/Smart Port product belonged to Angio and it existed in 2002. The radiographic markers were not new either. Prior art included a breast implant subcutaneously with a radiographic marker. The Isomed, likewise, had a radiographic label. The Court finds that it does not matter how the information is conveyed, whether\n   it is by CT, color, the bracelet, shape or a separated feature, it is all information. Accordingly, the Court will grant Angio's motion and dismiss this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   AngioDynamic's oral motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of plaintiff's case is granted in its entirety, and this case is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Two of them are apparatus patents, the '460 and the '417, and one is a method patent, the '478.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Bard is the owner of the three patents at issue, which are identified as\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C475%2C417%2C%20U\">\n     U.S. Patent No. 8,475,417, U\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .S.

If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    (A) resolve the issue against the party; and\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    (B) grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    (2) Motion.

The Court finds herein that there is no infringement, so it follows there is no evidence of willful infringement. Further, Angio received a written opinion of counsel upon which Angio relied regarding both invalidity and infringement. Bard put on no testimony that this opinion by counsel was drafted by a bad law firm, nor did Bard put on any other evidence of willfulness. Bard has failed to sustain its burden t of proof. The JMOL is granted as to willfulness and will not be further discussed herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 356 at 1-21, addressing summary judgment motions 248, 249, 250, 253, 254, 255, and 256.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Claims Construction Memorandum and Order, D.I. 416, wherein the Court determined that Judge Robinson did not specifically decide the printed matter issue regarding construction of printed matter, as the Praxair case was not decided until a year later.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C805%2C478\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C805%2C478\">\n     at 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Praxair Distrib., Inc. v.

Okay. So, identification features. That's the marker, the CT?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    A. There are various identification features that are in suit, but CT is one of them, yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    Q. Okay. So, let's just -- are you alleging we copied the bracelet?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n    A. I don't think you copied the bracelet, but I don't recall.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n    Q. Okay. Do we copy the color?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n    A.

The palpable shape, the combination of identification means with the port structured for power injection.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    Q. Okay.

I am not alleging that you copied the port itself. There are aspects that we included that we consider important identification features that were copied and they are radiopaque, and they say the same thing.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n    Q. What do they say?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    A.
