Lanza, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a lawsuit brought on behalf of C.L., an autistic child who was 14 years old at the time of the events in question, against the City of Buckeye and three members of the Buckeye Police Department (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The claims stem from an incident in July 2017 in which one of the Defendants, Officer David Grossman (\"Officer Grossman\"), is alleged to have slammed C.L. against a tree, wrestled C.L. to the ground, and then pinned C.L. down while attempting to handcuff him. The complaint further alleges that C.L., who was screaming in agony during the incident, sustained serious injuries requiring surgery. There is no suggestion C.L. committed a crime before this encounter occurred. Instead, the complaint alleges that (1) Officer Grossman initially approached C.L., who was standing in a park, because he suspected C.L.'s hand movements might be indicative of drug use, (2) C.L. twice explained to Officer Grossman that he was simply \"stimming\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   self-stimulating with a piece of string, which is a common technique used by individuals with autism to calm their nerves), and (3) Officer Grossman proceeded to slam, wrestle, and pin C.L. despite this explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 30, 2019, the Court issued a 21-page order in which it granted in part, and denied in part, Defendants' motion to dismiss (the \"Order\"). (Doc. 40.) Among other things, the Court concluded that Officer Grossman was not entitled to qualified immunity (at least at the motion-to-dismiss stage) as to Counts 1 and 2 of the complaint, which are claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for false arrest and excessive force. The Court did, however, dismiss several other counts. The dismissal of those counts means that five counts now remaining pending: (1) Count 1, the \u00a7 1983 false arrest claim against Officer Grossman; (2) Count 2, the \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim against Officer Grossman; (3) Count 5, an Americans With Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") false arrest claim against the City; (4) Count 7, a state-law battery claim against Officer Grossman; and (5) Count 9, a state-law negligent training/supervision claim against all Defendants except Officer Grossman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the Order was issued, Officer Grossman filed a notice of appeal concerning the denial of qualified immunity. (Doc. 41.) Additionally, Defendants have filed a motion to stay until Officer Grossman's interlocutory appeal is resolved. (Doc. 42.) The stay request has two components: first, Officer Grossman seeks a stay as to the counts asserted against him; and second, Defendants collectively request a stay of the entire case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Meanwhile, Plaintiffs have filed an opposition to the stay request (Doc. 47) and, separately, filed their own notice of appeal, which purports to challenge the portions of the Order dismissing certain other counts in the complaint (Doc. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As explained below, Defendants' motion to stay will be granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, Officer Grossman's request for a stay as to Counts 1 and 2 will be granted because his interlocutory appeal is not frivolous. Although the Court continues to believe its decision to deny qualified immunity as to Counts 1 and 2 was correct-indeed, this order identifies several additional cases, with analogous facts, in which requests for qualified immunity were rejected-the arguments raised by Officer Grossman are not \"wholly without merit\" and \"so baseless ... that nothing can be said on the other side.\" However, Officer Grossman is not entitled to a stay as to Count 7, because it is a state-law claim not subject to a qualified-immunity defense, and Defendants' request to stay the entire case pending the resolution of Officer Grossman's appeal will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In their motion, Defendants request a stay of all proceedings pending the resolution of Officer Grossman's interlocutory appeal. First, Officer Grossman argues he is entitled to a stay of proceedings related to the issues he appealed. He explains that, when interlocutory review of an order is sought, \"the district court is automatically divested of jurisdiction\" over the particular issues involved in the appeal, unless the court certifies the appeal is frivolous. (Doc. 42 at 3.) He argues his appeal isn't frivolous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, Defendants contend the Court should stay the remaining proceedings (not subject to the appeal) because the stay factors established in\n   <em>\n    Nken v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    556 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), weigh in their favor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In their response, Plaintiffs argue that Officer Grossman's appeal is frivolous and that the Court shouldn't stay the remaining proceedings because the\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in their favor. (Doc. 47.) Plaintiffs also obliquely note that they have filed a cross-appeal, appealing the dismissal of several of their causes of action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In their reply, Defendants argue that, because Plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal, the Court is divested of jurisdiction over all aspects of this case and therefore must stay all proceedings. (Doc. 48 at 1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Stay As To Officer Grossman\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[T]he filing of a notice of interlocutory appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction over the particular issues involved in that appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles, Harbor Div. v.

However, if the district court finds that the interlocutory appeal is \"frivolous,\" it \"may certify, in writing, that defendants have forfeited their right to pretrial appeal, and may proceed with trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Chuman v.

In other words, a frivolous appeal is one that is \"so baseless that it does not invoke appellate jurisdiction such as when the disposition is so plainly correct that nothing can be said on the other side.\"\n   <em>\n    Dagdagan v. City of Vallejo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3595456\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/682/1100/#p1116\">\n    682 F.

The only two causes of action subject to qualified immunity are Count 1 (false arrest) and Count 2 (excessive force), both arising under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court is automatically divested of jurisdiction over those\n   claims unless it certifies that Officer Grossman's interlocutory appeal is frivolous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the Court stands by the Order and continues to believe it correctly denied Officer Grossman's motion to dismiss, his appeal is not frivolous. As Officer Grossman correctly states, denial of qualified immunity is only appropriate where an official's conduct violates \"clearly established constitutional rights of which a reasonable officer would be aware 'in light of the specific context of the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Keates v. Koile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516052\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1228/#p1235\">\n    883 F.3d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1235 (9th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted). And Officer Grossman contends the cases cited in the Order wouldn't make a reasonable officer aware his conduct violated a clearly established constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the one hand, the Court acknowledges that the Order focused primarily on the merits of the constitutional violations asserted in Counts 1 and 2. In retrospect, it would have been preferable to provide a comparable level of analysis concerning the clearly-established prong of the qualified-immunity test (which the Court has attempted to supply below). Thus, the Court recognizes there could be reasonable disagreement about the correctness of its decision to deny qualified immunity. The Order is not \"so plainly correct that nothing can be said on the other side,\"\n   <em>\n    Dagdagan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3595456\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/682/1100/#p1116\">\n    682 F. Supp. 2d at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so Officer Grossman's appeal isn't frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the other hand, it can't be overlooked that Officer Grossman's appeal arises from a ruling at the motion-to-dismiss stage, not at summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit has explained that, because \"[d]etermining claims of qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage raises special problems for legal decision making,\" a district court should conclude that the \"plaintiffs are 'entitled to go forward' with their claims\" if \"the operative complaint 'contains even one allegation of a harmful act that would constitute a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.' \"\n   <em>\n    Keates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516052\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1228/#p1235\">\n    883 F.3d at 1234-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, as for the \u00a7 1983 false arrest claim in Count 1, the complaint alleges that C.L. was arrested because a police officer unreasonably interpreted the symptoms of his disability as evidence of criminal conduct. Multiple courts have denied qualified immunity under analogous circumstances. For example:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 In\n   <em>\n    Marzullo v.

Conn. 2016), the plaintiff was driving his car when he began to suffer an epileptic seizure, which caused him to crash into a wall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. When the police arrived at the scene, a passenger told them the plaintiff was having a seizure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The police disregarded this information, demanded that the plaintiff produce his driver's license, and, when he didn't comply (\"he was slumped over the steering wheel, unresponsive\"), the police shot him with a Taser and threatened to arrest him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Afterward, the plaintiff brought a \u00a7 1983 action alleging claims for, among other things, unlawful seizure\n   and excessive force.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The officers moved for summary judgment on qualified-immunity grounds but the district court denied their motion in relevant part, holding that the officers could not \"legitimately argue ... that it would be reasonable for a police officer to use force against an individual, including shooting that individual in the neck with a Taser, under the circumstances testified to by [the passenger].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

As a result, the neighbor called 911.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the police arrived, they found the young man standing in a nearby park with his dog.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He had vomit on his shirt and appeared confused and disoriented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although one of the officers understood that the young man was \"having a mental health episode,\" they decided to arrest him and take him to jail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He was detained overnight and then released.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. However, he never returned home-upon his release from jail, he drowned in a nearby river.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The young man's family sued the arresting officers and asserted, among other things, a \u00a7 1983 claim for false arrest and a claim under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officers moved for summary judgment on the false-arrest claim on qualified immunity grounds, arguing they reasonably believed the young man had committed the crime of public intoxication, but the district court denied their motion, explaining that \"the court cannot conclude that it is uncontestable that a reasonable officer would have believed that probable cause existed for the arrest under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6. In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized that the officers had actual notice, before initiating the arrest, that the young man's symptoms were actually \"signs of a person suffering from mental illness,\" not intoxication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These cases establish that a reasonable officer wouldn't have believed he had probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or indeed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   reason to suspect C.L. had committed a crime. This is significant because an officer must have a \"particularized and objective basis\" to suspect legal wrongdoing\n   before detaining a person.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the time of this incident, which occurred in 2017, the law was well established that \"[w]here there is no need for force,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   force used is constitutionally unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

App'x 663 (10th Cir. 2015), the court concluded a reasonable officer would have known his actions constituted excessive force, in violation of clearly established law, where a deputy sheriff carried out a forceful takedown of a teenager.

As an initial matter, Defendants' argument that they will be subjected to duplicative discovery is incorrect-no Defendant (except for Officer Grossman) will be subjected to any more or less discovery based on how Officer Grossman's appeal is resolved. Count 5 (wrongful arrest under the ADA) and Count 9 (state-law negligent training/supervision) are asserted against the City. The City will be required to engage in discovery related to Officer Grossman's interaction with C.L. regardless of whether the Ninth Circuit determines Officer Grossman violated clearly established law. The same is true for Chief Hall and Lieutenant Arlak, against whom Count 9 is asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, even if Defendants were correct that the denial of a stay would cause them to engage in duplicative discovery, such harm isn't irreparable.\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v.

On the one hand, although \"[d]elay can certainly constitute 'a substantial injury to the plaintiff,' \" where a plaintiff only identifies general concerns, rather than specific concerns about a stay (such as risk of lost evidence), courts are less likely to find the injury is substantial.\n   <em>\n    Richards v.
