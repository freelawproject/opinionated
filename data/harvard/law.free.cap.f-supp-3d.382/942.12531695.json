Further,\n    <em>\n     Wild\n    </em>\n    was decided before the Ninth Circuit clarified in\n    <em>\n     Gordon\n    </em>\n    that only where a plaintiff satisfies one of the\n    <em>\n     Rogers\n    </em>\n    prongs, must a plaintiff then establish that the use of the mark is likely to cause confusion.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gordon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519275\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/257/#p264\">\n     909 F.3d at 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, the Court declines to import a likelihood of confusion analysis into the second\n    <em>\n     Rogers\n    </em>\n    prong.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Finally, Plaintiff argues that even if the\n    <em>\n     Rogers\n    </em>\n    test protects Defendants' use of the mark for their album name, it has no bearing on Defendants' other uses of the mark for the tour name, and as Roberts' persona in interviews and other live performances. Pl.'s Opp'n at 18. The Court finds this unconvincing because these are extensions of the use of the mark in an effort to advertise and market the \"Mastermind\" album.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Twentieth Century Fox\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266999\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1192/\">\n     875 F.3d at 1196-97\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding use of the \"Empire\" mark beyond the title of a TV show, such as appearances by cast members, radio play, online advertising, live events, and sale of consumer goods, protected because \"it requires only a minor logical extension of the reasoning of\n    <em>\n     Rogers\n    </em>\n    to hold that works protected under its test may be advertised and marketed by name, and we so hold.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In sum, Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence that creates a triable issue of material fact as to whether Defendants' album \"Mastermind\" explicitly misleads as to the source of the work. Because Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to either\n    <em>\n     Rogers\n    </em>\n    ' prong, the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot prevail on his infringement claim as a matter of law and\n    <strong>\n     GRANTS\n    </strong>\n    Defendants' Motion. As such, the Court declines to consider Defendants' remaining defense for fair use, and Defendants' request for summary judgment for cancellation of the mark, including that:(1) Plaintiff failed to meet the notice requirement; (2) Plaintiff used the mark as a signature and not a source identifier; (2) Plaintiff failed to use the mark in commerce in connection with all of the goods listed in Class 009; (3) Plaintiff committed fraud upon the USPTO in obtaining the trademark; and (4) Plaintiff abandoned the mark.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Remaining Claims\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In its initial Order, the Court granted summary judgment as to Plaintiff's remaining claims of unfair competition, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation, because each was dependent on a finding of infringement of a protectable mark. Because the Ninth Circuit reversed the Court's cancellation of the mark, these\n    claims are now back before this Court. However, as the Court found that Plaintiff cannot prevail on his trademark infringement claim, the Court again\n    <strong>\n     GRANTS\n    </strong>\n    summary judgment in Defendants' favor as to Plaintiff's remaining claims.\n    <em>\n     Entrepreneur Media, Inc. v.
