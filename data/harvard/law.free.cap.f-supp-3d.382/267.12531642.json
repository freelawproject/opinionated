If so, the claimant is not disabled.

At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since January 16, 2014, the application and alleged onset date. (Dkt. 8 at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, reading disorder, anxiety disorder, and autism disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to Plaintiff's representation that she suffered from speech delay, the ALJ concluded that this was not a medically determinable impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 12.02, 12.05, 12.06, and 12.10 in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels, with the additional non-exertional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   retains the mental [RFC] to perform unskilled work where interactions with others are related to the work performed. Interactions with others as well as decision-making are limited to approximately a third of the workday.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of cleaner, hospital cleaner, hand packager, housekeeper, and mail clerk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 34-39). While some of these records do pre-date Plaintiff's alleged onset date (January 16, 2014), several pieces of evidence - including Dr. Brownfeld's examinations, Plaintiff's December 2014 ISP, Ms. Rapke's evaluations, and the letter from Plaintiff's most recent counselor, Ms. Nesta - are from the alleged period of disability and, more importantly, reflect Plaintiff's functional limitations during that period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the ALJ should have attempted to obtain current or additional treatment evidence. However,\n   Plaintiff does not identify what relevant treatment records the ALJ should have allegedly worked to obtain, other than records from Ms. Nesta. (Dkt. 10-1 at 18). At the administrative hearing, Plaintiff's mother testified that Plaintiff was \"seeing a counselor, Lenore Nestor [sic] ... I don't believe I gave you her name the last time because we had just started seeing her in 2014. We had to stop since - she's trying to go back to college and it was just time-wise. I couldn't get her out to see her so we had stopped for a couple weeks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 382-83). Following the administrative hearing, a letter containing Ms. Nesta's opinion as to Plaintiff's disability, dated October 25, 2015, was submitted to the ALJ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 650). In the written determination, the ALJ thoroughly discussed Ms. Nesta's opinion that Plaintiff's case is \"truly a case that needs benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). The ALJ explained that he assigned Ms. Nesta's opinion \"little weight\" because (1) Plaintiff attends college level classes, works part time at Marshalls, and seeks to live on her own; and (2) the consultative examinations do not support a disability finding, in that they revealed only mild and moderate limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39). As a social worker, Ms. Nesta's opinion relating to Plaintiff's disability was not entitled to controlling weight,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Sept. 27, 2017) (ALJ properly afforded opinion \"little weight\" where it \"conflicted with findings ... of other medical professionals, which reflected that Plaintiff retained significant ability to functional normally\"). Under these circumstances, the ALJ was not obligated to take additional steps to obtain Ms. Nesta's underlying treatment notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that the ALJ \"made no attempt to elicit testimony regarding current treatment nor did the ALJ make any effort to assist a pro se Plaintiff in developing a clear lack of current material.\" (Dkt. 10-1 at 16). Again, Plaintiff's characterization of the ALJ's conduct at the administrative hearing is incorrect. The ALJ was cognizant of the fact that Plaintiff appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , explained to Plaintiff and her mother that Plaintiff was entitled to an attorney, and confirmed that they wanted to proceed without an attorney. (Dkt. 8 at 378-79). The ALJ first questioned Plaintiff's mother regarding Plaintiff's diagnoses, experiences at work and in high school and college, treatment, and behavior, with which Plaintiff's mother was very familiar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 380-85). Thereafter, the ALJ questioned Plaintiff about her high school classes, her ability to read, and her job at Marshalls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 385-86). At certain points in the record, the ALJ emphasized that he wanted testimony from Plaintiff, rather than her mother. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 385 (regarding the kind of books Plaintiff reads, telling her mother \"[n]o, I'm going to ask her\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 386 (regarding why Plaintiff could not work at Marshalls full-time, clarifying, \"[t]his question is for Emily\") ). The ALJ also asked Plaintiff's mother about the connection she saw between Plaintiff's impairments and her stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, opinions she had received in the past regarding Plaintiff's inability to work, and Plaintiff's difficulties at work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 386-92). As noted above, the ALJ also encouraged Plaintiff's mother to submit any additional documentation she had and instructed her on how to submit this information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 393-94). The ALJ specifically\n   advised Plaintiff's mother as to steps she could take to uncover additional information, including individuals who she could contact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394, 398). The ALJ also questioned Plaintiff's mother regarding Plaintiff's treatment, asking about physicians who had seen Plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 390-91) and inquiring as to whether there were any additional records that had not been presented (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 383-84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff notes that additional evidence was submitted to the Appeals Council, consisting mostly of school records and testing prior to Plaintiff's turning 18 and prior to the alleged onset date, and argues that this additional evidence demonstrates that the ALJ failed to develop the record. (Dkt. 10-1 at 16). This argument lacks merit. As noted above, the ALJ's duty to develop the record is not limitless, and the ALJ's failure to collect information that, as discussed below, largely predates the alleged onset date and is in any event duplicative, does not constitute reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff argues that the Appeals Council improperly excluded this evidence, this argument is also rejected. The Appeals Council must consider \"new\" and \"material\" evidence if it \"relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision\" and there is \"reasonable probability that the additional evidence would change the outcome of the decision.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.970\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). Here, the Appeals Council acknowledged Plaintiff's submission but found that this evidence \"[did] not show a reasonable probability that it would change the outcome of the decision.\" (Dkt. 8 at 5). As noted above, the record on which the ALJ assessed Plaintiff's RFC was adequate, and, as conceded by Plaintiff, the bulk of this evidence related to a time period that pre-dated the period of disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McManus v.

Further, Plaintiff does not make any meaningful argument as to how the additional evidence submitted to the Appeals Council would have changed the outcome of the decision. Defendant specifically identifies the content of these records, including: 98 pages of duplicate information; records dated years before Plaintiff's alleged onset date, which provide information similar to the educational assessments already in the record; and 30 pages of documents relating to future care planning, reflecting that Plaintiff is capable of performing most tasks of daily living. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14-1 at 30). Plaintiff does not dispute these facts. The Court finds that the Appeals Council properly rejected these records, as they would have had no effect on the outcome of the ALJ's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, the record in this case is adequate and contains evidence from which the ALJ could properly assess Plaintiff's RFC, including recent opinion evidence from medical experts and an opinion from Plaintiff's treating therapist.

At the first step, the ALJ found that Plaintiff's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms\" but that \"the claimant's statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limited effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible for the reasons explained in this decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34). The ALJ identified specifically the testimony relevant to his credibility analysis, including Plaintiff's testimony that she took algebra in high school, finds it difficult to read, and could not work fulltime because she gets stressed out and tired, as well as her mother's testimony that Plaintiff works part-time at Marshalls but could not work fulltime because she gets very tried, stressed, and anxious; and that Plaintiff attended community college and studied liberal arts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thereafter, the ALJ discussed evidence in the record showing that, contrary to Plaintiff's and her mother's claims, Plaintiff's impairments were not disabling, including: (1) recent opinion evidence from Dr. Brownfeld, who found that Plaintiff had only some mild or moderate limitations, which did not affect her ability to function on a daily basis; (2) Plaintiff's ISP, which reflected that Plaintiff graduated from high school, was currently taking classes in college, and noted that Plaintiff \"is proud to be able to take and be successful in collegiate level coursework\"; (3) Plaintiff's employment at Marshalls, where she \"increased her speed a lot on the job\" and was \"able to add an extra day of work\"; (4) Plaintiff's high school ISP, which revealed average math skills and adequate language skills, as well as improved self-control; and (5) assessments from March 2010, July 2007, and June 2014, all of which are consistent in showing that Plaintiff had low average cognitive functioning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-37). Accordingly, the ALJ's credibility assessment complied with the regulations, and it is clear to the Court why the ALJ found Plaintiff's subjective complaints regarding her inability to work not fully credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the ALJ mischaracterized the record when he referred to Plaintiff's attending college and working at Marshalls as contrary to her claim that she is disabled. (Dkt. 10-1 at 24). Plaintiff contends that the ALJ ignored the fact that Plaintiff had difficulty working, had meltdowns\n   at work, and had a job coach at Marshalls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24). It is true that \"a reason ... that relies on a mischaracterization of the record cannot be a good reason....\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

However, in this case, the ALJ did not mischaracterize any testimony; rather, the ALJ clearly considered Plaintiff's testimony and her mother's testimony that Plaintiff became anxious at work, as well as the fact that Plaintiff had a job coach at Marshalls. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 34-35 (both Plaintiff and her mother testified that Plaintiff could not work fulltime because she gets tired, stressed, and anxious);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (\"Though she has a job coach at her jobs at Marshalls....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39 (\"Both claimant and her mother testified at the hearing that claimant cannot work full time because she becomes [tired] and exhausted\") ). However, the ALJ found this testimony not credible, based on the multiple opinions in the record - including those by Drs. Brownfeld and Shapiro - that Plaintiff had only minimal mental impairments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39 (\"Though she does experience some limitations from her conditions, as per Drs. Shapiro and Brownfeld, neither opined they were disabling limitations. Rather, Dr. Brownfeld noted her problems 'did not appear to be significant enough to interfere with the claimant's ability to function on a daily basis' \") ). The ALJ also discussed Plaintiff's recent ISP, which revealed that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   has increased her speed a lot on the job and in doing so she has been able to add an extra day of work (when the schedule permits).

The ALJ also explained that there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Plaintiff's complaints of exhaustion and anxiousness at work are linked to her impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39). In other words, the ALJ did not mischaracterize the record relating to Plaintiff's ability to work - he merely found that Plaintiff's complaints relating to her ability to work were not borne out by the medical and other evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff reiterates her argument that the ALJ did not ask enough questions of Plaintiff to critique the credibility assessment. (Dkt. 10-1 at 22). However, as noted above, the ALJ's development of the record at the hearing was adequate, including his questioning of Plaintiff and her mother. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II(A),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). Further, it is undisputed that the record before the ALJ contained records that contradicted Plaintiff's subjective complaints.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The ALJ discussed Plaintiff's IQ scores at step three of the disability analysis, including that IQ scores from March 2014 and June 2014, which were scaled at 71 and 80 respectively, did not reveal sub-average intellectual functioning. (Dkt. 8 at 31). The ALJ further noted that an IQ test from March 2010 also failed to meet the requirements of Listing 12.05.

Sept. 20, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the ALJ did not only consider Plaintiff's failure to meet the IQ score requirements of Listing 12.05. In considering whether Plaintiff met the requirements of Listing 12.05, he explained that none of the evidence in the record \"reflect[s] any deficits in adaptive functioning prior to the developmental period or subsequent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 8 at 31). The ALJ also explained that he considered Plaintiff's activities, including her taking two college classes and working a part-time job, as evidence that she did not meet Listing 12.05. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, the ALJ's step 3 analysis was not superficial, and he considered all of the evidence - including Plaintiff's activities and her functional limitations - in considering whether Plaintiff met the requirements of Listing 12.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the ALJ improperly assessed the opinions of Dr. Sullivan, Dr. DeMarle, Dr. Bauer, and Ms. Rapke. (Dkt. 10-1 at 25). The ALJ assigned their opinions \"significant weight\", based on the consistency of the IQ scores with which they assessed Plaintiff, and because all of these sources were consistent in not opining that Plaintiff was disabled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39). The ALJ further noted that their findings were consistent with subsequent consultative examinations, which showed that Plaintiff's conditions do not significantly interfere with her ability to function on a daily basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   properly assigned these opinions \"significant weight,\" based on their consistency with one another and with other opinions in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maldonado v.

As noted by the ALJ in his written determination, a majority of the opinions in the record - including the recent opinions by Dr. Brownfeld - do not support a finding of disability. The RFC finding, which requires Plaintiff to perform only unskilled work, limits her interactions with others and decision making, provides her with regular work breaks, and exempts her from fast-paced assembly work, is entirely consistent with the evidence in the record. For example, the RFC for unskilled work is consistent with Dr. Brownfeld's opinion that Plaintiff can follow and understand simple directions and instructions without limitations and perform simple tasks independently without limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Borelli v.

Further, the ALJ specifically fashioned the RFC to include limitations for Plaintiff's interactions with others and decision making, breaks in her work schedule, and avoidance of fast-paced assembly line work, to accommodate Plaintiff's mild limitations in her ability to maintain attention and concentration and moderate limitations in her ability to appropriately deal with stress, per Dr. Brownfeld's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

In other words, it is clear to the Court how the ALJ arrived at the assessed RFC, which is supported by opinion evidence in the record. There is no other opinion evidence in the record from an acceptable medical source that directly contradicts Dr. Brownfeld's opinions as to these functional limitations.
