(Dkt. 18). Defendant was initially charged with co-defendant Dominic Daniels, but Mr. Daniels pleaded guilty on July 19, 2018. (Dkt. 91). Defendant's trial is scheduled to commence on May 14, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion seeking to suppress evidence obtained through a warrant authorized on a cellular telephone used by Mr. Daniels. (Dkt. 176). Because Defendant did not have a privacy interest in Mr. Daniels' cell phone, his Fourth Amendment rights were not implicated, even if the cell phone was tracked by law enforcement into a hotel room being used by Defendant. Accordingly, Defendant's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The background of this matter is set forth in detail in the Court's Decision and Order entered October 5, 2018 (Dkt. 127), familiarity with which is assumed for purposes of this Decision and Order. As a brief summary, on May 15, 2017, Defendant rented Room #113 at the Comfort Inn and Suites Buffalo Airport Hotel located at 901 Dick Road, Cheektowaga, New York 14225 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Comfort Suites\"). (Dkt. 35-3 at \u00b6 3). On that date, Mr. Daniels was surveilled by law enforcement leaving the Comfort Suites with a blue package. Mr. Daniels was subsequently stopped by law enforcement and he had in his possession approximately 794 grams of cocaine, $ 17,000 in U.S. currency, and a key for Room #113 at the Comfort Suites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 127 at 5-6, 27 n.7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Mr. Daniels left the Comfort Suites, Defendant and his 14-year old son arrived at the hotel's parking lot in a black 2017 Corvette. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Law enforcement approached Defendant, ultimately leading to his flight and subsequent arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-12). At the time of his arrest, Defendant had in his possession a key to Room #113 at the Comfort Suites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    at 45-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   That same day, Erie County Court Judge Kenneth F. Case signed a search warrant authorizing a search of Room #113 at the Comfort Suites. (Dkt. 44-1 at 5-6). Earlier in the investigation and prior to the search of Room #113, law enforcement obtained a search warrant to obtain real-time cell site location information for telephone number (716) 536-9617, which was possessed by Mr. Daniels. (Dkt. 184-1). The search warrant is signed by Judge Case and is dated April 17, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Defendant now contends that \"[b]ecause law enforcement was privy to this information, any later investigation of Dominic Daniels, his whereabouts, or the ultimate arrest of defendant Richard Lucas is subject to suppression based upon the officers' derivative use of the said information.\" (Dkt. 176 at 5). More specifically, Defendant argues that he is entitled to discover\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the warrant materials authorizing the tracking of Mr. Daniels' cell phone, and\n   that he has standing to suppress evidence obtained through the tracking of the phone, because law enforcement allegedly tracked the phone to Room #113 at the Comfort Suites, a place where Defendant had an expectation of privacy.

In support of his argument, Defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    Alderman v.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Alderman\n   </em>\n   case is inapposite. Law enforcement did not install a listening device in Room #113, nor did they intercept any of Defendant's phone conversations. Instead, law enforcement obtained a warrant to obtain tracking information from Mr. Daniels' cell phone, which allegedly led them to the Comfort Suites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant also relies on\n   <em>\n    Kyllo v.

In\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that evidence obtained through the search of the interior of a residence with technology that is not available to the public-in that case, a thermal imager-constituted an unlawful search.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/\">\n    533 U.S. at 34-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   is also distinguishable; here, law enforcement simply allegedly obtained location information for Mr. Daniels' phone, rather than information relating to activities occurring inside Room #113. In other words, the tracking information from Mr. Daniels' phone did not reveal to law enforcement any information regarding the contents of or activities happening inside Room #113.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This contention is flawed, particularly because the information Defendant seeks to suppress was not obtained from Room #113; rather, it was collected as a result of a tracking warrant for Mr. Daniels' cell phone, in which Defendant has no expectation of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The case\n   <em>\n    United States v. Peters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527310\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/366/\">\n    333 F. Supp. 3d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Vt. 2018) is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed whether the government's tracking the cell phone of another person riding in the defendant's vehicle violated the defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment. The defendant's argument was similar to that raised here; that is, the defendant argued in\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   that \"evidence obtained by tracking [the passenger's] cell phone, including the traffic stop which resulted in her arrest, is inadmissible against her absent a warrant because she had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her vehicle and her own real-time location information,\" and \"the government must obtain a warrant before private citizens are inadvertently tracked through real-time cell site location information obtained by surveillance of another target.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527310\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527310\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/366/\">\n    at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court disagreed, and concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The fact that [the passenger's] cell phone happened to be located in Defendant's vehicle does not render the government's actions unconstitutional. There is no evidence that the government intentionally sought to obtain Defendant's location through the real-time location information pertaining to [the passenger's] phone. Instead, it was pure happenstance that [the passenger] entered Defendant's vehicle as opposed to her home or the vehicle or home of some other individual. There was thus no way the government could predict in advance that it would need a second warrant for Defendant's real-time location if she happened to be in proximity of [the passenger's] cell phone. The approach Defendant\n   advocates is thus wholly unworkable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the government does not dispute that the officers monitoring [the passenger's] location were aware that Defendant was also a target of the same investigation, her status as a person of interest does not materially alter the analysis because the government was not actively tracking her location. Even if the government believed that Defendant might come into contact with the target cell phone, such a belief is immaterial in light of a facially valid warrant authorizing the government to track the phone itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, even if Defendant possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in her real-time location information, the government did not violate that expectation and was not required to obtain a second warrant prior to arresting her. Any other conclusion would lead to unworkable and unreasonable results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527310\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527310\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/366/\">\n    at 377-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
