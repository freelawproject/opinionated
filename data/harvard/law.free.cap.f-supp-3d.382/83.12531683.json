In Maine, the term 'educational performance' encompasses \"performance in ... academic and functional areas ... including, but not limited to, those areas that are being assessed through the local [school administrative unit]'s own curriculum.\" MSER \u00a7 II(10).

Pl.'s Mem. 18 (ECF No. 15, #74). The \"trigger\" concept is not unheard of in this area of law and searching that term will yield a collection of cases that contemplate what set of circumstances, in a given case, \"trigger\" educational referrals. However, suggesting that the child-find factors provide a calculus for calendaring one specific trigger date to the exclusion of all others is unwarranted. School staff considering a student's need for either an accommodation or special education services are not charting planetary motion with astronomical instruments, but are instead deciding how best to facilitate educational objectives for a unique child with particular issues in a particular school setting. In this sense, the child-find factors, in my view, should not be regarded as a clockwork armillary sphere. The standard of reasonableness calls for a measure of leeway to explore whether a school's referral occurred at an appropriate time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Ninth &amp; Tenth Grade\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The hearing officer concluded CEHS did not violate its child-find duty when it did not refer Jane for services in ninth and tenth grade.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   335. I agree. The record indicates that despite the growing discord in the Doe home, this turmoil was not reflected in Jane's educational performance. Throughout these two years of school, Jane maintained excellent grades and earned an unweighted GPA of 91.85 and 89.32 in ninth-grade and tenth-grade, respectively.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   889, 904. Additionally, Jane had only one unexcused absence during the two total years - a figure that falls far short of the statutorily-defined absenteeism referral requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Jane's guidance counselor and parents repeatedly reported the absence of disciplinary problems at school.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   890; 2629; 2697 (recording that \"[Jane] ha[d] no\n   [history] of emotional dysregulation or behavioral issues within the school environment\" and further noting that the Does \"report[ed] that [Jane] has never been in trouble for aggression or violence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although the school was aware of the atmosphere in the Does' home and that Jane was receiving services outside of school that were impacting her ability to keep up in school, during Jane's tenth-grade year, the school 'intervention team' - a group of individuals not only experienced in and tasked with the responsibility of identifying children who may need assistance, but also familiar with Jane on a personal level - reasonably concluded that the need for special education services was not evident.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4312. On this point, I defer to the expertise of the hearing officer who saw no reason not to credit the perspectives of the teachers and administrators who had the opportunity to observe Jane closely over her ninth and tenth-grade years in the academic setting. Because the record supports CEHS's determination that Jane's disability, which up until March, 2016 remained undiagnosed and was not disclosed to CEHS until the following school year, had minimal - if any - effect on her educational performance during her ninth and tenth-grade years, her disability did not implicate CEHS's child-find requirements and certainly did not compel a finding that IDEA services were appropriate at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, although Jane's unilateral placement at the Hyde School lasted six weeks, I see no reason why that private placement would necessarily set in motion the absenteeism provision of Maine law, given that the placement was not an \"unexcused\" absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

The hearing officer found that early on in the schoolyear, Ms. Murphy-Lewis and Principal Shedd were attuned to Jane, but could only infer so much given the failure of the Does to share Dr. Paradis's evaluation.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   335. Furthermore, the hearing officer determined that Ms. Murphy-Lewis acted reasonably when she instituted the 504 process upon learning of Dr. Bowker-Kinley's diagnosis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895129\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1/#p13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She also found that the MSER did not \"mandate\" a special education referral based on Jane's absenteeism.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   336. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As noted by her teachers and school administrators, Jane missed a significant amount of schoolwork early on in her eleventh-grade year.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1247, 1250, 1262. By mid-October, Jane's academics were suffering, prompting Ms. Murphy-Lewis to send an email to Jane's teachers requesting an update on which classes Jane was \"in danger of failing for the first quarter.\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1261. A review of her attendance record tells a similar story. Up until Jane's 504 referral on October 10, 2016, she was absent seven times.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2171-72. Between the referral and the 504 Determination Meeting held on November 10, 2016, Jane was absent eight more times.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2172. From the time of her 504 Determination Meeting\n   to CEHS receiving the Does' consent for a special education evaluation on December 6, 2016, Jane was absent another eleven times.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2172-73. In sum, from the time school started to the time CEHS received the Does' consent to evaluate Jane for special education, Jane had twenty-six absences. School attendance records, however, reflect that of the twenty-six absences, only seven were regarded as \"unexcused,\" and they were not consecutive.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2172-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   While the sharp decline in Jane's attendance was clearly alarming to CEHS administrators, as determined by the hearing officer, Jane's absences fell short of Maine's statutory absenteeism standard, which turns on the existence of \"unexcused\" absences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSER \u00a7 IV(2)(A) (requiring \"the equivalent of 10 full days of unexcused absences or 7 consecutive school days of unexcused absences during a school year\" to implicate a school's child-find obligation);\n   <em>\n    see also R.\n   </em>\n   334 (indicating that at the time of the 504 referral, Jane \"had not yet met the threshold number of absences which would have mandated such a referral\"). Furthermore, as CEHS argues and as the hearing officer noted approvingly, a majority of Jane's early absences and the corresponding adverse impact on her educational performance could be attributed to issues unrelated to disability or suspected disability - a scenario that likewise fails to implicate CEHS's child-find obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In support of this stance, CEHS first points to the concussion Jane sustained on September 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2581. The school health office recorded that Jane slowly progressed through the stages of her concussion and did not reach the \"green zone\" until September 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1052. Similarly, Jane was regularly seen in the health office during this period and consistently complained of complications arising from her concussion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1053. It was not until after September 30, 2016 that Jane's complaints transitioned from concussion-related symptoms to those of \"emotional concern\" or other unrelated health issues.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1053. In addition to the concussion, as Ms. Murphy-Lewis explained, \"different factors [were] converging\" in Jane's life, including her \"living arrangements, her relationship with her parents, anxiety and feeling like she did not fit in with the culture at CEHS.\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   335. As the hearing officer concluded, \"[t]hese factors would not necessarily have prompted a special education referral.\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   335.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Without a causal link to a disability or suspected disability, the decline in Jane's educational performance was insufficient to obligate CEHS to identify and refer Jane in accordance with its child-find duty. And while the sheer number of absences certainly set off alarm bells, I am not persuaded by Plaintiffs' position that the MSER compelled a different conclusion under Maine law. Furthermore, for reasons set forth,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , in sections B.2 and D, even if CEHS had instituted an IEP referral or attempted an evaluation in October or November, 2016, Plaintiffs have not persuaded me that this matter would have unfolded any differently than it did in terms of their participation, or that, had the Does and Jane participated in the process, the end result would have dictated an IEP calling for a private residential program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Despite the possible non-disability culprits for Jane's educational decline, on\n   October 10, 2016, Ms. Murphy-Lewis nevertheless made a request to initiate the development of a 504 Plan to accommodate Jane under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   only five school days after Jane's first complaint of emotional concern to the school nurse - an approach which Jane's treating psychiatrist, Dr. Bowker-Kinley, independently recommended.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   948, 1253, 1258.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the 504 referral was too little, too late. Specifically, they assert that \"[b]y early October, ample evidence supported a suspicion that Jane could require special education and related services\" and therefore Ms. Murphy-Lewis's 504 referral was an insufficient response.

Because Jane was a proven student and her symptoms correlated so directly with what was going on in the home, the record, including some professional commentary, could suggest that the Does were the kindling in this special education scenario. Additionally, the record does permit a finding that the Does circled the wagons and did not facilitate the school's special education evaluation process, both when Jane was still at CEHS and after her out-of-state placement. Based on my review of the record, however, I am not persuaded that the hearing officer's decision is the product of the \"blame game,\" to borrow from Plaintiffs. Rather, my impression is that the hearing officer, someone familiar with the administrative demands of special education law and the pace and manner in which matters typically progress, concluded after a fulsome hearing and review of an extensive record that CEHS complied with its obligations under state and federal law.
