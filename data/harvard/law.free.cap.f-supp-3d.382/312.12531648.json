Initially she told AWF that Cond\u00e9 Nast's use infringed one of her colored Prince portraits but, after further comparison, notified AWF that Cond\u00e9 Nast's use actually infringed one of her black-and-white portraits - the Goldsmith Prince Photograph.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-27.

Indeed, twelve of the sixteen works have been auctioned or sold throughout the world, and AWF has made each of the sixteen works available for licensing to third parties for use in books, magazines, newspapers, and for other merchandizing purposes. However, AWF gave four of the works to the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and some of the other works have been exhibited at other galleries and museums. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has commented that \"[n]otwithstanding the fact that artists are sometimes paid and museums sometimes earn money, the public exhibition of art is widely and we think properly considered to have value that benefits the broader public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Blanch v.

Moreover, AWF is a not-for-profit entity that was created for the purpose of advancing visual art, and profits derived from licensing Warhol's works help fund AWF's programs.

As Goldsmith has confirmed, her photographic work centers on helping others formulate their identities, which she aims to capture and reveal through her photography. Her photoshoot illustrated that Prince is \"not a comfortable person\" and that he is a \"vulnerable human being.\" AWF's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 90. The Goldsmith Prince Photograph reflects these qualities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Warhol's Prince Series, in contrast, can reasonably be perceived to reflect the opposite. In all but one of the works, Prince's torso is removed and his face and a small portion of his neckline are brought to the forefront. The details of Prince's bone structure that appear crisply in the photograph, which Goldsmith sought to emphasize, are softened in several of the Prince Series works and outlined or shaded in the others. Prince appears as a flat, two-dimensional figure in Warhol's works, rather than the detailed, three-dimensional being in Goldsmith's photograph. Moreover, many of Warhol's Prince Series works contain loud, unnatural colors, in stark contrast with the black-and-white original photograph. And Warhol's few colorless works appear as rough sketches in which Prince's expression is almost entirely lost from the original.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   These alterations result in an aesthetic and character different from the original. The Prince Series works can reasonably be perceived to have transformed Prince from a vulnerable, uncomfortable person to an iconic, larger-than-life figure. The humanity Prince embodies in Goldsmith's photograph is gone. Moreover, each Prince Series work is immediately recognizable as a \"Warhol\" rather than as a photograph of Prince - in the same way that Warhol's famous representations of Marilyn Monroe and Mao are recognizable as \"Warhols,\" not as realistic photographs of those persons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, the Prince Series works are transformative.

Goldsmith has presented evidence demonstrating that she incorporated these elements into her artistic process when shooting Prince, and they are apparent in her photograph. However, these creative elements are almost entirely absent from the Prince Series works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   All but one of Warhol's works include only Prince's head and a small portion of his neckline; Goldsmith's photograph captures much of Prince's torso. The sharp contours of Prince's face that Goldsmith emphasized in her photograph are softened in some Prince Series works and traced over or shaded in others. Moreover, the three-dimensional effect in the photograph, produced by the background and lighting that Goldsmith chose, was removed by Warhol resulting in a flat, two-dimensional and mask-like figure of Prince's head. And in the majority of his Prince Series works, Warhol traded Goldsmith's white background for a loudly colored background. Indeed, unlike Goldsmith's photograph, most of Warhol's works are entirely in color, and the works that are black and white are especially crude and the creative features of the Goldsmith Prince Photograph are especially absent. Ultimately, Warhol's alterations wash away the vulnerability and humanity Prince expresses in Goldsmith's photograph and Warhol instead presents Prince as a larger-than-life icon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Although the pose and angle of Prince's head were copied from the photograph to the Prince Series, \"such a pose cannot be copyrighted\" because copyright law \"protect[s] only plaintiff's particular photographic expression of [a] pose[ ] and not the underlying ideas therefor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kate Spade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8922864\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/388/382/#p392\">\n    388 F.

And several non-Goldsmith photographs capture Prince in a similar pose, indicating that the pose is not particularly original.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AWF 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 96. Finally, to the extent that Prince's facial features remain in Warhol's works, the features themselves are not copyrightable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mattel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9252390\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/133/#p136\">\n    365 F.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the distinctive (and therefore copyrightable) way in which Goldsmith presented those features is absent from the Prince Series works.

Although Goldsmith points out that her photographs and Warhol's works have both appeared in magazines and on album covers, this does not suggest that a magazine or record company would license a transformative Warhol work in lieu of a realistic Goldsmith photograph. Moreover, Goldsmith does not specify the types of magazines and album covers on which she and Warhol appear, and whether they are similar. Put simply, the licensing market for Warhol prints is for \"Warhols.\" This market is distinct from the licensing market for photographs like Goldsmith's - a market which Goldsmith has not even attempted to enter into with her Prince photographs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The evidence shows that the Prince Series works are not market substitutes that have harmed - or have the potential to harm - Goldsmith.

Both are unpublished decisions from the Central District of California involving a defendant's copying and then altering the plaintiff's photograph to create a new work based primarily on the original photograph. The court in each case found against the defendant in its fair use analysis. In the first case,\n    <em>\n     Friedman v. Guetta\n    </em>\n    , the defendant admitted to making only \"small alterations\" to a digital copy of the plaintiff's photograph, and the defendant \"[did] not offer[ ] a transformative alternative use\" of the photograph despite copying \"the heart\" of the photograph.

May 27, 2011). And in the second case,\n    <em>\n     Morris v.
