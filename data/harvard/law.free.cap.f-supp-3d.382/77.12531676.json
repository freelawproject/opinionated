The President states that \"fact discovery should not commence unless the Court denies the motion for interlocutory appeal,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, and the parties agree on a proposed briefing schedule that would be complete within another three months,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties agree, therefore, that discovery will conclude and cross motions for summary judgment will be fully briefed within six months. Once the cross motions are ripe, the Court will be able to resolve them expeditiously thereby terminating the case. In view of this abbreviated discovery and briefing schedule, the President has not \"carried [his] burden of demonstrating that interlocutory appeal of this question at this point in time would materially advance the litigation as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11373370\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/233/16/#p28\">\n    233 F.

This discovery and briefing schedule stands in stark contrast to cases in this district where Courts have found the moving party to have met the burden of establishing the third element of the section 1292(b) test. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Molock v.

In\n   <em>\n    APCC Services Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Judge Huvelle found the third element of the section 1292(b) test to be satisfied in protracted litigation where discovery had been ongoing \"more than four years after the filing of the suit\" and where the significant costs of discovery\n   were expected to \"exceed any possible damages award.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9055927\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/297/90/#p100\">\n    297 F.
