Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant, released from prison after a successful habeas corpus petition which was subsequently denied on appeal, seeks release from incarceration pending resolution of his petition for review by the United States Supreme Court. Defendant argues that he is entitled to release pursuant to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The government disagrees. Defendant also seeks release on compassionate grounds; his wife is ill with breast cancer and scheduled to have surgery in a matter of weeks. Defendant's request is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The government did not object to his release at that time, but appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and, at its direction, this court reinstated the original sentence.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20F.%20App%27x%20108\">\n    752 F.

At the time of the reinstatement, Brown was already in federal custody after pleading guilty to four violations of the terms of his supervision: (1) positive urinalysis for marijuana, (2) positive urinalysis for cocaine, (3) failure to participate in drug aftercare treatment, and (4) failure to participate in mental health counseling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.

He has completed his term of incarceration for those violations and is in federal custody serving the balance of his longer reinstated sentence in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant filed a timely petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. It remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   He requests that he be released from federal custody while the petition is pending because Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(c) incorporates a presumption of release pending review of a decision granting a criminal defendant's habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from K.

Brown would like to be able to provide her physical assistance and moral support during this difficult time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The government opposes Defendant's motion for release, arguing that his request is governed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(b), which allows the court to release a criminal defendant at its discretion. But the court should not exercise that discretion to release Defendant, the government argues, because he is unlikely to be successful in an appeal of the Second Circuit's decision. The government did, however, agree to consider a limited term of release to account for Defendant's wife's health issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A hearing on the motion was conducted on May 30, 2019. The court directed the parties to obtain additional information about Brown's wife's medical issues and propose a release plan. The parties have failed to provide a plan. Defendant was unable to obtain additional information about his wife's health condition, and the government continues to oppose Defendant's request for release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23 governs the release of successful and unsuccessful habeas corpus petitioners pending resolution of appeals. When a petitioner seeks release following an order granting her habeas petition (a \"successful petitioner\"), one standard applies pursuant to Rule 23(c). If a petitioner seeks release following an order rejecting her habeas petition (an \"unsuccessful habeas petitioner\"), another standard applies pursuant to Rule 23(b).

She will have breast removal surgery on July 13. After the operation, there will be a period of recovery.
