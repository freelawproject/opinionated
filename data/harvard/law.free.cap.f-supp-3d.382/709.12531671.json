Doc. 8. At issue is whether the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") erred in finding Plaintiff not \"disabled\" and therefore unentitled to Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\"). This case is before the Court on Plaintiff's Statement of Errors (doc. 10), the Commissioner's memorandum in opposition (doc. 12), Plaintiff's reply (doc. 13), the administrative record (doc. 5),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

PageID 545.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed for SSI in 2010 and, after an initial denial of her application, received\n   a hearing before ALJ Thomas McNichols on September 28, 2012. PageID 59. ALJ McNichols issued a written decision on November 6, 2012 finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 59-76. After the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for a review of the ALJ's decision, Plaintiff filed an appeal with this Court. PageID 541-42. Finding that the ALJ erred in his analysis of Plaintiff's treating physician, this Court remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

ALJ Motta issued a written decision October 28, 2015, again finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 771-90. Finding that ALJ Motta's decision did not sufficiently address this Court's directives on remand, the Appeals Council vacated the non-disability finding and remanded the case for further proceedings. PageID 799-801. Specifically, the Appeals Council directed ALJ Motta to \"give further consideration to treating source opinion evidence with particular emphasis on SSR 12-2p in conjunction with the claimant's fibromyalgia and explain the weight given to such opinion evidence.\" PageID 542.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ALJ Motta held a third administrative hearing on October 26, 2016. PageID 578-606. For a third time, an ALJ issued a written decision finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 541-68. Specifically, ALJ Motta found at Step Five that, based upon Plaintiff's Residual Functional Capacity (\"RFC\") to perform a reduced range of light work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"there were jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy that [Plaintiff] could have performed[.]\" PageID 567.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request to review ALJ Motta's December 29, 2016 decision, making her non-disability finding the final administrative decision of the Commissioner.

In light of the errors illuminated above, the undersigned finds reversible error in the ALJ's assessment of Dr. Gebhart's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ALJ similarly erred in discounting the opinions of treating psychologists,\n   C. Jesse Carlock, Ph.D., and Kathleen Glaus, Ph.D. Both Drs. Carlock and Glaus authored opinions concluding that Plaintiff would be absent from work more than three times a month; has \"marked\" restrictions of daily living; \"marked\" restrictions in concentration, persistence, and pace; and has \"extreme\" functional limitations due to episodes of deterioration or decompensation in work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   PageID 445.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In affording their opinions \"little weight,\" the ALJ found it \"quite evident that any limitations described [by Drs. Carlock and Glaus] were based largely, if not entirely, on the Claimant's subjective complaints and self-reported symptoms.\" PageID 552. Yet, the psychologists provided an extensive list of the clinical findings, treatment, and prognosis that demonstrate the severity of Plaintiff's mental impairments and symptoms. PageID 444. Moreover, Plaintiff's treatment notes from Drs. Carlock and Glaus document that she consistently exhibited a depressed, hopeless, anxious, anhedonic mood; concentration problems; and tearful behavior. Thus, the ALJ's determination -- that the opinions of Drs. Carlock and Glaus \"lack any support\" -- is belied by a close reading of the medical record. PageID 552.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To the extent that the ALJ discounted the treating psychologists' opinions because they relied on Plaintiff's subjective complaints, such an assessment demonstrates a fundamentally flawed understanding of mental impairments. Like fibromyalgia, \"a psychiatric impairment is not as readily amenable to substantiation by objective laboratory testing as a medical impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v. Bowen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1816634\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/874/1116/#p1121\">\n    874 F.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1121 (6th Cir. 1989). Contrary to the ALJ's assertion, \"the report of a psychiatrist [or other mental health personnel] should not be rejected simply because of ... the absence of substantial documentation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1816634\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/874/1116/#p1121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Next, the ALJ discounted Drs. Carlock and Glaus's physical limitations on the grounds that the doctors are \"mental health professionals.\" PageID 552. The ALJ erred in this respect because she flouted both the instructions given to her on remand\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the mandate of Social Security Regulation (\"SSR\") 12-2p.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

Thus, the ALJ again failed to comply with SSR 12-2p and, in so doing, also failed to establish \"good reasons\" for discounting the opinions of Plaintiff's treating psychologists.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

First, the ALJ found that \"the claimant's alleged symptoms appear\n   much more severe than any pathology shown on lumbar spine studies in the record.\" PageID 546.

Second, the ALJ repeatedly cited Plaintiff's lack of treatment as evidence that her impairments and symptoms were overstated,\n   <em>\n    see e.g.,\n   </em>\n   PageID 553, 555, but failed to note her extensive medication list, including Zoloft, Lyrica, Flexeril, Naproxen, Vicodin, and Valium, PageID 463.\n   <em>\n    Boston v.

More egregious is that the ALJ's proposition pits Plaintiff against a double-edged sword: she is condemned when she seeks treatment and condemned when she does not.
