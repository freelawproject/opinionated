Compl., at 5. HGEA is the certified exclusive representative of certain University employees, including Grossman, for collective bargaining purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. By statute, the exclusive representative \"shall be responsible for representing the interests of all [bargaining unit employees] without discrimination and without regard to employee organization membership.\" Hawai'i Revised Statute (HRS) \u00a7 89-8(a). This statutory requirement is the basis of Grossman's claim in Count II. Grossman alleges that the exclusive representation structure results in compelled speech because the Union's statements, whatever they may be, are ascribed to University employees, such as herself, irrespective of Union membership and irrespective of whether they share the Union's views.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 20, 2018, Grossman initiated this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). On February 11, 2019, HGEA filed a Motion to Dismiss Count II, arguing that Grossman failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because her claims in Count II are foreclosed by controlling precedent. Defendants Lassner and Suzuki\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   joined in the Motion. Dkt. Nos. 38, 40. Grossman filed an opposition, and Defendants timely replied, also offering supplemental authority. Dkt. Nos. 41, 43-44. The Court found these matters suitable for disposition without a hearing, pursuant to Local Rule 7.2(d), and thus vacated the previously-scheduled hearing on the Motion. Dkt. No. 45. This disposition follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes the Court to dismiss a complaint that fails \"to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Rule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2).

Together, these provisions grant exclusive representation of Hawai'i government employees in collective bargaining to a single employee organization-here, HGEA. Grossman asks this Court \"to recognize and acknowledge that...neither the government nor the union can claim the union is representing non-members in its\n   negotiations with the government\" because to do so \"would violate Grossman's First Amendment right to freedom of association.\" Opp. at 2. In moving to dismiss this claim, Defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mentele\n   </em>\n   foreclose Grossman's First Amendment challenge. The Court agrees that each of these decisions, binding on this Court, preclude Count II. As such, Count II is dismissed for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Grossman challenges the provisions of state law that allow a single employee organization, such as HGEA, to be \"responsible for representing the interests of all [bargaining unit] employees without discrimination and without regard to employee organization membership.\" Opp. at 2. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   considered a similar Minnesota law that \"establishe[d] a procedure, based on majority support within a unit, for the designation of an exclusive bargaining agent for that unit.\" According to Minnesota law, where such an agent was selected, \"the employer may neither 'meet and negotiate' nor 'meet and confer' with any members of that bargaining unit except through their exclusive representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    465 U.S. at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The exclusive representative structure in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   contemplated that not every individual employee would agree with the views of the employee's peers or exclusive representative on every policy question, nor would every employee in the bargaining unit be a member of the exclusive representative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Minnesota law and the exclusive representation structure it gave rise to in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   are materially indistinguishable from those here: Hawai'i requires that a designated, exclusive representative bargain on behalf of public sector employees on employment-related matters, recognizing that some of those employees are not members of and may disagree with the position of the exclusive representative. Such a system, according to the Supreme Court, does not violate the First Amendment because \"The state has in no way restrained appellees' freedom to speak on any education-related issue or their freedom to associate or not to associate with whom they please, including the exclusive representative. Nor has the state attempted to suppress any ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    465 U.S. at 288-290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Faced with\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , Grossman argues that\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   no longer represents good law after\n   <em>\n    Janus v.
