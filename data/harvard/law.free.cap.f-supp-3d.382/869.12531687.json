DAWSON, SENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The City of Hot Springs, Arkansas has adopted an ordinance restricting communication by means of physical interaction between persons in public roadways within city limits. The ordinance distinguishes messages between pedestrians and vehicle occupants attempting to communicate and subjects these individuals to differential treatment. This Court now holds that the ordinance is a content-based regulation of speech that cannot survive strict scrutiny. Although the effort by the City to enact the ordinance does not meet constitutional requirements, the City is not to be criticized for its attempt protect the safety of its citizens and those who use the streets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Plaintiff. ECF No. 31. Defendant has filed a Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion (ECF. No. 34), and Plaintiff filed a Reply to Defendant's Response (ECF No. 39). Also, before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (EDF No. 36), to which Plaintiff has filed a Response in Opposition (ECF No. 41), and Defendant has filed a Reply to Plaintiff's Response (ECF No. 42). This matter is ripe for the Court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, a beggar and panhandler (as described in his pleadings), is a disabled veteran who has \"resorted to begging in order to have enough money to live on.\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 1, ECF 31-1. Plaintiff regularly begs within the city limits of Hot Springs, Arkansas (the \"City\" herein), and has been doing so for several years. He has previously been cited, arrested and put in jail by the Hot Springs Police Department for begging alongside public roadways within City limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He brings this constitutional challenge to an ordinance enacted by the City prohibiting physical interaction between the occupant of a motor vehicle and a pedestrian while the motor vehicle is in operation on a public roadway unless the vehicle is lawfully parked. HOT SPRINGS , ARK. , Ordinance No. 6217 (Dec. 5, 2017) (\"the Ordinance\"). Alleging the Ordinance was crafted with discriminatory intent against beggars and panhandlers, and claiming the Ordinance abridges his First Amendment right to free speech and is unconstitutionally vague under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiff filed suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   seeking declaratory judgment that the Ordinance violates the United States Constitution on its face and to permanently enjoin its enforcement. The named defendant is Jason Stachey in his official capacity as Chief of Police. Plaintiff alleges the Ordinance is unconstitutional because it criminalizes protected speech. Plaintiff claims he is chilled from freely exercising his right to protected speech due to concerns about being warned, questioned, cited, arrested, jailed, prosecuted, found guilty and penalized by fines, penalties, imprisonment and court costs. Plaintiff also claims the Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because the wording makes it unclear whether he is prohibited from begging on streets and roadways within City limits. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, monetary damages, and an award of Plaintiff's costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff originally filed the complaint in this case seeking to invalidate a completely different City ordinance. On September 6, 2016, the City enacted \"An Absolute Ban on Solicitation\" making it a crime for a person to \"enter upon a roadway, median, or portion of a public street, or otherwise approaching a vehicle located in any portion of a public street or roadway for the purpose of soliciting anything from the occupant of a vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" HOT SPRINGS , ARK. , Ordinance No. 6168 (Sept. 6, 2016) (Ordinance\n   No. 6168 herein). Plaintiff was warned by a member of the Hot Springs Police Department that he would be taken to jail if he violated Ordinance No. 6168, and thereafter Plaintiff was afraid to beg within the City limits. (Pl's Mot. Summ. J, Ex. 1, ECF No. 31-1). On June 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed suit to invalidate Ordinance No. 6168 as unconstitutional. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff also filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction seeking to prevent enforcement of the ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 5.) In its Response to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the City notified the Court, \"that it will not enforce the existing ordinance [No. 6168] at issue in this case pending a determination on the merits, or a resolution of this case by the parties.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 1, ECF No. 15.) Based upon this representation and finding no threat of irreparable harm to Plaintiff, the Court denied Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction by order entered July 19, 2017 (ECF No. 17). Plaintiff thereafter resumed panhandling \"freely in the city without fear.\" (Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 1, ECF 31-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A few months later, the City enacted \"An Ordinance to Promote Public Safety Within the Roadways and Public Streets of The City of Hot Springs, Arkansas, and for Other Purposes.\" HOT SPRINGS , ARK. , Ordinance No. 6217 (Dec. 5, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   December 18, 2017, Plaintiff filed a First Amended and Substituted Complaint seeking to invalidate Ordinance No. 6217 as unconstitutional. (ECF No. 23.) A Second Amended and Substituted Complaint was filed on January 10, 2018 adding Todd Reid as a party plaintiff. (Sec. Am. Compl., ECF No. 26.) Reid identified himself as someone who \"has given money to panhandlers while occupying a motor vehicle in operation on the public streets of Hot Springs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff wishes to continue to beg in Hot Springs, and he continues to do so while the ordinance is not being enforced. Plaintiff is afraid that if the ordinance is enforced in the future, his right to freedom of expression will again be chilled as he will fear harassment and punishment by the City. (Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 1, ECF No. 31.) No criminal charges are currently pending against Plaintiff in the City.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that when a party moves for summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Fed.

While it is true that the right to free speech does not include all conduct that is connected to speech, when it comes to physical interaction between humans, the act itself is often both the message and the conduct. In many instances the two are so intertwined it is not possible to separate the speech and non-speech elements. All people everywhere routinely communicate non-verbal messages through physical interaction, often without even noticing it. It is visceral and instinctive, and it is often the quickest way to communicate. Messages conveyed through physical interaction include acknowledgment, support, contribution, charity, love, gratitude, agreement, acceptance, instruction, compliance, cooperation, inclusion, generosity, praise, disgust, aggression, sympathy, and sadness just to name a few. It matters not that the Ordinance does not prohibit with specificity the exact messages delivered through physical interaction. \"[A] narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Hurley v.

The City also contends that the Ordinance is justified without reference to the content of any protected First Amendment activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This Court has ruled that physical interaction as defined in Ordinance No. 6217 is protected speech. The Ordinance distinguished physical interaction between certain persons within the roadway and singles them out for penalty, and one may identify violators of the Ordinance only by examining the content of the messages being transmitted. The content of the outlawed messages is physical interaction. The regulation to promote public safety within the roadways and public streets cannot be justified without reference to both the message (the physical interaction) and the speaker (a pedestrian or occupant of a motor vehicle). Verbal and written messages may be transmitted freely to the eyes and ears of everyone in the roadway without restriction, and not all physical interaction is prohibited in the roadway. Only messages of physical interaction between a pedestrian and a motor vehicle or its occupants in operation are prohibited. Thus, whether the restrictions are applicable depends entirely upon distinguishing the speaker and the communicative content of the speech. As Ordinance 6217 distinguishes between the content of different messages, the Court finds it is content-based and subject to constitutional strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(\"[A] State's interest in protecting the safety and convenience of persons using a public forum is a valid governmental objective.\") The court finds that the City has shown a compelling state interest in promoting the roadway safety of pedestrians, motorists, and vehicle occupants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Narrowly Tailored\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The crux of this case lies in determining whether the Ordinance is narrowly tailored to meet the stated interests of addressing the safety hazard created by \"pedestrian traffic within the unauthorized portions of the roadways and streets of the City.\" (Ordinance No. 6217.) The Ordinance does not \"fit\" because it is under-inclusive with respect to the protection of pedestrians within the unauthorized portions of a roadway or street. The Ordinance applies only to certain pedestrians, and yet no one is safe in a roadway no matter the reason for being there. Whether a pedestrian enters the roadway to interact with vehicles, perform road maintenance, cross the street, or engage in protected speech not involving physical interaction with anyone, the pedestrian is at significant risk of death or injury. The NHTSA report relied on by the City to support its compelling interest applies generally to \"pedestrian safety\" and is not limited to pedestrians intending to physically interact with motor vehicles in the roadway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report shows that\n   roadways are inherently dangerous whether one intends to physically interact with a vehicle or not. Even those who observe safety precautions with the intent of avoiding contact with a motor vehicle are at risk of death or injury while in the street or roadway. By singling out only certain persons with certain types of messages, the City has fashioned a \"fit\" that is too small to cover its legitimate and compelling interest in promoting the safety of all pedestrians in unauthorized portions of the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The ordinance is also geographically over-inclusive. The Ordinance applies citywide, yet the City has introduced no evidence that \"physical interaction\" between pedestrians and vehicles presents the same level of risk to pedestrian safety on each and every street and roadway within the City limits. Because the burden rests on the City to submit evidence in support of its position, the Court cannot simply assume that all City streets and roadways are equally dangerous or present equal risks and hazards with regard to the safety of pedestrians and motorists. The blanket application of the Ordinance to all streets and roadways within the City limits substantially burdens more expressive conduct than is reasonably necessary to achieve its purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Town of Gilbert, Ariz.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit considered whether a city ordinance prohibiting roadway distribution of literature to vehicle occupants, was narrowly tailored to serve the city's significant interests in pedestrian and traffic safety. The record on appeal contained, among other things, a report from a traffic consultant and affidavits from two traffic researchers. The city had amended its traffic ordinance by defining key terms and adding a preamble to explain the law's purpose to address \" 'public safety concerns,' specifically the risk that people soliciting or distributing materials with a roadway would distract drivers and 'result in the person in the roadway being struck by the\n   vehicle during its operation, or the vehicle striking another vehicle or property in an effort to avoid the person in the roadway.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 972. The amended ordinance allowed distribution to the occupant of a non-moving vehicle on the roadway adjacent to the sidewalk by someone standing on the sidewalk. The effect of this amendment was to permit distribution to vehicle occupants by persons standing on the sidewalk near some of the several stop signs in the city. The court concluded from the record that the ordinance was not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government's interest, and that \"the Desloge ordinance [was] narrowly tailored to serve its asserted interests, those being to prevent harm to pedestrians or to persons seeking to distribute materials to vehicles in the roadways while permitting distributions along the side of the roadways and at other locations in Desloge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 976.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Desloge ordinance is distinguishable from the ordinance in the case at bar. The focus of the Desloge ordinance was limited to roadway distribution of literature to vehicle occupants, and the city produced evidence to show that its ordinance was enacted to address traffic safety concerns specific to distribution. In addition, the distribution of materials to vehicle occupants by persons standing outside of the roadway remained permissible at some of the stop signs within the city. In contrast, the preamble to Hot Springs Ordinance 6217 sets out a very broad general purpose stating that the Ordinance is designed to protect pedestrian safety in unauthorized portions of the roadways. Yet the restrictions in the Ordinance only apply to pedestrians and vehicle occupants attempting physical interaction. The NHTSA report relied upon by the City to support the relationship between the Ordinance and the City's stated interest speaks to pedestrian safety in general and does not document \"the dangers associated with pedestrian interaction with vehicular traffic.\" Finally, Ordinance No. 6217 outlaws completely and makes no allowance for physical interaction between occupants of vehicles in operation and pedestrians anywhere within the City limits. Based upon these distinctions, the Court does not find\n   <em>\n    Desloge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , is controlling authority on the issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   By restricting only physical interaction between pedestrians and the occupants of motor vehicles in unauthorized portions of all streets and roadways within City limits, the Ordinance does not serve to advance the stated goal of public safety for all pedestrians, motorists, and occupants of vehicles. In addition, and as noted above, there is no evidence showing that all City streets and roadways are equally dangerous. Without such evidence, the Court cannot assume the restriction is reasonably necessary to achieve the stated purpose of the Ordinance. Accordingly, even if the Court were to find the Ordinance content-neutral, the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored and cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    E.
