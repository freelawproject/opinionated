DAVID PROCTOR, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In September 2018, the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama (\"Board\" or \"Dental Board\") sent a cease-and-desist letter to SmileDirectClub, LLC (\"SmileDirect\"). The letter and subsequent communications from the Board informed SmileDirect that certain services it performs for customers at its Alabama shop can only be performed at facilities where a licensed dentist is physically present. Because SmileDirect does not have a licensed dentist physically present at its facility, the Board considers SmileDirect's nondentist personnel to be engaged in the unauthorized practice of dentistry. It therefore ordered SmileDirect to immediately cease performing those services without a supervising dentist present at the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   SmileDirect and one of its affiliated dentists, Dr. Blaine Leeds, claim that the Board's actions violate federal and state law. They filed this action against the Board and its members (in their official and individual capacities). SmileDirect and Dr. Leeds (\"Plaintiffs\") seek (1) an injunction forbidding the Board and its members (\"Defendants\") from requiring SmileDirect to have a dentist physically present at its facility and (2) a declaration that Defendants' conduct is unlawful. (Doc. # 29 at 46). Defendants have moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. (Doc. # 32);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6). After careful consideration, and for the reasons explained below, the court concludes that the motion (Doc. # 32) is due to be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   SmileDirect operates a web-based teledentisry platform that connects patients seeking clear aligner therapy with licensed dentists. (Doc. # 29 at \u00b6 23). Dentists like Dr. Leeds contract with SmileDirect to provide certain support services that enable them to treat patients remotely, often across state lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The platform enables Dr. Leeds, who has an Alabama dental license but resides in Nashville, Tennessee, to provide corrective teeth realignment for patients in Alabama who have mild to moderate malocclusion (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , improperly positioned teeth when the jaws are closed). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SmileDirect's business model operates as follows. A prospective patient considering clear aligner therapy first visits one of\n   SmileDirect's physical locations, known as \"SmileShops.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). There, SmileDirect employees use an iTero device -- described by Plaintiffs as \"essentially a wand with a camera\" -- to rapidly take thousands of digital photographs of the patient's teeth and gums. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). The iTero is inserted into the patient's mouth \"at varying angles to photograph the teeth and tissue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The iTero does not use ionizing radiation, x-rays, or gamma rays; instead, it simply takes digital photographs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30). After each use of the iTero, SmileDirect employees remove and discard the disposable cover on the device and clean the wand with a disinfecting wipe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95-96). SmileDirect employees also take standard digital photographs of the patient's teeth and gums using a regular digital camera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The iTero images are then sent to a dental lab, which creates a three-dimensional model of the prospective patient's teeth, bite, gums, and palate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 87). Dr. Leeds or another Alabama-licensed dentist then reviews the three-dimensional model -- along with the standard digital photographs, the patient's health and dental histories, and other pertinent information -- to decide whether clear aligner therapy may be appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-36). The dentist reviews these materials to identify any periodontal disease, cavities, or other conditions that would require further clearance or prevent the patient from receiving clear aligner therapy through SmileDirect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). If the dentist determines clear aligner therapy is appropriate and the patient agrees, the dentist writes a prescription to a lab to have the clear aligners fabricated and shipped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The patient then receives a series of custom-made removable plastic retainers that are placed on the patient's teeth to move them in small increments until the desired positioning is achieved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 20, 2018, the Board sent SmileDirect a cease-and-desist letter stating that SmileDirect was engaged in the unauthorized practice of dentistry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59). Plaintiffs allege the letter was sent in response to a complaint the Board received from a competing Alabama-licensed dentist about SmileDirect's operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58). On October 3, 2018, representatives from SmileDirect met with the Board to explain the function of the iTero and their belief that its use does not constitute a dental procedure that would require the presence of a licensed dentist on site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61). Six days later, the Board emailed the following message to counsel for SmileDirect: \"Thank you for coming by the Board office last week to discuss Smile Direct Club. I reviewed the situation with the Board last Friday in detail. I was directed to inform you that your client immediately must cease and desist performing the services that are considered the practice of dentistry (i.e. digital imaging) without a supervising dentist present.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62). SmileDirect and Dr. Leeds responded by filing this lawsuit. (Doc. # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Board's cease-and-desist letter and subsequent communications were based on certain provisions of the Alabama Dental\n   Practice Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-1\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 34-9-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and a regulation promulgated by the Board pursuant to its authority to \"[a]dopt rules and regulations to implement\" the Act,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 34-9-43(a)(10). The Act defines what constitutes the practice of dentistry in Alabama, stating in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any person shall be deemed to be practicing dentistry who does any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (7) Uses a roentgen, radiograph, or digital imaging machine for the purpose of making dental roentgenograms, radiographs, or digital images....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 34-9-6. However, the Act goes on to exempt certain practices that would otherwise fall within this definition from being considered the practice of dentistry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Nothing in this chapter shall apply to the following practices, acts, and operations:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (5) The use of roentgen machines or other means for making radiographs, digital images, or similar records, of dental or oral tissues under the supervision of a licensed dentist or physician....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 34-9-7(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Board contends the iTero is a \"digital imaging machine\" and that the images it produces are \"digital images\" within the meaning of Alabama Code \u00a7 34-9-6. (Doc. # 29 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 62-68). It therefore understands persons who use the iTero to be practicing dentistry-unless they do so \"under the supervision of a licensed dentist or physician.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-7\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 34-9-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Board also claims SmileDirect's use of an iTero violates one of the Board's regulations. (Doc. # 29 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 62-68). The regulation defines dental hygienists, dental assistants, and dental laboratory technicians as \"[a]llied dental personnel\" and identifies certain dentistry-related duties they are permitted to perform. Ala. Admin. Code 270-X-3-.10. Under the regulation, dental assistants and dental hygienists may \"[m]ake dental radiographs or digital images.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, however, all of the duties listed-including making digital images-are \"[s]ubject to the prohibition that no intra-oral procedure can be performed unless under the direct supervision of a duly licensed dentist as defined by Board rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Direct supervision\" is defined by another Board regulation as \"supervision by a dentist who authorizes the intraoral procedure to be performed, is physically present in the dental facility and available during performance of the procedure, examines the patient during the procedure and takes full professional responsibility for the completed procedure.\" Ala. Admin. Code 270-X-3-.06. Because SmileDirect employees make intraoral digital images using an iTero at a facility where no licensed dentist is physically present, the Board understands them to be engaged in the unauthorized practice of dentistry, in violation of Alabama Administrative Code 270-X-3-.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Board's actions against SmileDirect are not motivated by a desire to protect the public from the unauthorized practice of dentistry. Instead, Plaintiffs argue the Board -- which by statute consists of six dentists and one dental hygienist who are all selected by other members of the dental profession,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-40\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 34-9-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -- seeks to protect Alabama dentists from competition by innovators like SmileDirect and Dr. Leeds, who provide clear aligner therapy at lower prices than traditional dentists. They claim that use of the iTero poses no health or safety risks and that the Board's requirement that SmileDirect have a licensed dentist physically present at its SmileShops cannot be justified by anything besides economic protectionism. Plaintiffs therefore filed this lawsuit against the Board and each of its members (in their individual and official capacities), asserting claims\n   under the Sherman Antitrust Act, U.S. Constitution, and Alabama Constitution. (Doc. # 29 at \u00b6\u00b6 107-185).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Board and its members, for their part, claim that the physical-presence requirement serves important public health and safety purposes and that all of Plaintiffs' claims are due to be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a complaint provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

They also request a declaratory judgment that the Board's challenged conduct exceeded its authority under the Alabama Dental Practice Act. For the reasons explained below, the court concludes that Plaintiffs may proceed with their Sherman Act and Dormant Commerce Clause claims against the Board members in their official capacities. Before addressing Plaintiffs' various claims, the court first deals with several threshold issues concerning sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Board of Dental Examiners is Entitled to Sovereign Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Board argues it is entitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Versiglio v.

The court agrees. Plaintiffs' claims against the Board itself are barred by sovereign immunity and must therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit held that the Board of Dental Examiners was an arm of the State of Alabama and therefore entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from a claim asserted under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904405\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/1290/\">\n    686 F.3d at 1291-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit based its\n   decision on a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that the Board was an arm of the state entitled to immunity from a breach-of-contract claim under Alabama's constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Bd. of Dental Examiners of Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7010324\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/368/#p370\">\n    102 So.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370, 386 (Ala. 2012). Though \"[w]hether an agency qualifies as an arm of the state is a federal question with a federal standard,\" the Eleventh Circuit observed that \"whether that standard is met [is] determined by carefully reviewing how the agency is defined by state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904405\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/1290/\">\n    686 F.3d at 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the Alabama Supreme Court had defined the Board as an arm of the state for purposes of immunity under the Alabama constitution, and because federal courts give \"great deference to how state courts characterize the entity in question,\" the Eleventh Circuit held the Board immune from suit on a federal claim in federal court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904405\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/1290/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904405\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/1290/\">\n    at 1292-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   does not bar their claims against the Board because the Board's challenged conduct in this case (enforcing a state statute and regulation) differs from its challenged conduct in\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   (incorrectly paying Board employees and miscalculating overtime wages).

Ala. Aug. 27, 2010) (district court opinion describing Versiglio's claim as one \"for alleged unpaid overtime\" under the FLSA). Thus, the only question even arguably presented here is whether the four-factor test calls for a different result with respect to the Board's function of enforcing state statutes and regulations, which is the conduct Plaintiffs challenge in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is difficult to see how the first, third, and fourth factors could call for a different result when applied to the Board's function of enforcing statutes and regulations instead of paying its employees. Plaintiffs have not suggested that state law defines the Board differently with respect to its regulatory and enforcement functions than it does with respect to its employee-payment functions. Nor have they argued that the source of the Board's funds or the party responsible for judgments against it differ when the challenged conduct is the Board's enforcement of statutes and regulations rather than its payment of employees. Instead, Plaintiffs argue the degree-of-control\n   factor makes all the difference and \"weighs decisively against a finding that the Dental Board is an arm of the state\" when engaged in the conduct challenged in this lawsuit. (Doc. # 44 at 3). The court is unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs marshal a variety of arguments to show that the State of Alabama exercises little to no control over the Board with respect to the challenged activities in this lawsuit, namely, promulgating regulations and issuing cease-and-desist letters to enforce statutes and regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5). But given the Eleventh Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   , the critical issue is not the absolute degree of control the state exercises over the Board's challenged activities, considered in the abstract. The decisive question is whether the state exercises any\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   control over the Board's rulemaking and enforcement functions than it does over the Board's payment of its employees. After all,\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   necessarily held that whatever degree of control the state exercises over the Board with respect to its wage payments to employees is sufficient to render the Board an arm of the state as to that function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs have offered no reason to think that the state exercises any less control over the Board's rulemaking and enforcement functions than it does over the Board's payment of employees, such that\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   can be persuasively distinguished-and the court is unable to think of one. Indeed, if anything, it seems likely that the state exercises\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   control over the Board's rulemaking and enforcement decisions than it does over its wage payments to employees. For example, the Board's rulemaking and enforcement authority is constrained by legislative guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-43\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 34-9-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (granting the Board authority to adopt rules and regulations \"subject to\" the provisions of Chapter 9 of the Alabama Code). The Alabama Legislature has defined what constitutes the practice of dentistry,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-43\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 34-9-6 and 34-9-7, and Board regulations defining and regulating the practice of dentistry must \"not conflict with any statute which defines the practice of dentistry,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-43\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 34-9-43.2(c). The Legislature has also limited the fine that may be imposed for violating a Board regulation to \"not more than five thousand dollars ... for each offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 34-9-5. Finally, the Legislature has directed the Legislative Services Agency to engage in some form of review of the Board's regulations, though the parties dispute the nature and extent of that review.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-43\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 41-22-22.1; (Docs. # 29 at \u00b6 56; 33 at 6-9). In short, the state has established a number of mechanisms by which it exercises a degree of control over the Board's rulemaking and enforcement functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has found similar considerations relevant in concluding that a state exercised sufficient control over an entity to render it an arm of the state for sovereign immunity purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe of Indians v. Fla. State Athletic Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11235230,8168911\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/1226/\">\n    226 F.3d 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1232 (11th Cir. 2000) (\"[Florida] has provided [legislative] guidelines to limit the Commission's ability to make regulations and, consequently, has some control over the Commission's rule making powers.\"). But again, the question is not whether the measures described above would give Alabama sufficient control over the Board to render it an arm of the state as a matter of first principles. The question is how Alabama's control over the Board's rulemaking and enforcement functions compares to its control over the Board's payment of employees, a function for which the Eleventh Circuit has already held that the Board is entitled to sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904405\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/1290/\">\n    686 F.3d at 1291-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A review of the Alabama Code reveals that the state has provided scant guidance to the Board on the subject of how it should pay its employees. Indeed, the only direction\n   the Legislature has apparently given is that Board members \"shall receive as compensation a sum to be fixed by the board\"; that the secretary and secretary-treasurer shall each \"receive such compensation as may be fixed by the board\"; and that \"[t]he board is authorized to expend such funds as shall be necessary ... to pay salaries.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-9-41\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 34-9-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, there can be no doubt that the control Alabama maintains over the Board's rulemaking and enforcement functions is at least as great as (probably greater than) the control it exercises over the Board's payment of its employees.\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   therefore controls this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   held the Board immune from a claim based on its payment of employees, that decision compels the conclusion that the Board is also immune from claims based on its rulemaking and enforcement decisions. The four-factor Eleventh Amendment immunity test does not yield a different result. If anything, the Board has a stronger claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity in this case than it did in\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, all of Plaintiffs' claims against the Board itself are due to be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edelman v.

(Doc. # 29 at 46). As discussed above, Plaintiffs' requested relief would run against the state itself, not merely against the individual Board members. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' individual-capacity claims against the Board members \"fail[ ] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\" and must therefore be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Feit v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   That might well be true. In\n   <em>\n    North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. F.T.C.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court left open \"the question whether agency officials, including board members, may, under some circumstances, enjoy immunity from [antitrust]\n   <em>\n    damages\n   </em>\n   liability.\" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12586992\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1101/#p1115\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12586992\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1101/#p1115\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (emphasis added). Thus, it is at least possible that the Board members could be held personally liable in damages for using their office to violate the antitrust laws. (To be clear, the court takes no position on that question at this time). But the fact remains that, in this case, Plaintiffs have not\n   <em>\n    sought\n   </em>\n   relief against the Board members in their individual capacities. Instead, all of Plaintiffs' requested relief (an injunction forbidding the Board members from enforcing state law and a judgment declaring\n   the Board members' official conduct unlawful) would run against the state, not against the individual Board members. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' individual-capacity antitrust claims must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535179\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/848/#p858\">\n    886 F.2d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To sum up: All of Plaintiffs' claims against the Board itself are barred by sovereign immunity. Plaintiffs' state-law claims against the Board members in their official capacities are likewise barred by sovereign immunity under\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, because Plaintiffs' requested relief would run against the state, not the individual Board members, all of their individual-capacity claims fail to state a claim and are due to be dismissed. However, Plaintiffs' federal claims for prospective equitable relief against the Board members in their official capacities are not barred by sovereign immunity. The court therefore proceeds to address whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim against the Board members in their official capacities under the various provisions of federal law they claim the Board members are violating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Doc. # 29 at 1, 29, 32). The Board members respond that these claims should be dismissed because they are entitled to state-action immunity from Sherman Act claims under\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    317 U.S. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    87 L.Ed. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943) and its progeny. For the reasons explained below, the court concludes a definitive ruling on\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity would be premature at this time. Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims, as pleaded, are sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity grounds. Further factual development will be required to determine whether the Board members are entitled to\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity. The Board members may therefore raise the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity defense at a later stage in this litigation, in a motion for summary judgment, if appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Indeed, limits on\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity \"are most essential\" when the state delegates its regulatory power \"to active market participants,\" because active market participants may be incentivized to regulate in a manner that promotes their own private interests instead of the state's policy goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Deciding whether a nonsovereign actor is enforcing state policy or furthering private interests can be a difficult task, especially where the nonsovereign actor is controlled by active market participants.

Thus, sovereign actors for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity appear to be limited to governmental bodies like a state legislature or supreme court (or perhaps the governor) that constitute the apex of a coequal branch of state government. But whatever the limits of that category, as\n   <em>\n    N.C.

As described above, the Eleventh Circuit employs a four-factor test to determine whether a state agency is an arm of the state with respect to a particular function it performs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106284\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/338/1304/#p1308\">\n    338 F.3d at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of the different tests that apply, it is possible for a state agency to be \"sovereign\" for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity but \"nonsovereign\" for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity. And, that is precisely the position the Alabama Dental Board is in. As explained above, the Board is an arm of the state entitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Circuit's controlling decision in\n   <em>\n    Versiglio\n   </em>\n   . But, under the equally binding\n   <em>\n    N.C.

None of Plaintiffs' claims, including their antitrust claims, may proceed against the Board itself. However, under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' federal claims for prospective relief against the Board members, including specifically their antitrust claims, are not barred by sovereign immunity.

The court therefore turns to the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity issue. Because the Board members are active market participants in the dental profession, the court must analyze their assertion of\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity under\n   <em>\n    N.C.

There are two possible scenarios in which the Board members might be entitled to\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity. But under either scenario, the factual record on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is insufficient for the court to determine whether the Board members may in fact claim\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity for their challenged conduct in this case.

In\n   <em>\n    N.C.

The court concludes Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a Dormant Commerce Clause violation under the second tier. It therefore need not address the first tier at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The regulation Plaintiffs challenge requires a licensed dentist to be physically present at facilities where nondentists perform intraoral procedures, including using an iTero to make digital images of teeth. Plaintiffs allege that the regulation burdens interstate commerce: it prevents out-of-state dentists like Dr. Leeds from serving patients across state lines, and it impedes SmileDirect's ability to offer a platform to out-of-state dentists who wish to serve Alabama patients. (Doc. # 29 at \u00b6\u00b6 68, 71-72, 79, 83-85, 90-91). According to Plaintiffs, requiring SmileDirect to employ highly paid licensed dentists at its SmileShops would prove prohibitively expensive and would effectively prevent SmileDirect from partnering with out-of-state dentists to serve Alabama patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In other words, Plaintiffs argue, the regulation burdens the practice of dentistry across state lines and protects those in-state dentists who provide clear aligner therapy at their offices from competition by out-of-state dentists who, using SmileDirect's platform, could provide the same treatment to Alabama patients at a lower cost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that the regulation serves no legitimate state interest and produces no local benefits. They allege that using an iTero to make digital images of a person's teeth is a simple, safe procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86-88). The iTero is the size and shape of a pen and is covered with a disposable sheathe to ensure that no germs are transmitted between patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86, 95). SmileDirect staff also wipe the iTero wand with a disinfecting wipe after each use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95-96). The iTero does not use any radiation, but instead uses digital camera technology to create a digital model of a person's teeth and gums. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-94). Additionally, SmileDirect staff wear non-allergenic nitrile gloves when using the iTero. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97). SmileDirect has performed hundreds of thousands of digital scans nationwide, and hundreds of scans in Alabama alone,\n   without receiving a single complaint of physical injury, infection, or other adverse patient outcome associated with the use of the iTero. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99). Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs claim that the use of an iTero presents no risk to consumers that would be eliminated by a dentist's physical presence at SmileDirect's facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 980). Plaintiffs therefore argue that the state has no legitimate interest in imposing the regulation besides economic protectionism and that the burdens on interstate commerce imposed by the regulation clearly exceed any local benefits if affords.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Board responds that its regulation provides important health and safety benefits to Alabama consumers and that Plaintiffs therefore have failed to state a claim under the Dormant Commerce Clause. (Doc. # 33 at 25-26). The Board argues that requiring the physical presence of a licensed dentist when the iTero is used provides the following local benefits: (1) dentists can ensure that sterilization procedures are followed to prevent the spread of illness; (2) dentists can use their skill and training in the event of a sudden medical emergency, such as a patient experiencing an allergic reaction from contact with latex gloves, or the iTero inadvertently dislodging a patient's crown; (3) dentists can diagnose preexisting conditions that contraindicate the use of clear aligner therapy in the first place, such as gum disease; and (4) dentists can verify in real time that a patient's oral cavity is being accurately imaged by the iTero device.

Defendants and their\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   have identified several legitimate goals for requiring the physical presence of a licensed dentist at facilities where an iTero is used. Using an iTero to make digital images of teeth is an intraoral procedure that involves inserting the device into patients' mouths. Hypothetical legitimate goals for requiring a dentist's physical presence at facilities where an iTero is used include: (1) ensuring proper sterilization procedures are followed to prevent the spread of illness; (2) ensuring that a skilled, trained dentist is available in the event of a sudden medical emergency caused by the iTero inadvertently dislodging a patient's crown; (3) ensuring that a licensed dentist has the opportunity to diagnose preexisting conditions that contraindicate the use of clear aligner therapy in the first place, such as gum disease; and (4) ensuring that a dentist can verify in real time that the iTero is accurately capturing a patient's oral cavity, to avoid having the procedure repeated and to prevent patients from receiving clear aligners that were fabricated based on inaccurate images. (Docs. # 33 at 24; 47-1 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   All of these purposes are legitimate state interests that\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   justify the Board's regulation. Moreover, a rational basis undoubtedly exists for believing that the regulation would further those hypothesized purposes. Rational arguments exist that requiring a licensed dentist to be physically present at facilities where an iTero is used would advance each of the interests identified above. And importantly, that is all that is required under rational basis review. It does not matter if the challenged law is based only on \"rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data\" or even if the law \"seems unwise or if the rationale for it seems tenuous.\"\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4096390\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1185/#p1194\">\n    634 F.3d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). The challenged regulation in this case readily meets the low bar of rational basis review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Because the rational basis inquiry occurs entirely in the abstract, no evidentiary record is necessary for the court to assess this challenge. And, no evidence that Plaintiffs might uncover through discovery could change the court's analysis above. Plaintiffs have simply failed to plausibly allege an equal protection or substantive due process claim, and the Board members' Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss those claims will therefore be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. # 32) is due to be granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs' Sherman Act and Dormant Commerce Clause claims against the Board members in their official capacities may proceed. But all claims against the Board itself are barred by Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. Plaintiffs' state constitutional and statutory claims against the Board members in their official capacities are likewise barred by Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity under\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst\n   </em>\n   . And though Plaintiffs' federal claims for prospective relief against the Board members are not barred by sovereign immunity, their equal protection and substantive due process claims fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Finally, all of Plaintiffs' individual-capacity claims fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
