Dkt. No. 1. About a month later, the government filed an information under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , giving notice of its intent to seek an enhanced penalty because the defendant had a prior felony drug offense. Dkt. No. 7. On March 21, 2005, the defendant pled guilty to all three counts. Dkt. Nos. 10, 11. Judge Clevert sentenced the\n   defendant on November 23, 2005; he imposed a sentence of 120 months on the felon-in-possession charge in Count One; 262 months on the cocaine base charge in Count Two, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed on Count One; and sixty months for the charge of using and carrying a gun in relation to a drug trafficking offense in Count Three, to run consecutively to the sentences imposed on Counts One and Two, for a total sentence of 322 months. Dkt. Nos. 27, 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On appeal, the Seventh Circuit vacated the sentence and remanded for re-sentencing. Dkt. No. 46. On April 9, 2008, Judge Clevert resentenced the defendant to serve 120 months on Count One; 180 months on Count Two, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed on Count One; and sixty months on Count Three, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed on Counts One and Two, for a total sentence of 240 months. Dkt. Nos. 50, 51. He credited the defendant for the forty-two months he'd already spent in custody, which meant that the defendant had 198 months left to serve on the new sentence. Dkt. No. 51 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 2, 2019, the defendant-on his own, without a lawyer-filed a motion asking the court to resentence him under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), because of the passage of the First Step Act of 2018. Dkt. No. 90. Two months later, counsel filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant, and filed a second motion to reduce the sentence as a result of the First Step Act. Dkt. No. 92. The motion filed by counsel asserts that the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction because he was convicted of an offense that was modified by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, and he committed that offense before that statute's effective date (August 3, 2010).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The government states that that sentence already is below what the guideline range would have been had the Fair Sentencing Act been in effect at resentencing, because the First Step Act didn't change the fact that the defendant qualified as a career offender and because the First Step Act does not authorize plenary resentencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The government recognizes that, despite its opposition, the court may decide to exercise its discretion to\n   reduce the sentence, and in that event, asks that the court impose a sentence of time served plus ten days (to allow time to collect DNA samples).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In reply, the defendant asserts that he isn't asking for much of a reduction, that he has done well while in prison and that if he were being sentenced today, his guideline range would be half of what it was in 2008. Dkt. No. 98 at 1. He makes a number of legal arguments that this court has since rejected (the court will mention those below), then notes that he tried to assist the government when he was arrested, that he was young when he was sentenced (twenty-six years old) and that he already has served a very long sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A month and a half after the grand jury indicted the defendant, the government filed an information under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Dkt. No. 1 at 3. That crime carried (and still carries) a mandatory sentence of sixty months, to be imposed consecutively to any other sentence. The only count of conviction that did not carry a mandatory minimum sentence was Count One-the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Regardless of the application of the sentencing guidelines, the defendant faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months, or fifteen years, and a maximum sentence of life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    The Sentencing Guidelines\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The PSR indicated that for Count One-the felon-in-possession charge-the base offense level was 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For Count Two-the cocaine base charge-the offense level for possession of more than twenty but less than thirty-five grams of cocaine base was 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For Count Three-the \u00a7 924(c) count-the guideline range was the mandatory statutory sentence of 60 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The PSR recommended that Judge Clevert grant the defendant a 2-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1(a), as well as a 1-level decrease for timely notifying the government of his intent to plead under \u00a7 3E1.1(b). This 3-level reduction resulted in an offense level of 25-the highest offense level of 28 minus the 3-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant, however, had a prior felony conviction for fleeing/eluding and a prior felony drug conviction. Under \u00a7 4B1.1(a) of the 2004 guidelines-the career offender section-a defendant convicted of a controlled substance offense who was at least eighteen at the time of the offense of conviction and who had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense qualified as a career offender. If the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction was life, \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(A) increased his offense level to 37 (before acceptance). It also increased his criminal history category to VI (the defendant's criminal history category would have been IV had he not qualified as a career offender). Even with acceptance of responsibility, the defendant's offense level jumped from 27 to 34 in criminal history category VI, which resulted in a guideline range of 262 to 327 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   That wasn't the end of the calculation. Section 4B1.1(c)(2) provided that if a career offender also was convicted of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) -which the defendant was-his guideline range jumped to the greater of the range that resulted by adding the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) count to the low and high ends of the career offender range and the range provided in the chart in \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(3). In the defendant's case, adding the 60 months to the low and high ends of the career offender range resulted in a range of 322 to 387 months, while the chart in \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(3) provided a range of 262 to 327 months (the same range applicable to the defendant under the career offender guideline without the \u00a7 924(c) conviction). When the defendant walked into Judge Clevert's courtroom for sentencing in August 2005, he faced a sentence of 322 to 387 months-twenty-six years and ten months to thirty-two years and three months-with a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    The 2005 Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But the defendant walked into Judge Clevert's courtroom for sentencing\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court had issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Booker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    543 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), holding that mandatory sentencing guidelines violated the Constitution. Judge Clevert no longer was required to impose a sentence within that 322-to-387-month guideline range. He could not give the defendant less than ten years on the drug count, he could not give him less than five years on the \u00a7 924(c) count and he was required to impose the five-year \u00a7 924(c) sentence to run consecutively to any other sentence he gave the defendant. Otherwise, he was not bound by the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judge Clevert varied from the guideline range on Count One (felon in possession of a firearm), sentencing the defendant to ten years-sixteen years and eight months below the low end of the guideline range. On the drug count (Count Two), he imposed the low end of the guideline range-262 months, or twenty-one years and ten months. He imposed that sentence to run\n   concurrently with the ten-year sentence on Count One. Finally, he imposed the mandatory sixty-month sentence on Count Three, and imposed it to run consecutively to the 262-month sentences he'd imposed on the drug counts, as the law required. The resulting sentence was 322 months-twenty-six years and ten months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    The First Step Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The First Step Act allows this court to resentence the defendant as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 had been in effect when the defendant committed the cocaine base offenses. Section 2(a) of the Fair Sentencing Act changed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(iii). Instead of five grams of cocaine base triggering the mandatory minimum of five years and the maximum of forty-and the mandatory minimum of ten years and maximum of life for those defendants with two qualifying convictions-section 2(a) of the FSA raised the trigger amount to twenty-eight grams. Under section 2(a) the FSA, offenses involving less than twenty-eight grams of cocaine base carried no mandatory minimum sentence and a maximum of twenty years; if the defendant had two qualifying prior convictions, he still faced no mandatory minimum, but his statutory maximum increased to thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Calculating the Defendant's Sentence Under the FSA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court will set aside for the moment the ten-year sentence Judge Clevert imposed on Count One, and the mandatory, consecutive five-year sentence on Count Three. The following discussion involves only Count Two, the cocaine base count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Calculating the defendant's sentence as if section 2(a) of the FSA had been in effect when he committed the drug offense for which he was convicted, the defendant is no longer subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum for Count Two. This means that if the court agrees to exercise its discretion to resentence the defendant, its sentence on the drug count is subject only to the \u00a7 3553 factors and the Supreme Court's requirement that it consider the applicable guidelines. The 2004 guidelines in effect at the time of the original sentencing assigned a base offense level of 28 to the 22.7 grams of cocaine base attributed to the defendant. The 2018 guidelines in effect today assign a base offense level of 22 to that amount of cocaine base. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As the court has noted, the defendant qualified as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1(b), and a career offender's offense level is linked to the statutory maximum for his offense. Because the statutory maximum the defendant faced in 2005 was life, the applicable offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(1) was 37. Under the FSA, the statutory maximum is thirty years, which means that under \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(2), the applicable offense level is reduced to 34. Minus the three points for acceptance of responsibility, the defendant's offense level under the FSA would be 31. Level 31 in criminal history category VI results in an advisory guideline range of 188 to 235 months, compared to the range of 262 to 327 months the defendant faced in 2005. Adding the sixty-month mandatory sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) count to the low and high ends of this range under \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(2) results in a sentencing range of 248 to 295 months, rather than the 322-to-387-month range the defendant faced in 2005. The new range would be 74 months lower on the low end and 92 months lower on the high end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Judge Clevert sentenced the defendant to 262 months on the cocaine base count-the bottom of the pre-FSA guideline range and 74 months\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   than the low end of the new range. The sentence was a 47% reduction from the low end of the guideline range. A sentence at the low end of the new range plus the 60-month sentence on\n   the gun charge would result in a sentence of 248 months, rather than 322 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    The Career Offender Classification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendant argues, however, that due to changes in the law since he was sentenced, he no longer qualifies as a career offender. Dkt. No. 92 at 7. He asserts that his conviction for felony fleeing/eluding no longer qualifies as a predicate offense under \u00a7 4B1.1(a), citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Haynes\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 8:08CR441,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201430125\">\n    2019 WL 1430125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (D. Neb., Mar. 29, 2019) (same holding, with some expanded reasoning).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This court agrees with those courts. The First Step Act does not \"expressly permit\" the court to conduct a plenary resentencing. It does not authorize the court to disturb the 120-month sentence Judge Clevert imposed on Count One. It does not authorize the court to disturb Judge Clevert's conclusion that the defendant qualified as a career offender, or ignore the requirement that a court must impose the five-year mandatory sentence required by \u00a7 924(c) to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. It authorizes the court to do one thing-recalculate the sentence on Count Two as if section 2(a) of the FSA had been in effect when he committed that crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Recalculation of the Defendant's Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court believes that if the Fair Sentencing Act had been in effect in 2005 (at the time the defendant committed his offenses), he would have faced no mandatory minimum sentence on Count Two, and a statutory maximum sentence of thirty years. His offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(2) would have been 34, minus 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, for an adjusted offense level of 31. His criminal\n   history category would have been VI. Level 31 in criminal history category VI results in an advisory sentencing range of 188 to 235 months-whether under the 2007 guidelines in effect at the time of resentencing or under the guidelines in effect today. The sentence Judge Clevert imposed in 2008 was eight months below the low end of that range. But Judge Clevert chose in 2008 to impose a sentence 31% below the low end of the applicable guideline range. If the court's math is correct, a sentence 31% below the guideline range the defendant would have faced had the Fair Sentencing Act been in effect would be somewhere around 130 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The court will exercise its discretion and grant the defendant's motion to resentence him as if the Fair Sentencing Act had been in effect when he committed the drug offense. The court will not, however, schedule a sentencing hearing with the defendant present. As several of the courts above have noted, Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b)(4) provides that a defendant \"need not be present\" at a proceeding that \"involves the ... reduction of sentence under ...\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\" The court will be reducing the defendant's sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B). Under Rule 43, his presence is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   There is information that the court does not have. It does not know the date on which the Bureau of Prisons considers the defendant to have begun serving his sentence. It does not know how much federal time he has served. It does not know how Judge Clevert's order imposing the sentence to run entirely concurrently with the state revocation sentence might impact a sentence reduction eleven years later. To avoid possible problems, the court will not impose a new sentence until it can obtain an analysis and recommendation from the probation office (something it should be doing in every case in which a defendant files a First Step motion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for a sentence reduction under the First Step Act. Dkt. No. 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the defendant's Motion for Resentencing Under the First Step Act of 2018, to the extent that it asks the court to recalculate under section 2(a) of the FSA the sentence he received on Count Two. Dkt. No. 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    DEFERS\n   </strong>\n   imposition of the reduced sentence pending receipt of a supplemental presentence report from the probation office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that the probation office shall prepare a supplemental presentence report, calculating the guidelines for Count Two as if section 2(a) of the FSA had been in effect when the defendant committed those crimes, and indicating what the defendant's total sentence would be if all other original sentencing determinations remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
