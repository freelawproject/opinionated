The majority's reasoning for adopting this test was that \"because the defendant had unlawful intent in the extrinsic offense, it is less likely that he had lawful intent in the present offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"858084\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/582/898/#p913\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"858084\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/582/898/#p913\">\n    at 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Beechum\n   </em>\n   pointed out, however, this reasoning is logically flawed in light of Rule 404(b)'s prohibition on character evidence. In their words, it is \"beyond reason\" to \"reason that because a defendant displayed an improper intent in the past, he is more likely to have had an evil intent in the act for which he is tried\" somehow \"differs from reasoning that the defendant has a 'propensity' to act with evil intent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"858084\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/582/898/#p913\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"858084\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/582/898/#p913\">\n    at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Goldberg, J., dissenting);\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   , David A.

A balancing test is required. To say that, every time the two offenses at issue require the same statutorily required intent, the court must\n   allow the introduction of the extrinsic one would nullify the balancing test. The court must engage in a deeper 'factual' analysis, specific to the instances at issue, than just whether the two offenses involve the same intent. Or to put it another way, the court must, as best it can, make sure that it is not just allowing the introduction of character or propensity evidence and that there is really some basis that the evidence would be enlightening as to intent based on the specific facts presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is true that the more similar the offenses, the more probative the extrinsic offense is as to intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Astling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"576995\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/733/1446/#p1457\">\n    733 F.2d at 1457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the probative value of the extrinsic offense was high in part because the offenses \"were almost exactly identical\"). But that raises the issue of just how factually similar the two are, and whether they are similar in material ways. Here, Count One and Count Two both involved the alleged use of excessive force. But is that general level of factual similarity enough to make the 2015 and 2016 alleged offenses each highly probative of the other? After all, Count One involved an alleged slamming incident, whereas Count Two allegedly involved tasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   What tips the scales here is that the two instances allegedly involved more than just arguably similar (or even dissimilar) conduct or acts. Here, there is allegedly evidence from which a factfinder could infer that Smirnoff expressly made known\n   <em>\n    in his own words\n   </em>\n   what his intent was at the time of both incidents. Namely, at to Count 2, the government contends that video footage shows that immediately after tasing the arrestee, Smirnoff stated, \"There's your f--king rights.\" Government Response (doc. no. 24) at 5-6. As a result, Smirnoff's alleged statement of his view about an arrestee's rights would likely be admissible regardless of whether the statement occurred during an incident of misconduct or not. That is, his statement that he viewed the arrestee's rights as \"f--king rights\" would likely be probative in and of itself, regardless of whether it occurred during an extrinsic bad\n   <em>\n    act.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, an additional factor in favor of admissibility is that it appears that Smirnoff's intent will be \"a critical issue at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"576995\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/733/1446/#p1457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And finally, if Smirnoff wishes, the court can provide cautionary instructions to the jury, including not to infer that one incident of alleged excessive force makes him more likely to have engaged in excessive force on the other occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the government satisfies the three-part test for determining whether the extrinsic offenses are admissible under Rule 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2. Ramifications of Rule 404(b) Admissibility\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has held that the \"[u]nfair prejudice\" needed to justify a severance \"does not result when two offenses are joined if evidence admissible to prove each offense is also admissible to prove the other offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gabay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549674\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/1536/#p1540\">\n    923 F.2d 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1540 (11th Cir. 1991). Here, there are two alternative ways to read and apply this rule in light of the court's finding that, under Rule 404(b), evidence of Count One is admissible to prove Count Two, and vice versa, that is, that there is a\n   <em>\n    mutual admissibility of evidence.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The first alternative is that, regardless of whether Smirnoff meets the three requirements for defendants who seek a severance based on the desire to testify about one count but not another, his severance motion automatically fails, because the mutual admissibility of evidence means that unfair prejudice \"does not result\" from a single trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549674\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/1536/#p1540\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This reading of the law is supported by the categorical language of the\n   <em>\n    Gabay\n   </em>\n   rule: X (unfair prejudice) does not result if Y (mutual admissibility) occurs. Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Gabay\n   </em>\n   , the rule served as the sole, independent ground for denying the severance motion--no further analysis was necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549674\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/1536/#p1540\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 2004) (Ginsburg, C.J.) (denying severance because a \"finding of prejudice is logically precluded if, had the counts been tried separately, the evidence concerning each count would have been admissible on each other count\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

June 16, 2011) (Rodgers, J.) (citing\n   <em>\n    Gabay\n   </em>\n   in holding that the \"unfair prejudice argument fails because ... evidence of [the defendant's] prior activity would be admissible for Counts One and Two regardless of whether Count Three was severed\"). Finally, this reading also seems correct if the three requirements that apply when the defendant wishes to testify about one count but not another is viewed as a proxy for determining the ultimate question of whether there is \"unfair prejudice\" sufficient to justify a severance. The\n   <em>\n    Gabay\n   </em>\n   rule would seem to resolve this ultimate question irrespective of how the proxy test resulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The second alternative is that here the mutual admissibility of evidence is a factor to consider when analyzing whether the three requirements are met that may undermine--but does not automatically preclude--the existence of sufficient prejudice. As to the first requirement, the mutual admissibility of evidence undermines a defendant's contention that counts are \"distinct in ... evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Hersh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453470\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/297/1233/#p1241\">\n    297 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1243 n.15. And as elaborated later in this opinion, the mutual admissibility of evidence can also undermine the defendant's arguments as to the second and third requirements that he has \"important\" testimony about one count and a \"strong need\" to refrain from testifying about another, because the mutual admissibility can place him \"in the same dilemma with separate trials as he would [be in] with a joint trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Aug. 10, 2018) (Jones, J.). Further supporting the second alternative is the fact that none of the cases in which the\n   <em>\n    Gabay\n   </em>\n   rule served as the sole, independent ground for denying a severance involved defendants--such as Smirnoff--who claimed prejudice based on a wish to testify about one charge but not another, rather than, for instance, based on the claim that evidence of one charge would make a jury think he is more likely to have committed the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ultimately, this court need not resolve which alternative reading of the\n   <em>\n    Gabay\n   </em>\n   rule applies. Because Smirnoff cannot meet the three requirements--in part due to the mutual admissibility of evidence--his motion must be denied, regardless whether the mutual admissibility of evidence\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   precludes a severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3. First Requirement: Distinct Time, Place, and Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Smirnoff cannot meet his burden of showing that the charges are \"distinct in time, place,\n   <em>\n    and evidence\n   </em>\n   ,\" given that there is significant overlapping evidence to prove each count.\n   <em>\n    Hersh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453470\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/297/1233/#p1241\">\n    297 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1243 n.15 (emphasis added).

Second and Third Requirements: \"Important\" Testimony About One Count, \"Strong Need\" Not to Testify About Another\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court's Rule 404(b) finding as to the mutual admissibility of evidence means that separate trials would not shield Smirnoff from his asserted quandary of having \"important\" testimony about Count Two (the alleged July 2015 taser incident), and a \"strong need\" not to testify about Count One (the alleged March 2016 slamming incident). Imagine being in Smirnoff's shoes at the Count One trial once the government introduces the evidence of the Count Two tasing incident. At that point, he would presumably want to give the same \"important\" testimony to explain his alleged Count Two conduct as he claims to want to give at the trial for Count Two. And he would still presumably want to remain silent about Count One.
