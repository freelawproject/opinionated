Docket No. 105-15 at \u00b6 27. Defendants' expert, Dr. Dan Schonfeld, opines that a person of ordinary skill in the art \"would have (a) at least at least a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or equivalent thereof and (b) at least two years of work experience relating to multimedia streaming and user interfaces.\" Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b615. Having considered the parties' proposals, and the factors that may be considered in determining the level of skill in the art, the Court finds that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or equivalent thereof, and at least two years of programming experience. While a person of skill in the art may have the more specific experience relating to multimedia streaming and user interfaces, the Court finds that even general programming experience is sufficient in light of the varied specifications of the Asserted Patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The parties' dispute focuses on the meaning and scope of thirty-two terms/phrases in the Asserted Patents. As an initial matter, the Court notes that the parties dispute whether several \"software\" limitations are subject to \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6. Both sides agree with the general proposition that \"software\" claims do not automatically invoke or exclude a claim from being subject to \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6. But both sides also argue that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the disputed \"software\" limitations either are subject to or are not subject to \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The term \"application\" appears in asserted claim 14 of the '954 Patent ; asserted claims 236, 238, 239 of the '361 Patent ; asserted claims 3, 4, 7, 11, 12 of the '923 Patent ; asserted claims 1, 15, 23 of the '938 Patent ; asserted claims 1, 153, 154, 156, 164, 166 of the '838 Patent ; asserted claim 1 of the '878 Patent ; and asserted claims 13, 30, 52 of the '145 Patent. The Court finds that the term is used consistently in the claims and is intended to have the same general meaning in each claim. The Court further finds that the specifications for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the Asserted Patents that include this claim term state that \"FIG. 1 illustrates execution environment 102 including operating system 120, one or more applications 122, and other program code and/or data components illustrated by other libraries and subsystems 124.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '954 Patent at 4:35-38. As shown below, Figure 1 illustrates \"applications 122\" distinct from \"operating system 120.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   '954 Patent at Figure 1 (highlighted). To the extent that Plaintiff argues that \"application\" as used in the asserted claims may include only the operating system, the Court rejects this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In addition to Figure 1, the specification provides context for the term and further provides examples of applications. The Background section of the '954 Patent, '145 Patent, and '838 Patent describes the problem with a lack of \"integration and/or cooperation between or among applications used at the same time by a user.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '954 Patent at 1:23-25. The specifications also provide examples of applications and further explain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   For example, documents often include both text and media such as images from pictures, graphs, and drawings.\n   <em>\n    Word processors\n   </em>\n   provide rich feature\n   sets for creating and editing text, but provide relatively weak or no features for creating and editing other forms of data.

As another example, each specification states that Figures 4a and 4b illustrate web browser 403b as an equivalent to an application 403a. The specifications explain that \"FIG. 4a illustrates execution environment 401a\n   <em>\n    hosting application 403a\n   </em>\n   ,\" while \"FIG. 4b illustrates execution environment 401b\n   <em>\n    hosting browser 403b.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '954 at 8:25-28 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court finds that these examples will help clarify the disputed term for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiff replies that Defendants' construction is improper because it uses examples picked from the background section of just one asserted patent. As illustrated above, these examples do not appear in only one patent. The word processor, image editor, and CAD tool examples appear not only in the '954 Patent, but also in the '145 Patent and the '838 Patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '145 Patent at 1:27-37; '838 Patent at 1:23-33. Moreover, the web browser example cited above appears in all of the Asserted Patents related to this term. Thus, Plaintiff's argument that the examples appear in only the '954 Patent is incorrect. Further, the Court's construction clearly indicates that these are non-limiting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     examples\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of applications-not an exhaustive list-that will aid the jury in understanding the term. In summary, Plaintiff has not provided a persuasive reason for construing \"application\" differently across the Asserted Patents or to alter the construction adopted in\n   <em>\n    ZTE.\n   </em>\n   Finally, in reaching its conclusion, the Court has considered the extrinsic evidence submitted by the parties and has given it its proper weight in light of the intrinsic evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The Court finds that the terms \"the first program component\" and \"the second program component\" do not lack antecedent basis. Claim 14 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   storage of\n   <em>\n    a plurality of applications\n   </em>\n   including a first application, a second application, and a third application, utilizing the memory,\n   <em>\n    the applications including a first program component and a second program component;\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   detection of a first user input;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   in response to the first user input, presentation of, utilizing the touchscreen,\n   <em>\n    a first window associated with the first program component\n   </em>\n   including at least one user interface element;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   detection of a second user input in connection with the at least one user interface element of the first window;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   in response to the second user input in connection with the at least one user interface element of the first window, creation of\n   <em>\n    a second window associated with the second program component\n   </em>\n   and presentation thereof, utilizing the touchscreen, adjacent to and not overlapping with respect to the first window, for presenting, in the second window, data associated with the at least one user interface element of the first window\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   '954 Patent at claim 14 (emphasis added). As indicated, claim 14 recites \"a plurality of applications,\" and states that the applications include \"a first program component and a second program component.\" The claim later recites \"a first window associated\n   with the first program component,\" and \"a second window associated with the second program component.\" Thus, the first/second window is associated with the first/second component, and the first/second component is included in the \"plurality of applications.\" Accordingly, \"the first program component\" and \"the second program component\" do not lack antecedent basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Defendants focus on the phrase \"storage of a plurality of applications including\n   <em>\n    a first application, a second application, and a third application\n   </em>\n   ,\" and the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    the applications including a first program component and a second program component\n   </em>\n   .\" Docket No. 108 at 55 (emphasis in original). Defendants argue that a plain reading of this language results in a total of six claimed program components-three first program components, and three second program components.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants further argue that claim 14 does not indicate which first program component and which second program component are associated with the first window and the second window.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Defendants, this presents an indisputable lack of antecedent basis, which results in the disputed \"associated with the [first/second] program component\" terms having several potential meanings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   As discussed above, claim 14 recites that the first program component and the second program component are included in the \"plurality of applications.\" Thus, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that regardless of the number of applications included in the \"plurality of applications,\" the plurality includes a first program component and a second program component. Indeed, the recited \"a first application, a second application, and a third application\" are introduced as part of the \"plurality of applications,\" and are not further recited in claim 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Moreover, the specification states that a visual component of a user interface may include a \"window.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '954 Patent at 5:62-5:67 (\"[V]isual components of a user interface are referred to herein as visual interface elements.

Claim 14 recites that a first/second window is associated with the first/second component, and the first/second component is included in the \"plurality of applications.\" Thus, the claims, viewed in light of the specification, inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the terms \"the first program component\" and \"the second program component\" lack antecedent basis.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The phrase \"in an area that is more convenient than an area in which a desktop taskbar resides\" appears in asserted claim 16 of the '923 Patent. The phrase \"permits a user to conveniently enter the second user input on the one of the plurality of elements of the menu corresponding to the second application for selection purposes, instead of requiring location of the second window among a clutter of different windows\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   appears in asserted claim 12 of the '923 Patent. The Court finds that the intrinsic evidence does not provide an objective criterion for determining what is \"more convenient\" or \"permits a user to conveniently enter\" the second user input. Claims 12 and 16 of the '923 Patent require the display of a menu or window to be in a location that permits \"convenient\" access by a user. The claims do not provide any objective criteria for determining what is \"convenient.\" Claim 16 recites an apparatus configured such that a window is displayed for \"user interaction\" in an area that is \"more convenient\" than a taskbar. But the claim does not specify any objective basis for determining which, if any, areas outside of a taskbar are more or less convenient than the taskbar itself. Likewise, claim 12 recites an \"apparatus\" configured so that the display of a menu in a particular location permits a user to \"conveniently enter\" user input without searching through \"clutter.\" Simply stated, the claims fail to provide any definition for what is \"convenient,\" what constitutes \"clutter,\" or any criteria for determining whether an area that lacks \"clutter\" is \"convenient\" or not \"convenient.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The remaining intrinsic evidence fails to provide any objective guidance for evaluating \"convenient.\" The only instance of the term in the written description or prosecution history occurs in the patent's background, stating that a user interface \"may be located in a location that is convenient for some applications but inconvenient for others for a user.\" '923 Patent at 1:39-42. This statement does not provide any objective scope for \"convenient.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, both parties' experts agree that, in the context of this patent, the term \"convenient[ ]\" is purely subjective and depends on the personal preferences of the specific user accessing the user interface or display. Docket No 108-2 at \u00b6 154. Indeed, Plaintiff's expert agreed that the term \"convenient\" in claims 12 and 16 is subjective because \"[d]ifferent people will have different interpretations of convenient or not convenient or the degrees of convenience that something refers to.\" Docket No. 108-3 at 143:9-13. It is well established that the meaning of a claim limitation \"cannot depend on the undefined views of unnamed persons, even if they are experts, specialists, or academics.\"\n   <em>\n    Datamize, LLC v.

First, the Court must determine whether the phrases are in means-plus-function form pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robert Bosch, LLC v.

Cir. 2014). If the Court determines that the phrases recite a means-plus-function limitation, then the Court proceeds to the next step and attempts \"to construe the disputed claim term by identifying the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification to which the term will be limited.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266211\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1094/#p1099\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Starting with the first step, Defendants argue that all four \"code for\" terms recite functions, but do not identify any structure to perform those functions. Courts in this District have noted that in many instances, \"code,\" like \"circuit\" or \"processor,\" may connote sufficiently definite structure and is not a \"nonce\" or \"functional\" word that is necessarily subject to the limitations of \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6.\n   <em>\n    Glob.

LEXIS 177218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *96-97 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 22, 2016). In other words, whether recitation of \"code for\" performing a function is governed by \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 depends on whether the recited objectives and operation of the code connote sufficiently definite structure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Linear Tech. Corp. v. Impala Linear Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180237\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/379/1311/#p1319\">\n    379 F.3d 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1319-21 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (finding that \"circuit [for performing a function]\" was sufficiently definite structure because the claim recited the \"objectives and operations\" of the circuit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In the context of these claims and the intrinsic evidence here, the Court agrees with Defendants that \"code for\" does not connote sufficiently definite structure. Rather, in these claims, the term \"code for\" is defined only by the function that it performs, specifically: \"code for detecting the user input corresponding to the first navigation,\" \"code for sending, in response to detecting the user input, navigation information to navigate to the second visual component,\" \"code for presenting a first navigation control, in a first navigation region determined based on the first application region,\" and \"code for presenting, in a first application region of a presentation space of a display device, a first visual component.\" Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 39, 49, 59. The surrounding claim language also does not identify any specific structure of \"code\" to perform the recited function of \"detecting the user input corresponding to the first navigation control,\" \"sending...navigation information to navigate to the second visual component,\" \"presenting a first navigation control, in a first navigation region determined based on the first application region,\" or \"presenting, in a first application region of a presentation space of a display device, a first visual component.\" Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28, 39, 40, 49, 50, 59, 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Moreover, the specification equates \"code for\" and \"means for\" by using the\n   same functional language as in the claims except that the specification recites \"means for\" performing those functions, whereas the claims recite \"code for\" doing so. Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 41, 52. Specifically, the specification states that \"a system for navigating between visual components includes\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     means for\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    detecting a user input corresponding to the first navigation control.\n   </em>\n   \" '361 Patent at 14:14-17 (emphasis added). Likewise, the specification provides that \"a system for navigating between visual components includes\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     means for\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    sending, in response to detecting the user input, navigation information to navigate to the second visual component.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:49-52 (emphasis added). The specification also states that \"a system for navigating between visual components includes\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     means for\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    presenting a first navigation control, in a first navigation region determined based on the first application region.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:37-40 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the patentee used \"means for\" in each of these cited portions of the specification to show examples of how to implement the method of detection. Docket No. 105 at 8. The Court disagrees. By using this parallel language, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the '361 Patent uses the terms \"code for\" and \"means for\" as synonyms. Accordingly, Defendants have rebutted the presumption that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 does not apply to the disputed \"code for\" terms in the '361 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Regarding the application of \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6, Plaintiff first argues that the claim language itself provides sufficient structure to a POSITA in view of the intrinsic evidence, and that the patentee clearly indicated that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 should not apply. Docket No. 105 at 5-6, 12, 13, 15, 17. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the patentee stated in the prosecution history that \"it should be noted that no claims are intended to be construed under 35 U.S.C. paragraph 6.\" Docket No. 105-15 at \u00b6 107. But whether a claim limitation invokes \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 is a \"question of law.\" And under the controlling precedent, the Court concludes that Defendants have rebutted the presumption that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 does not apply. In other words, a patentee cannot \"opt-out\" of this legal determination by stating that his \"intent\" is for it not to apply. In addition, the Federal Circuit has noted that the \"inventor's subjective intent is irrelevant to the issue of claim construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Howmedica Osteonics Corp. v. Wright Med.

Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that the recited function is not complex and does not require express structural or algorithmic instructions. Docket No. 112 at 12, 14, 15. \"Although the examples given in the [ ] patent might enable [a POSITA] to make and use the invention, they do not recite the particular structure that performs the function and to which the means-plus-function claim is necessarily limited.\"\n   <em>\n    Aristocrat Techs. v.

For the following reasons, the Court finds that the phrases are subject to \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.\n    </em>\n    Determining Whether the Disputed \"Code For\" Terms Are Means-Plus-Function Terms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Here, there is a rebuttable presumption that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 does not apply because the claim does not recite the word \"means.\" Therefore, the analysis proceeds in two steps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Starting with the first step, Defendants argue that the term \"code for\" does not convey any definite structure to a POSITA and only serves as a generic placeholder for structure. Docket No. 108 at 42. In this instance, the Court agrees with Defendants that the term \"code for detecting,\" in the context of the asserted claims and intrinsic evidence, does not connote sufficiently definite structure. Nothing in the claim language describes any definite structure or algorithm to perform the recited functions. The term \"code for\" is defined only by the function that it performs-specifically, \"code for detecting...access.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Moreover, the specification equates \"code for\" and \"means for\" by using the same functional language as in the claims, except that the specification recites \"means for\" performing those functions whereas the claims recite \"code for\" doing so. Indeed, the specification states \"a system for coordinating playing of media streams includes\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     means for\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   detecting a\n   first media player access to a first presentation device to play a first media stream.\" '299 Patent at 6:23-26, '731 Patent at 18:3-6 (emphasis added). Thus, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the '299 Patent and the '731 Patent use the terms \"code for detecting\" and \"means for detecting\" as synonyms. Accordingly, Defendants have rebutted the presumption that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 does not apply to the \"code for\" terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.\n    </em>\n    Construing the Terms that Are Subject to \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   \"The first step in construing [a means-plus-function] limitation is a determination of the function of the means-plus-function limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Medtronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108588\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/1303/#p1311\">\n    248 F.3d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no algorithm described in any form for the function of \"detecting media player access to a presentation device to play a media stream.\" Instead, the specification includes only functional language and does not contain any process for detecting the user input. The specification does state that a \"presentation access component is configured for detecting a first media player access to a first presentation device to play a first media stream.\" '731 Patent at 6:26-29, 18:6-9, 23:23-26. However, the \"presentation access component\" is a purely functional module. Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b6 260; Docket No. 108-3 at 240:9-23. Indeed, the specification states that \"the presentation access component may be included in and/or interoperate with any component configured to prepare for and/or access a presentation device, and/or configured to access a resource processed in accessing a presentation device.\" '731 Patent at 7:20-25. This statement does not provide the corresponding structure or algorithm to accomplish the claimed function, but instead indicates that the presentation access component could be part of any other component that may provide access to a presentation device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   In arguing that the specification discloses structure, Plaintiff relies on its expert's citation to large portions of the specification as providing structure to perform all the \"detecting access\" functions. But\n   Plaintiff's expert does not explain how any of these passages are clearly linked or associated with the recited functions. Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 260, 271. Plaintiff's expert also states that unidentified \"algorithms run by\" the \"focus state component\" and \"focus director component\" perform the recited functions. Docket No. 105-15 at \u00b6 536. Again, Plaintiff's expert never states where those algorithms are disclosed in the specification or how those components are linked to the recited functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Plaintiff's expert opines that POSITAs were aware of many different implementations for the \"detecting access\" functions. Docket No. 105-15 at \u00b6\u00b6 481, 538, 551. Critically, however, Plaintiff's expert does not indicate where any such implementations are disclosed in the specification. The Federal Circuit has rejected this approach. In\n   <em>\n    Medical Instrumentation\n   </em>\n   , an expert opined that a claimed function could be implemented by \"a software programmer having ordinary skill in the art\" because she \"would be aware of the sources of routines, modules and even small programs\" that \"were widely available from well-known sources or available from other software developers.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781010\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1205/#p1210\">\n    344 F.3d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For the following reasons, the Court finds that the phrase is subject to \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6, and is not indefinite. The phrase \"instructions to:...in response to the detection of the selection of the at least one first input control presented with the first media player, cause presentation of the first media stream via the first presentation device and the second presentation\n   device utilizing the first media player; detect, while the first media stream is being presented via the first presentation device and the second presentation device utilizing the first media player, a selection of the at least one second input control presented with the second media player; and in response to the detection of the selection of the at least one second input control presented with the second media player while the first media stream is being presented via the first presentation device and the second presentation device utilizing the first media player, cause a pause of the presentation of the first media stream via the first presentation device and the second presentation device utilizing the first media player, and cause presentation of the second media stream via the first presentation device and the second presentation device utilizing the second media player\" appears in asserted claim 17 of the '558 Patent.

Docket No. 108 at 48. In this instance, the Court agrees with Defendants that in the context of the asserted claims and intrinsic evidence, Term No. 33 does not connote sufficiently definite structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   Moreover, the specification equates \"instructions to:...indicate,...that the first media stream is allowed to be presented via the first presentation device\" and \"means for\" by using the same functional language as in the claims except that the specification recites \"means for\" performing those functions whereas the claims recite \"instructions to:...indicate,...that the first media stream is allowed to be presented via the first presentation device.\" Specifically, the specification states \"a system for coordinating playing of media streams includes\n   <em>\n    means for\n   </em>\n   indicating, in response to determining the first media player has first presentation focus, that the first media player is allowed to play the first media stream via the first presentation device.\" '558 Patent at 13:56-61, 23:14-18, 25:45-49. Thus, a POSITA would understand that the '558 Patent uses the terms \"instructions to:...indicate,...that the first media stream is allowed to be presented via the first presentation device\" and \"means for indicating,...that the first media player is allowed to play the first media stream via the first presentation device\" as synonyms.

For example, the processor is programmed to present a plurality of application window representations including a second application window representation associated with the second application, and a third application window representation associated with the third application using the screen. Claim 66 further recites that the processor is programmed to detect first user input, and in response to the first user input, present a first window for presenting first data associated with the first application. Claim 66 states that the processor is programmed to detect a second user input, and in response to the second user input, present a second window for presenting second data associated with the second application, adjacent to the first window associated with the first application.

Specifically, claim 1 recites that the apparatus is configured to display a first window \"in response to the first user input.\" '838 Patent at 27:55-59. Claim 153 adds the further limitation that the screen and processor are configured to \"present\" a \"window representation group [including a plurality of application window representations]\n   <em>\n    simultaneously\n   </em>\n   with the first window without overlapping the first window.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:6-9. Claim 164 directly contradicts these limitations by adding the requirement that \"the apparatus is configured such that: the application window representations are presented\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the detection of the first user input.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:41-43. It is not possible to present the application window representation\n   <em>\n    simultaneously\n   </em>\n   with the first window\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a user input, because the claim requires that the first window is not presented until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in response to\n   </em>\n   a user input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments are unpersuasive and fail to reconcile the inconsistent requirements of claim 164. Plaintiff's expert refers to the wrong independent claim (claim 66), from which claim 164 does not depend. Docket No. 105-15 at \u00b6\u00b6 692-97. His contention-that the invention of claim 164 is functional whether application window representations are presented before or after detection of first user input-contradicts the claim language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 696. Claim 164 requires the application window representations to be presented both before and simultaneously with the first window. Given this contradiction, a person of skill in the art would not understand the scope of the claim. '838 Patent, claims 1, 153, 164; Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 214-21. Accordingly, the Court finds that the phrase \"the application window representations are presented before the detection of the first user input\" renders the claim indefinite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-470\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Defendants further argue that the background of the patent emphasizes that the motivation of the alleged invention is to improve the process of a user \"interacting with\" an application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Docket No. 105-4 at 1:44-46). Defendants contend that the specification also makes clear that there are numerous \"visual interface elements\" other than windows.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Docket No. 105-4 at 9:33-38). According to Defendants, Plaintiff's alternative proposal fails to distinguish an \"application window\" from these other forms of \"visual interface elements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the parties' experts agree that an \"application window\" is one through which a user can interact with an application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Docket No. 108-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 125-29; Docket No. 105-15 at \u00b6 290).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court finds that the terms\n   <strong>\n    \" first window of the first application\" / \" application window\"\n   </strong>\n   should be given their plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-479\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-480\">\n   The terms \"first window of the first application\" and \"application window\" appear in either asserted claim 4 of the '923 Patent, asserted claim 1 of the '938 Patent, asserted claim 1 of the '878 Patent, or asserted claim 52 of the '145 Patent. The Court finds that the terms are used consistently in the claims and are intended to have the same general meaning in each claim. The Court further finds the terms \"first window of the first application\" and \"application window\" are unambiguous and understandable by a jury, and should be given their plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-481\">\n   Defendants argue that their construction gives meaning to each word in the claim. Docket No. 108 at 49. But Defendants fail to provide a persuasive reason for replacing the language chosen by the patentee with their preferred language. Defendants' construction implies that an element is only a \"window\" if the user uses it to interact with the application. The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendants' proposed construction moves away from the term \"window\" and potentially reads an unnecessary limitation into the claim. The surrounding claim language captures the interaction of the user with the first application. Accordingly, the term will be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-482\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiff's alternative construction removes \"application\" from the term by construing it without any reference to the application to which the window provides access.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50. Defendants further argue that there\n   are numerous \"visual interface elements\" other than windows, and that Plaintiff's proposal fails to distinguish an \"application window\" from these other forms of \"visual interface elements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court notes that Defendants' construction has the same flaw because any of the other \"visual elements\" may also allow a user to interact with the first application. Thus, Defendants' argument indicates that their construction is unnecessary and would confuse the jury. Moreover, the surrounding claim language captures the interaction of the user with the first application. Defendants also argue that Figures 6a-e \"clearly illustrate windows providing access to a user to interact with an application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees that the figures illustrate what a juror would understand a \"window\" to be. But Defendants have not provided a persuasive reason to replace the understandable term \"window\" with their construction of \"a visual interface element through which a user can interact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-483\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that the parties appear to agree that the plain and ordinary meaning of \"window\" includes a \"visual interface element.\" Specifically, Plaintiff's expert provides an alternative construction of the phrases \"first window of the first application\"/ \"application window\" to mean \"a first visual interface element.\" Docket No. 105-15 at 149. Thus, to the extent that a party argues that the term \"window\" does not include a \"visual interface element,\" the Court rejects that argument. This is consistent with the specification, which states that \"[e]xemplary visual interface elements include windows.\" '938 Patent at 9:32-33. Finally, in reaching its conclusion, the Court has considered the extrinsic evidence submitted by the parties and given it its proper weight in light of the intrinsic evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   <strong>\n    3.
