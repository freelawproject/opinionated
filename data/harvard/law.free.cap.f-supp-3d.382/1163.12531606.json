At Mr. McKinney's sentencing hearing in March 2009, the court calculated a base offense level of 38 after converting quantities of cocaine and cocaine base to more than 56,000 kilograms of marijuana. Mr. McKinney then received a two-level reduction pursuant to Application Note 10(D) of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 because the offense involved cocaine base and another controlled substance, bringing the offense level to 36. Ultimately, the court calculated an adjusted offense level of 42 after applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a) based on Mr. McKinney's role in the offense and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. With a criminal history category of V, the guidelines provided a sentencing range of 360 months to life. The court sentenced Mr. McKinney to 360 months imprisonment on the first count and 60 months imprisonment on the second count, to run consecutively, for a total term of 420 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Mr. McKinney now seeks relief under section 404 of the First Step Act of 2018, which authorizes a court to \"impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act ... were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.\" First Step Act of 2018, Pub.

Mr. McKinney, however, contends that the First Step Act authorizes plenary resentencing such that the court may consider evidence of Mr. McKinney's rehabilitation since his sentencing to support a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range. The government opposes the motion, arguing that the First Step Act does not contemplate or authorize plenary resentencing. According to the government, Mr. McKinney's motion must be denied because his guideline range is unchanged despite the application of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As will be explained, the court agrees with the majority of courts that have addressed this issue and concludes that the First Step Act does not authorize a full resentencing but only an adjustment of an otherwise final sentence-a \"recalculation of a defendant's Guidelines numbers under the Fair Sentencing Act and a possible sentencing reduction consistent therewith, if warranted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Apr. 29, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The only question, then, is whether the relevant statute-the First Step Act of 2018-\"expressly permits\" plenary resentencing as urged by Mr. McKinney, for he does not dispute that his Guideline range does not change through retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act. As noted earlier, section 404(b) of the First Step\n   Act provides that a district court \"may ... impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 ... were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.\" Mr. McKinney argues that this language places no limit on the extent to which the court may reduce a sentence and places no restriction at all on what a court may consider in imposing a reduced sentence. Mr. McKinney further asserts that Congress's use of the word \"impose\" signals an intent to authorize plenary resentencing and that if Congress had intended to condition eligibility to cases in which the guideline range had been lowered, it would have expressly indicated that intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. McKinney has not directed the court to any case that is factually analogous to the one here-that is, one in which the defendant's advisory guideline range stayed the same after an application of the First Step Act and yet the court engaged in plenary resentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The most analogous case that the court has found is\n   <em>\n    United States v. Glover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12531162\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/377/1346/#p1354\">\n    377 F.Supp.3d 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201924706\">\n    2019 WL 1924706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. May 1, 2019). In that case, the defendant's Guidelines range at the time of his initial sentencing was 360 months to life imprisonment and the court sentenced him to 360 months imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. In resolving the defendant's motion for a reduction under the First Step Act, the court, over the defendant's objection, held that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 had no impact on his sentence because his guideline range under retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act remained 360 months to life imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-9. The court then held that the defendant was not entitled to a full resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). Beginning with the statutory language, the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court must construe a criminal statute narrowly and according to its plain meaning, and where \"the language Congress chose to express its intent is clear and unambiguous, that is as far as we go to ascertain its intent because we must presume that Congress said what it meant and meant what it said.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358877\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1316/#p1318\">\n    147 F.3d 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1318 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc). Here, Section 3582(c)(1)(B) authorizes a court to \"modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute....\" (Emphasis added.) In turn, pursuant to Section 404(b) of the First Step Act of 2018, the Court \"may impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 ... were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.\" Pub. L. No. 115-391,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n    132 Stat. 5194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As stated previously, Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act expressly increased the amount of crack cocaine necessary to invoke the mandatory minimum sentences and the statutory maximum sentences under Section 841(b) ; Section 3 eliminated the mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. The court concluded that \"nothing in the plain language\" of the First Step Act expressly authorized the court to conduct a full resentencing. The\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   court went on to explain that the \"understanding of Section 3582(c)(1)(B) as a narrow exception\n   to the rule of finality that does not allow for a full do novo resentencing finds further support in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. Specifically,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Rule 43 requires that a defendant be present at \"sentencing,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a)(3), but does not require that a defendant be present if \"[t]he proceeding involves the correction or reduction of sentence under Rule 35 or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b)(4).

R. Crim. P. 35(a) ; and second, it authorizes a court to reduce a sentence for substantial assistance upon the government's motion, Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b). The fact that Rule 43(a)(3) requires the defendant's presence for sentencing while under Rule 43(b)(4) the defendant's presence is not required for Section 3582(c) and Rule 35 proceedings is based on the distinction that 3582(c) and Rule 35 proceedings are narrow in scope and are not full, de novo resentencing proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillon\n   </em>\n   , 560 U.S. at 827-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2683/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the fact that Rule 43 distinguishes Section 3582(c) and Rule 35 from all other sentencing proceedings supports the understanding that Section 3582(c)(2) is \"a narrow exception to the rule of finality\" during which the Sixth Amendment interests identified in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Those cases also persuasively look to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for further support that full resentencings are not contemplated by \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) or the First Step Act. The court also specifically endorses that portion of the\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   opinion in which the court emphasized that the First Step Act simply cannot anticipate a full resentencing because to engage in a full sentencing would work an injustice to past offenders who did not have a crack cocaine conviction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201277507\">\n    2019 WL 1277507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1. Moreover, while the Tenth Circuit has not addressed this issue, it has rejected plenary resentencing under other \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For all of these reasons, the court believes that the Circuit, if faced with the issue, would conclude that Mr. McKinney is not entitled to a full resentencing under the First Step Act and, because retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act does not impact Mr. McKinney's Guidelines calculation, would conclude that his motion for a reduction should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The cases cited by Mr. McKinney do not convince the court otherwise.

In that case, a reduction was appropriate because the First Step Act reduced the defendant's mandatory minimum sentence from life in prison to ten years and the defendant's Guidelines range was also lowered. Interestingly, however, the court in that case did not engage in a full resentencing and simply resentenced the defendant at the middle of the new Guidelines range, finding that the mid-point of the range was consistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530788\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/372/795/#p796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 798-99 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
