Brnovich, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At issue is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 43, \"Mot.\"). Plaintiff responded to the motion (Doc. 53, \"Resp.\"), and Defendants replied. (Doc. 60). For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion is denied in part and granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Suzanne Powers (\"Powers\" or \"Plaintiff\") created 56 drawings entitled \"Dogs of the West aka Dog Country\" in 1997 and 1998. In 2002, Powers entered into an agreement with Caroline Treasure's, Inc. (\"CTI\") to license these works for use on CTI's products for two years (the \"2002 License\"). (Resp. at Exh. B). CTI is an Alabama Corporation that retails home items. (Doc. 31 \u00b6 64). Defendants Ronald Rutherford (\"Rutherford\") and Walter Knight (\"Knight\") are officers of CTI. (Doc. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 65-66). The 2002 License included a clause that said the agreement could be renewed in one-year increments if both parties agreed. (Resp. at Exh. B). The 2002 License ended on May 29, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nevertheless, after the license expired, the parties stayed in contact and Defendants continued to use Plaintiff's works and their business relationship continued under the same terms. (Mot. at 4; Resp. at 1). In November 2006, Powers and CTI entered into a new two-year licensing agreement (the \"2006 License\"). The 2006 License had a same renewal clause as the\n   2002 License. (Resp. at Exh. D). When the license lapsed in November 2008, CTI continued selling licensed products. (Mot. at 5). In November 2009, Powers contacted CTI requesting a payment for royalties, which CTI paid by check. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In the memo line for that check, it noted it was for royalties from October 2008 to October 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties present different characterizations of their business relationship between 2002 and 2009. Defendants argue that it was established practice that they would pay Powers royalties whenever she requested. (Mot. at 3-6). Powers argues this was a constant frustration for her, and she attaches emails from 2003, 2004, and 2007 asking for payment. (Resp. at 9, Exh. E, F, G). In a May 30, 2007, email, Powers wrote, \"If you are not going to send me what is owed on a timely basis without me hounding you ... I wish to terminate our relationship ....\" (Resp. at Exh. F). A week later, she seems to walk back her demand in another email: \"I would like to not have to ask to be paid, that's all. As far as pulling the designs, that is up to you. As long as you don't disappear into the night on me!\" (Resp. at Exh. G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Powers claims she thought the agreement lapsed November 26, 2008, and Defendants would stop selling her works at that point. (Resp. at Declaration of Suzanne Powers, \"Powers Decl.,\" \u00b6 14). She further alleges that even though the last check for her royalties went through \"Oct. 2009,\" she thought it was just for October 2008 and November 2008, the last two months of the license agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). She alleges she only found out about the continued use of her images in June 2017 and immediately contacted CTI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). When she contacted CTI at that time, they sent her a check for post-October 2008 royalties. (Mot. at 8, Exh. M-1). She did not deposit the check, because she \"decided to look into a lawsuit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at M-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants argue that Powers impliedly consented to continuing the license by following the same course of conduct that followed the 2002 License's lapse. Plaintiff contends that she believed their business relationship was over once the 2006 License ended and Defendants continuing to sell past the expiration date of the 2006 License constitutes breach of contract and copyright infringement. Powers also alleges violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Pub. L. No. 105-304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%202860\">\n    112 Stat. 2860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (codified in scattered sections of Title 17). Powers alleges she sent all 56 of the copyrighted works to Defendants digitally with her signature and the copyright symbol (\u00a9), which constitutes copyright management information (\"CMI\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Resp. at 5). When the images were posted online to sell the goods, the signature and copyright symbol were not shown. Defendants say they posted the images as they received them and did not remove a signature or copyright symbol, and they provide website archives from June 2002 through April 2004 and June 2004 through May 2006 that show the images without a signature or copyright symbol on their website and crediting Powers as creating the artwork. (Reply at 2; Doc. 56). Powers notes that when she saw her images replaced with a new background on various websites in June 2017, none of the sites credited her and instead had references to Caroline's Treasures. (Resp. at 6, Exh. H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants also raise a statute of limitations defense. Defendants believe Powers was on notice that they were continuing to use the images based on their previous business dealings and the royalty check noting it went through October 2009. Thus, any damages that accrued more than three years prior to filing suit are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, Defendants believe Knight and Rutherford should be granted summary judgment on the breach of contract claim even if CTI is not, because only the corporate entity is liable. The Court will take each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Powers alleges Defendants removed her signature and a copyright symbol from the copyrighted works and replaced them with a notation that said \"Caroline's Treasures.\" She argues this constitutes two DMCA violations regarding CMI-one for removing her CMI and one for adding false CMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Neither party has submitted the original images, which were sent electronically to the Defendants in 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only evidence Powers presented that her signature and a copyright symbol were on the images when Defendants received them is her statement that it was her business practice to put them on her copyrighted works. (Resp. at 5; Powers Decl. \u00b6 5). Defendants do not contest that a signature and copyright symbol are CMI. Rather they allege they received the images without the signature and copyright symbol on them. Therefore, they could not have removed them. Defendants have also presented website archives showing the alleged CMI missing from the images they posted on their store website while the licensing agreement was still in place. (Mot. at Exh. M-4 &amp; M-5). They argue this shows both that the CMI was not there when Powers gave them the images and, even if it was, it was removed at a time when a licensing agreement was in place. Therefore, it was not removed with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Initially, Defendant Knight gave a conflicting account of how Defendants received the images. In a declaration, he said that CTI received the images with Powers' signature on them. (Mot. at Exh. 2 \u00b6 14). In the same declaration he said the images filed by Powers in this action \"differ from the images CTI received from Powers in that CTI's images did not have any copyright symbol or Powers' signature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Defendants' were later granted leave to file a corrected declaration, (Doc. 61), where they removed the portion of paragraph 14 that said each image had Powers' signature on it, (Doc. 62). Knight's initial declaration was also different than Defendant Rutherford's. Rutherford declared CTI received the images with no identifying information other than an electronic file name. (Mot. at Exh. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 20-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants that Powers cannot show a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether her signature and a copyright symbol were on the images when they received them and will grant summary judgment regarding Powers claim that Defendants removed CMI from the protected images. In order for a plaintiff to prove a defendant removed her CMI, she must be able to show it was originally \"conveyed in connection with\" the protected work.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Personal Keepsakes, Inc. v.

Powers does not object to the use of the archived website and, in fact, even used those exhibits to argue for her preferred outcome during oral argument. The archived website also shows that, if they did remove CMI, it was done years prior to the alleged infringements\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   they had a valid license to use the images, which undercuts any allegation that the alleged CMI was removed to induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement. The Court finds Defendants' evidence, particularly the images that corroborate their statements that they received the images without her signature or a copyright symbol, persuasive and meets the burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Defendants removed CMI knowing that it would induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants have met their burden, thus shifting the burden to Powers to establish there is a genuine issue of material fact. Powers fails to do so because she has provided nothing more than bare assertions and uncorroborated, self-serving evidence to refute Defendants' evidence. Powers contends that she sent the original images to Defendants with images that contained her signature and a copyright symbol because it was her business practice to include that on her artwork. Specifically, she said, \"To the best of my knowledge, because it was always my standard practice, I included my CMI on all 56 of the Copyrighted Works when I originally sent Defendants my artwork pursuant to the 2002 License.\" (Powers Decl. \u00b6 5). She also attaches the 56 images to her response as Exhibit C. Those images have her signature and a copyright symbol on each of them, but she does not even go as far as to say that she sent the images as those same files. Instead, she relies on it being her standard practice to add a signature and copyright symbol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants object to her testimony as inadmissible habit evidence. Even assuming it is admissible, however, it amounts to nothing more than uncorroborated, self-serving evidence. Uncorroborated, self-serving evidences is not enough for a court to \"find a genuine issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Villiarimo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396804\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/1054/#p1061\">\n    281 F.3d at 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).

Powers alleges that when she discovered her copyrighted works being advertised and sold on third party websites, the works \"contained a notation which read 'Caroline's Treasures.' \" (Resp. at 7-8). She says this constitutes replacing her CMI with false CMI knowing that it \"would induce, enable, facilitate, and/or conceal the infringements of Powers' Copyrighted Works.\" (Resp. at 8).

CMI is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"copyright management information\" means any of the following information conveyed in connection with copies or phonorecords of a work or performances or displays of a work, including in digital form, except that such term does not include any personally identifying information about a user of a work or of a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display of a work:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) The title and other information identifying the work, including the information set forth on a notice of copyright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) The name of, and other identifying information about, the author of a work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (3) The name of, and other identifying information about, the copyright owner of the work, including the information set forth in a notice of copyright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (4) With the exception of public performances of works by radio and television broadcast stations, the name of, and other identifying information about, a performer whose performance is fixed in a work other than an audiovisual work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (5) With the exception of public performances of works by radio and television broadcast stations, in the case of an audiovisual work, the name of, and other identifying information about, a writer, performer, or director who is credited in the audiovisual work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (6) Terms and conditions for use of the work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (7) Identifying numbers or symbols referring to such information or links to such information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (8) Such other information as the Register of Copyrights may prescribe by regulation, except that the Register of Copyrights may not require the provision of any information concerning the user of a copyrighted work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Of these definitions, the Caroline's Treasures notation only seems to be a plausible fit for the first three definitions-the title of the work, the name of the author, the copyright owner of the work, or other information identifying the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court is persuaded that there is a factual dispute about whether the Caroline's Treasures notation is CMI. CMI must be info \"conveyed in connection with\" a work. This does not necessarily mean CMI must be placed directly upon or affixed to a copyrighted work, but the location of information can determine what it refers to or whether an alleged infringer lacked the required intent.\n   <em>\n    Banxcorp v.

It is off to the side or underneath and appears to be part of the product description, but it could be interpreted as conveying the title, name of the author, or owner of the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Where \"Caroline's Treasures\" appears in relation to the work is not consistent. In the dozens, perhaps hundreds, of listings provided by Powers, it often appears in the same line as words that describe the products being sold. Sometimes, such as when \"by Caroline's Treasures\" appears on the Amazon listings, it appears to communicate nothing more than who is selling the item. At other times, \"Caroline's Treasures\" appears in the title of the item. A viewer of the work could interpret \"Caroline's Treasures\" as title, author, or owner of the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, though the haphazard manner in which \"Caroline's Treasures\" was added to the listings makes the Court doubt that Defendants had the intent required by \u00a7 1202(a), the Court cannot say so conclusively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ICONICs, Inc. v.

On some pages of listings provided by Powers, \"Caroline's Treasures\" does not appear at all. On some, it only appears in the product listing, and on others it is in the product listing in addition to Caroline's Treasures being listed as the seller. Defendants were using \"Dog Country,\" the same name they used when the parties signed the first licensing agreement in 2002. If Defendants really were intentionally trying to induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement, it would be a strange choice to retain the name that they used when they first began their business relationship with Powers.

Moreover, during the second license, Powers expressed frustration with the contract and threatened to terminate the relationship. After the 2006 License lapsed, Defendants heard from Powers only one or two times, the last time being in November 2009. After that, there was no contact between the parties for almost eight years.
