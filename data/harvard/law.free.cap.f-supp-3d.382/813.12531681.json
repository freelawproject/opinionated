May 31, 2018). McGinnis does not actually attempt to distinguish the reasoning of these cases and has essentially forfeited the Article III standing argument in his two-page position paper. The position paper confuses two separate legal issues: what it means to be \"aggrieved\" under the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act-which is a question of\n   <em>\n    state statutory\n   </em>\n   interpretation-versus what it means to have suffered an Article III injury-in-fact.

That said, for the sake of completeness, this Court will engage in an analysis of why McGinnis has failed to allege a concrete injury for Article III purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To establish standing, a plaintiff \"must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

U.S. Cold Storage questions whether all disclosures to any third-party really present a concrete injury, arguing that \"[p]ayroll vendors typically are privy to all kinds of confidential information ... and have strong protocols and practices in place to protect such data,\" so it was not clear that\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   was harmed by the alleged violation.

There is some force to that line of reasoning when the third-party is a payroll vendor, but this Court need not determine whether that sort of disclosure qualifies as a sufficient concrete injury, because McGinnis does not allege any such disclosure (nor did he ask for jurisdictional discovery). The Seventh Circuit has held that the mere retention of personally identifying information that was obtained with the person's knowledge is insufficient to confer Article III standing if there is no risk of unauthorized disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Gubala v.

Rather, he alleges that after U.S. Cold Storage implemented its biometric time-tracking system in 2012, he was \"required to scan his fingerprint and/or handprint so that [U.S.] Cold could use it as an authentication method to track his time.\" Compl. \u00b6 32. McGinnis knew his fingerprints were being collected because he scanned them in every time he clocked in or out of work, and he knew they were being stored because the time-clock-scanned prints were obviously being compared to a stored set of prints. All other courts in this District that have considered whether a person suffers a concrete injury from the\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   collection and retention of a fingerprint,\n   <em>\n    without disclosure\n   </em>\n   to a third-party, have answered the question no.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203636556\">\n    2018 WL 3636556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203239715\">\n    2018 WL 3239715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Goings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202966970\">\n    2018 WL 2966970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Howe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202445541\">\n    2018 WL 2445541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    McCollough v.

For a plaintiff to rely on a risk of future harm to satisfy Article III's concrete injury requirement, the plaintiff must establish a \"substantial risk\" that the future harm will occur.\n   <em>\n    Clapper v.

That allegation does not come close to the kind of situation in which the risk of future harm satisfies\n   Article III concreteness requirements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lewert v.

The mental anguish alleged by McGinnis arises from the possible disclosure of his biometric data, as well as the unknown period of retention. Compl. \u00b6 39. But as discussed, McGinnis does not allege that his data was already-or is even likely to be-compromised or disclosed, so any emotional injury he suffers from that fear is a product of the sort of hypothetical injury the Supreme Court has held cannot support Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    568 U.S. at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[R]espondents cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.\"). His anxiety about \"whether [U.S.] Cold will ever delete his biometric information\" Compl. \u00b6 39, does not on its own constitute a concrete injury because the mere retention of data does not in itself cause an injury-in-fact absent a substantial risk of disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Gubala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135564\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/909/#p912\">\n    846 F.3d at 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
