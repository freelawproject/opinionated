He now sues defendant debt collector Divine and Service, Ltd. for sending him a dunning letter that fails to comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Divine contends that the FDCPA does not apply because (1) Gold Coast is the debtor, not plaintiff, and (2) the underlying transaction is business, not consumer, related. The parties cross-move for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 11, 2011, Nestor Nicolaides opened a credit card account with Lowe's in the name of Gold Coast Insurance Agency, Inc. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 26, ECF No. 18-1; Koehler Decl. \u00b6 6, ECF No. 20. That same day, Nicolaides purchased approximately $ 2,400 worth of patio furniture, which he claims was for his residence. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 27; Ward Decl. Ex. 3, at 4, ECF No. 15-8. On the credit card application, Nicolaides was listed as the \"contact person and personal guarantor.\" Koehler Decl. \u00b6 6. The cardholder agreement, subsequently mailed to Nicolaides, provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   You understand that we will be unable to determine whether any given purchase charged on your Account was in fact authorized by and for the benefit of the business in whose name the Account is established. You agree that your promise to pay, as contained in this section of this Agreement, will apply to all purchases made by any of you whether or not the purchase was in fact authorized by and for the benefit of that business.\n   <strong>\n    You agree that this Account shall be used only for the purchase of merchandise for commercial or business purposes, and not for personal, family, or household purchases.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Koehler Decl.

However, Gold Coast was dissolved by proclamation of the State of New York on June 29, 2016. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. Ex. 1, ECF No. 15-2. An alternate business address is listed for Nicolaides as an \"individual\" by the Department of Financial Services insurance broker registry. Def's 56.1 Stmt. Ex. 2, ECF No. 15-3. Although Divine alleges \"it was Gold Coast-not [Nicolaides]-who fell behind on payments owed,\" it admits that Nicolaides would be \"obligated to make ... payments ... in his capacity as personal guarantor of the debt owed by Gold Coast.\" Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 26, 2018, Divine sent a dunning letter with \"Insurance\" on the first address line and \"Nestor Nicolaides\" on the line below to the address listed for Nicolaides, the individual, on the Department of Financial Services website.

Thus, this case turns on the validity of defendant's argument that an FDCPA violation cannot lie where a \"consumer\" violates a contractual promise to use a corporate credit card \"only for the purchase of merchandise for commercial or business purposes, and not for personal, family, or household purchases,\" with the understanding that the creditor cannot \"determine whether any given purchase ... was in fact authorized by and for the benefit of the business.\" Koehler Decl.

To be sure, a debt collector's attempt to collect from an individual does not convert a commercial debt into a consumer debt for purposes of determining the nature of the debt itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Util.

In that scenario, the creditor is \"likely to know whether the debt was personal or commercial.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/#p874\">\n    214 F.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A credit card transaction is slightly different: No money is owed at the moment the account is opened. Yet just as the original creditor of a loan \"is more likely to know whether the debt was personal or commercial at its incipience than either the creditor or the debt collector is to know what current use the debtor is making of the loan,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/#p874\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , a credit card issuer cannot foresee a cardholder's future misuse in violation of the terms of the agreement. The district courts that have applied the FDCPA to corporate credit card debts discount this reality by elevating the cardholder's subjective intent at the time of purchase over all other considerations, including, most notably, the terms of the credit agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"What matters in the context of an FDCPA claim is the asserted basis for the obligation to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Beauvoir v.

Key to that obligation is the relationship between the creditor and the debtor. Thus, courts regularly examine the terms of the credit agreement to evaluate the nature of a transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hepsen v.

Oct. 22, 2013) (relying on business credit card agreement to hold debt was commercial in nature). And at least one district court has declined to extend the FDCPA to corporate credit card debts altogether.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vasilakos v. Blitt &amp; Gaines, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204047634\">\n    2013 WL 4047634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 8, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This approach makes sense because the promise to use a corporate credit card only for business purposes is an\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   expression of the cardholder's intent. Courts regularly hold parties to the intent manifested in a written agreement to \"ensure some measure of stability in commercial relations\" and to \"avoid the possibility that fraud might be perpetrated if testimony as to subjective intent could be substituted for the plain meaning of a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garza v. Marine Transp. Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523588\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/23/#p26\">\n    861 F.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (2d Cir. 1988). In evaluating a credit card transaction, the cardholder's intent behind specific purchases must therefore be subordinated to a contrary purpose articulated in the credit agreement. That is, the creditor or debt collector is justified in relying on the debtor's express contractual representation of the account's purpose. This better comports with the purpose of the FDCPA, limits uncertainty, and avoids unfairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As the Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized, the primary purpose of the FDCPA is to protect vulnerable consumers from predatory debt collection practices.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Avila v. Riexinger &amp; Assoc., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/#p75\">\n    817 F.3d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75 (2d Cir. 2016). Nevertheless, \"it also protects the interests\n   of law-abiding debt collectors.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobson v. Healthcare Fin. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640577\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/85/#p95\">\n    516 F.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (2d Cir. 2008). Here, the interests of the debt collector clearly outweigh those of the \"consumer\" who appears to have obtained a corporate credit card by fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed extension of the FDCPA does not protect consumers; it protects savvy and unscrupulous businesspeople. Nicolaides opened a corporate credit card in the name of Gold Coast. It is undisputed that he immediately used the corporate credit card to buy a patio set for his residence, even though the terms of the credit card agreement prohibit using the card \"for personal, family, or household purchases.\" Koehler Decl. Ex. B. Yet sometime between the moment he opened the credit card and swiped it, Nicolaides allegedly gained FDCPA protection. He was no less sophisticated a businessman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/#p874\">\n    214 F.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A businessman who converts a business purchase to personal use does not by virtue of that conversion lose his commercial sophistication and so acquire a need for statutory protection.\"). The creditor had no reason to know the patio set was for his home and not an office.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slenk v. Transworld Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170815\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1072/#p1075\">\n    236 F.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 (9th Cir. 2001) (dispute of material fact existed as to transaction's purpose where plaintiff took out loan in the name of his business to purchase a backhoe used to build his home and the loan instrument indicated funds would be used for \"excavation equipment and other personal goods\" (emphasis omitted)). Nor could the debt collector have known that the patio set was put to household use. On the other hand, everyone knew at all times that the account eventually placed in Divine's portfolio for collection was a corporate credit card account held by Gold Coast Insurance Agency, Inc. and that the terms of the card prohibited its use for \"personal, family, or household\" purchases-the exact words used to define \"debt\" in the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, extending the FDCPA to protect businesspeople sophisticated enough to obtain a corporate credit card, promise that it will not be put to personal use, and then immediately violate that promise, condones conduct that borders on fraud and is a far cry from the statute's goal to \"regulate[ ] the debt collection tactics employed against\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   borrowers on the theory that they are likely to be unsophisticated about debt collection and thus prey to unscrupulous collection methods.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9969308\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/872/#p874\">\n    214 F.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.

News 1695 (\"This bill applies only to debts contracted by consumers for personal, family or household purposes; it has no application to the collection of commercial accounts.\"). Under these circumstances, a debt incurred by misusing a corporate credit card that restricts personal usage does not give rise to a consumer \"debt\" under the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A word on the reach of my holding: I do not necessarily part ways with those cases concluding that commercial purchases made on personal credit cards are excluded from FDCPA protection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Holman v. W. Valley Collection Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11573243\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/60/935/#p936\">\n    60 F. Supp. 2d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936-37 (D. Minn. 1999) (FDCPA does not apply to purchase of \"commercial equipment\" using personal credit card). For a personal credit card account, examining the owner and terms of the credit card agreement may not suffice to determine the nature of the debt. For example, personal credit card agreements might lack restrictions on card usage. Accordingly, it may be necessary to rely upon other aspects of the transaction, including the purchases themselves, to determine its\n   nature. Nor do the policy concerns associated with examining each individual purchase apply with the same force to personal accounts. Unlike corporate accounts, the creditor and debt collector are on notice that a personal credit card will be likely put to personal use, and we might expect debt collectors to err on the side of caution by following the FDCPA in case of doubt. Regardless, this case does not involve the use of a personal credit card, so I need not resolve this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment is denied, and this case is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    While the Second Circuit has previously recognized that \"at a minimum, the statute contemplates that the debt has arisen as a result of the rendition of a service or purchase of property or other item of value,\" it has not held that the purpose of a credit card transaction must be discerned from the cardholder's subjective intent at the time of purchase and not the credit card agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beggs v.
