Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 23. The Trust was organized under the laws of California.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  Sometime in 2002 or thereafter, the estate planning company that first established the Trust referred Plaintiff to Defendant Christopher S. Salisbury (\"Defendant Salisbury\") for her investment and financial planning needs.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6 24.\n </attorneys>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiff turned sixty-two years old-and thus became an \"elder\" as that term is defined in HRS \u00a7 480-13.5 -sometime in 2012. Compl. \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Early on in his tenure as Plaintiff's financial advisor, Defendant Salisbury began investing Plaintiff's money and/or that of the Trust into annuities, among other investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Defendant Salisbury, together with Defendant C. Salisbury, LLC and Accelerated Estate Planning, LLC (together, \"the Salisbury Entities\") caused Plaintiff to surrender certain annuities and move the money to different annuities with the promise that any surrender fees would be offset either by bonus monies or greater earnings of the new product (a process the Complaint calls \"churning\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Defendant Salisbury understood that Plaintiff did not have sophisticated knowledge of investment, financial, and insurance-related matters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The Salisbury Entities made verbal representations about the products Defendant Salisbury was directing Plaintiff to invest in or purchase, and Defendant Salisbury routinely presented Plaintiff with signature pages, rather than complete documents, which he instructed her to sign but not date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Defendant Salisbury, a licensed notary, often notarized documents Plaintiff had signed, including those signed outside his presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Annuities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Among the many annuities involved in Defendant Salisbury's \"churning\" process were annuities issued by Allianz, at least two of which were surrendered at a sizeable loss.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. First, on or about December 29, 2009, Plaintiff was caused to surrender Allianz Flexible Premium Deferred Annuity Policy (Index Benefit bearing policy number XXX 3635, policy date September 1, 2006)-which was then valued at approximately $ 902,000-at a loss of approximately $ 200,077.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Second, on or about November 21, 2014, following Defendant Salisbury's advice and direction, Plaintiff surrendered an Allianz annuity with a policy number XXX 7754, which was issued on December 18, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Again acting on Defendant Salisbury's advice and direction, Plaintiff also surrendered four Phoenix Personal Income Annuities. On or about October 19, 2017, Plaintiff surrendered two such annuities. One, number XXX 5109, was issued with a\n   single premium of $ 24,795.55 on December 9, 2014, and its surrender cost Plaintiff approximately $ 3,790.04 in surrender charges,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34a; the other, number XXX 5355, was issued with a single premium of $ 24,800.42 on December 11, 2014, and its surrender cost Plaintiff approximately $ 3,939.86 in surrender charges,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34b. On or about November 7, 2017, Plaintiff surrendered Phoenix Personal Income Annuity number XXX 8769, which had been issued with a single premium of $ 700,000 on May 4, 2015, and incurred approximately $ 110,220.74 in surrender charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34d. And on or about November 8, 2017, Plaintiff incurred approximately $ 25,983.85 in surrender charges by surrendering Phoenix Personal Income Annuity XXX 4609, which was issued on December 18, 2014 with a single premium of $ 160,319.48.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34c. As to these four annuities, Plaintiff lost approximately $ 143,931.49.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Again following Defendant Salisbury's advice and direction, Plaintiff purchased and invested in the Fidelity Premium Deferred Fixed Index Annuity, AdvanceMark Ultra 14, number XXX 5051, which was issued on February 8, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. As of the most recent annual statement, it had an account value of approximately $ 453,282.52.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff surrendered it in or around October 2017, and the surrender charge was $ 52,382.80.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Similarly, Defendant Salisbury allowed an American National annuity, number XXX 0431, to run just over a year before he caused Plaintiff to surrender it in or around April 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. The surrender of this annuity, which had been issued on March 14, 2014 with an initial premium payment of $ 737,450.85, incurred approximately $ 61,028 in surrender charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was also issued a ForeThought Single Premium Deferred Annuity Contract number XXX 8001 on February 11, 2009, with an initial premium payment of $ 166,949.80.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. At Defendant Salisbury's direction, Plaintiff made several withdrawals from this annuity while it was in force.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time of surrender on or about November 17, 2014, the annuity was valued at $ 146,486.39, and the surrender fee was $ 7,324.32.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   And on November 26, 2007, Plaintiff was issued a North American Company Individual Flexible Premium Deferred Annuity, number XXX 2105, with an initial premium payment of $ 276,745.13.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Plaintiff paid an additional premium of $ 598,595.71 on or about April 27, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On or about January 29, 2014, the annuity was surrendered at a net loss of $ 88,205.94.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   These transactions-which Plaintiff alleges are a representative list of Defendant Salisbury's \"churning\" activities rather than an exhaustive one,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39-cost Plaintiff approximately $ 576,207.28 in surrender charges,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to each transaction, and over the course of them all, Defendant Salisbury told Plaintiff that the surrenders were in her best interest and explained that any surrender charge incurred was worth incurring to better position the funds in the replacement annuity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Acting on Defendant Salisbury's advice, Plaintiff obtained a Lincoln Benefit Flexible Premium Variable Life Insurance Policy on October 6, 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. This policy carried a death benefit of $ 5,066,782, and its planned annual payment was $ 279,731.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In or around 2008, Defendant Salisbury reduced the death benefit to $ 500,000, and the policy was surrendered on October 7, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Again acting on Defendant Salisbury's advice, Plaintiff procured a one million dollar Flexible Premium Universal Life Insurance Policy from Columbus Life Insurance\n   Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. The policy had an effective date of May 20, 2004, and the planned premiums were $ 16,881.12 annually.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This policy was cancelled in or around April 2016 and replaced with a $ 2,500,000 VOYA IUL-Global Choice Policy (\"the VOYA Policy\" or \"the Policy\") issued by Defendant Security Life of Denver (\"Defendant SLD\") and subject to a financing arrangement conceived of and carried out by Defendants Salisbury, Claraphi Advisory Network, LLC (\"Defendant Claraphi\"), Michael Diyanni (\"Defendant Diyanni\"), Aurora Capital Alliance (\"Defendant ACA\"), Lake Forest Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.A. (\"Defendant Lake Forest\"), Wintrust Life Finance (\"Defendant Wintrust\"), and Alejandro Alberto Bellini (\"Defendant Bellini\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Defendant Bellini was the writing agent of the VOYA Policy and participated in selling the Policy to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant Salisbury advised Plaintiff that the VOYA Policy would fund itself-that she would never have to make premium payments on it due to the design of the premium financing arrangement orchestrated by Defendants Salisbury, Claraphi, Diyanni, ACA, Lake Forest, Wintrust, and Bellini.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant Salisbury about the value of the VOYA Policy, but Defendant Salisbury told Plaintiff that the Policy was designed to assist her children in paying taxes after Plaintiff's decease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. But Defendant Salisbury did not inform Plaintiff at the time the Policy was purchased that very little, if any, of her net worth would be subject to estate taxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Salisbury misrepresented Plaintiff's net worth on the application for the VOYA Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff did not need the VOYA Policy's life insurance, and in any case she lacked the liquid assets to properly fund it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Despite knowing this, Defendants Salisbury, Claraphi, Diyanni, ACA, Lake Forest, Wintrust, and Bellini induced Plaintiff to enter into transactions they knew would be to her detriment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A trust agreement was created on March 26, 2016, by Defendant Diyanni, an attorney chosen by Defendant Salisbury whom Plaintiff had never met.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Defendant Diyanni handles some tax matters, but specializes primarily in personal injury and DUI/DWI cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Diyanni was hired by Defendant ACA to draft \"an Irrevocable Trust that would meet both the standards for the financial institution and life insurance carrier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Defendant Diyanni, and The Law Office of Michael Diyanni, would serve as Trustee of the Kathy Ryan Irrevocable Trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant SLD issued the VOYA Policy on April 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The annual scheduled premium was $ 160,000, and the minimum monthly premium to maintain the policy was $ 3,072.22.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant ACA arranged for First Insurance Funding (now Defendant Lake Forest; hereafter \"Defendant Lake Forest\") and/or Wintrust to finance the VOYA premiums.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. On April 12, 2016, Defendant Lake Forest issued its proposal of a $ 172,000 initial loan amount, which included a $ 12,000 broker's fee that was paid to Defendant Diyanni.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Plaintiff alleges that this $ 12,000 fee is substantially in excess of the commissions normally paid to brokers, agents, or attorneys for similar services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant Diyanni then assigned the VOYA Policy as collateral to Defendant Lake Forest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Plaintiff was also required to assign an annuity, Allianz Annual Fixed Index Annuity number XXX 9437, as collateral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Defendants Diyanni and Salisbury told Plaintiff that the assignment would be released after seven years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But this assignment was fraudulently procured by Defendants Diyanni\n   and Salisbury, as it is dated and notarized in Orange County, California, on a date when Plaintiff was not on the mainland and could not have signed the document.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, during and after the sale of the Policy, Defendant Diyanni as Trustee of the Kathy Ryan Irrevocable Trust (the \"ILIT\") failed to perform his fiduciary duties to determine the appropriateness of replacing the Columbus Life policy or the suitability of the VOYA Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Diyanni did not properly assess the negative consequences of the premium financing arrangement, the selection and assignment of collateral, and/or the funding of premiums outside of the premium financing arrangement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"In short,\" Plaintiff alleges, \"the VOYA [P]olicy should have never been purchased.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A year later, Plaintiff and Defendant Diyanni were advised that the Note issued by Defendant Lake Forest was in default for failure to make the interest payment of $ 8,642.25, and to make the premium payment of $ 163,500, as well as to provide the requested collateral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Plaintiff contacted VOYA, a representative of which told her that the company could only speak with Defendant Diyanni because he was the \"owner\" of the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. When Plaintiff contacted Defendant Salisbury, he told her that Defendant Lake Forest was mistaken, but he later reversed course and instructed Plaintiff to wire $ 37,000 to Defendant Lake Forest in order to secure the loan.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff did so, but never received a receipt for the transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Despite having been advised by Defendant Salisbury that she should never have to personally pay premiums on the VOYA Policy and that the policy would fund itself, Plaintiff was advised by Defendant ACT, in or around March 2018, that the action items on her life insurance premium finance arrangement included an outstanding interest payment of $ 24,545.82 and a signed, dated Guarantors Acknowledgment and Certification Additional Collateral of $ 60,639.55.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Those defendants who initiated and/or approved the purchase of the VOYA Policy and the associated premium financing arrangements-i.e., Defendants Salisbury, Claraphi, Diyanni, ACA, Lake Forest, Wintrust, SLD, and Bellini,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45, 53-knew at the time they did so that the VOYA Policy was an unsuitable financial product for Plaintiff in light of the excessive death benefit and the fact that its premiums exceeded her ability to pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.c (alleging that \"Defendant Salisbury misrepresent[ed Plaintiff]'s net worth on the application for the VOYA life insurance policy\").

Plaintiff has thus satisfied the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III standing as to her claims against Defendant SLD. Moreover, she is asserting her own legal rights rather than those of the ILIT, the grievance she asserts is not generalized, and her complaint falls within the zone of interests protected by the laws she invokes against Defendant SLD: Hawai'i's UDAP statute and the federal RICO statute. In sum, Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to establish that she has prudential standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant SLD's wrongful conduct included issuing her a life insurance policy she could not afford, Compl. \u00b6 72.b, and taking part in a scheme to defraud her of her money by way of the Policy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.
