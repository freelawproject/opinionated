On September 18, 1962, under U. S. District Court Docket No. 6620, a plea of not guilty was made to this indictment by the Defendant-Appellant and the matter was continued until the next term of court. On April 3, 1963, a plea of guilty was entered by the Defendant-Appellant. On October 31, 1963, upon oral motion of the United States Attorney, the indictment was dismissed. The indictment was dismissed as it did not allege an offense against the United States. A second indictment was returned on March 26, 1964, United States District Court Docket No. 6769. The Defendant-Appellant entered a plea of guilty on April 14,1964, at which time there was a stipulation by both counsel for the United States and the Defendant-Appellant that none of his rights of appeal would be waived, it being the position that the Defendant-Appellant was being placed in double jeopardy. The Court overruled the Defendant-Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and sentenced the Defendant-Appellant on May 14, 1964. Appeal is taken to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-21\">The question before the Court is, did the trial Court err in overruling Defendant-Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the Defendant-Appellant was placed in double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b991-22\">In Shoener v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 207 U.S. 188, 28 S.Ct. 110, 52 L.Ed. 163 (1907), the Court held: \u201cone is not put in jeopardy if the indictment under which he is tried is so radically defective that it would not support a judgment of conviction, and that a judgment thereon would be arrested on motion\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-23\">Here, the defendant pleaded guilty to a defective indictment. Instead of proceeding on this indictment, and waiting for the accused to raise the issue of the defective indictment, the United States voluntarily dismissed the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>We find that the second indictment did not place the Defendant-Appellant in double jeopardy. There was no error in the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the Defendant-Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
