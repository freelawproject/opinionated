Lauritzen, owner of the S.S. Gerda-Dan, in a maritime action for injuries sustained when he was assaulted on June 16, 1959, by a fellow longshoreman with a cargo hook while they were discharging the vessel\u2019s cargo. The Complaint alleged unseaworthiness of the vessel in that the plaintiff\u2019s assailant was not equal in temperament and disposition to the ordinary men of his calling. The jury returned a verdict of $2,000 in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant Lauritzen. It also returned a verdict of $2,000 against the third-party defendant Jarka Corporation of Philadelphia, a stevedore employer of the plaintiff and his assailant. Jarka had been joined by Lauritzen as third-party defendant on an indemnity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The plaintiff appealed when the District Court denied his motion for a new trial which was based on alleged errors in the charge to the jury. Jarka has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The plaintiff here asks a new trial limited to the issue of damages, or in the alternative, a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">He urges, inter alia, that the trial judge erred in charging the jury that (1) \u201cif the assault was justified in self-defense * * * the vessel was not unseaworthy\u201d; (2) \u201cif the assault was * * * sufficiently provoked, the vessel was not unseaworthy\u201d; and (3) \u201cI think you should consider that they [plaintiff and assailant] were both using the [cargo] hook, admittedly everyday tools of their trade, and there is no testimony that Frank Smith [the assailant] went to get the hook to beat up the plaintiff. In other words, what I am trying to say is that I think you should take into consideration the fact that when this fight broke out they were both using hooks\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">It is necessary to consider the evidence adduced at the trial before proceeding to a discussion of the plaintiff\u2019s stated contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">The record discloses that on the day of the assault the plaintiff, (\u201cArthur\u201d), and his alleged assailant Frank Smith, (\u201cFrank\u201d), were unloading bags of sugar from the hold of the S.S. Gerda-Dan, and that some time after they commenced to perform their work, Frank attacked Arthur from behind with a cargo hook or hooks, inflicting severe head injuries. The incidents relating to the attack were variously described by the witnesses at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">James Rich, a rigger and a fellow longshoreman, testified that he had observed the action from above; Arthur and Frank had gotten into a \u201crumble\u201d; and that \u201cFrank had took the hook and hit Arthur in the head three or four times.\u201d Asked on direct examination what he meant by \u201crumble\u201d, Rich answered, \u201cI heard the talking. I heard they were talking. Then I looked down the hold. I was standing right over the hatch. * * * I heard a noise down in the hatch. I heard a noise and then I look around and that time I saw Frank hitting Arthur in the head with the hook, so that must be what I hear him was talking about. * * * Arthur was bent over. He had both of his hands sticked in a bag to raise it up to put in the draft.\u201d And on cross-examination in response to the question, \u201cAnd by rumble do you mean quarrel, that Frank and Arthur were quarreling ?\u201d he testified, \u201cNo they wasn\u2019t quarreling. I heard the talking and I looked around and Frank was hitting Arthur in the head with the hook. Whether it was Frank talking or Arthur talking, I didn\u2019t heard Arthur say anything but I know Frank\u2019s voice because I worked with him.\u201d And to the further question on cross-examination, \u201cAnd by rumble you mean you heard Arthur and Frank argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ing?\u201d he replied, \u201cNo, no. I didn\u2019t say Arthur and Frank. I said I heard Frank voice\u201d; and to the question, \u201cDid you hear people arguing?\u201d he responded, \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t say they was arguing because Arthur had both his hooks in the bag to lift it up to put it in the sling; and then when I looked down Frank was hitting Arthur in the head with the hook.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Leroy Stevens, another fellow longshoreman, a defense witness, who apparently saw the entire occurrence, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201cBy the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cQ. Now you heard them arguing, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\u201cQ. Did you see any motions made one to the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201cA. Well, Arthur hit Frank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201cQ. Arthur hit Frank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">\u201cA. Yes. * * * And Frank didn\u2019t say anything, but he waited until Arthur bend to sweep the bag, and then he took his hook and he hit him aside the head. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">And to the question, \u201cDid those men [the men working in the hold, including Arthur and Frank] have any tools with them at the time?\u201d he replied, \u201cThey all had two hooks, all but the hook runner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">On cross-examination Stevens again described the incidents leading up to the attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">\u201cBy Mr. Dorfman [Plaintiff\u2019s counsel] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">\u201cQ. I am just interested in learning what you saw the first time you looked into the hold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-17\">\u201cA. When I looked into the hold, they were arguing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-18\">\u201cQ. They were arguing ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-19\">\u201cA. Yes. That\u2019s what started it. They started to argue.\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-21\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-22\">\u201cQ. Tell us what happened as they were arguing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-23\">\u201cA. They were arguing about the work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-24\">\u201cQ. What happened after the argument ;? Was it an argument of words ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3T\">\u201cA. Argument of words, and then it turned into a fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATX\">\u201cQ. Now tell us how it turned into a fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD_\">\u201cA. Arthur hit Frank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKnm\">\u201cQ. Arthur hit Frank ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8p\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsO\">\u201cQ. With what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0S\">\u201cA. With his fist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeo\">\u201cQ. With his fist? Did Arthur have hooks in his hand at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWg\">\u201cA. I guess he did. He works with two hooks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcE\">\u201cQ. Well, did he have his hooks in his hands when he hit Frank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"App\">\u201cA. I think he put his hooks away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYu\">\u201cQ. You think he put his hooks away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMB\">\u201cA. He put them down, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A89\">\u201cQ. And Arthur hit Frank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au7\">\u201cQ. With his fist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoN\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOu\">\u201cQ. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIb\">\u201cA. Then Arthur took his hooks up and begin to work. He bend over to sweep the bags. That\u2019s when Frank hit him with the hook.\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-27\">\u201cQ. Arthur\u2019s hooks were in the bag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-28\">\u201cA. Yes. He had them stuck in the bag, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-29\">\u201cQ. And at that point Frank hit Arthur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-30\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-31\">Frank and Arthur also testified to what had happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-32\">On direct examination Frank was asked:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-33\">\u201cQ. Do you remember this fight that happened on June 16, 1959?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-34\">\u201cA.

Could you tell us in your own words the events that led up to the fight and the fight itself?\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\u201cA. Yes. He came in the hatch there and they told me about my head. They used to make me mad because they said I had a silver plate in my head and they used to kid me and say they was going to knock the silver plate off my head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201cQ. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I just go on and work, but that morning we had a little misunderstanding again so I just got tired and hit him with the hook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">\u201cQ. I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\u201cQ. And that was after he said he was going to hit you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">\u201cQ. \u2014on the head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-14\">\u201cQ. On your plate, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-15\">\u201cA. Yes. I haven\u2019t got no plate, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-16\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t have a plate in your head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-17\">\u201cA. No, but they say I have a plate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-18\">\u201cQ. Did Arthur Smith have any things in his hand at the time he made that threat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-19\">\u201cA. Yes. He had two hooks, just like I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-20\">\u201cQ. Where did he have the hooks at the time he made that statement ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-21\">\u201cA. We were loading the sugar, getting ready to load the sugar. We had loaded and then we finished putting the bag over the rope. Then we started the argument again, so I just hit him with the hook.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-22\">Arthur admitted that he and Frank had argued, but stated that the argument, which had pertained to work procedure, occurred some fifteen minutes before the attack. As to the attack itself Arthur testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-23\">\u201cQ. Will you tell us what happened to you on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-24\">\u201cA. Well, on this morning me and Frank was working. I was bent, bent over to put a bag in the rope. Well, when I felt something hit me on the head, and then I felt it again and then it came again. At first I thought it was the man on the deck that throwed a rope sling in the hold for us to load the bags. Then it came again and I found myself blacking out and at the last instant it came, it dawned on me that I was being clobbered over the head with these cargo hooks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-25\">The plaintiff testified that he had incurred some $1,300 in medical expenses, allegedly as a result of the attack by Frank. The defendant agreed that $1,300 was a reasonable approximation of the costs incurred, but denied that any of this sum, except $49.50 came as the result of the attack. The plaintiff also claimed that he had lost some $4,300 in wages as a result of injuries incurred in the attack. The defendant denied this, and attempted to show that at the very most lost wages totaled $432.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-26\">As earlier stated, the theory upon which the case was tried and presented to the jury was that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the unseaworthiness of the defendant\u2019s ship due to the fact that Frank was not equal \u201cin temperament and disposition to the ordinary men of his calling\u201d. Such a theory is normally susceptible to one of two modes of proof: (1) by independent evidence with regard to the assailant\u2019s temperament and disposition, or (2) by direct evidence showing a vicious and unprovoked attack. See Clevenger v. Star Fish &amp; Oyster Company, Inc., 325 F.2d 397 (5th Cir. 1963); Walters v. Moore-McCor-mack Lines, Inc., 309 F.2d 191 (2 Cir. 1962); Jones v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc., 204 F.2d 815 (2 Cir. 1953). From the record it is apparent that the plaintiff chose the second mode of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-27\">Coming now to the three grounds upon which the plaintiff premises his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tention that the trial court erroneously and prejudicially charged the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">First, as to the court\u2019s instruction, \u201cIf the assault was justified in self-defense * * * the vessel was not un-seaworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"> The instruction was not justified by the testimony and was erroneous for that reason. Critical to the theory of self-defense, whether in a civil or criminal setting, is the notion that the defender is privileged to respond only to a reasonable belief on his part that he is in imminent danger of bodily harm. See Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 343, 41 S.Ct. 501, 65 L.Ed. 961 (1921); Josey v. United States, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 135 F.2d 809, 810 (1943); 6 Am.Jur. 2d, Assault and Battery \u00a7 159. There is not an iota of evidence in the present record to support a jury finding that Frank acted in self-defense. Even if the jury believed that at some time prior to the attack Arthur had struck Frank, or that he had threatened to hit Frank in his \u201csilver plate\u201d, nothing evidences that Frank acted at the moment of the attack with a reasonable fear of bodily harm. The defense witness Leroy Stevens testified that after Arthur had struck Frank he returned to his work, and only then did Frank launch the attack. Frank himself never mentioned being struck, but instead testified that the two had argued \u201cagain, so I just hit him with the hook\u201d; \u201cI just got tired and hit him with the hook\u201d. All that a jury could find from this evidence is that Frank acted because he was greatly annoyed or frustrated by Arthur\u2019s actions. This is not self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">It is settled that where the record does not support the submission of an issue to the jury it is reversible error to do so. Eichmann v. Dennis, 347 F.2d 978, 981 (3 Cir. 1965); Moore v. Smith, 343 F.2d 206, 210 (3 Cir. 1965); O\u2019Neill v. Reading Company, 306 F.2d 204, 206 (3 Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Second, as to the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, \u201cIf the assault was * * * sufficiently provoked, the vessel was not unseaworthy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The defendant urges on this point that (1) there was sufficient evidence of provocation to support a jury finding; (2) the plaintiff failed to furnish an adequate definition of provocation either in his points for charge, or when given the opportunity to do so at a side bar conference following delivery of the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">The defendant\u2019s first point is irrelevant. If the court failed to relate the evidence to an applicable legal standard the charge was erroneous, even if the evidence justified a finding of provocation under a proper charge. Cf. Mc-Nello v. John B. Kelly, Inc., 283 F.2d 96 (3 Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The following colloquy between the court and plaintiff\u2019s counsel is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">\u201cMr. Dorfman: Your Honor, I think you did not charge as to the meaning of the words \u2018provocation\u2019 and \u2018sufficient provocation\u2019, as I recall; and I would request a charge that provocation must be a sufficient provocation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">* x- * * x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">\u201cThe Court: * * * Do you have a case there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">\u201cMr. Dorfman: Well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-19\">\u201cThe Court: Well what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-20\">\u201cMr. Dorfman: Mere words do not justify it at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-21\">\u201cThe Court: What words should I use then? Let the record indicate that you have not included anything in your points for charge. You are now asking me to put in words what is a provoked assault. What do you suggest? You tell me what words to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-22\">\u201cMr. Dorfman: The words I suggest, Your Honor, are that the provocation must be a sufficient provocation and that mere needling is not a legal provocation to justify Frank Smith\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-23\">\u201cMr. Thompson: I would object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-24\">\u201cThe Court: Denied. Anything else?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The standard of sufficient provocation for longshoremen and seamen differs from that applied to ordinary persons, Cf. Boudoin v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc., 348 U.S. 336, 75 S.Ct. 382, 99 L.Ed. 354 (1955); Jones v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc., supra, for they \u201clead a rough life and are more apt to use their fists than office employees\u201d, and \u201cwhat will seem to sedentary and protected persons an insufficient provocation for a personal encounter, is not the measure of the \u2018disposition\u2019 of \u2018the ordinary men in the calling.\u2019 \u201d Jones v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc., supra, 204 F.2d at 817. In Walters v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., supra, it was held that the trial court properly directed a verdict in favor of the defendant shipowner even though the record supported a possible finding that the plaintiff had been struck in the face with fists, hit with a \u201ckarate\u201d blow, and furiously attacked after he fell to the deck, by a fellow seaman who was 30 pounds heavier than he, after they had exchanged some unpleasantries. But, nevertheless, there is a limit beyond which even seamen and longshoremen cannot go without their \u201cdisposition\u201d being impugned. In Clevenger v. Star Fish &amp; Oyster Company, Inc., supra, where the plaintiff was attacked by the ship\u2019s first mate, following an exchange of \u201cseamen\u2019s unpleasantries,\u201d with a \u201cdevil\u2019s fork\u201d, a four foot long pointed steel ice chisel being used in unloading fish from the defendant\u2019s ship, the court held that the ship was unseaworthy as a matter of law. The factor which distinguishes Clevenger from Walters is the use in Clevenger of an unmistakably dangerous or deadly instrument, the \u201cdevil\u2019s fork\u201d, rather than mere fists. Thus, although it can be said that mere words may be sufficient provocation to signal the start of a longshoremen\u2019s brawl or fisticuffs, it is not enough when the means of attack is an unmistakably dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">A cargo hook, like a \u201cdevil\u2019s fork\u201d, when used as an instrument of attack is an unmistakably dangerous or deadly weapon. The court\u2019s charge, however, permitted the jury to find sufficient provocation for its use, even if they only found, for example, that Frank was motivated by the \u201cargument of words\u201d which the record indicates preceded the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Absent some indication from the court that mere words could not serve as legal provocation for an attack with a cargo hook, the jury was without a sufficient guideline to render a proper decision on the question of provocation, and this was error. See McNello v. John B. Kelly, Inc., supra. Counsel\u2019s objections alerted the trial court to this deficiency in its charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Third, as to the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">\u201cWas this a vicious, unprovoked, and unwarranted attack ? The plaintiff says this is apparent by the use of a hook used by Frank Smith. However, I do think you should consider that they were both using the hook, admittedly everyday tools of their trade, and there is no testimony that Frank Smith went to get the hook to beat up the plaintiff. In other words, what I am trying to say is that I think you should take into consideration the fact that when this fight broke out they were both using hooks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\"> The viciousness of an attack may be established by a showing that the assailant used an unmistakably dangerous or deadly instrument. See Clevenger v. Star Fish &amp; Oyster Company, Inc., supra; Walter v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., supra; Jones v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc., supra. The court\u2019s charge to the jury in the instant case, however, shifted the jury\u2019s focus from the dangerous nature of a cargo hook when used as a weapon, to the question of whether or not the hook was also a tool in everyday use in the trade. This shift in focus constituted error, for the fact that a hook is a tool normally used by longshoremen is irrelevant as is the fact that the assailant did not have to \u201cget the hook to beat up the plaintiff\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Illustrative of this is the Clevenger case where the instrument of attack was a devil\u2019s fork, which was apparently being used to aid in the unloading of fish, an operation in which both the libellant and the assailant were engaged at the time of the attack.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">For the reasons stated the Judgment of the District Court entered November 26, 1963, pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdicts in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant and in favor of the defendant against the third-party defendant will be reversed with directions to grant a new trial in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b225-18\"> Judge Kalodner became Chief Judge on October 7,1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-12\">.
