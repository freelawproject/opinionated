UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b973-12\">No. 22101.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b973-13\">United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b973-14\">Feb. 11, 1966.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b973-25\">David W. Palmer, Purl G. Adams, Crestview, Fla., for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b973-26\">Clinton Ashmore, U. S. Atty., C. W. Eggart, Jr., Asst. U. S. Atty., Tallahassee, Fla., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b973-27\">Before GEWIN and COLEMAN, Circuit Judges, and McRAE, District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b973-28\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b973-29\">Each of the three appellants was indicted and found guilty on four counts: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>(1) having possession and custody of an unregistered still; (2) carrying on the business of a distiller without giving the required bond; (3) illegally making and fermenting mash for distillation; and (4) having possession of distilled spirits in a container to which no tax stamp was attached. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5601 (a)(1), (4), (7), 5604(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The major contention of appellants is that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain their convictions. Appellants\u2019 trial counsel, however, did not move for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure either at the end of the Government\u2019s case or after trial. In light of this failure, we are not called upon to review the sufficiency of the evidence except to avoid a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d Fallen v. United States, 220 F.2d 946, 949 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 924, 76 S.Ct. 213, 100 L.Ed. 808 (1955). Such a miscarriage would exist only if it appears that the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d Molina v. United States, 162 F.2d 198 (5th Cir. 1947). <em>Cf. </em>Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654 (1960) (violation of due process clause to convict person when record devoid of evidence to support judgment). In this case, not only is there evidence to support each conviction, but the evidence of guilt would be more than sufficient to support an affirmance if motions for judgment of acquittal had been made below.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Although again not objecting to the alleged defects at trial, appellants also urge now that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury and in allowing a government witness to remain in the courtroom during the trial. These allegations are without merit: the jury instructions were complete and correct, and permitting one government witness to hear the remaining testimony is \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>e. g., </em>Del Cristo v. United States, 327 F.2d 208, 209 (5th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
