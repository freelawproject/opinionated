COON was not the result of any negligence on the part of the towboat AMERICA causing or contributing to the cause of the accident involved. The trial court found that the Captain of the COON was negligent in his unsuccessful attempt to make a downstream landing on the head of the AMERICA\u2019S tow, and that such negligence was the sole cause of the disaster and loss. Our review of the record convinces us that the evidence amply supports the conclusion reached by the trial court. McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
