By a letter dated July 16,1963 and received on July 19, the Union informed Security of its majority status and demanded a meeting to negotiate a labor agreement. Security made no response. Instead, it immediately approached several employees who were supporting the Union and urged them to cease their activities and withhold any support. It pointed out that representation would be an expense to both employee and employer and argued that neither would receive any real benefit. It threatened to close the business if the Union was successful. On the other hand, it promised to improve working conditions as soon as its financial condition permitted. Then on August 1, the employees held a meeting at which Fred Fischer, a principal owner and general manager, spoke. He urged them to revoke their prior Union authorization. A ballot was taken and, just as it was announced that the result was in favor of Union representation, Fischer received a telegram from the Union protesting any such election. He thereupon angrily accused the employees of having a \u201cstool pigeon\u201d among them and again threatened to close the shop. A second ballot was then taken, but this time only one vote was cast in favor of representation. The next day Security discharged Badillo, and this was shortly followed by the discharge of Palmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Security urges that the evidence is insufficient to support the Board\u2019s order. N.L.R.B. v. Mrak Coal Co., 322 F.2d 311, 313 (9th Cir. 1963); Snow v. N.L.R.B., 308 F.2d 687, 691 (9th Cir. 1962). But an examination of the entire record convinces us. the respondent is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Security first attacks the Board\u2019s finding that it refused \u201cto bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees\u201d and thus violated Section 8 (a) (5) and (1) of the Act. Security argues that the Union did not represent a majority of the employees and, in the alternative, even if it did, the employer entertained a good faith doubt as to the Union\u2019s majority status, justifying a refusal to bargain. Security does not deny that the necessary number of employees did sign the authorization cards, or that representative status can be created by such cards alone. See United Mine Workers of America v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 351 U.S. 62, 71-72, 76 S.Ct. 559, 100 L.Ed. 941 (1956). Rather, it contends the cards do not reflect the real intention of many of those who signed because the cards were in English, a language which they were unable to read and that the Union organizer misrepresented the cards as simply a necessary preliminary to an election. The most that can be said in support of the argument is that there was some evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>that effect. However, there was also evidence that the meaning and import of the cards were carefully and correctly read and explained to such employees in a language that they understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Respondent\u2019s next argument presents a more difficult question. It rests on the now well established rule that a good faith doubt of a union\u2019s majority status will excuse an employer\u2019s failure to recognize and bargain with a union. N.L.R.B. v. Hyde, 339 F.2d 568, 570 (9th Cir. 1964); Snow v. N.L.R.B., supra, 308 F.2d 691; N.L.R.B. v. Trimfit of California, 211 F.2d 206, 209 (9th Cir. 1954); Fort Smith Broadcasting Co. v. N.L.R.B., 341 F.2d 874 (8th Cir. 1965). The rule does not operate unless it appears that employer had a bona fide doubt at the time the majority union was denied recognition. The refusal may not be motivated by a desire to forestall collective bargaining and provide an opportunity to undermine the union\u2019s majority status and rid the company of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In the instant case Security received notice on July 19 that the Union was the majority representative and demanded collective bargaining. On this date, the Union was in fact majority representative, although it was not on the date the letter bore, July 16. However, a request to bargain is effectual only upon receipt. The Union\u2019s status on the day the letter was sent is not material. Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling v. N.L.R.B., 312 F.2d 529, 532 (3d Cir. 1962). Security did not contact the Union as requested in the letter but instead sought to influence its employees to withdraw authorization. Security now argues vigorously that the Union\u2019s Petition for Certification as Representative, filed with the N.L.R.B. Regional Office on July 17, raised a good faith doubt, justifying its refusal to bargain. Security also states the Union\u2019s failure to present proof of majority status induced doubt. For the latter proposition, the employer cites Edward Fields, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 325 F.2d 754 (2d Cir. 1963). This case is distinguishable in that the employer in <em>Fields </em>\u201crepeatedly asked for evidence to support the [majority status] claim\u201d and \u201cthis request was refused.\u201d Id. 760. Furthermore, our own Circuit has stated, \u201cthere was no necessity for the union to offer proof of the genuineness of its majority claim absent a challenge by respondent [employer].\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Trimfit of California, supra, 211 F.2d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">N.L.R.B. v. Dan River Mills, 274 F.2d 381 (5th Cir. 1960) is quoted at length by respondent in support of its argument that the Representation Petition justified a good faith doubt of the Union\u2019s status. The facts in that case are similar to our own \u2014 a Representative Petition was filed just prior to receipt of the Union\u2019s letter to the employer stating it had majority status. In the <em>Dan River </em>case a good faith doubt was found by the court, but there were certain controlling facts not present here. In that case \u201cthe employer immediately * * * disputed [the union\u2019s majority status]\u201d by expressly stating its doubt in a letter to the Union and the Board. Here, Security did not dispute the Union\u2019s claim. Its only reaction to the letter requesting recognition was an immediate anti-Union campaign. Such action tends to indicate an implicit acknowledgment of the Union\u2019s power. Under similar facts, the court in N.L.R.B. v. Overnite Transportation Co., 308 F.2d 279, 283 (4th Cir. 1962) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">\u201cIn this case the evidence unmistakably demonstrates that the company gave some credit to the union\u2019s claims, for [the managers] began their course of unlawful interrogations and speeches immediately, upon receiving the union\u2019s * * * telegram and * * * letter, requesting recognition and bargaining. This course of conduct is an absolute refutation of any good faith doubt on the part of the Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Considering all the facts, the Board was not in error in finding Security\u2019s refusal to bargain was not based on a good faith doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\"> Respondent next contends that the discharge of Palmer and Badillo was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>not discriminatory; it argues that Palmer was discharged for \u201csabotaging\u201d machinery and Badillo for slow and inefficient job performance. However, the Board affirmed the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion that these employees were discharged to discourage Union membership and activity in violation of Section 8(a) (3) and (1). As stated by this court in Wells, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 162 F.2d 457, 460 (1947), and reiterated in N.L.R.B. v, Texas Independent Oil Co., 232 F.2d 447, 450 (9th Cir. 1956), \u201cthe existence of some justifiable ground for discharge is no defense if it was not the moving cause.\u201d See Radio Officers, Union, etc. v. N.L.R.B., 347 U.S. 17, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954). We have before us conflicting evidence as to why the employees were dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since a consideration of the record as a whole convinces us there is substantial evidence supporting the Petitioner, we are precluded from further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The Board also found Security violated Section 8(a) (1) by frustrating the employees\u2019 rights guaranteed by Section 7. The essence of the latter is, employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively. American Ship Building v. N.L.R.B., 380 U.S. 300, 85 S.Ct. 955, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965). Subsection (a) (1) of Section 8 is a broad provision making it an unfair practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in organizing and bargaining, as guaranteed by Section 7. Here, there was evidence that Security questioned employees about their union activities, implied that union activities were under surveillance, made threats, and made promises of benefits if the Union were defeated. The opinions or arguments that it expressed were more than those authorized by Section 8(c) or the First Amendment to the Constitution. Rather, they constituted a prohibited anti-union campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-5\">. Palmer offered uncontradicted testimony that Fischer told her at the time of her discharge that she had failed to cooperate in ridding the company of the Union. Prior to this time, Fischer had sought Palmer\u2019s help in defeating the Union. On the other hand, Palmer denied she had tampered with certain machinery as claimed by Security. The evidence pertaining to Badillo showed that she had been warned not to support the Union and that Fischer was aware of her subsequent yote for the Union on August 1. The next day, Badillo was discharged. There had been no previous complaint to Badillo that she was slow and inefficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
