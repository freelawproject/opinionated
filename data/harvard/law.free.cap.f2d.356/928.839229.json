Pierpont as a death bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>fit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cin recognition of the services\u201d rendered by her late husband, Mervin G. Pierpont, who was the majority shareholder and principal officer of the taxpayer for many years. The District Court held that Section 404 incorporated the pertinent provisions of Section 162,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the payments in question failed to meet the \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d requirements of the latter section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With this conclusion we must agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Taxpayer has conceded on appeal that the payments were not made pursuant to any obligation to pay additional compensation for the services rendered by Mr. Pierpont, that they were motivated primarily, if not solely, by his widow\u2019s dire financial straits, pending her receipt of income from certain trusts, and that no corporate benefit was either contemplated or derived.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">In view of these concessions and the decision to liquidate the business so soon after these payments were authori2;ed, we can perceive no error in the District Court\u2019s findings that the payments were not ordinary and necessary to the operation of the taxpayer\u2019s business, or in its conclusion that the deductions were properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-13\">. The payments were made in the years 1956 and 1957, but the taxpayer had a net operating loss <em>in </em>1957 which was carried back to 1955.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-5\">. Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 404 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-6\">\u201c\u00a7 404. Deduction for contributions of an employer to an employees\u2019 trust or annuity plan and compensation under a deferred-payment plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-7\">\u201c(a) General rule.' \u2014 -If contributions are paid by an employer to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or if compensation is paid or accrued on account of any employee under a plan deferring the receipt of such compensation, such contributions or compensation shall not be deductible under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) or section 212 (relating to expenses for the production of income) but if they satisfy the conditions of either of such sections, they shall be deductible under this section, subject, however, to the following limitations as to the amounts deductible in any year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">\u201c(1). Pension trusts. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-9\">\u201c(2). Employees\u2019 annuities. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0x\">\u201c(3). Stock bonus and profit-sharing trusts. * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-10\">\u201c(4). Trust created or organized outside the United States. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-11\">\u201c (5). Other plans. \u2014 In the taxable year when paid, if the plan is not one included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), if the employees\u2019 rights to or derived from such employer\u2019s contribution or such compensation are nonforfeitable at the time the contribution or compensation is paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">\u201c(b) Method of contributions, etc., having the effect of a plan. \u2014 If there is no plan but a method of employer contributions or compensation has the effect of a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or similar plan deferring the receipt of compensation, subsection (a) shall apply as if there were such a plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b981-18\">. Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 162 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-19\">\u201c\u00a7 162. Trade or business expenses, \u201c(a) In general. \u2014 There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-20\">\u201c(1) a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b981-21\">. We note in passing that in the case of Poyner v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 301 F.2d 287, Mrs. Pierpont contended that the payments were gifts and hence excludable from her gross income under Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b981-22\">. This final concession is especially important to our decision, for in the usual case, increase in the morale of remaining officers and employees may constitute a corporate benefit. The directors of Loewy Drug voted the payments to Mrs. Pierpont on March 22 and April 27, 1956. In the summer of that year serious consideration was given to the possibility of liquidation, and a sale of assets was approved by the directors on April 12, 1957. Corporate dissolution was formally completed on December 30, 1957. There could be, and was, no hope of an increase in morale of remaining officers with liquidation in the offing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
