Cantrell suffered an injury to his leg in the course of his employment with the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Treasury Department, for which he had worked since 1947. The Federal Employees Compensation Board determined that he had a 61% partial disability in his leg, and awarded him $10,655.43 in compensation benefits under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 755 (1958). In 1957, on the application of the Treasury Department, the Civil Service Commission found that Cantrell had become disabled, and retired him on a monthly annuity of $150.00. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252 et seq. (1958). Thereafter Cantrell filed this complaint in the Western District of South Carolina, Greenville Division (Simons, J.), challenging the Commission\u2019s authority to determine appellant\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d status. On appeal from dismissal of that complaint, the parties have waived oral argument and submitted the matter on brief and on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-19\">Appellant contends that because his original leg injury was employment-related, only the Compensation Board could determine his physical condition, and since the Board found only a <em>partial </em>disability of his leg, the Civil Service Commission could not for purposes of retirement find him \u201cdisabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-20\">However, the Compensation Act and the Retirement Act cover very different situations. The former provides compensation in lieu of damages for injuries sustained in the course of the work, and the Board is primarily concerned with the nature and extent of such injuries and damages. On the other hand, a disability subjecting an employee to retirement need not be work-related. The Civil Service Commission\u2019s inquiry is primarily directed not to the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>the injury itself, but to the employee\u2019s general ability to perform his duties. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(g). The injury is considered incidentally, together with other circumstances, in determining working capacity. The Board and the Commission exercise their respective jurisdictions independently and each makes its own factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The Retirement Act specifically provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-5\">\u201cAny employee who completes five years of civilian service and <em>who is found by the Commission to have become disabled </em>shall, upon his own application or upon application by his department or agency, be retired on an annuity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Since the adjudication complained of has been specifically authorized by Congress as part of the Civil Service System, the District Court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
