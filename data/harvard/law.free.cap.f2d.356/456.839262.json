These funds resulted from the sale of Cutter-Karcher\u2019s shoes and accessories by Cutter-Karcher\u2019s employees in the department store of the bankrupt, Lord\u2019s, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-24\">The petition was denied by the Referee in Bankruptcy, whose order was affirmed by the District Court on petition for review, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-25\">On February 1, 1956, Cutter-Karcher entered into a lease with Lord\u2019s for space in Lord\u2019s store in Evanston, Illinois, where Cutter-Karcher would sell its shoes and related accessories for cash or on credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>It was agreed that sales would be made in the name of Lord\u2019s and recorded by Lord\u2019s at its expense, and that all moneys received by Cutter-Karcher\u2019s employees would be turned over immediately to Lord\u2019s. The agreement provided, however, in Article Sixteenth of the agreement that all the moneys and accounts so received by Lord\u2019s on account of sales in Cutter-Karcher\u2019s department would be considered to be held by Lord\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">* * * in Trust for Lessee [Cutter-Karcher], and if mingled with Lessor\u2019s [Lord\u2019s] funds, either in cash drawer or deposit in the bank, or wherever such commingling may be effected, such funds shall nevertheless and hereby are considered trust funds, and are to be so held by Lessor in trust for Lessee until Lessor has paid to Lessee the total amount of such sales and receipts in accordance with the provisions hereof. In the event title to said funds shall at any time be called into question, the parties hereto desire to clearly indicate their intention that these funds shall be and are hereby considered and regarded by the parties hereto as trust funds irrespective of whether they are commingled or not, and said funds shall be held in trust for the benefit of Lessee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On June 16, 1964, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against Lord\u2019s. Lord\u2019s petitioned for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. Until September 2, 1964, Lord\u2019s operated as debtor in possession under court order. On September 2, 1964, Lord\u2019s was adjudicated a bankrupt with its consent, and Charles D. Maley, defendant-appellee in this case, was appointed Trustee in Bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On June 16, 1964, Lord\u2019s had in its possession $9,553.16 net proceeds of sales in the leased department during May, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Trustee subsequently adopted Lord\u2019s answer to the reclamation petition for the $9,553.16 plus proceeds of sales after June 16, 1964. Lord\u2019s contended that it held no sums in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">After hearing, the Referee in Bankruptcy found that the lease agreement and the conduct of the parties showed a relationship of debtor and creditor and not the creation of a trust. He accordingly denied the reclamation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Cutter-Karcher contends that the lease agreement contained an express trust obligation which Lord\u2019s (and the Trustee, in turn) was estopped to deny. In the face of the explicit wording of Article Sixteenth, quoted above, Cutter-Karcher considers that no other conclusion may be drawn despite certain terms of the agreement and actions of the parties which Lord\u2019s points to as inconsistent with an express trust, such as failure to provide for creation of a separate fund for deposit of proceeds of sales; failure to denominate the lease a \u201ctrust agreement\u201d; and failure to use the terms \u201ctrustee\u201d or \u201cbeneficiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The Trustee appellee asks why did the parties not provide for a separate bank account with the protective features commonly associated therewith; that the parties contemplated these funds would be commingled as they were over a period of years, and that merely denominating them \u201ctrust funds\u201d was insufficient to create a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Cutter-Karcher argues that the obligation assumed in the agreement by Lord\u2019s to repay by the 15th of each month the proceeds of Cutter-Karcher\u2019s sales of the previous month (less certain authorized deductions) even though such sales were made in Lord\u2019s name and recorded at Lord\u2019s expense, with Lord\u2019s guarantee of credit or charge sales, did not operate to create a mere debtor-creditor relationship, nor to destroy the trust character of the sales proceeds in Lord\u2019s hands. Cutter-Karcher asserts that in none of the cases on which the Referee and.the District Court rely were there any agreements with an express provision for a trust. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">In In Matter of Yeager Company (Mendel et al. v. Whitmer), 6 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 864, the facts were very much like those here except that there was no reference to a \u201ctrust\u201d in the lease. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>court refused to infer one. Reclamation of the fund resulting from sales of Mendel and Marshall merchandise commingled with Yeager funds was denied. Another generally similar factual set-up existed in In re Martin\u2019s, District Court, New York, 1935, 11 F.Supp. 99, and in Isaac McLean Sons Co. v. William S. Butler &amp; Co., District Court, Mass., 1913, 208 F. 730, except that there is no mention of an express trust in the quoted or described terms of the lease. In both cases, the court declined to find an. implied trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Thus in this case we have before us a set of circumstances similar to those in which courts have refused to imply a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Cutter-Karcher cites In re Steele-Smith Dry Goods Co., District Court, N.D.Ala.S.D., 1924, 298 F. 812, where under similar circumstances, the court did imply a trust and found a fiduciary rather than a debtor-creditor relationship as to funds traceable from sales in the leased department to the general bank account of the bankrupt lessor department store.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We have carefully weighed this case against the conflicting decisions and find the reasoning in the cases cited above to be more convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">If a trust cannot be implied, is the situation materially changed by the mere use of the term \u201ctrust\u201d in one article of a long agreement in which the parties are designated \u201cLessor\u201d and \u201cLessee ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aa2\">There is nothing magical in the word \u201ctrust\u201d standing alone.- As Bogert puts it in Trusts and Trustees, 2nd Ed. 1965, Vol. I, Ch. 3, \u00a7 45, p. 316:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">[T]he use of words of trusteeship is not conclusive as to the expression of an intent to have a trust, where incidents foreign to that relationship appear to have been contemplated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Another equally respectable authority, Scott on Trusts, 2nd Ed. 1956, Vol. I, \u00a7 24, p. 181, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">[T]he mere fact that these words are used does not necessarily indicate an intention to create a trust. The question in each case is whether the settlor manifested an intention to create the kind of relationship which to lawyers is known as a trust, whether the settlor manifested an intention to impose upon himself or upon a transferee of the property equitable duties to deal with the property for the benefit of another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">All sales here were made in the Lessor\u2019s name, all proceeds of such sales were immediately turned over to the Lessor with the understanding that they could be commingled with the Lessor\u2019s own funds. Not on demand, but on agreed dates, the Lessor paid a net amount (less certain agreed disbursements, returns, etc.) out of the Lessor\u2019s own general funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">From the time of its receipt until settlement date (at least 15 days) the Lessor had unrestricted use of the funds. A similar relationship in In re Martin\u2019s, supra, was held to be consistent with that of debtor and creditor and not that of fiduciary and beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">William Hahn and Company, <em>amicus curiae, </em>does not rely on the theory of an express trust. It argues that Lord\u2019s accepted a bailment of money which was not converted into a loan by the inability of the bailee to return-the identical currency deposited, in the absence of some subsequent agreement for such a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">The <em>amicus curiae </em>contends that lease-departments in department stores represent a growing contemporary trend; that the decision of the Referee and the District Court would impose a high and commercially unwarranted administrative and bookkeeping expense on lessor and lessee. As <em>amicus curiae </em>sees the situation here, Lord\u2019s sole function was to account for the funds and to restore them to Cutter-Karcher on the 15th day of each month. The cases cited in support of this argument seem to deal mainly with the question of whether a particular transaction was a bailment or a sale, which is not the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">A number of bailment-sale cases were also cited by Cutter-Karcher. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>these, In re Warner-Quinlan Co., 2 Cir., 1936, 86 F.2d 103, includes the following statement (at p. 104):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">If the proceeds were to be held in trust, the deposit of such trust funds in the appellee\u2019s general account would have been a breach of trust and, if appellant knew that this was appellee\u2019s practice, it would tend to show the real understanding between the parties. * * * This would contradict the provision that title to the proceeds of sale vested in the appellant; or, at best, this provision would have to be interpreted as an effort by appellant to obtain security for appellee\u2019s obligation, not as the creation of a trust relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The brief of the <em>amicus curiae </em>refers to avoidance of administrative and bookkeeping expense by allowing commingling of funds. In another place, in the affidavit in support of the brief, Mr. Gilbert Hahn speaks of the bargaining process between a department store and a prospective leased department operator. He says that a financially strong department store, where risk of financial failure is small, may resist a \u201ctrust\u201d clause because of its administrative and bookkeeping burdens, but that a financially weaker store may accept it as a suitable means of minimizing the lessee\u2019s risks in the event of the lessor\u2019s bankruptcy. Mr. Hahn feels it is unfair to deprive the lessee in such cases of the protection for which he has contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Nevertheless, it appears that in the case before us, a \u201ctrust\u201d clause has been inserted into a document which otherwise sets up a simple debtor-creditor relationship in an effort to assure the debtor\u2019s performance of its obligation and not to create a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The parties to a department store-leased department agreement may establish a fiduciary relationship as they did in U. S. National Bank v. Blauner\u2019s Affiliated Stores, Inc., 3 Cir., 1935, 75 F.2d 826, where the contract provided for the funds collected to be kept in a separate account for the lessee. The parties have not done that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">We have considered all other points and authorities to which Cutter-Karcher and the <em>amicus curiae </em>have invited our attention, but we find them lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">The orders of the Referee and the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b511-14\">SWYGERT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aou-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">If I understand the majority opinion correctly, this court is holding that if the circumstances do not permit a trust to be implied, those same circumstances will not create a trust even though the parties have additionally agreed to the creation of an express trust. To my mind this is an illogical proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">Here, we are asked to enforce an express trust. There is no need to imply one. Paragraph sixteen of the agreement explicitly and unambiguously shows an intent to establish a trust relationship. Even though the trust is mentioned in only one of several paragraphs of the agreement, the terms contained in the other paragraphs are consistent with the explicit provision that amounts received by Lord\u2019s on account of sales in the department leased to Cutter-Karcher should be held in trust for Cutter-Karcher. Other portions of the agreement provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that sales in the department were to be made by Cutter-Karcher\u2019s employees ; that the merchandise was to be purchased by Cutter-Karcher on its credit and that it retained the right to remove its stock and any of its other chattels in the event Lord\u2019s breached the agreement. Further, all of the incidental supplies used in the department were to be furnished by Cutter-Karcher. Casualty insurance on all merchandise, workmen\u2019s compensation Insurance, public liability insurance, and any taxes and licenses were to be paid by Cutter-Kar-cher. Thus, the entire operation of the leased department was under the control and at the expense of Cutter-Karcher. All sales receipts, however, were to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>turned over to Lord\u2019s which was obligated to keep a true and accurate account thereof. Lord\u2019s paid Cutter-Karcher\u2019s employees from these moneys, but only after Cutter-Karcher\u2019s submission of its payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">This method of operation enabled Lord\u2019s to simplify its bookkeeping system and to retain the twelve per cent of Cutter-Karcher\u2019s net sales agreed upon as the cost of leasing the department store space. The balance of Cutter-Kar-cher\u2019s receipts held by Lord\u2019s was to be remitted periodically to Cutter-Karcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In re Kline, 7 F.Supp. 850 (W.D.Pa.1934), aff\u2019d sub nom., United States Nat\u2019l Bank v. Blauner\u2019s Affiliated Stores, 75 F.2d 826 (3rd Cir. 1935), concerned the collection of funds by the receiver and the trustee in bankruptcy during their operation of the bankrupt\u2019s business. Although it is not entirely clear, it appears that the funds may have been deposited in a physically separate account. The district court stated that by the agreements under which the claimants occupied space in Kline\u2019s department store, Kline was merely the trustee in the collection of the moneys due from credit sales by the leased departments. \u201cThe agreements so plainly state, and provide for a separate account of these items of money collected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The majority here, referring to In re Kline, says: \u201cThe parties to a department store-leased department agreement may establish a fiduciary relationship * * * where the contract provide [s] for the funds collected to be kept in a separate account for the lessee. The parties have not done that here.\u201d True, the agreement did not require Lord\u2019s to maintain a separate bank account for funds belonging to Cutter-Karcher. But if the majority places its reliance upon the absence of a provision for the physical separation of the trust funds, such reliance is misplaced. Commingling of funds by a trustee does not of itself destroy an express trust. In re Warner-Quinlan Co., 86 F.2d 103 (2d Cir. 1936); Southern Cotton Oil Co. v. Elliotte, 218 F. 567 (6th Cir. 1914); In re Steele-Smith Dry Goods Co., 298 F. 812 (N.D.Ala.1924). Section 179, comment (f), of the Restatement of Trusts, 2nd, reads: \u201cBy the terms of the trust the trustee may be permitted to mingle trust property with his own property. It may be expressly so provided by the terms of the trust or the character of the trust may be such as to make this proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">On the other hand, the majority may have attached significance to a supposed failure of the parties to provide a separate accounting procedure for the trust funds. But the Cutter-Karcher-Lord\u2019s agreement specifically provides for such procedure. Paragraph ten reads in part: \u201cThe Lessor agrees to keep a true and correct account of all moneys received, growing out of the Lessee\u2019s sales, including an account with respect to the Lessee\u2019s credit or charge sales, also an account of all moneys disbursed on the Lessee\u2019s authorization, and exhibit said records to the Lessee or its representatives upon reasonable request to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKrL\">I would reverse the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
