None of the four attacks has any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">First, venue in the Middle District of Florida was obviously correct under F.R.Crim.P. 18 prescribing that \u201cprosecution shall be had in a district in which the offense was committed. * * *and under the \u201cgeneral rule that where the crime charged is a failure to do a legally required act, the place fixed for performance fixes the situs of the crime.\u201d Johnston v. United States, 1956, 351 U.S. 215, 220, 76 S.Ct. 739, 742, 100 L.Ed. 1097, 1101-1102; United States v. Commerford, 2 Cir., 1933, 64 F.2d 28, 32-33, cert. denied, 289 U.S. 759, 53 S.Ct. 792, 77 L.Ed. 1502; Evans v. United States, 5 Cir., 1965, 349 F.2d 653, 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Second, under the circumstances of this record, there was compliance with 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3109 which prescribes that \u201cthe officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house * * to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance * * *.\u201d In executing the warrant, the Government Agent announced himself by knocking on the door, identified himself as a Federal Agent armed with a warrant and demanded admittance. He heard movements within and smelled smoke and, apprehending that the occupants were attempting to destroy incriminating evidence (confirmed immediately upon entry) , ordered his fellow officers to break open the door, enter the premises, and arrest the appellants. Bypassing the Government\u2019s first response that \u00a7 3109 may not afford a basis for suppression (see Barrientes v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 116, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 879, 77 S.Ct. 102, 1 L.Ed.2d 80), the actions were entirely reasonable and satisfied \u00a7 3109. See McClure v. United States, 9 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 19, cert. denied, 1965, 380 U.S, 945, 85 S.Ct. 1027, 13 L.Ed.2d 963; Masiello v. United States, 1963, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 57, 317 F.2d 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Third, Appellant Blackburn\u2019s belated registration and payment of the gambling tax on March 31, 1964, was ineffectual to erase the charged, and proved, violations occurring between March 1 and March 24, 1964. Under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4901, registration for and payment of the gambling tax is a \u201ccondition precedent to carrying on\u201d the business of accepting wagers. The tax imposed \u201cmust be paid before engaging in the business of wagering.\u201d Lewis v. United States, 1955, 348 U.S. 419, 422, 75 S.Ct. 415, 417, 99 L.Ed. 475, 479; Marderosian v. United States, 1 Cir., 1964, 337 F.2d 759, 760, cert. denied, 1965, 380 U.S. 971, 85 S.Ct. 1328, 14 L.Ed.2d 268. Consequently, no help comes from Farmer v. United States, 10 Cir., 1942, 128 F.2d 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Fourth, this record was quite sufficient for the jury to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellants knew of the obligation to register for and pay the gambling tax and willfully failed to do so. Edwards v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 334 F.2d 360 (en banc), cert. denied, 1965, 379 U.S. 1000, 85 S.Ct. 721, 13 L.Ed.2d 702; Ingram v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 672, 79 S.Ct. 1314, 3 L.Ed.2d 1503.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
