BRYAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AGv\">Our first opinion in this case, NLRB v. Schapiro &amp; Whitehouse, Inc., 353 F.2d 513 (4 Cir., 1965) related in detail the facts incident to the contest of the union\u2019s election as the bargaining representative of Schapiro\u2019s employees. Since our request the Board has opened the 3 sealed ballots and reports them as against the union. Thus the tally stands at 89 for and 88 against the union. In consequence we now decide Schapiro\u2019s threefold attack upon the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">1. The Finkelstein ballot, presumably still unopened and a \u201cNo\u201d vote, was challenged by the union on the ground that he was a supervisor. The Regional Director deemed unnecessary a determination of whether Finkelstein was a supervisor, but recommended rejection of the ballot on the ground that \u201che did not have sufficient community of interest with the other employees to warrant his inclusion in the unit\u201d previously designated for bargaining representation. The Board followed the Regional Director\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">It was a \u201cconsent election\u201d upon a stipulation signed by the union and the employer, and approved by the Board\u2019s agent and its Regional Director. \u201cEligible voters\u201d and \u201cThe Appropriate Collective Bargaining Unit\u201d were by agreement limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">\u201cAll production and maintenance employees, including truckdrivers at the Employer\u2019s Baltimore, Maryland, plant; but excluding office clerical employees, watchmen, guards and supervisors as defined in the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amg-dedup-0\">Pursuant to the further provisions of the agreement \u201can accurate list of all the eligible voters, together with a list of the employees, if any, specifically excluded from eligibility\u201d was furnished the Board by the parties. The list was approved by the union\u2019s representative as evidenced by his signature thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">...Finkelstein was listed among the qualified voters. Aware before the election of his employment status, the union\u2019s deliberate abstention from any question of his inclusion in the representation unit, we think, barred its challenge of him after the election. The point is trenchantly made by Judge Wisdom in Shoreline Enterprises of America, Inc. v. NLRB, 262 F.2d 933, 943 (5 Cir. 1959) in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">\u201cThe basic policy \u2014 we endorse it\u2014 is that a company and a union must be held to their agreements, as any other party is held to an agreement. In cases involving a pre-election resolution of eligibility issues between a company and union it is especially important to hold the parties to their contract. To permit either to repudiate a pre-election agreement and redetermine the eligible members of a bargaining unit, <em>after </em>an election has been held, would enfeeble the consent election procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-14\"> Of course, the Board has the duty and power to supervise an election. The Board cannot delegate or abdicate this prerogative by or through an agreement between labor and management. Shoreline Enterprises of America, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, 262 F.2d 933, 943 (5 Cir. 1959). Nevertheless, this responsibility does not entitle the Board to abrogate an employer-union agreement unless, of course, the agreement impairs the opportunity of any eligible unit members to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">In NLRB v. Joclin Manufacturing Company, 314 F.2d 627, 633 (2 Cir. 1963), the Regional Director allowed two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>employees to vote who were not within the bargaining unit as defined by an employer-union agreement. There was no specific list of eligibles. The stipulation was that \u201coffice, clerical and professional employees, guards and supervisors\u201d should be disqualified to vote. Nevertheless the Regional Director permitted \u201cplant clericals\u201d to vote, on the basis that the agreement excluded only office cleri-cals. The Court overruled the Board in its approval of the Director\u2019s ruling, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFD\">\u201cThere may, of course be situations where the agreement reached between company and union as to the appropriate bargaining unit should not be enforced by the Board because it improperly disenfranchises employees, see Shoreline Enterprises of America, Inc. v. N.L.R.B. supra, 262 F.2d at 944-946; but nothing would indicate this to be such a case, and in any event it is the agreement on which the Board is relying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Our position finds reinforcement in NLRB v. J. J. Collins\u2019 Sons, Inc., 332 F.2d 523, 525 (7 Cir. 1964), Judge Castle saying for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cIt is conceded that the Board\u2019s exercise of \u2018informed discretion\u2019 in defining an appropriate bargaining unit is not to be upset unless the evidence compels a conclusion that it has acted arbitrarily, or from bias, or prejudice. But unlike in the cases cited, the bargaining unit here involved was defined and its limits circumscribed by stipulation of the company and the Union. And the Board\u2019s exercise of discretion was restricted by the Board to its approval of the unit as submitted by the parties. The factor of \u2018community of interest\u2019 and other elements of To-porek\u2019s duties might well have formed a rational basis for having included the job in the unit under some descriptive designation identifying it. But the Board did not do so. It did not so exercise the discretion it may have had in such connection. And, considerations applicable when the Board makes its own independent determination defining the appropriate bargaining unit do not control here where it is merely interpreting the language used by the parties to define and limit the unit in a stipulation for a consent election. The primary question here is what the parties intended. N.L.R.B. v. Joclin Manufacturing Company, 2 Cir., 314 F.2d 627, 633-634.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1x\">Not only was the disqualification of Finkelstein rested by the Board on a premise \u2014 lack of sufficient community of interest with the unit \u2014 -foreclosed by the agreement, but the union did not even challenge on that score. The idea was solely the Regional Director\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">The Board would dilute the stipulation with the argument that the \u201cparties did not enter into a written and signed agreement which expressly provided that the resolution of eligibility issues therein should be final and binding\u201d. The effort is futile. On a form prescribed by the Board, the stipulation didactically spells out who may vote, requires them to be named individually and exacts prior verification of the list by the opposing parties. A declaration of eligibility more conclusive is scarely conceivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">2. The \u201cerasure ballot\u201d was rejected by the Board for ambiguity in its marking. We think it should have been polled as registering the balloter\u2019s intention to say \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">The pertinent part of the finding of the Examiner as to this ballot is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">\u201cExamination of the original ballot reflects that the <em>marking in the \u2018no\u2019 box is more distinct than the marking in the \u2018yes\u2019 box </em>and there is an <em>indication of a possible attempt at erasure of the marking in the \u2018yes\u2019 box. </em>The Board Agent conducting the election first ruled this ballot \u2018Void\u2019, and after some discussion with the parties of the possible attempt at erasure, changed his rulings and declared it to be a \u2018no\u2019 vote. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The Board Agent then challenged the ballot and recorded it as such in the Tally of Ballots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">\u201cThe undersigned has carefully examined the ballot in question and, in his opinion, the intent of the voter is not clear; accordingly, it is recommended that the challenge to this ballot be sustained and that it be declared a \u2018Void\u2019 ballot.\u201d (Accent added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">This description is helpfully amplified in the Board\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201cThe voter did not place a mark in either the \u2018yes\u2019 or the \u2018no\u2019 square but rather, made his marks outside the squares of the two boxes. An \u2018X\u2019 was placed just outside the \u2018yes\u2019 square and a more distinct \u2018X\u2019 was placed outside the \u2018no\u2019 square.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">We are as advantageously positioned as was the Board to read this ballot. 4 Davis, Administrative Law, at 241. It is not a question of the weight of evidence; the substantial-evidence rule of testing the acceptability of a Board finding does not prevail. We may and must without any such restriction construe the ballot. Celanese Corporation v. NLRB, 291 F.2d 224, 226 (7 Cir. 1961), cert. den. 368 U.S. 925, 82 S.Ct. 360, 7 L.Ed.2d 189. A strikingly similar situation in NLRB v. Whitinsville Spinning Ring Co., 199 F.2d 585, 589 (1 Cir. 1952) illustrates the courts\u2019 untrammeled discretion in construing such a ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The erasure ballot has since been so covered with a strip of scotch tape as to obscure the markings. Specifically, the adhesive runs across the \u201cNo\u201d and over the erasure of \u201cYes\u201d, including any tell-tale traces of erasure. Removal of the tape would probably further efface these clues. Whether the tape was applied before or after the Board\u2019s examination of the ballot is not clear. Thus we can never know its minute but significant features, so vital to its validity and to the election. This diminution in the record is enough to set aside the Board\u2019s decision of the outcome at the polls. S. D. Warren Co. v. NLRB, 342 F.2d 814, 816 (1 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">With Finkelstein\u2019s ballot unopened, the count is now tied, 89 to 89, which, as we noted in the first opinion, would mean that the union had lost for want of a majority. The count, however, cannot be final until Finkelstein\u2019s ballot is opened. Should Finkelstein\u2019s preference be anti-union, as is reasonably suspected, the defeat would be more pronounced, 90 to 89. If he voted pro, the union would win the count. However, rather than delay further final determination by awaiting the casting of Finkelstein\u2019s ballot, we pass to the propriety of the pre-election literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">3. Campaign literature distributed by the union on two occasions shortly before the election was so irrelevant and so highly inflammatory, employer Schapiro asserts, as to invalidate the election. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">The union\u2019s appeal to the voters urged the employees to consider and act upon race as a factor in the election. In its brief the Board fairly and completely describes each incident and its background. Thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">\u201cOn August 2,1963, about 4 weeks before the election, the Union circulated a leaflet among the Company\u2019s employees, practically all of whom are Negroes (J.A. 57). The leaflet, entitled \u2018THEY CAN\u2019T FIRE EVERYBODY\u2019, listed the names of several employees who had recently been discharged (J.A. 57, 62). It stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-15\">\u2018IF YOU ARE GOING TO LET THIS SCARE YOU INTO GIVING UP, THEN YOU\u2019VE LOST AND THE COMPANY HAS WON. REMEMBER THIS, THE PEOPLE AT CAMBRIDGE DIDN\u2019T GET SCARED NOR DID THEY GIVE UP BECAUSE THEIR FRIENDS WERE ARRESTED. INSTEAD, THE DEMONSTRATIONS GREW BIGGER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>THIS IS THE POSITION THAT YOU MUST TAKE. SHOW THIS COMPANY THAT YOU\u2019RE NOT GOING TO BACKUP. OVER THE YEARS, YOU HAVE BEEN HELD DOWN. \u2014 LET US HELP YOU TO GET UP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">NOTE: WE HAVE FILED AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN DISCHARGED. STICK WITH THESE PEOPLE, - THEY - ARE - DEPENDING ON YOU.\u2019 (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201cOn August 23, a week before the election, the Union circulated another leaflet. This leaflet reproduced a newspaper article, under the headline \u2018Young Gives Top Priority to Negroes\u2019 Job Security,\u2019 which stated that Ernest D. Young, a Negro member of the Maryland House of Delegates, had criticized Negro leaders for demonstration for \u2018social\u2019 rights they wanted and overlooking \u2018the real Negro problem of unfair employment practices\u2019 (J.A. 57, 63). The leaflet contained the the following message:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">READ THIS! And thank God that we have such a man in office. Delegate Ernest D. Young knows the importance of jobs. Right now we are trying to help you on your job. You can help by voting, \u2014\u2018YES\u2019 on Aug. 30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The second leaflet was headed with a picture of the Negro Delegate mentioned in the circular. Advertence to \u201cCambridge\u201d was an allusion to recent racial strife there.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">This type of propaganda is deplorable. It cannot be ignored on the assumption that it had no effect upon the voters, most of whom are Negroes. Not long ago we set aside an election because of misrepresentations in campaign dodgers. NLRB v. Bonnie Enterprises, Inc., 341 F.2d 712 (4 Cir. 1965). Although quite different in nature, the instant throwaways equally offend the electoral process and likewise vitiate the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">As the Board itself noted in Sewell Manufacturing Co., 138 NLRB 66, 71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-12\">\u201cWhat we have said indicates our belief <em>that appeals to racial prejudice on matters unrelated to the election issues or to the union\u2019s activities are not mere \u2018prattle\u2019 or puffing. They have no place in Board electoral campaigns. </em>They inject an element which is destructive of the very purpose of an election. They create conditions which make impossible a sober, informed exercise of the franchise. The Board does not intend to tolerate as \u2018electoral propaganda\u2019 appeals or arguments which can have no purpose except to inflame the racial feelings of voters in the election.\u201d (Accent added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">We approve these standards. Equality of race in privilege or economic opportunity was not presently an issue. That a majority of the employees were Negroes did not make it so. For the union to call upon racial pride or prejudice in the contest could \u201chave no purpose except to inflame the racial feelings of voters in the election\u201d. Besides their utter irrelevance, the leaflets appear to this court as highly inflammatory, especially the reference to the \u201cCambridge\u201d incidents. The reliance upon race inhibited a \u201csober, informed exercise of the franchise\u201d and was altogether out of place.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">As our canvass of the Finkelstein and erasure ballots apparently leads to a majority against unionization, the designation of the union as the representative of Schapiro\u2019s employees cannot stand. The same result follows from our ruling on the campaign literature. Consequently, the employer was warranted in refusing to bargain with the union and the contrary finding and order of the National Labor Relations Board is without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">Enforcement of order denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
