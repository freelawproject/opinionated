App. \u00a7 34(f)) ? (See Appendix A at 359-360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-18\">The three actions under review were filed in the District Court in May and July of 1964 and seek to set aside the dismissal by the Attorney General of appellants\u2019 debt claims based upon their deposits of yen in the American branches of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. Except for the claimant internees or parolees in No. 19,283, appellants are several thousand Americans of Japanese ancestry who, residing in the United States, had, prior to December 7, 1941, made deposits in the American branches of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. The property in the United States of this Japanese bank was vested as Japanese Enemy Property under the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1 et seq. After liquidation by state superintendents of banks, there remained approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>mately $17 million, which was turned over to the Office of Alien Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Congress, on August 8, 1946, enacted section 34 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, which authorized the Alien Property Custodian<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to pay from the proceeds of vested property the debts of former owners of the vested' property that were due and owing on the vesting date. Congress excluded from the benefits of this statute, among others, individuals and their successors who had been interned or paroled as potentially dangerous alien enemies under the Alien Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Acting under section 34(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, the Alien Property Custodian fixed November 18, 1949, as the final date for filing debt claims with the Custodian against the funds of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. Approximately ten thousand debt claims were timely filed, of which some seven thousand, five hundred were based on yen deposits. Appellants in the present cases all filed claims in the amount of their deposits during this period. The aggregate of the claims exceeded the seized assets of the bank, necessitating a processing of the claims under section 34 (f) of the Act relating to insolvent debtors\u2019 estates. Claims of persons who had been interned or paroled under the Alien Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 21) were dismissed because of the express provision of section 34(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act (see Appendix A at 359), which excluded such persons from the status of eligible debt claimants. This action constituted the final disposition under the Act of the claims of the appellants in case number 19,283.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Extensive hearings before an Examiner were conducted, and ultimately, in 1957, the Alien Property Custodian ruled that the claims were allowable at the post-war rate of exchange of 361.55 yen to the dollar under the \u201cJudgment Day\u201d rule of Die Deutsche Bank v. Humphrey, 272 U.S. 517, 47 S.Ct. 166, 71 L.Ed. 383 (1926), since the deposits were payable in yen in Japan. Thereafter, identical registered letters were sent to all eligible claimants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> numbering some seven thous- and, five hundred, stating that their claim could be allowed at the 361.55 rate and requesting that the claimants\u2019 original yen certificates be submitted to the Office of the Alien Property Custodian. This letter was received by all appellants represented in cases number 19,282 and 19,284. The claims of appellants in case number 19,283 had been rejected initially, as heretofore indicated, and they were not recipients of the letter. A copy of the registered letter appears in Appendix B of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Some further summation of the contents of the letter received by the claimants is essential to a consideration of the contentions of appellants in the <em>Honda </em>(No. 19,284) and <em>Kondo </em>(No. 19,282) cases. The letter, in addition to the provisions set forth above, informed these appellants that they might, if they wished, file a statement of their objections to the application of the 361.55, or post-war, rate of exchange. The letter informed claimants that if their original certificates were not submitted within the designated period, or if an explanation of why the certificates could not be submitted was not timely submitted, the claim would be dismissed as having been abandoned. The letter also set forth that a schedule of claimants would be drawn up from the names of persons submitting their original deposit certificates or explanations. Included in the letter was the statement that \u201c[wjithin sixty days after the issue of the schedule any aggrieved claimant may file in the District Court of the United States for the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>trict of Columbia a complaint for review of such schedule, naming the Attorney General as defendant. If no complaint for review is filed, payments will be made in accordance with the schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Thereafter, one thousand, eight hundred seventeen deposit claims against the Yokohama Specie Bank, for which either original certificates of deposit or satisfactory evidence of loss had been submitted, were allowed at the rate of 361.55 yen to the dollar. Carrying out the provision of section 34(f) of the Act (see Appendix A at 359-360, the Alien Property Custodian prepared and served by registered mail on all claimants <em>(id est, </em>allowed and dismissed claims and including claimants in cases 19,282, 19,283 and 19,284) a Final Schedule of all debt claims allowed and the proposed payment to each claimant. Claimants whose claims had been dismissed, including appellants in the <em>Okamoto </em>case (No. 19,283) were not listed on the Final Schedule. Included with the notice transmitting the Final Schedule to each claimant was the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cPursuant to Section 34(f) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, any claimant considering himself aggrieved by this Final Schedule may, within sixty (60) days from the date of the mailing of the Schedule, file in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of this Schedule, naming the Attorney General as defendant. A copy of such complaint must be served on the Attorney General and on each claimant named in the Schedule. If no such complaint for review is filed within the sixty-day period, payments to claimants will be made by this Office as specified in the Final Schedule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">A timely complaint for review of the award was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1961 asserting that the claims should have been allowed by the Custodian at the pre-war dollar rate of exchange for yen. This action (Abe v. Kennedy, C.A. 2529-61) was pursued in behalf of all Yokohama Specie Bank yen deposit claimants whose claims had been allowed on the Final Schedule. Proceedings in the <em>Abe </em>case were postponed, however, pending the outcome of a companion case, Aratani v. Kennedy, C.A. 3164-58, which had been filed in 1958 and which related to the yen deposit claims which had been asserted against vested funds of the Sumitomo Bank, Ltd. The chronology and disposition of this case are set forth in the court\u2019s opinion published in 115 U.S.App.D.C. at page 97 and in 317 F.2d at page 161. The opinion affirming summary judgment in favor of the Government certainly invited certiorari, and on October 21, 1963, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, 375 U.S. 877, 84 S.Ct. 147, 11 L.Ed.2d 110. Before disposition by the Supreme Court, however, the Attorney General settled the Sumitomo Bank, Ltd. case on an exchange rate much more favorable to the claimants and simultaneously, or virtually so, settled the yen deposit claims on the Final Schedule of the Yokohama Bank case at a rate approximating a net return to the claimants of 49 per cent of the amount claimed. The settlements were approved in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on May 18, 1964,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 228 F.Supp. 706. After payment of the settlement sums, about $10 million remains in the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. account in the Office of Alien Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Against this background, the identity of the appellants in our present cases comes into sharper focus. In the <em>Kondo </em>(No. 19,282) and <em>Honda </em>(No. 19,284) cases, we have before us several thousand depositors in the Yokohama Specie Bank who, although recipients of the notices heretofore described as issuing from the Alien Property Custodian, declined or failed to file their original deposit certificates with the Custodian. Whatever reasons may have prompted or caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>this action, these depositors were not listed on the Final Schedule for payment, were not represented in the court action entitled Abe v. Kennedy, <em>supra, </em>and were not included in the settlement effectuated by the District Court approval of May 18, 1964. By actions filed in the District Court in the <em>Honda </em>case on May 19, 1964, and in the <em>Kondo </em>case on July 9,1964, these appellants sought to compel the Attorney General to pay to them on their deposits in the Yokohama Specie Bank a pro rata amount from the funds remaining in the Bank\u2019s vested account upon the same basis as was paid to the claimants in the <em>Abe </em>case. Similarly, in the <em>Okamoto </em>case, No. 19,283, in a complaint filed in the District Court on July 6, 1964, appellants, as depositors in the Yokohama Specie Bank whose claims were disallowed on the ground that they had been interned and paroled as alien enemies, seek a like portion of the remaining vested funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The District Court, on March 31,1965, dismissed all three actions on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the actions because they were not commenced within the time set forth in section 34(f) of the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 34(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Appellants in the <em>Kondo </em>and <em>Honda </em>cases contend that the District Court should have invoked equitable estoppel against the 60-day limitation period; that estoppel is applicable to suits arising under the Trading with the Enemy Act; that the sovereign immunity doctrine contains nothing warranting an implied exemption for the Government from the estoppel principle of Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, 359 U.S. 231, 79 S.Ct. 760, 3 L.Ed.2d 770 (1959); and exemption from the <em>Glus </em>estoppel doctrine creates a constitutional issue under the just compensation provisions of the Fifth Amendment. We treat first the presentation of these appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Basing their first argument on a chronological treatment of the events transpiring between December 7, 1941 and March 31, 1965, these appellants argue that the 1958 letter of the Custodian to each claimant was a \u201cdiscouragement\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d to the claimants, who had waited 17 years for the money seized by the vesting procedure. Concluding that the text of this letter was confusing, insulting and arbitrary, appellants argue that they were not told why their original certificates surrender was being demanded and why only two per cent of their deposits were being refunded, with a resulting inference that a surrender of the original certificate would constitute acquiescence in the two per cent formula and a waiver of further rights of the claimants. Appellants argue that their original certificates constituted their sole tangible remaining evidence of a claim, and because of illiteracy, language difficulties and other similar reasons they were reluctant to take any step which might either result in a loss of their claim or require them to accept a two per cent award. Accordingly, say this group, they awaited the outcome of the Abe v. Kennedy case \u201creasonably anticipa [ting] that if the two per cent formula which had long been in administrative litigation in <em>Abe </em>were reversed in the court all Yokohama Bank depositors who had filed timely claims under the act which the Government had recognized as valid would be similarly compensated.\u201d Appellants conclude that their refusal to file their original deposit certificates and that their failure to sue or join in a suit while <em>Abe </em>was in litigation was \u201cexcusable delay\u201d in view of their reasonable reliance upon the Government to treat them equally with claimants in the <em>Abe </em>case, especially since no prejudice accrued to the Government between 1961 and 1964 as a result of these appellants\u2019 inactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">In answer, the appellee points out that these actions arising under the Trading with the Enemy Act are suits against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Government. All conditions of the sovereign\u2019s consent to be sued must be complied with, and the failure to satisfy any such condition is fatal to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Since the provision of section 34(f) of the Act creates a 60-day limitation upon the period in which a depositor may establish his status as a claimant or take other action, failure to meet this condition constitutes a fatal failure to meet a prescribed condition precedent to the maintenance of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">There is no doubt that this action is a suit against the United States. Banco Mexicano v. Deutsche Bank, 263 U.S. 591, 602-603, 44 S.Ct. 209, 68 L.Ed. 465 (1924); Codray v. Brownell, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 112, 207 F.2d 610 (1953), cert. denied 347 U.S. 903, 74 S.Ct. 428, 98 L.Ed. 1063 (1954). It is equally as well established that failure to satisfy the conditions of the United States\u2019 sovereign consent to be sued is fatal to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Brownell v. Morizo Nakashima, 243 F.2d 787 (9th Cir.), cert. denied 355 U.S. 872, 78 S.Ct. 117, 2 L.Ed.2d 77 (1957); Cisatlantic Corp. v. Brownell, 131 F.Supp. 406 (S.D.N.Y.1953), aff\u2019d 222 F.2d 957 (2d Cir. 1955); Von Clemm v. Smith, 204 F.Supp. 110 (S.D.N.Y. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The 1958 letter attacked by appellants is set forth in the appendix of this opinion. (See Appendix B.) The appellee explains the necessity for requiring that the depositors submit their original certificates of deposit by pointing out that the certificates were redeemable to the holder by the banks in Japan, and in numerous cases had been so redeemed, and existence of the original certificates in the claimants\u2019 hands was essential to the establishment of an unsatisfied debtor status and in order to avoid double payment. The letter followed in meticulous detail and with painstaking care the requirements of the statute in notifying each of the thousands of depositors, not only of the Custodian\u2019s proposal but of the depositors\u2019 rights to file objections to the proposal and to initiate court action if they so desired. As heretofore set forth, the 60-day statutory limitation was set forth specifically and accurately. We question that the Custodian could more completely have outlined the significance of the proposal, creation and status of the forthcoming Final Schedule of Allowed Claims and the rights of the appellants under the statute. To characterize this letter as insulting requires an emotional approach unwarranted by the letter. That it was discouraging to its recipients is obvious. Those recipients were told, however, of the action which they could take if they desired. In some instances, their attorneys were also informed. Their failure to act cannot, we feel, be attributed to any misrepresentation, either affirmatively or negatively, by the appellee. Whatever may have prompted the appellant\u2019s action, or lack of action, we conclude it was not any misleading act or inaction on the part of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Appellants\u2019 contention that estoppel is applicable to suits arising under the Trading with the Enemy Act faces immediately our holding that \u201cestoppel cannot be used against the Federal Government\u201d in Legerlotz v. Rogers, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 266 F.2d 457, 459 n. 5 (1959), cert. dismissed 362 U.S. 938, 80 S.Ct. 803, 4 L.Ed.2d 768 (1960). That case also involved a suit for the return of vested property under the Act involved in the present case. Similar holdings may be found in Anderegg v. United States, 171 F.2d 127 (4th Cir. 1948), cert. denied 336 U.S. 967, 69 S.Ct. 937, 93 L.Ed. 1118 (1949); Wallace v. United, States, 142 F.2d 240 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 323 U.S. 712, 65 S.Ct. 37, 89 L.Ed. 573 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Next, these appellants reason that Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, <em>supra, </em>contains nothing warranting the conclusion that the appellee is excepted from the estoppel principle enunciated therein. We observe, first, that the Government was not a party in the <em>Glus </em>case. Secondly, the <em>Glus </em>opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ion is based upon an affirmative claim that the respondent had made a misrepresentation to the petitioner, thereby misleading him into a course of non-action. Utilizing the basic concept that no man may take advantage of his own wrong, the Supreme Court reversed in order to permit the petitioner to show whether he could, in fact, make out a case calling for the application of the doctrine of estoppel. The <em>Glus </em>case, however, does not pretend to announce any new or extended doctrine. Mr. Justice Black quotes in <em>Glus, </em>with approval, a statement of basic principle from Insurance Company v. Wilkinson, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 222, 233, 20 L.Ed. 617 (1871) wherein Mr. Justice Miller said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201cThe principle is that where one party has by his representations or his conduct induced the other party to a transaction to give him an advantage which it would be against equity and good conscience for him to assert, he would not in a court of justice be permitted to avail himself of that advantage. And although the cases to which this principle is to be applied are not as well defined as could be wished, the general doctrine is well understood and is applied by courts of law as well as equity where the technical advantage thus obtained is set up and relied on to defeat the ends of justice or establish a dishonest claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We do not believe that the factual record before us permits a conclusion that the appellee \u201cby his representations or his conduct induced\u201d the appellants to give appellee any advantage. This being so, the question of whether the doctrine of estoppel restated in <em>Glus </em>is operative against the Government, or more specifically against this appellee, does not enter this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Insofar as appellants attempt to relate the estoppel principle of the <em>Glus </em>case, we refer back to the discussion of this factor in section III of this opinion and conclude that the record does not support appellants\u2019 contention on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Approaching their difficulties from the constitutional viewpoint, these appellants argue that the Fifth Amendment, in providing for due process, precludes the Government from any arbitrary or unreasonable intrusion upon private rights and requires that the Government be held to the highest standards of fairness and reasonableness, and they cite Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 351 U.S. 115, 76 S.Ct. 663, 100 L.Ed. 1003 (1956); Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616 (1950); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958), in support of this principle. Continuing, appellants charge that appellee\u2019s action with reference to their deposits in the Yokohama Bank constitutes a Government seizure of private property without judicial process. Citing Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, 254 U.S. 554, 566, 41 S.Ct. 214, 65 L.Ed. 403 (1921), the argument continues that the qualification of the alien property seizure therein is valid only \u201cif adequate provision is made for a return in case of mistake\u201d establishes a standard of \u201cadequate provision,\u201d which because of the application of the 60-day limitation clause has not been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The appellee denies in rather general terms the existence of a constitutional issue in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The record supports the appellee\u2019s argument that the property taken and vested by the Custodian was the property of the Yokohama Specie Bank and not the property of the appellants. That deposits in banks become property of the bank and create a debtor-creditor relationship between bank and depositor is universally recognized. See <em>e. g., </em>Anderson National Bank v. Luckett, 321 U.S. 233, 64 S.Ct. 599, 88 L.Ed. 692 (1944); Killoren v. First National Bank, 127 F.2d 537, 541 (C.C.A.8th Cir. 1942); Cicero State Bank v. Crowley, 115 F.2d 1022 (C.C.A.7th Cir. 1940). It follows that the property of the appellants \u2014 that is, the debt to them of the Yokohama Specie Bank- \u2014 still belongs to appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>and has never been seized by the Custodian. The existence of this property in the control and possession of the appellants is further emphasized by the fact, heretofore pointed out, that each appellant may recover in Japan from the Yokohama Specie Bank on the basis of his original deposit certificate, albeit at a rate of exchange not pleasing or acceptable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The constitutional question may be viewed from another viewpoint. Appellants are creditors of a wartime enemy commercial enterprise. The American-based assets were legally vested by valid Act of Congress. Thereafter, as a matter of grace, Congress, by enacting section 34 of the Act, conferred upon certain creditors of enemy enterprises a means of attempting to recover upon their claims from those assets of the debtor which were held by the Custodian. The action did not, however, create a constitutional right in the creditors to recover. The practical effect of section 34 is to provide a means of pro rata distribution of vested funds among those claimant-creditors who are able under the statute to establish their right to this recovery. Certainly, the creditors have not acquired by section 34 of the Act a property right in vested funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We conclude that the appellants have not been deprived of any constitutional right by the appellee in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">YII</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Turning now to the <em>Okamoto </em>case, we recall that this group of appellants are the depositors in the Yokohama Specie Bank whose claims were rejected by the appellee because these people had been interned and paroled and were, consequently, barred by the statute from recovery of their deposits. It is argued on behalf of these appellants that the Government, to their detriment, is taking an inconsistent and consequently illegal position by first claiming the Trading with the Enemy Act created no rights for appellants and \u201cdoes not apply to them,\u201d in permitting the processing of their deposit claims, but later claiming that the Act\u2019s 60-day limitation clause does apply to appellants when they seek through the courts to press their suit. On this basis, these appellants, relying on Interstate Commerce Comm. v. United States ex rel. Humboldt Steamship Co., 224 U.S. 474, 32 S.Ct. 556, 56 L.Ed. 849 (1912), argue that the courts have authority in this case by mandamus to compel the Custodian to accept the claims of appellants and to proceed to the merits of their claim. In advancing this argument, the appellants emphasize the distinction between the exercise of an agency\u2019s discretionary power and a denial of power from a misunderstanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Our review of the <em>Humboldt Steamship Co. </em>case establishes a vital distinction from the situation that confronts us here. In <em>Humboldt, </em>the Interstate Commerce Commission \u201crefused to proceed at all, though the law required it to do so,\u201d 224 U.S. at 485, 32 S.Ct. at 559. Here, the Custodian exercised jurisdiction initially over these appellants\u2019 claims. The claims were reviewed and dismissed on the ground of ineligibility of the claimants under the provisions of the Act. Jurisdiction was exercised, and it was adverse to appellants. Under these circumstances, proceedings in the nature of mandamus will not lie. But, say these appellants, mandamus will lie where \u201c * * * the erroneous decision cannot be reviewed on appeal or writ of error,\u201d citing United States ex rel. Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., 246 U.S. 638, 643, 38 S.Ct. 408, 409, 62 L.Ed. 914 (1918). Unfortunately for this approach, we have in the present case statutory provision for review of the Custodian\u2019s action in rejecting the claims of these appellants. Section 34(f) of the Act provides a remedy which is an exclusive one and one which the claimants failed to utilize, although complaint for review was brought by a similary situated depositor in another vested Japanese bank case.

Again, the short \u2014 and we think obvious \u2014 answer to this argument is that if the appellants desired to contest the constitutionality of the eligibility provisions of section 34(a) of the Act, they could, and should, have filed a timely complaint for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We conclude upon the entire record in all three eases that the District Court acted correctly in dismissing these cases on March 31, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The unique and unfortunate circumstances which have deprived these appellants of their deposits in the Yokohama Specie Bank command sympathetic consideration of their problem. Arguments made to the court were broadly spiced with a strong emotional appeal. Appellants\u2019 sincere counsel valiantly attempted under the label of \u201cequitable considerations\u201d to lead the court to abandon established legal principles and upon purely humane grounds return to the appellants the funds which represented their savings on December 7, 1941. Benevolence is a noble virtue, but it cannot be a foundation for legal opinions, regardless of the need of the litigant or the strictly emotional appeal of his plight. It is not for the courts to turn their backs upon legal principles, precepts and established law in order to accomplish an end which is suggested by a desire to accomplish a humane objective. To do so would immediately constitute the creation of a program of judicial legislation in complete disregard of our constitutional limitations and separation of powers. Obviously, Congress, enacting into law the will of the people, must write our country\u2019s laws. The dangers of wartime, the military and economic problems of the early 1940\u2019s, are far behind us. Perhaps now the necessities that required the enactment of the Trading with the Enemy Act have so far passed into history that Congress may wish to reconsider the status of these appellants and another disposition of their claims. It is not for the court to suggest to Congress what it should or should not do. We suggest only that the relief sought by these appellants lies solely in legislative hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Section 34 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 60 Stat. 925 (1946), 50 U.S.C.

The claim is based upon yen certificates of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The Director of this Office decided on November 13, 1957, In the Matter of Kunio Abe'et al., Claim No. 55507, Docket No. 55 D 72, which decision the Attorney General has declined to review, that yen certificates of deposit issued by the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd., and the Sumitomo Bank, Ltd. are obligations payable in yen in Japan, and that claims based on such certificates of deposit are to be allowed and paid in United States currency at the post war rate of exchange in accordance with the \u201cJudgment Day\u201d rule set forth in Die Deutsche Bank v. Humphrey, 272 U.S. 517 [47 S.Ct. 166, 71 L.Ed. 383] (1926). Thus, the current rate of exchange of 361.55 yen to one dollar must be used in converting the yen into a dollar amount. Interest is allowable from the date of deposit to the date of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Therefore, if you submit your original certificates of deposit to this Office, I can recommend your claim for allowance in the sum of $9.09 plus interest. If you have lost your certificates, you should prepare a statement setting out that the deposits were made as alleged in the Notice of Claim form, giving the numbers of the certificates, the dates of the deposits, and the branch of the Bank at which the certificates were purchased. You should also state that you have not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>received payment from the Bank or accepted renewed certificates of deposit. This statement should be signed and sworn to by you before a Notary Public and forwarded to this Office in support of your claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">(J.A. 7)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Payment of your claim, however, will not be made immediately. Under the procedures set forth in section 34(f) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 34(f)); it is necessary that all of the approximately 9000 claims filed against the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. be reviewed and a schedule issued showing the proposed payments before any payments can be made. Within sixty days after the issuance of the schedule, any aggrieved claimant may file in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of such schedule, naming the Attorney General as defendant. If no complaint for review is filed, payments will be made in accordance with the schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Advice received by this Office is to the effect that yen certificate of deposit accounts are carried on the books of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. in Japan, and the funds may be withdrawn in that country or transferred to the Bank of Tokyo, Ltd. Under the circumstances, you may wish to utilize the funds in Japan rather than await settlement by this Office. If this is done, the Notice of Claim filed with this Office should be canceled by signing and mailing the enclosed Notice of Cancellation of Claim card.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">If, however, you wish to maintain your claim with this Office you are requested to submit the original certificates of deposit or the notarized statement as to why they cannot be forwarded. In the event you object to the allowance of your claim in the amount stated above, you should submit the certificates to this Office within the next forty-five days and file a statement specifying your objections, together with the reasons in support thereof. Upon receipt of your objections, if I consider them to be without merit, I shall apply to the Director of this Office, pursuant to section 502.25(1) of the Rules of Procedure for Claims, a copy of which is enclosed, for the entry of an Order allowing your claim in the principal amount stated above, plus interest, and dismissing any portion over and above that amount on the ground that there is no debt due and owing to you by the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. in excess of that amount. In acting upon my application, the Director will consider the statement of objections that you may have submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">(J.A. 8)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">On the other hand, if within the next forty-five days you do not submit the original certificates of deposit or a statement explaining why they cannot be forwarded, I shall conclude that the claim has been abandoned in its entirety and, without further notice to you, shall apply to the Director for the entry of an Order dismissing the claim on the ground of abandonment, pursuant to section 502.-25(g) and (i) of the Rules of Procedure for Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">To recapitulate:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">1. If you wish to maintain your claim with this Office, you should within forty-five days forward the original certificates of deposit and, if you wish to do so, file a statement of your objections to the allowance of the claim in the amount stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">2. If you wish to maintain your claim but do not have the original certificates of deposit, you should within forty-five days submit a statement, signed and sworn to before a Notary Public, giving the details of the deposits and stating that you have not received payment or renewed certificates. If you wish to do so, you may also file a statement of your objections to the allowance of the claim, in the amount stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">3. I shall then apply to the Director for an Order allowing your claim in the principal amount stated above, plus interest, and dismissing any portion over and above that amount. Where objections have been filed, they will be sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>mitted to the Director for his consideration in acting upon your claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">4. If, within forty-five days, you do not submit the original certificates of deposit or an explanation as to why you cannot forward them, I shall conclude that the claim has been abandoned and shall apply to the Director for an Order dismissing the claim on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">5. If you prefer to utilize the funds in Japan, you should sign and mail the enclosed Notice of Cancellation of Claim card in order to clear the records of this Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">(J.A. 9)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Please note that the original certificates must be submitted; photostatic copies cannot be substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Sincerely yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Arthur R.

SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A7v\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">I agree with the court that these cases command sympathetic consideration for these many thousands of Japanese-American appellants. Respectfully, I dissent from the court\u2019s conclusion that we are powerless to provide relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">Appellants were depositors of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd. when the bank\u2019s property in the United States was seized on Pearl Harbor Day and vested as enemy property under the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>40 Stat. 411. On August 8,1946, Congress enacted \u00a7 34 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 60 Stat. 925, which authorized the Alien Property Custodian to pay from the vested proceeds the claims of former owners who were citizens or residents of the United States during World War II and who had not been interned or paroled as potentially dangerous alien enemies. Pursuant to \u00a7 34(b) of the Act, the Custodian fixed November 18, 1949, as the final date for filing claims against the Yokohama Bank. Appellants in <em>Honda, </em>No. 19,284, <em>Kondo, </em>No. 19,282, and <em>Okamoto, </em>No. 19,283, all filed timely claims. The Government refused to recognize the claims of appellants in <em>Okamoto </em>on the ground they were ineligible under the statute because they had been interned and paroled. This ruling was correct and disposes of that case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-22\">The claims of appellants in <em>Honda </em>and <em>Kondo </em>were recognized by the Custodian, however, to the extent that toward the end of 1958 they were sent letters as eligible claimants, instructing them to send in their original certificates of deposit or equivalent proof and informing them that if proper proof were submitted a recommendation would be made that their claims be allowed at the post-war rate of exchange, which amounted to approximately <em>2% </em>of the pre-war rate. Appellants were further advised that any claim not timely submitted would be dismissed as abandoned. Appellants failed to comply with the requirements of the 1958 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-23\">Around September 1961 the Custodian prepared and sent by registered mail to all claimants a Final Schedule of all Yokohama Bank depositor claims allowed and the proposed payment in each case. A Notice was included advising that \u201c[i]f your claim is not shown on the Schedule, it is for the reason that the claim has been dismissed and disallowed by this Office\u201d; that any claimant considering himself aggrieved \u201cmay, within sixty (60) days\u201d file for judicial review; and that \u201c[i]f no such complaint for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>view is filed within the sixty-day period, payments to claimants will be made\u201d in accordance with the Schedule. Appellants did not file for judicial review within 60 days of the letter, as required by \u00a7 34(f) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In Abe (pronounced \u201cAh-bey\u201d) v. Kennedy, a timely complaint, demanding payment at the pre-war rate, was filed in the District Court on behalf of all Yokohama Bank claimants who had complied with the Custodian\u2019s 1958 letter. Proceedings in <em>Abe </em>were stayed pending the outcome of Aratani v. Kennedy, which involved the same issue with depositors of a different Japanese bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss in <em>Aratani, </em>this court affirmed, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 317 F.2d 161, 323 F.2d 427, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari, 375 U.S. 877, 84 S.Ct. 147, 11 L.Ed.2d 110 (1963). The Government then entered into a settlement with complainants in <em>Aratani </em>and <em>Abe, </em>which was referred to the District Court by the Supreme Court, 376 U.S. 936, 84 S.Ct. 790, 11 L.Ed.2d 657 (1964), and approved in 1964, D.D.C., 228 F.Supp. 706. The <em>Abe </em>settlement was for well over 60% of the amount claimed, and in fact came to approximately 100% of the original deposits without interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 petition to be included in the settlement was denied by the Government on the ground that they were not parties to the litigation being compromised. They then brought these actions. The District Court granted a Government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the complaints were filed long after the 60-day limitation period prescribed by the Act. This appeal challenges the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Appellants urge us, under the circumstances of this case, to estop the Government from asserting the 60-day statute of limitations. In addition to denying that any basis for estoppel is shown, the Government advances two arguments which would bar consideration of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">The Government argues first that estoppel cannot be applied against it. It may be true that estoppel does not lie against the United States where its officers or agents, without authority, enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit. <em>E. g., </em>Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947); United States v. Stewart, 311 U.S. 60, 70, 61 S.Ct. 102, 85 L.Ed. 40 (1940). Compare Maguire &amp; Zimet, Hobson\u2019s Choice and Similar Practices in Federal Taxation, 48 Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1299 (1935). But when the conduct relied upon as the basis for estoppel is authorized, estoppel has often been applied against the Government by a number of courts, including this one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, admittedly, the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>who communicated with appellants and who formulated the policy which resulted in the 1958 offer and the 1963 settlement all acted within their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The Government\u2019s second argument, that the 60-day limitation period for judicial review provided in the Act is \u201csubstantive\u201d rather than \u201cprocedural\u201d and therefore cannot be extended, is likewise unfounded. The suggestion seems to be that, since the limitation provision is included in the same Act which creates the right, the passage of time itself extinguishes the right. The Supreme Court rejected this argument in ruling that es-toppel may prevent a private party from pleading the \u201csubstantive\u201d limitation period of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern Terminal, 359 U.S. 231, 79 S.Ct. 760, 3 L.Ed.2d 770 (1959). See also United States for Use of E. E. Black Limited v. Price-McNe-mar Construction Co., 9 Cir., 320 F.2d 663 (1963) (estoppel applied in favor of the Government in Miller Act case despite \u201csubstantive\u201d statute of limitations) . More recently, also in tolling the FELA limitation period, the Supreme Court said: \u201c[T]he \u2018substantive\u2019-\u2018procedural\u2019 distinction would seem to be of little help in deciding questions of extending the limitation period.\u201d Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., 380 U.S. 424, 427 n. 2, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 1054, 13 L.Ed.2d 941 (1965). \u201c[T]he basic inquiry is whether congressional purpose is effectuated by tolling the statute of limitations in given circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 85 S.Ct. at 1054. Of course, Congress can make a limitation period inflexible, but in order to do so it must do more than merely place the limitation and the right in the same statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In deciding that the limitation period in FELA was not inflexible the Supreme Court, in <em>Burnett, </em>examined \u201cthe purposes and policies underlying the limitation provision, the Act itself, and the remedial scheme developed for the enforcement of the rights given by the Act.\u201d 380 U.S. at 427, 85 S.Ct. at 1054. These cases meet the test of <em>Burnett. </em>There are no problems of notice or proof. Appellants\u2019 claims, which the Government concedes are valid, were timely filed with the Custodian before 1949. The \u201cAct itself\u201d is remedial and humane. It was passed at the Custodian\u2019s urgent request, in part for the benefit of the Government, and was designed to return to rightful creditors on an equitable basis, rather than according to a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d rule, assets kept out of enemy hands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both Congress and the Custodian recognized the strong moral obligation owed to rightful creditors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Certainly any application of equitable principle permissible under FELA, which is designed purely to benefit employees, is permissible here, where the Government also benefited, and where a strong moral obligation was recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Moreover, there is nothing in the Act\u2019s \u201cremedial scheme\u201d which indicates congressional intent to limit or preclude equitable extension of the limitation period. Section 34(f) does set out the 60-day requirement, but this only poses the issue rather than answers it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither does \u00a7 34(i), which provides that the sole relief for vested property claimants shall be that provided in the Act, indicate congressional intention to make the limitation period inflexible. This provision was designed only to prevent independent suits for recovery of property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Speed in resolving all claims was a matter of importance to Congress, but only as it related to the general purpose of effectuating an equitable distribution. Thus \u00a7 34(b) ordered the Custodian to fix \u201cbar dates\u201d within which debt claims could be filed, no later than two years from the date of vesting or of enactment. This enabled the Custodian to determine at one time which claimants were eligible, and to distribute each account equitably. Appellants complied with this fundamental requirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The 60-day limitation with which they failed to comply can hardly be said to constitute a fundamental and inflexible part of the Act\u2019s remedial scheme.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">Reiterating the old aphorism \u2014 \u201cThe failure to satisfy the conditions of the sovereign\u2019s consent to be sued is fatal to the court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d \u2014 the Government argues, however, that equitable principles may not be used to vary the literal terms of the sovereign\u2019s consent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>But neither reason nor authority is advanced to show why the approach taken in <em>Glus </em>and <em>Burnett </em>in determining whether a \u201csubstantive\u201d limitation period is inflexible should not apply in suits against the Government. In fact, <em>Burnett </em>cited with approval<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Osbourne v. United States, 2 Cir., 164 F.2d 767 (1947), which involved claims against the Government under the Suits in Admiralty Act and against a private employer under the Jones Act. The court in <em>Os-bourne </em>tolled the \u201csubstantive\u201d limitation periods of both statutes without discussing any possible difference between them. If equitable principles may be applied to extend the limitation period for a claim against the Government which would have to be satisfied from the federal treasury, as in <em>Osbourne, </em>no reason appears why such principles should not be applicable in suits against the United States where the claims are to be satisfied only from vested funds of the Yokohama Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The Government\u2019s opposition on the merits to the plea of estoppel is predicated on a rigid and mechanical approach to that doctrine. Estoppel is a \u201csimple and wholly untechnical conception, perhaps the most powerful and flexible instrument to be found in any system of court jurisprudence.\u201d Statement of Sir Frederick Pollock, quoted in Canada and Dominion Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Canadian National Steamships, Ltd., [1947] A.C. 46, 55. It should be neither rigidly circumscribed nor mechanically applied<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This does not mean courts are free to apply estoppel indiscriminately. The fundamental requirements \u2014 a representation, reliance, change of position, detriment\u2014 must be met.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But once these elements are present, the novelty of a particular case should not deter courts from using the device to do justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">The facts of this case reveal a combination of circumstances and procedures which have operated to bring about a potential injustice of substantial proportion. Appellants all filed timely claims. They could have obtained the post-war ratio for their deposits at any time at the Yokohama Bank in Japan. They did not. Rather, they held on to their certificates of deposit, hoping their own government, applying the beneficent provision of the Act, would treat them more fairly. But in 1958, after waiting 12 years to cash their deposit certificates, the Custodian informed them their recovery would be limited to the post-war ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Many of the appellants undoubtedly could not understand the Custodian\u2019s technical letter. But even if we assume they could, it seems certain the letter discouraged them from filing their certificates. The ratio offered rendered their small deposits almost completely worthless. A $500 creditor suddenly found he might be entitled to $10. Moreover, the letter pointed out- that \u201c[p]ayment of your claim, however, will not be made immediately,\u201d because it remained necessary to compile a Final Schedule (which took approximately three years). The letter then advised, however, that claimants could receive the same rate in Japan without going through as much trouble: \u201cUnder the circumstances, you may wish to utilize the funds in Japan rather than await settlement by this Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">The 1958 letter unquestionably contained an authorized representation of fact \u2014 that it was the Government\u2019s position that payment should be made at the post-war rate. This representation was relied upon by appellants when they failed to file their certificates, knowing full well they could get the same rate at any time in Japan. The Government knew reliance might follow, and encour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>aged such reliance by suggesting Japan as an alternate, speedier source of funds. That only 1,817 of about 7,500 eligible claimants complied with the letter is strong evidence of its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">It turns out, however, that the Government\u2019s position changed. When the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Aratani, </em>the Government settled the cases on a basis completely at variance with its original position. The power of the Government to take its 1958 position, and to change its position in 1963, is incon-testible. But the exercise of this power cannot become a means, whether intentional or inadvertent*<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> whereby innocent persons who acted in reliance upon the Government\u2019s first representation should be denied the opportunity to recoup moneys which Congress wanted returned. The pattern of events \u2014 the letter which discouraged filing of certificates because of the position taken therein, the failure of the vast majority of claimants to file certificates, the subsequent change of position and settlement, the exclusion of appellants from the benefits of the change of position \u2014 could hardly have been better designed to secure exclusion of most claimants from the relief Congress afforded them, and from the relief to which the Office of Alien Property now apparently agrees they were always entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We have here a remedial and humane piece of legislation designed to secure the equitable return of property to American citizens. The purposes of the limitation period have been satisfied, and nothing in the Act\u2019s remedial scheme limits or precludes equitable extension of the limitation period. The Yokohama Bank account, with over $10,000,000 in cash, has more than enough to pay appellants the same rate paid the claimants in <em>Abe. </em>Under these circumstances, the Government should not be permitted to assert the statute of limitations as a bar to the suit. Appellants should be allowed to take advantage of the Government\u2019s new position.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-19\">.

From the Supreme Court\u2019s oft-repeated formulation of the immunity from estoppel in terms of administrative action that \u2018the law does not sanction or permit,\u2019 it may bo inferred that government is bound by actions within the scope of the agent\u2019s authority. A steadily growing number of federal courts have properly so held, for the sole tenable argument for the immunity derives from separation of powers considerations which have no play where administrative action is <em>au-thorised </em>by Congress. In such case the government should be and is es-topped.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">In holding that estoppel cannot be applied against the Government, the majority ignores these authorities. The statement in Legerlotz v. Rogers, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 258 n. 5, 266 F.2d 457, 459 n. 5 (1959), relied on by the majority, that estoppel does not lie against the Government, is dictum and arose in a context which clearly precluded applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tion of the doctrine. The Attorney General had sent plaintiff a Notice of Intention to return a certain sum seized during the war, but later decided to retain a part of the sum involved. , Plaintiff, allegedly in reliance upon the Notice, failed to bring suit within the two years prescribed by statute. But the court pointed out that the statute specifically provided that a Notice of Intention conferred no right of action to compel the return of property; the provision\u2019s purpose was to leave the Attorney General with the power freely to change his mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\">. The Supreme Court held, in Markham v. Cabell, 326 U.S. 404, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945), that creditors or allies of enemies whose property had been seized by the Custodian during World War II may maintain suits against the Custodian on their debt claims under the Trading with the Enemy Act \u00a7 9(a), although that section appeared to apply only to World War I seizures. This resulted in a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d rule \u2014a race of creditors which exhausted properties without equitable distribution \u2014and in serious interference with the use of the property to the best interests of the United States. Congress acted promptly. Within one year, \u00a7 34 was passed at the Custodian\u2019s urgent recommendation, providing for the equitable distribution of vested property by disallowing independent suits and by setting up a procedure whereby all claims could be considered and disposed of together.

As pointed out <em>supra, </em>Note 4, passage of the present \u00a7 34 of the Act was generated by the Supreme Court ruling that creditors could sue, necessarily on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis, under \u00a7 9(a). The committee report makes clear that \u00a7 34 (i) was passed to preclude \u00a7 9(a) suits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">\u201cSection 35(i) [now 34(i)] is generally procedural in nature. It provides that the debt claim provisions of the bill shall constitute the sole relief of creditors, except for their right to sue the original debtor or any other person liable. It is expressly provided that debt claim suits heretofore filed under section 9(a) shall not be continued and only suits to review the Custodian\u2019s determination under the bill are maintainable with respect to debt claims. This is believed necessary to the effective operation of the debt claim provisions of the bill. * * * \u201d H.R.Rep.

It is upon non-compliance with the similarly fundamental requirement of \u00a7 33 of the Act that the cases cited by the Government are based. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brownell v.

The suppletive nature of the requirement makes it analogous to the 60-day reporting requirement in N. V. Philips\u2019 Gloei-lampenfabrieken v. Atomic Energy Comm., 114 U.S.App.D.C. 400, 316 F.2d 401 (1963). There, petitioners owned certain foreign patents which were divulged to the United States Government in connec- . tion with Project Manhattan and were widely used. The Patent Compensation Board rejected petitioners\u2019 claim for \u201cjust compensation\u201d on the ground that petitioners had failed to file a report describing the processes of their inventions within 60 days of the passage of the statute conferring a right to compensation. We looked to the purpose of the requirement and found, not a mechanical reporting process, but a means for assuring disclosure. It was conceded that the A.E.C. had the relevant information. We concluded: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, the Commission should not be allowed to seize upon this technicality to avoid a responsibility which the Congress recognized.\u201d 114 U.S.App.D.C. at 408, 316 F.2d at 409. Since in these cases the Custodian knew of appellants\u2019 claims and could include them in his computations in equitably distributing the Yokohama property, the failure to file for review in time did not interfere with the basic purpose of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. 380 U.S. at 427, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 13 L.Ed.2d 941.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">.
