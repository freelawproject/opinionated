Although plaintiff has no right to proceed under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, we suggest that the essence of the crime of burglary in Illinois is the breaking and entering with felonious intent. People v. Stanton, 16 Ill.2d 459, 158 N.E.2d 47. The value of the property actually stolen is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-26\">The Declaratory Judgment Act cannot be used as a substitute for appeal or habeas corpus, coram nobis or other such procedures. Forsythe v. State of Ohio, 6 Cir., 338 F.2d 678. It may not be used as a substitute for a petition to correct a sentence in the court where the sentence was imposed or as a substitute for habeas corpus in the district court where the alleged unlawful detention occurs. Clark v. Memolo, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 65, 174 F.2d 978. Olney v. State of Ohio, 6 Cir., 341 F.2d 913 and Christopher v. State of Iowa, 8 Cir., 324 F.2d 180, are in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">The order of the District Court sustaining defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
