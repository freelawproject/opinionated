Though the submission to the jury in tax evasion, cases, where the facts are often voluminous and complicated, of summaries of the evidence (in either narrative or tabular form) has often been approved, Ballantyne v. United States, 5 Cir., 1961, 293 F.2d 112, 116, rehearing denied, 294 F.2d 958, cert. denied, 1962, 369 U.S. 802, 82 S.Ct. 641, 7 L.Ed.2d 549; Conford v. United States, 10 Cir., 1964, 336 F.2d 285; Swallow v. United States, 10 Cir., 1962, 307 F.2d 81; Turner v. United States, 4 Cir., 1955, 222 F.2d 926, cert. denied, 350 U.S. 831, 76 S.Ct. 65, 100 L.Ed. 742; United States v. Kelley, 2 Cir., 1939, 105 F.2d 912; see 10 Mertens, Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 55A.22, at 142 (rev. ed. 1964), their preparation and use must be carefully handled by the trial Judge. Having carefully examined the complained of summary, the evidence it purports to cover, and the Court\u2019s instructions accompanying its submission to the jury, we find no impropriety in either the preparation or use here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Although the summary does not include all the evidence, or Appellant\u2019s theories of the evidence, it does not purport to. See Flemister v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 513. It does not contain anything not in the record, United States v. Ward, 3 Cir., 1948, 169 F.2d 460, and identifies in detail the evidence summarized, Lloyd v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d 9. Finally, in view of its contents and the Judge\u2019s instructions regarding its use, this summary did not usurp the province of the jury. Steele v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 222 F.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">All other contentions are devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
