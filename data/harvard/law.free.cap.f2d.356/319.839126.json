Albright v. Commissioner, 42 T.C. 643 (1964). We reverse on the ground that such payments were fully includable because they were wholly attributable to amounts contributed by the decedent to the cost of the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The decedent, Raymond W. Albright, was an executive of the Eastman Kodak Company when he died in February 1957 at the age of 62. Previously he had been employed by the B. F. Goodrich Company. In connection with each of these employments Mr. Albright, at the time of his death, was the prospective annuitant under a group annuity contract; and each contract constituted a \u201cqualified\u201d plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. The annuity contract arising out of the decedent\u2019s employment at Kodak had been issued by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The second contract arising out of the decedent\u2019s former employment at the B. F. Goodrich Company had been issued by the Aetna Life Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">The Metropolitan annuity contract and the Aetna annuity contract are, for the most part, similar in terms so far as their terms are relevant here. According to each contract Mr. Albright would begin to receive a life annuity on March 1, 1959 if he lived until then. Each annuity contract was financed by yearly contributions of Albright and his respective employer. At the time of his death Albright had paid $5,349 toward the cost of the Metropolitan contract, and Kodak had paid $81,316.34; he had contributed $2,909.19 toward the cost of the Aetna contract and the Goodrich Company had contributed $2,292.52. The Metropolitan contract provided that if Albright died prior to the date of the first annuity payment Metropolitan was to pay the named beneficiary a lump sum equal to the contributions Albright personally had made. As Mrs. Albright was the named beneficiary on the Metropolitan contract she received upon her husband\u2019s death a lump sum payment of $5,349 from Metropolitan. This sum exactly equalled her husband\u2019s contributions toward the cost of the contract. The terms setting forth the liability of the Aetna Life Insurance Company if Al-bright died prior to the date of the first annuity payment are more complicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Albright was the beneficiary on the Aetna contract, clear that she received a lump sum payment of $4,728.40 upon her husband\u2019s death, and clear that this payment from Aetna consisted entirely of the contributions made by the decedent to the cost of the contract together with interest thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The respondents, the duly qualified executors of the estate of Raymond W. Albright, included only $330.14 of the amount paid to Mrs. Albright under the Metropolitan contract and $2,644.45 of the amount paid to Mrs. Albright under the Aetna contract in the decedent\u2019s gross estate for purposes of computing the federal estate tax due. The Commissioner did not accept this and determined that the entire amounts received under these contracts were includable in the decedent\u2019s gross estate. The Tax Court overruled the Commissioner\u2019s determination, and held that there was no deficiency in federal estate tax due from the estate of Albright. The present petition to review this Tax Court decision was then filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The single issue before us is whether the respondents correctly excluded from the decedent\u2019s estate a proportionate part of the lump sum payments received by the decedent\u2019s beneficiary under the retirement annuity contracts, when these payments simply represented a refund of the decedent\u2019s contributions toward the cost of the contracts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We begin our resolution of this issue by examining Section 2033 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code. Section 2033 states that, \u201c[t]he value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death.\u201d The annuity contract issued by Metropolitan clearly states that up to the time of Albright\u2019s death he could terminate his rights under the contract and could receive a refund of the amounts he had paid in toward the cost of the contract. Similarly, during his lifetime he could surrender the annuity contract issued by Aetna and could receive back a sum equal to the total premiums he had paid plus interest thereon. Thus, if Section 2033 of the Code applies, both lump sum payments are includable in their entirety in the decedent\u2019s gross estate because up to the time of the annuitant\u2019s death he could have surrendered the contracts and recovered the amounts he had paid in.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The Estate argues, however, that Section 2039 of the Internal Revenue Code qualifies in part the broad inclusionary rule imposed in Section 2033 and that under Section 2039 it is clear that only a proportionate part of the lump sum payments received by Mrs. Albright need be included in her deceased husband\u2019s gross estate. We now turn to Section 2039 to learn whether it authorizes the exclusions from the gross estate that the executors made.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Prior to 1954 there was no provision in the Code dealing specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>with the estate tax consequences of annuities. See Bittker, Federal Income, Estate &amp; Gift Taxation, 1232 (3d ed. 1965). Lump sum payments similar to those received here by Mrs. Albright would have been includable in the decedent\u2019s gross estate only if they fell within the terms of one of the general estate tax provisions of the Code, such as the pre-1954 analogue of Section 2033. So, in order to regulate more specifically the estate tax consequences of various types of annuities Section 2039 was enacted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In essence Section 2039 provides for two dissimilar types of treatment depending upon whether the annuity contract in question satisfies the requirements for privileged treatment contained in one of several other sections of the Code. Section 2039(a) states that the decedent's gross estate includes the value of an \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d (other than life insurance) receivable by a beneficiary who survives the decedent if, under the contract or agreement, the \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d was payable to the decedent, or he possessed a right to receive it, either alone or in conjunction with another, for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death, or for any period which did not in fact end before his death. Section 2039(b) goes on to provide that only that part of the value of the \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d that is proportionate to that part of the total purchase price the decedent contributed is includable, but that any contribution by an-employer toward the purchase price shall be attributed to the decedent-employee if made by reason of his employment. Section 2039(c), which is set out in pertinent part in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> then proceeds to accord special treatment to, <em>inter alia, </em>an \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d received by a beneficiary under a qualified employee\u2019s retirement annuity contract. Section 2039(c) (2) first provides that such payments are excludable; it then promptly limits this provision by stating that, if the payments are to any extent attributable to contributions of the decedent, that proportion of the total payment received which equals the proportion of the decedent\u2019s contributions to the total contributions made is <em>not </em>excludable. It should be noted that subsection (c), unlike subsections (a) and (b), states that the employer\u2019s contributions are not to be attributed to the employee. The statutory design is clear: If employer and employee both contribute to the purchase price of a qualified retirement annuity contract and, after the employee\u2019s death prior to the effective annuity date, a designated beneficiary receives a payment that is attributable to the contributions made by both the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ployer and the employee, only a proportionate part of the total payment so received is includable in the employee\u2019s gross estate, and the includable proportion is computed with reference to the apportionment formula set out in Section 2039(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The position of the Albright estate is quite simply that the lump sum payments received by Mrs. Albright are \u201cother payments\u201d within the meaning of Section 2039(c) because they were received under qualified annuity contracts, and, as these payments are attributable to contributions made by the decedent, the apportionment formula of Section 2039(c) requires that only a proportion of the payments be included in the decedent\u2019s gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Commissioner first contends that the lump sum payments are not \u201cother payments\u201d within Section 2039(c) and thus are includable under Section 2033. According to the Commissioner, the language \u201cannuity or other payment\u201d means \u201cannuity or other payment similar to an annuity,\u201d and he contends that since the lump sum payments received by Mrs. Albright have none of the hallmarks of an annuity they cannot pass this definitional test.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we view this case, however, we need not decide this issue, for we hold that even if the payments received by Mrs. Albright are \u201cother payments\u201d within Section 2039(c) they are nevertheless includable in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> We should, of course, construe Section 2039(c) in a way that is consistent with the history and the spirit of federal estate tax legislation. We believe we best comply with this requirement if we hold that when Congress enacted Section 2039 it intended to continue the preexisting rules that frequently required the inclusion in a decedent\u2019s gross estate of payments received by the decedent\u2019s beneficiary under an annuity contract if the payments were attributable to the decedent\u2019s contributions to the cost of the contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> True, the applicable legislative history does not affirmatively establish that this was the intent of Congress; but neither does it contain any indication that Congress intended to deviate from the pre-1954 rules that frequently required the inclusion of such payments, and this silence suggests to us that Congress intended no such change. This view of Section 2039 (c) means that the apportionment formula contained therein is <em>only </em>applicable in situations in which the decedent\u2019s beneficiary receives a payment that is attributable to the contributions of both employer and employee. In such a situation the purpose of apportionment would be to insure that only the proportionate part of this payment that reflects the proportion the decedent-employee\u2019s contributions bore to the contributions of both employee and employer, was included. In the present case, however, the payments received by Mrs. Albright were solely attributable to the decedent\u2019s contributions to the two contracts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, the apportionment formula set out in Section 2039(c) is inapplicable, and as the payments Mrs. Albright received would have been fully includable under pre-1954 Code law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> they are fully includable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-11\">.
