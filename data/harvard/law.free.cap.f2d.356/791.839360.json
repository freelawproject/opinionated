And the presence of counsel for the indigent at arraignment is now assured by the Plan for Furnishing Representation for Indigent Defendants in Criminal and Quasi-Criminal Cases, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, which was not in effect at the time of appellants\u2019 arraignment:</p>\n<p id=\"A0c\">\n<em>Arraignment Without Counsel.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">If the defendant appears for arraignment without counsel, the Judge will refer the defendant\u2019s name to the Coordinator for a preliminary determination of financial ability to obtain an adequate defense and for submission of attorneys\u2019 names for appointment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
