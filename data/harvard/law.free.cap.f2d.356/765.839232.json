There are approximately one hundred employees. The discharged employee, Helen Allwood, began her employment at Banner in September, 1955 and at the time of her termination stood sixth in seniority. Her duties were confined primarily to packing cookies on a production line although she was knowledgeable of other operations and had on occasions served as forelady.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-20\">After Union organizational efforts during the spring of 1963, a certification election was held on May l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Allwood actively supported the Union (with Banner\u2019s knowledge) and during the preelection campaign offered her home for Union meetings. At the election she served as Union observer and challenged the eligibility of three or four individuals requesting ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-21\">The Union lost the election. The day after, Banner Vice President and General Manager Anderson urged that \u201ceveryone go back, to work and let bygones be bygones.\u201d Employees and supervisors alike were warned that discrimination among employees and inquiries of how anyone voted would not be tolerated. This same morning Anderson observed Allwood crying, and after efforts to comfort her was advised that \u201cit wasn\u2019t losing the election but the fact that she thought she was doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>what people wanted her to do and that they had turned on her.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Five months later on September 30, 1963, Allwood was discharged. Banner cited some ten deeds of misconduct creating friction and hostility among the employees, including insubordination and disrespect to superiors; usurpation of authority and arbitrary instructions to fellow workers; creation of an atmosphere of distrust, fear and suspicion by simulated gossip and whispering creating the feeling that a particular employee was the object of derogatory and derisive comments; excessive use of profanity; spreading false rumors about the Company\u2019s profit sharing plan; and making unauthorized and forbidden changes in production apparatus. Because of All-wood\u2019s continuous backbiting and bickering, three good employees, unable to cope with such conditions, quit their jobs; production decreased; and the feeling of a close relationship between employer and employee, so necessary for successful operations, was lost. Banner, in similar fashion, reported the disappearance of the above mentioned conditions soon after Allwood\u2019s separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The Union attributed Allwood\u2019s discharge to her Union interest and activity of the previous May and accused Banner of \u201cbusily compiling\u201d a \u201cdossier\u201d giving respectability to their sinister motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Banner\u2019s position that the Examiner\u2019s findings are not. supported by substantial evidence necessitates our review of the record in its entirety. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(f); Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); N. L. R. B. v. Fruin-Colnon Const. Co., 330 F.2d 885 (8th Cir. 1964); N. L. R. B. v. South Rambler Co., 324 F.2d 447 (8th Cir. 1963); Osceola County Co-Op. Creamery Ass\u2019n v. N. L. R. B., 251 F.2d 62, 63-64 (8th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">At the outset, our attention is called to the Examiner\u2019s \u201chostile\u201d attitude towards the Company\u2019s case as expressed in his \u201ccynical, contemptuous and scornful view of the employer\u2019s sworn testimony.\u201d We would not he\u00e1itate to reverse upon a clear conviction of bias and hostility but the Examiner\u2019s language here, although somewhat disparaging, does not betray an attitude preventing a fair hearing and necessitating a remand. See A. O. Smith Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 343 F.2d 103 (7th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">An examiner may give credence and weight to the testimony of the general counsel\u2019s witnesses in preference to that of the employer. N. L. R. B. v. Morrison Cafeteria Co., 311 F.2d 534, 538 (8th Cir. 1963); N. L. R. B. v. Federal Dairy Co., 297 F.2d 487 (1st Cir. 1962); N. L. R. B. v. Local 815, Teamsters Union, 290 F.2d 99 (2nd Cir. 1961). But, a complete disregard for sworn testimony coupled with a tongue-in-cheek characterization of those utterances as \u201cregaled with * * * trivialities\u201d or its absence which \u201cspared [the Examiner and General Counsel] the denouement of [a] momentous situation\u201d depreciates the examiner\u2019s findings and obliges our close examination. A. O. Smith Corp. v. N. L. R. B., supra; N. L. R. B. v. Florida Citrus Canners Coop., 311 F.2d 541, 543 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\"><em>Section 8(a) (1) </em>\u2014 Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">The first \u00a7 8(a) (1) violation concerns a -conversation between Anderson and Allwood occurring about two days prior to the May 1 election.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Anderson indicated that he distinctly remembered asking Allwood to come to his office where they had a \u201cvery good heart to heart talk.\u201d In substance, Anderson \u201casked [Allwood] what she thought she gained by having a union in the plant * * * I [Anderson] went back into the history from the time she started, the trouble she had at home and all about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the way we worked together and what a good employee she had been and why she wanted to upset the apple cart now. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Anderson denied making any promises of special benefits for her withdrawal from Union activities nor did he threaten her with any reprisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Allwood\u2019s testimony verified Anderson\u2019s explanation of the substance of this conversation and additionally answered his inquiry of what she gained from the Union in expressing that she \u201cwanted * * * the work to be slowed down to where I thought I would be able to do it the rest of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The Trial Examiner found that Anderson\u2019s \u201cquestion under the circumstances tends to limit employees\u2019 freedom of choice and suggested an offer of benefit as a substitute for selecting the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Anderson\u2019s inquiry of \u201cwhat [Allwood] wanted\u201d cannot be construed as an offer of benefit or a limitation upon Allwood\u2019s freedom of choice when taken in context and answered by the immediate reply that she expected the work to be reduced. The inquiry was made of an honest employee knowledgeable of plant production and policies and obviously concerned for her welfare and betterment. A reasonable interpretation discloses the Union as the benefactor of Allwood\u2019s expectations and absolves Anderson of unlawfully soliciting support for Banner. Beaver Valley Canning Co. v. N. L. R. B., 332 F.2d 429 (8th Cir. 1964). There is simply no record evidence that this conversation contained coercive or restrictive insinuations. Lincoln Bearing Co. v. N. L. R. B., 311 F.2d 48 (6th Cir. 1962); accord: N. L. R. B. v. Byrds Mfg. Co., 324 F.2d 329, 332 (8th Cir. 1963); Marshfield Steel v. N. L. R. B., 324 F.2d 333, 335-336 (8th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">The second violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) involved an alleged conversation between Plant Superintendent McNiece and an employee, Marilyn Winfrey. According to Winfrey\u2019s testimony, the conversation took place in August of 1963 and that \u201c[Mr. McNiece] told me [Mrs. Winfrey] he heard the union man was in town and he asked me if I had seen him. I avoided him, I didn\u2019t want to answer him. He said did Deity [Mrs. Winfrey\u2019s husband] talk to him and I said yes. He said the best thing for you two [Mrs. Winfrey and her husband, Deity] would be to leave the union alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">This particular conversation was neither verified nor denied, nor in any way explored in either the direct or cross-examination of McNiece, who did emphatically deny any individual conversation with employees about the Union from at least election time until Allwood was discharged. In the words of the Examiner, this \u201cthreat tend[s] to interfere with employees\u2019 protected concerted activities and constitute [s] unlawful threat and interrogation as alleged. As Mrs. Winfrey sought to avoid the discussion, McNiece\u2019s statement was no mere expression of opinion without threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\"> We said in Beaver Valley Canning Co. v. N. L. R. B., supra, that \u201cisolated interrogation, free of coercive statements and absent resort to systematic intimidation, is not unlawful conduct per se.\u201d 332 F.2d at 433. The tenor of McNieee\u2019s expressions betray, at most, a general animus and hostility for Union sympathizers. It carries no threat or indication of coercion and represents attitude without action.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">As succinctly stated by the Fifth Circuit in N. L. R. B. v. McGahey, 233 F.2d 406, 410 (5th Cir. 1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-16\">\u201c * * * [Interrogation becomes unlawful when it is a part of the means by which the employer\u2019s hostility carries with it the purpose to retaliate against Union sympathizers and by threat of job or other reprisals, coerce them into a vote of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>tion which does not express their free will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Finding a \u201cthreat\u201d in McNiece\u2019s naked statement, communicated to a single employee, evidencing no course of present, past or future coercive conduct, and uttered three months after the certification election is unwarranted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(c); N.L.R.B. v. Council Mfg. Corp., 334 F.2d 161, 165 (8th Cir. 1964); N.L.R.B. v. Trumbull Asphalt, 327 F.2d 841, 844 (8th Cir. 1964); Beaver Valley Canning Co. v. N.L.R.B., supra; J. S. Dillon &amp; Sons Stores Co. v. N.L.R.B. 338 F.2d 395, 399-400 (10th Cir. 1964); accord: N.L.R.B. v. Byrds Mfg. Corp., supra; Marshfield Steel Co. v. N.L.R.B., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>Section 8(a) (8) </em>\u2014 Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">It would serve no worthwhile purpose to relate in detail Banner and the Board\u2019s conflicting explanations of All-wood\u2019s recalcitrant conduct. Nor is there reason to explore these incidents to develop a business justification or show the cumulative effect of Allwood\u2019s actions as unduly straining Banner\u2019s patience. Fort Smith Broadcasting Co. v. N.L.R.B., 341 F.2d 874 (8th Cir. 1965). Here, the Board has failed to establish that quantum of evidence necessary to demand justification. Banner had the unbridled right to discharge Allwood absent a showing of unlawful motive as \u201c[m]anagement can discharge for good cause, or bad cause, or no cause at all. It has, as the master of its own business affairs, complete freedom with but one specific definite qualification: it may not discharge when the real motivating purpose is to do that which Section 8(a) (3) forbids.\u201d NLRB v. McGahey, supra, 233 F.2d at 413; Steel Industries, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 325 F.2d 173, 176 (7th Cir. 1963). The burden is upon the Board to show by preponderance of the evidence that the unlawful motive was discriminatory and did, in fact, result in the discouragement of Union membership. American Ship Bldg. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 380 U.S. 300, 85 S.Ct. 955, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965); N.L.R.B. v. Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965); N.L.R.B. v. Council Mfg. Corp., supra; Iowa Beef Packers, Inc. v. N.L.R.B. 331 F.2d 176, 182 (8th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Justifiable ground for dismissal is no defense when it is but a pretext and not the moving cause. N. L. R. B. v. Solo Cup Co., 237 F.2d 521, 525 (8th Cir. 1956). Judge Matthes in N. L. R. B. v. South Rambler Co., 324 F.2d 447 (8th Cir. 1963) stated the principle applicable in assessing this pretext:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-11\">\u201cCertainly, an employer may hire and discharge at will, so long as his action is not based on opposition to union activities. * * * Furthermore, an employer\u2019s general hostility to unions, without more, does not supply an unlawful motive as to a specific discharge. * * * An inference that a discharge of an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ployee was motivated by his union activity must be based upon evidence, direct or circumstantial, not upon mere suspicion, * * * and the burden of proving an improper motive for discharge is upon the Board. (Citations omitted.)\u201d Id. at 449-450.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{10] The Board offers as \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d for its finding that Banner discharged Allwood for the ulterior motive of discouraging Union activity the uncorroborated testimony of two Banner employees, each testifying to a separate statement made to them by Anderson. First, on May 3, Anderson told Deity Winfrey that there would probably be hard core unionists at Banner and bickering at the plant. Anderson also expressed disappointment at Allwood\u2019s Union interest and allegedly stated that some changes might have to be made. The second statement occurred two months later in July when returning employee Margaret Hedrick testified that Anderson asked if she had heard of the Union difficulty and hoped that there would be no trouble from her. There is no record evidence of any Union activity at Banner after May 1, nor is there any evidence that Allwood espoused the Union cause after the election. With the bare exceptions of the two statements noted above, there is simply no showing by the Board of any unlawful motive, discrimination or resulting discouragement of Union membership. We cannot in good faith base a \u00a7 8(a) (3) violation on these meager statements which constitute at most mere suspicion. N. L. R. B. v. South Rambler Co, supra; N. L. R. B. v. Council Mfg. Co, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We conclude that the evidence on the whole fails to support either of the violations charged. The order of the Board is set aside and the cross-application for enforcement is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-13\">. 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-14\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3):</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">\u201c(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">\u201c(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;</p>\n<p id=\"b819-22\">\u201c(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b819-23\">. American Bakery and Confectionery Workers International Union, AFL-CIO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. Allwood\u2019s testimony concerning the incident included only the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">\u201cHe [Anderson] was very nice to me. He said, \u2018The election is over, now let\u2019s all go out there and work, work together and get along.\u2019 He was very nice to me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b820-16\">. Anderson testified that the conversation occurred prior to April.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\">. The Board\u2019s brief points out that All-wood\u2019s husband had been killed in an industrial accident and that she supported two children as a Banner employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">. The amended charge filed November 26, 1963 contained the first allegation of unlawful interrogation and threats of reprisals in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1). Specifically alleged were the Anderson-Allwood and McNiece-Winfrey incidents covered in this opinion. The original charge filed October 10, 1963 contained only a blanket allegation of interference, restraint and coercion by unlawfully terminating All-wood because of her involvement in Union and other protected activity. Banner contends that these are distinct, specific, unconnected violations so that the amended charge does not relate back to the date of the original charge. Under \u00a7 10(b) of the Act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(b)), confining unfair labor practices to those occurring within six months of the filing of the charge, the Anderson-Allwood conversation would be excluded as falling beyond the permissible six-month limit. E. g., Joanna Cotton Mills Co. v. N. L. R. B., 176 F.2d 749 (4th Cir. 1949). Because of our disposition of the case, we prefer to answer the \u00a7 8(a) (1) issues rather than develop this collateral procedural problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
