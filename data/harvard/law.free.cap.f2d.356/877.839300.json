We have jurisdiction. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a.) Appellant was convicted of illicit possession of marijuana, violating \u00a7 11530, Health and Safety Code of the State of California. Appellant denied that a conviction existed because of subsequent so-called \u201cex-pungement\u201d proceedings \u2014 California Penal Code, \u00a7 1203.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">We have already held that section does not wipe out the conviction or \u201cexpunge\u201d it for the purposes of \u00a7 241(a) (11) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Garcia-Gonzales v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 344 F.2d 804 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. den. 382 U.S. 840, 86 S.Ct. 88, 15 L.Ed.2d 81; Kelly v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 349 F.2d 473 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. den. 382 U.S. 932, 86 S.Ct. 326, 15 L.Ed.2d 344. We follow said cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">There was no error in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s conviction despite \u201cexpungement;\u201d no matter how illogic\u00e1l appellant thinks it may be. Congress was legislating with reference to an existing statute (\u00a7 11530, Calif. Health &amp; Safety Code), and not with respect to that state statute as it is partially modified by Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4. See discussion by Judge Duniway in Garcia-Gonzales v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">Judge Ely retains the view which he, dissenting, expressed in Kelly v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, supra, but he has authorized the statement that he, yielding to controlling precedent, concurs in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
