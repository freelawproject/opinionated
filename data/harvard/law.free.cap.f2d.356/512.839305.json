Clary because Clary had participated in activity opposing petitioner\u2019s handling of union funds and affairs. The Board requests enforcement of its order. Its decision and order are reported at 148 NLRB No. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-21\">In addition, petitioner Partin has filed a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence because neither petitioner nor his counsel were present when the matter was heard before the Trial Examiner. Petitioner\u2019s counsel claims that he was advised by someone not connected with the case that the scheduled hearing had been postponed; therefore, he did not attend. When the docket was called in this Court, counsel for petitioner was not present. This Court delayed hearing the case for a reasonable time after court opened to allow additional time for petitioner\u2019s counsel to appear. He had not appeared when court recessed on this day. We deem it unnecessary to make a detailed factual statement with respect to the motion except to say that neither the petitioner nor his counsel appear to regard seriously the matter of responding to dockets or scheduled hearings. In addition to other reasons for denying the motion, the petitioner has not shown that the evidence he seeks to adduce is material or that there were reasonable grounds for his failure to adduce such evidence before the Board. The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>There was ample evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s finding and the Board properly denied petitioner\u2019s request to reopen the hearing. The petition for review is denied and the Board\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
