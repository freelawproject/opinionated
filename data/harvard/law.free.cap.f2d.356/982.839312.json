P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-25\">The proliferation of notices of appeal is to be discouraged. The first notice of appeal was premature, no appealable final judgment having been entered. The second notice of appeal, given after final judgment, is sufficient to raise every question arising from the trial. The motion of the United States for dismissal of the first notice will be granted, and the appeal will proceed pursuant to the second notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
