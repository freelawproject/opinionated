The trial court correctly rejected appellant\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>We have examined each of appellant\u2019s contentions with regard to the admissibility of certain items of evidence, and are satisfied that no prejudicial error was committed. Appellant\u2019s charge that she was prejudiced by the rulings and conduct of the trial judge is likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the court erred in refusing her leave to amend her original complaint in order to claim medical expenses under a mandate from her husband. We need not consider this point, since the jury found for appellee on the question of liability. Appellant\u2019s contention would affect only the question of quantum of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
