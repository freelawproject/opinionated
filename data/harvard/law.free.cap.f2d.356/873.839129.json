(326 F.2d 960).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">The referee grounded his ruling upon a finding that the arrangement was tainted by fraud. This court, declaring that there was \u201cample evidence\u201d to support that conclusion, affirmed. (326 F.2d 960 at 962).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">Thereafter, Arnold, pursuant to leave granted by the referee \u201cto propose * * * alterations or modifications of the arrangement for the purpose of correcting the fraud\u201d [11 U.S.C. 786(2)], filed the present \u201cAmended Plan of Arrangement.\u201d The referee denied confirmation on the basis of his prior determination and this court\u2019s opinion. The district court affirmed and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">The \u201cAmended Plan\u201d was, as Arnold himself asserts in the accompanying petition, \u201cessentially similar\u201d in all material respects to the initial plan, the invalidity of which was finally adjudicated on the former appeal. That determination became and was the law of this case and of course precluded relitigation of the issue. In re Tinkoff, 156 F.2d 405 (7th Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
