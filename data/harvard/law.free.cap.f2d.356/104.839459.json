Eight months later he moved for vacation of sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A., Section 2255. He alleged that \u201cat no time, in either the pre-trial proceedings or in the trial itself, was Mov-ant either advised of his right to have counsel appointed for him by the Court or offered the assistance of legal counsel\u201d. The District Court denied the motion for the reason that \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show the petitioner is entitled to no relief\u201d. Appeal to this Court was allowed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">An examination of the record reveals' that the following occurred in open court at the time this appellant waived indictment, waived venue, and pleaded guilty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkT\">\u201cMr. Chadwick (Assistant U. S. Attorney). I will ask you if you have an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-19\">\u201cThe Defendant. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-20\">\u201cMr. Chadwick. Do you want one ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlD\">\u201cThe Defendant. No sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-21\">This is all that was said on the subject. Appellant was not advised of his right to counsel. Neither was he informed that if he desired counsel and was unable to obtain it then the Court would provide it for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-22\">This failure invalidated the plea and all subsequent proceedings. Harvey v. State of Mississippi, 5 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 263, 269. Davis v. Holman, 5 Cir., 1965, 773 F.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-23\">The sentences, therefore, must be vacated, and we do not reach the other questions raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AQM\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
