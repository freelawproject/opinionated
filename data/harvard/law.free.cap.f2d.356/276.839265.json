Johnson, challenge a judgment of the United States District Court which vacated an order of the Grand Rapids City Commission denying approval of the transfer of a Class C liquor license to plaintiff-appellee, Alphonse Lewis, and affirmatively ordered the Chief to recommend and the City to grant such approval. Under the Michigan Liquor Control Act, such approval was required before the Liquor Control Commission would effectuate the transfer. M.S.A. \u00a7 18.988, Comp.Laws Mich. 1948, \u00a7 436.-17. Roodvoets v. Anscer, 308 Mich. 360, 13 N.W.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">The District Judge held that the City Commission\u2019s action was the product of racial and other invidious discrimination and that plaintiff, a negro, was entitled to, and was denied, due process of law in the City\u2019s consideration of his application for such approval. After the desired approval was refused, and after a subsequent resolution of the Commission requesting the Liquor Control Commission to revoke the involved license, plaintiff brought this action in the United States District Court at Grand Rapids. His complaint charged deprivation of rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and asserted jurisdiction under pertinent civil rights sections of the Judicial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">We hold that the District Judge erred in his conclusion that consideration of the transfer application had to comply with traditional procedures of due process, viz., specification of grounds for refusal, presentation of evidence supporting such grounds, confrontation of witnesses with opportunity for cross-examination, and like procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-21\">If racial bias or invidious discrimination motivated the actions of the City of Grand Rapids, or if denial of the transfer approval was the consequence of a conspiracy to deny plaintiff Lewis his civil rights, then such actions must be struck down as a denial of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to plaintiff Lewis of equal protection of the law. Glicker v. Michigan Liquor Control Commission, 160 F.2d 96 (CA 6, 1947). Our review of the entire record of the case, however, leaves us with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the District Court findings in such regard. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746, 766 (1948). Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). We reverse the judgment of the District Court to the extent that it vacates the order of the City Commission denying the transfer and affirmatively orders approval thereof. The City\u2019s brief does not challenge the District Judge\u2019s finding of denial of due process in the revocation of the license. We, therefore, do not discuss that. McCraw v. United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen &amp; App. of Plumbing, etc., 341 F.2d 705 (C.A. 6, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Much of the troubled history of Barnett\u2019s Bar, a Class C liquor establishment of Grand Rapids, is set forth in the extensive opinion of the District Judge. Lewis v. City of Grand Rapids, 222 F. Supp. 349-396 (W.D.Mich.1963). The opinion contains the District Judge\u2019s subjective conclusions and factual inferences upon which he based his findings. The Chief of Police and six of the seven members of the City Commission of Grand Rapids were convicted of conspiring to invidiously discriminate against plaintiff Lewis, motivated, at least in part, because he was a Negro.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Plaintiff Lewis\u2019 relevant connection with Barnett\u2019s Bar began in early 1959. Mr. Lewis, an attorney, had represented Patricia Barnett while she was under guardianship during her minority. Her property at that time consisted principally of her interest in the estate of her deceased father, the former licensee of Barnett\u2019s Bar, who had also been a client of Mr. Lewis. By marriage, Patricia Barnett became Patricia Ettress, and later Patricia Bell. The Liquor Control Commission did not consider this then 23 year old girl qualified to operate the bar and an initial step in Mr. Lewis\u2019 service to his young client was the making, on May 20, 1959, of a contract which made him the manager of Barnett\u2019s Bar. This arrangement was approved by the police authorities of Grand Rapids and was apparently required by the Liquor Control Commission as a condition to restoration of the license which had been suspended because of previous defaults. By this contract, plaintiff Lewis was to act as Mrs. Ettress\u2019 attorney as well as manager of her bar. He was given broad powers to sign all needed documents, and otherwise to exercise full control over the operation of the bar, including the right to hire and fire all of its employees. Lewis was to paid 6% of the bar\u2019s gross sales for the first year of his employment and 10% for the second and any subsequent term of the contract, with a guaranteed annual minimum compensation of $2,000.00. The contract further provided that Lewis was to be \u201cthe agent and attorney in fact\u201d for his client. The record is unclear as to the amount of time Mr. Lewis spent at the bar in performance of his managerial duties. During the time of his management there were several defaults in payment of federal and state taxes, although it appears that Mr. Lewis cured at least one of such defaults with a loan from his own funds. One or more of such defaults brought about so-called \u201cstop\u201d orders to prevent the continued operation of the bar. During this period Lewis obtained a chattel mortgage on the bar equipment to secure advances made to Mrs. Ettress.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In August of 1960, as the consequence of a police investigation at the Barnett Bar premises, a complaint was filed with the Liquor Control Commission and with a Judge of the Police Court of Grand Rapids that the persons named therein were carrying on \u201cthe numbers game.\u201d Arrests of several persons were made. Mr. Lewis acted as attorney for those arrested and ultimately all charges were withdrawn or dismissed except as to one accused who pleaded guilty on October 2, 1961, to the unlawful possession of policy or pool tickets \u201cat 58-60 Ionia Avenue, S.W.\u201d \u2014 the building where the bar was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">On November 15, 1960, Patricia Ettress agreed to sell her license and business to one Dr. Cortez English for $18,000.00. In May of 1961, Lewis amended the English agreement to add himself as a purchaser with Dr. English. In April of 1961 Lewis had acquired a contract purchaser\u2019s interest in the building in which Barnett\u2019s Bar was located. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The sellers had acquired their title from Patricia Ettress\u2019 stepmother. The contract of purchase in which Lewis acquired an interest was in the names of his sisters. Following the making of the contract under which Mr. Lewis was to join in buying out his client, there began the steps to get the needed approval of a transfer of the license to plaintiff Lewis and Dr. English.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">During 1961 and into 1962, Mrs. Ettress at various times expressed her dissatisfaction with Mr. Lewis\u2019 conduct and with his plan to acquire her license. On several occasions she wrote to the Liquor Control Commission, withdrawing her consent to a transfer. On May 10, 1961, she wrote to Lewis expressing her desire to terminate the management contract, stating \u201cyou are unable to take care of my affairs * * * because of conflicting interest.\u201d On October 21, 1961, following two and one-half years of Lewis\u2019 management of the bar, Mrs. Ettress reported to the Liquor Control Commission that her bar business was then under padlock for failure to satisfy Federal tax liens and that her license was then in the hands of the Internal Revenue Service; that her only out \u201cnow as before\u201d was to sell her business to pay her debts. She asked that the pending application for transfer be withdrawn \u201cbecause of some things that have happened since that application was sent in originally with only Dr. Cortez English as the buyer, before he requested that attorney Alphonse Lewis, Jr., be named as a partner.\u201d Her letter proceeds,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201cHe has been the manager of the before mentioned Barnett\u2019s Bar and also my attorney and financier on many occasions. I had repeatedly asked him for a final accounting and he gave it to me this summer after I was all ready committed to sell it to him. But, in a nut shell it goes as follows, for managers fees from May 21, 1959 to May 21, 1961, 6% of the gross income for the first year and 10% of the gross income for the second year. Which came to $8,406.78. I of course had never been in business before and that was why the Commission requested that I have a manager at the time and also because I was only twenty-three at the time. Then also he wasn\u2019t what is refered to as a working manager because he is a attorney by profession law. So of course there were times when he didn\u2019t even come near the business few days at a time. He also billed me for miscellaneous legal fees which came to $2609.50. I felt that some of these came under management. In loans from him the amount comes to $6079.87, with 6% interest added in of course. The latter of which I\u2019m more than willing to pay back to him and I have no doubt in my mind that I owe him for what I borrowed from him. The grand total of this is $17,096.15. The sale that I mentioned before was for only $18,000. As you can see this leaves me with the problem of paying my other obligations, which I couldn\u2019t pay for in a life time as I couldn\u2019t possibly earn enough on a job to pay them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">-X- -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">\u201cI\u2019m sending you a copy of a agreement that Mr. Lewis gave me to be considered and signed by me in lieu of a loan of $800.00 more to be paid by him to the Internal Revenue office to release the padlock. We had tried a situation similar to this and instead of his paying the tax he was in Lasing at some kind of a hearing with your Mr. Ressi to reconsider his application. He had however been in charge of the money because he had loaned me money to avoid closing for sales tax and I thought perhaps the whole business would be cleared up before this situation would have to be continued for long as it was not agreeable to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">\u201cHe had however gotten money from the bar to pay these taxes to a degree that would have satisfied Mr. Farrell. Instead the bar was padlocked and that is how things stand at the present time. He paid some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>obligations of the bar and kept the rest for his bill or against his bill I should say and he wouldn\u2019t even give me the money as I had none to live on because I had been home sick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On December 19, 1961, Mrs. Ettress wrote the Commission \u201cthat the application for transfer of my license to Mr. Lewis and Mr. English is hereby can-celled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Tax defaults were chronic during the upwards of three years of Mr. Lewis\u2019 management and it appears that for such entire period the personal property taxes due the City of Grand Rapids went unpaid. Additional circumstances preventing a license transfer were the long pending gambling charges. It was a policy of the Liquor Control Commission not to complete a transfer of a liquor license while violation charges remained outstanding. The long and confused route of the charges against the bar is set out in the District Judge\u2019s opinion, 222 F.Supp. at pages 353-355. From August, 1960, when some four or five men were arrested in a raid at the bar premises, until October 2, 1961, some charges remained pending. All of those charged were represented by Mr. Lewis. Two of those were dismissed on examination, two more had their cases nolle prossed, and one entered a plea of guilty to the possession of gambling paraphernalia \u201cat 58-60 Ionia Avenue\u201d \u2014 the address of the building where the bar was located. The District Judge found that this charge did not involve the bar itself, but we are unable to clearly understand how this conclusion was arrived at. Following the above dispositions, the Liquor Control Commission on October 31, 1961, concluded its own investigation of the gambling charges. Its report concluded that \u201cthere is no doubt * * * that there has been some gambling operations in your bar with the knowledge of your bartender.\u201d The examining officer dismissed the charges with the observation that he \u201cwas glad you\u2019re [Mrs. Ettress] going out of the business and I understand that you\u2019re [Lewis] going on * * *. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll [Lewis] be able to curtail the activities.\u201d All of the foregoing, however, occurred during Lewis\u2019 management. He appeared, however, to cast the blame for any irregularities upon his client, Mrs. Ettress.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">While the end of the gambling charges came, tax difficulties were continuing. Appellee Lewis recites transactions which eventuated in his acquiring his client\u2019s interest in the bar fixtures,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cIn August of 1961 the sales tax man and the state police came to close her up, and after a half day conference they agreed if she turned over financial control of the bar to me, if I kept track of the money that came in from the bar and paid the sales taxes, that they would let her continue to operate, in addition also upon my paying $500 to them immediately and paying the sales tax weekly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201cThereupon, this was communicated to Mr. Farell of the Internal Revenue, and at that time Mr. Farell had demanded that she come up with certain amounts of money. I had some money at that time and offered to pay it to Mr. Farell, if Mrs. Ettress would be sure that she didn\u2019t dissipate any more of the money. I could never get a firm agreement out of her, to my satisfaction, and so I did not pay Mr. Farell that particular money, and Mr. Farell was kept aware, of course, of the money as it was accumulated. Then he closed the bar, as indicated here before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">On November 13, 1961, the Internal Revenue agent sold the bar fixtures at auction and Lewis bought them in for $50.00. The $50.00 paid did not satisfy the Internal Revenue taxes and the bar remained closed from September 21,1961, until April 6, 1962. Lewis asserts that by such purchase he acquired for himself his client\u2019s equity in the bar equipment over and above Lewis\u2019 chattel mortgage. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\u201cQ. * * * You purchased certain property from the Internal Revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Service on auction sale on November 13, 1961, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cQ. What price did you pay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>$50.00. Now, that was also the second auction. The original auction went for $1,400.00 and the person couldn\u2019t pay for it. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A48\">\u201cQ. What did you purchase on that auction ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cA. It was the equity * * * the equity of redemption of Mrs. Ettress over and above the chattel mortgage which I then held on all the bar equipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The complaint in this case alleges that the Internal Revenue Service \u201csold all the right, title and interest of Patricia Ett-ress at public sale * * * <em>to plaintiff </em>(Lewis).\u201d We do not find that Lewis has ever announced or considered that the title he then acquired was to protect or as trustee for his client. In December, 1961, Patricia Ettress wrote to the Liquor Control Commission that she considered the application for transfer to Lewis and Dr. English void. On December 14, 1961, she made a sworn statement to a Grand Rapids Police Lieutenant that she would not go through with a sale to Lewis and English, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to transfer it to them simply for credit for Mr. Lewis\u2019 bills.\u201d The confusion existing in these months is set forth in the District Judge\u2019s opinion at 222 F.Supp. 356-358.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Mrs. Ettress\u2019 recalcitrance was met by a lawsuit filed on December 21, 1961, in the State Circuit Court at Grand Rapids, whereby Mr. Lewis sought to specifically enforce the agreement that his client had made with Dr. English and to which he had become a party. His complaint asked that he be appointed receiver of Barnett\u2019s Bar. This was refused. Lewis\u2019 application for transfer continued undetermined into 1962. The Safety Committee of the Grand Rapids City Commission which was considering the request for transfer to Lewis and Dr. English, undertook to study Lewis\u2019 lawsuit against his client, the transferor. On March 20, 1962, an agreement settling the lawsuit was entered into. By it, Lewis and Dr. English agreed that in addition to the $18,000 originally agreed upon they would assume and pay an additional $7,-300 of Mrs. Ettress\u2019 debts. This agreement was subject to approval of the transfer of the license. See appendix to the District Court opinion at 222 F.Supp. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">The agreement of November 15, 1960, with Dr. English, was drafted and concluded in Lewis\u2019 office. There is nothing in the evidence to indicate that Dr. English was otherwise than Lewis\u2019 client. The sale price of $18,000 was originally to be paid in cash. It was not then geared to what Lewis\u2019 client then owed, or would owe to him for advances and services. It was after Lewis was added as a purchaser that he rendered a statement to his client totalling slightly more than $17,000. This amount was made up of loans at 6% interest amounting to about $6,000, and Lewis\u2019 fees as manager and attorney in the amount of about $11,000. With the addition of $1,920 that Mrs. Ettress owed to Dr. English, the arrangement would leave her still owing a balance to Lewis and Dr. English. There is no evidence that in the making of this deal Mrs. Ettress had any other advisor than her attorney and manager, Mr. Lewis. In May, 1961, the price was $18,000. When she was sued for performance of that agreement by her own lawyer, Mrs. Ettress obtained new counsel. When this litigation was presumably settled in March of 1962, about $7,300 was added to the purchase price by way of assuming additional debts of Mrs. Ettress.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">Among faults charged to the City Commission by the District Judge was failure to detail to Lewis its reasons for not approving him. He found as a fact that the Commission had not, prior to the revocation proceedings, made specification to Lewis of the reasons which prompted its actions. It does appear that no formal enumeration of the reasons for denial was provided. But, whether formally notified or not, during consideration of the transfer Lewis was aware of the things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>which, at the trial of this case, were identified as the causes of his <em>being </em>disapproved. He knew about the tax defaults and the closing of the bar therefor. He testified that he told the Safety Committee that the taxes would be paid if he was approved as a transferee. This conditional promise was not a substitute for discharge of an obligation assumed when he was given the exclusive financial control of the business. Placing the blame on his client was not an answer; neither was his intimation that his client and a boy friend were taking large sums of money from the enterprise. He knew about the gambling charges. He was the lawyer for all persons involved. He knew about his own relations with his young client, to whom he stood in a position of high trust. He knew that this fiduciary relationship ended in his suit to require her to convey to him the asset which he had been managing for upwards of two years. He knew of her complaints about his management and her \u201con again, off again\u201d attitude toward transferring her license to him. The Grand Rapids authorities learned of these things in the course of their numerous hearings on the transfer application.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Members of the City Commission testified that the City Attorney had advised them that it was not necessary to specify to applicants reasons for denying a transfer, that embarrassment of such applicants was thus avoided. It seems clear that during the Safety Committee hearings the standing of Mr. Lewis as an acceptable transferee of the license for Barnett\u2019s Bar was deteriorating. We are of the view that considering, the discretion vested in a City Commission in the matter of transfers of liquor licenses, the City Commission had ample ground for finding Mr. Lewis unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Applications for transfer of liquor licenses are first referred for consideration and recommendation to a Safety Committee made up of three members of the Grand Rapids City Commission. The latter is the elected governing body of the city and consists of seven members who serve part time, meeting regularly once a week. The Chief of Police submits a Liquor Control Commission form (LCC 1800) giving his recommendation as to transfers. This is considered, but not necessarily controlling. It had not been the practice of the Safety Committee to hold formal hearings, with the taking of testimony and like procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Hearings of the Safety Committee to consider Lewis\u2019 application extended over a period from January 16, 1962, to July 31, 1962, at which latter date his application was denied. At the January 16 hearing, Lewis was present and spoke for himself and Dr. English. The matter was then tabled to allow Commissioner Sevensma, a lawyer, to review plaintiff Lewis\u2019 then pending suit against his client in the Circuit Court of Kent County, Michigan. Through this investigation, the Safety Committee learned of the character and issues involved in the litigation between Lewis and his erstwhile client, and then unwilling transferor. The above-detailed settlement of the lawsuit was made on March 20, 1962, and was conditioned upon approval of a license transfer to Dr. English and plaintiff Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">On April 17, 1962, the Safety Committee again took up the matter. Lewis was present. At this meeting, the Grand Rapids Chief of Police, William A. Johnson, presented a letter dated April 12, 1962, from the United States Internal Revenue Service requesting that a \u201cStop Order\u201d be placed against a transfer of the license to Lewis. This letter was signed by revenue agent Gordon F. For-ell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An earlier letter, dated April 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>1962, had been written by the Liquor Control Commission expressing the Commission's understanding that \u201cThis has been a complex matter which we hope has now been satisfactorily clarified. We understand the violations and tax difficulties have all been resolved.\u201d The Safety Committee\u2019s desire to have reconciled this apparent conflict between the Liquor Control Commission\u2019s April 6 statement that tax difficulties had been settled and the Internal Revenue letter requesting a \u201cStop Order\u201d for failure to pay federal taxes is emphasized by the District Judge as indicative of bad faith in the Safety Committee\u2019s delay in approving the transfer. Lewis contends, and the District Judge agrees, that the Chief of Police solicited the Internal Revenue letter as a means of thwarting Lewis. The Chief\u2019s denial of soliciting the letter and his attempt to explain its origin was cut off by the sustaining of a Lewis objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charge of solicitation finds its principal support in plaintiff Lewis\u2019 hearsay statement that he had heard that such was the case. In all events, we find no impropriety in the Chief\u2019s presentation of the letter, especially in view of the chronic tax delinquencies of the bar under Lewis\u2019 management. Whether solicited or not, the factual correctness of the Farell letter is not questioned, viz.: that notices of federal tax liens had been recorded; that a \u201cStop Order\u201d on the transfer <em>had been placed </em>with the Liquor Control Commission; and that the Internal Revenue Service desired similar action by the City of Grand Rapids. The record does indicate that Chief Johnson was developing a view that Lewis was not a desirable licensee for this bar. In addition to the tax delinquencies, the Chief considered that the charged operation of the numbers game at the bar, and Lewis\u2019 conduct in handling his client\u2019s affairs, lessened his attractiveness as a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Between the April 17 and the July 24, 1962 meetings, investigation by the Liquor Control Commission continued; the agent in charge reported difficulty in contacting Lewis, and Lewis then indicated that he was not in a hurry to have the investigation concluded. On July 24, 1962, a hearing was held before the Safety Committee with Lewis, Dr. English, Mrs. Ettress, and her then attorney present. Mrs. Ettress was then agreeable to a transfer to Lewis and Dr. English. There is dispute as to what was said and done at the meeting, but seemingly all present had an opportunity to express themselves. This meeting concluded with a carried motion that the matter be tabled for three weeks. At the trial of this case, Lewis and the city officials expressed differing understandings of the import of tabling the matter. Lewis stated that he assumed a further hearing would be held in three weeks. Safety Committee members considered that the hearing was concluded and that the tabling was merely for the purpose of allowing the Committee to consider its decision, and to obtain some further information from the Liquor Control Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">In all events, at the next regular meeting of the Safety Committee, July 31, 1962, the matter was taken from the table by unanimous vote, and denial of the transfer recommended. Lewis was not present nor given notice that such meeting was to consider his application. The reason given for acting without waiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the three weeks was concern that contemplated vacations of committee members might prevent early action. On the same day, at the regular meeting of the City Commission, the Safety Committee\u2019s recommendation was unanimously approved by the six members then present. The Chairman of the Safety Committee in reporting to the Commission, convened as a Committee of the Whole, gave as reasons for denial of the transfer the tax situation, Lewis\u2019 dual capacity \u201cas manager, advisor and counselor\u201d and the \u201cpoor operation\u201d of the bar under his management. These reasons, however, were not made a part of the formal motion by which the Commission adopted the Safety Committee\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The affairs of Barnett\u2019s Bar deteriorated further following the denial of the transfer to Lewis. Mrs. Ettress, the licensee, had moved to Flint, Michigan. She had, on March 20, 1962, executed an assignment of her license to Lewis and Dr. English. On September 10,1962, she filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. The license for the Barnett Bar was the principal asset of the bankrupt estate. A contest arose between Lewis and the trustee in bankruptcy as to its ownership. Lewis contended that as assignee of the bankrupt he was the owner. The referee held that the trustee was the owner. Thereafter, on October 2, 1962, the City Commission of Grand Rapids initiated steps which culminated on November 20, 1961, in a resolution requesting the Michigan Liquor Control Commission to revoke the license of the Barnett Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Because the District Judge\u2019s vacation of such request for revocation is not here involved we need not give detailed recital of relevant events. Under advice of the City Attorney, and because the Michigan statute, M.S.A. \u00a7 18.988, requires that a request to the LCC for revocation be preceded by \u201cdue notice and proper hearing,\u201d the City Commission attempted to set up and hold a hearing that would comply with due process. The several hearings antecedent to the final resolution, held on October 16 and 24 and on November 7 and 13, created excitement and confusion. There is no doubt that by this time opposition to and possibly dislike of Mr. Lewis had developed and there was evidence of remarks expressive of an intention to resist his efforts to take over Barnett\u2019s Bar. On November 13, by unanimous vote of 7 to 0, the City Commission requested that the license be revoked \u201cunless the same is placed in escrow with the Michigan Liquor Control Commission prior to November 20, 1962.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The license not having been placed in escrow prior to November 20, the Commission, on that date, requested unconditional revocation of the license. The Mayor of Grand Rapids cast a dissenting vote to such request. Except for this, all previous actions by the City Commission involving the Barnett Bar license had been by unanimous vote. On November 19, 1962, the complaint in the case at bar was started.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Before setting out the reasons which prompt our decision, we should give this broad summary of the case. The relevant and troubled history of the Barnett Bar began in May, 1959, when Lewis took over its management for his client, and ended in his client\u2019s bankruptcy in September, 1962, at a time when he claims to have become the part owner of the bar premises, had upon foreclosure acquired the bar\u2019s fixtures, and had obtained an assignment of its license. Although by broad inference Lewis attributes some of the trouble to \u201cdipping into the till\u201d by his client and her boy friend, it is neither claimed nor proved that action by the police or other municipal officers of Grand Rapids had anything to do with Lewis\u2019 inability to discharge his fiduciary responsibilities so as to maintain his client\u2019s asset as a solvent and going enterprise. The only solution proposed was a sale of the business to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>We come then to the reasons which prompt us to hold first that in the proceedings prior to denial of the transfer to Lewis the due process clause of the United States Constitution did not require the City Commission to afford plaintiff Lewis a trial-type hearing, with formal specification of reasons for finding Lewis unacceptable, with confrontation of witnesses, with the taking and recording of testimony and with other formalities that customarily attend a full dress adversary proceeding; and, second, that plaintiff Lewis was not in relation to the transfer denied the equal protection of the law guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I. <em>Due Process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Dealing with the law of Michigan, the liquor business has always been recognized as possessing a character vesting in public authorities a broad discretion in the control and regulation of it. Sherlock v. Stuart, 96 Mich. 193, 55 N.W. 845, 21 L.R.A. 580 (1895); Johnson v. Liquor Control Commission, 266 Mich. 682, 254 N.W. 557 (1934); Scott v. Arcada Township Bd., 268 Mich. 170, 255 N.W. 752 (1934); McCarthy v. Thomas Township Bd., 324 Mich. 293, 36 N.W.2d 923 (1949); People v. Wheeler, 185 Mich. 164, 171, 151 N.W. 710 (1915); Gamble v. Liquor Control Commission, 323 Mich. 576, 578, 36 N.W.2d 297 (1949); People v. Schafran, 168 Mich. 324, 330, 134 N.W. 29 (1912); Case v. Liquor Control Commission, 314 Mich. 632, 643, 23 N.W. 2d 109 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Scott v. Arcada Township, supra, emphasized the difference between the granting of a license and its revocation, indicating that revocation might indeed require due process. Although in Johnson v. Liquor Control Commission, supra, 266 Mich. 687, 254 N.W. 557, the Michigan Supreme Court said \u201c [a] license [liquor] is not property within the meaning of * * * due process,\u201d we need not consider the point, because plaintiff Lewis was not a licensee and could become such only upon approval of the transfer to him of the Ettress license. Section 17 of the Michigan Liquor Control Act, M. S.A. \u00a7 18.988, requires as a condition to issuance of a license, that the application therefor \u201cshall be approved by the local legislative body.\u201d Application to become a licensee by transfer must have like approval. Roodvoets v. Anscer, 308 Mich. 360, 363, 364, 131 N.W.2d 850 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">On this due process question, we need not accept or rely on Hanson v. Romeo Village Council, 339 Mich. 612, 615, 64 N.W.2d 570, 571 which, relevant to the discretionary action of a local legislative body, said \u201c[e]ven though exercised in an arbitrary and capricious manner, we do not review it.\u201d We hold only that neither the Fifth nor Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution required that the Grand Rapids City Commission hold a full \u201cdue process\u201d hearing to consider plaintiff Lewis\u2019 request for the transfer to him of a license then owned by another.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The Michigan legislature recognized a difference between issuance of a new license and revocation of an existing one. While Section 17 of the Act, M.S.A. \u00a7 18.988, originally provided that upon request of a local legislative body, \u201cthe commission shall revoke the license of any licensee,\u201d such section was amended in 1957 to provide that a request for revocation was to be made \u201cafter <em>due notice </em>and <em>proper hearing </em>by the body.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Such requirement, however, was not made applicable to approval of the transfer of a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">It is not necessary that we express agreement with the holding that \u201c[a] license is not property within the meaning of the due process clause.\u201d Johnson v. Liquor Control Commission, 266 Mich. 682, 687, 254 N.W. 557, 559. Plaintiff Lewis did not own a license to operate a liquor establishment, and the opportunity to seek approval to become an owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>was not, in our view, a property right.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such holding is consonant with our decision in Glicker v. Michigan Liquor Control Com\u2019n., 160 F.2d 96 (CA 6, 1947) where we said that \u201cThe right to a license to sell intoxicating liquor is not a natural or fundamental right, nor a privilege incident to national citizenship.\u201d Michigan\u2019s view that the character of the liquor business permits greater latitude in the means of its regulation than in the controls applied to other activities was paralleled by the United States Supreme Court in Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U.S. 86, 11 S.Ct. 13, 34 L.Ed. 620 (1890). The Court there said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">\u201cThere is no inherent right in a citizen to thus sell intoxicating liquors by retail. It is not a privilege of a citizen of the state or of a citizen of the United States. As it is a business attended with danger to the community, it may, as already said, be entirely prohibited, or be permitted under such conditions as will limit to the utmost its evils. The manner and extent of regulation rest in the discretion of the governing authority. That authority may vest in such officers as it may deem proper the power of passing upon applications for permission to carry it on, and to issue licenses for that purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Although the <em>Crowley </em>case on its face appeared to hold that liquor licensing was even outside of the equal protection clause, this was not necessary to the decision, since, as the Court noted, the city in its return had alleged certain criminal violations, which, while never raised at a hearing (there having been none) \u201c * * were a sufficient indication of the character of the place in which the business was conducted for the exercise of the discretion of the police commissioners in refusing a further license to the petitioner.\u201d The only inescapable rule of <em>Crowley </em>is that the denial of a hearing, in itself, would not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Such a position is entirely consistent with the decisions of this Court in the instant case and in Glicker v. Michigan Liquor Control Commission, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Indeed the District Judge here recognized the rules we speak of when he said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayz\">\u201cWe recognize that the Michigan Supreme Court and the courts of the other states have held consistently that the due process clause of the United States Constitution does not apply to matters concerning liquor licenses.\u201d 222 F.Supp. 384</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Such observation conforms to the great weight of authority. Anno. 35 A.L.R.2d 1067. We, however, read his opinion as holding that all such decisions are now in conflict with today\u2019s view of the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The United States Supreme Court, in recent decisions, has been exacting in its requirement of due process before a state agency may deny entrance of citizens into the practice of a profession or other calling, such as the practice of law, Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796 (1957); Willner v. Committee on Character and Fitness, 373 U.S. 96, 83 S.Ct. 1175, 10 L.Ed.2d 224 (1962). None of these decisions, however, can be read to control the case of an application for transfer of a liquor license. The traditional municipal interests in regulating the liquor business, together with the problems of conducting this regulation through competent, civic-minded, part-time officials, require the use of flexible procedures. These exigencies of city management must not be disregarded by ordering that plaintiff Lewis, and everyone else wishing to become a transferee of a liquor license, receive a process including \u201c * * * <em>actor, reus, judex, </em>regular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial according to some set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tied course of judicial proceedings.\u201d Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers, etc. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961). While we hold that such kind of due process did not have to precede the denial of the transfer to Lewis, the evidence makes clear that he was given repeated hearings with opportunity to present and argue his own position. The things which made him unacceptable as a transferee \u2014 the tax delinquencies and the closing of the bar \u2014 the history of gambling \u2014 a generally poor operation under his management \u2014 and his relations with his client, highlighted by his lawsuit against her \u2014were known to him and to the Corn-mission. Although not set in a formal charge, they were the subject of much discussion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Lewis contended that a plea of guilty to possession of gambling equipment at \u201c58-60 Ionia Ave.\u201d was not proof that Barnett\u2019s Bar, located in the building carrying such address, was the site of, or involved in, the \u201cnumbers\u201d enterprise. Except for that, neither at any hearing before the Safety Committee, at any of the revocation hearings or at the trial of the case at bar did Lewis make substantial contest of the underlying truth of the events detailed herein and which prompted the Commission\u2019s disapproval of him as a transferee. Whatever explanations he offered at the trial had already been made to the Safety Committee. He has not told what evidence he would, or might have offered or developed, if a more formal type of hearing had been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">All of the foregoing is not to say that if denial of Lewis as a transferee was the product of racial bias or other discriminatory motive, he would be without remedy in a Federal Court. If he was a victim of such motivation, then indeed he was denied the equal protection of the law guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The District Judge and Lewis rely on our decision in Glicker v. Michigan Liquor Control Commission, 160 F.2d 96 (CA 6, 1947) and read it as holding that the City Commission or the Safety Committee was required to hold a full dress, adversary hearing before denying approval of a transfer to Lewis. <em>Glicker </em>did not so hold and we decline to do so. We there announced that the Michigan Liquor Control Commission could not, under guise of regulating the liquor business, deny its citizens <em>equal protection of the law. </em>The case came to us on appeal from a District Court order granting a motion to dismiss a complaint which <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>alia </em>charged that the Commission\u2019s action in suspending an existing liquor license,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjL\"><em>\u201cwas intentional and deliberate discrimination </em>against her on account of political reasons and was done deliberately <em>for the purpose of treating the appellant in a different manner than any other owner of a Class C liquor license, </em>and was in violation of her rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The above allegations had to be accepted as true on motion to dismiss and we held only that the described conduct amounted to denial of equal protection of the law. We took occasion to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cThe business [selling of liquor] being one which admittedly may be dangerous to public health, safety and morals * * * the scope of the legislature\u2019s power to regulate it is much broader than in the case of its regulation of , an ordinary lawful business essential to the conduct of human affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">and the scope of our holding is made clear by our conclusion that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cIn considering the motion to dismiss we are controlled by the allegations of the complaint. It specifically alleges that the Commission acted \u2018unlawfully, fraudulently, wil-fully and illegally\u2019 and \u2018intentionally and deliberately discriminated against\u2019 her, and that its action \u2018was wilful, deliberate and intended solely for a political purpose,\u2019 * * * and that the revocation of her license \u2018was done purposely and with the thought of treating this plaintiff in a different manner than any other owner of a Class C liquor license.\u2019 <em>We believe that those allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment </em>* * *. Whether or not the proof * * * will sustain such allegations is a different question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The case of Hornsby v. Allen, 326 F.2d 605 (CA 5, 1964) was decided after the District Court\u2019s opinion in this case was announced. It is relied upon by appellee for his contention that full due process had to be afforded before denial of the transfer. This, like our <em>Glicker </em>case, involved the review of the dismissal on motion of a complaint which charged unconstitutional denial of an application for a liquor license. It charged that such denial was \u201cwithout reason therefor\u201d and was \u201carbitrary, unreasonable, unjust, capricious [and] discriminatory.\u201d Thus the matter was before the Fifth Circuit with the foregoing allegations admitted. The Court said that \u201cthe trial court must entertain the suit and determine the truth of the allegations.\u201d The cause was remanded for trial. This case, however, comes to us after a full and extensive trial in which the reasons for denial were fully exposed. We recognize some observations in the Hornsby case as being at odds with our conclusion and to that extent we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">II. <em>Denial of Equal Protection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\"> We come then to the question whether as a matter of fact plaintiff Lewis was denied a transfer because he was a negro or was otherwise discriminated against. It was his burden to prove his charges in this regard. The District Judge\u2019s opinion must be read as a factual finding that Lewis made out such a case. We are of the opinion that such findings were clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). We so hold, applying the rule of United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1947) that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d See also Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed. 2d 1218 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"api-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>It is our belief that the District Judge gained an early but erroneous impression that plaintiff Lewis was the victim of racial bias. We are persuaded, however, that his worthy zeal to vindicate Lewis\u2019 constitutional right not to be so victimized, led him to inferences that are, on the record of this case, unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A. Racial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">At an early pretrial conference, the District Judge remarked \u201cthis is a civil rights case.\u201d He remarked, \u201cthere is not any question about it that this license should continue as a negro operated licensed establishment.\u201d The following excerpts from the District Judge\u2019s opinion and trial observations portray his conclusion of racial bias and we set them out with our reasons for considering them invalid. (Emphasis is supplied in the quotations.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">1) \u201cThis action involves the denial of a * * * of the only <em>negro-owned-operated </em>Class C liquor license in a city of over 200,000 population.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 352)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cThere are only three liquor establishments in the city of Grand Rapids <em>owned by negroes </em>* * (222 F.Supp. 381)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">\u201c * * * you have only three <em>negro </em>establishments in a city of 200,000. <em>You have an intensity of surveillance of this establishment. </em>Now if this license goes in escrow, it could very well be the end of the license. Then you have two establishments, colored establishments for a city of 200,000. This is one of the things that has been <em>predominant and very conspicuous </em>in this case.\u201d (105a, 117a, 118a)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">We immediately note that there is no evidence that any other negroes had ever applied for and been denied the right to engage in the liquor business. A transfer from one negro licensee to another was once denied, but the reason therefor was not explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">The involved license had long been owned by negroes and notwithstanding its earlier revocation by the Liquor Control Commission (not the Grand Rapids authorities), the license was restored to Patricia Ettress, the 23 year old negro heir of her father. Because the Liquor Control Commission did not consider this young lady qualified to manage a bar, the restoration was conditioned upon a negro, plaintiff Lewis, acting as manager. A management agreement was urged and approved by the Grand Rapids Police Department. Of such agreement Lewis said, \u201cThis is the only case, by the way, where the police department approved a management agreement.\u201d This was in 1959, prior to the troubled history of the bar under Lewis\u2019 management.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">2) \u201cAll three of these liquor establishments are located in Commissioner Lamberts\u2019 ward. <em>She wanted Barnett\u2019s Bar closed. </em>She intended to eliminate the only Class C liquor license <em>owned by a negro </em>in the City of Grand Rapids, a city of over 200,-000 population.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 381)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">Such inference is without support in the evidence. It is not disputed that all of the City Commission, including Mrs. Lamberts, were agreeable to and urged transfer of the Barnett license to Dr. English, Lewis\u2019 partner and himself a negro.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mrs. Lamberts comes in for special condemnation by the District Judge. It cannot be denied that she took her responsibilities seriously and perhaps pursued them with vigor unwonted in municipal officers. It is a fair inference too that along the route of Mr. Lewis\u2019 frequent appearances before the Safety Committee, she developed a lack of confidence in his ability to properly manage a bar as a sideline to his law practice. The District Judge supported his indictment of Mrs. Lamberts by noting his observation of her demeanor on the stand. He emphasized \u201cthe very saucy tone of her voice,\u201d and that she had stuck out her tongue, and had otherwise employed \u201cfacial grimaces\u201d to evidence her dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>pleasure. Certainly we do not condone such conduct. We think it proper to observe, however, that such conduct happened during the course of a cross-examination running through several days. Her cross-examination by Lewis was vigorous, with repetitive and unfounded suggestions of derelict conduct by the witness, and covers some 248 pages of transcript. While we may not approve, we easily understand the described facial expressions with which Mrs. Lamberts reacted to her long ordeal \u2014 defensive weapons not uncommon to the badgered female. However, they do not prove nor justify an inference of racial bias. It may be relevant to here mention that the trial of this case consumed some 16 trial days and generated a transcript of 1,895 pages, over half of which is made up of Lewis\u2019 cross-examination of the Chief of Police and the members of the City Commission. Pretrial hearings are reported in 333 pages of transcript, and there is a supplemental transcript of 201 pages. The District Judge established a segregated record containing some of the defendants\u2019 evidence of reasons why it was considered inappropriate to approve Lewis as a transferee. The District Judge was of the view that such evidence was immaterial except to the extent that the thinking of the Commissioners had been communicated to Lewis. The District Judge would not receive evidence offered to prove that Lewis knew of the numbers gambling going on in Barnett\u2019s Bar. He so ruled because it was not shown that those who claimed to know of Lewis\u2019 knowledge had told the police about it, and no showing was made that the Commissioners had told Lewis that they had evidence that he knew of the gambling.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">3) \u201cMr. Lewis, Barnett\u2019s Bar, and all who were associated with it, were made to appear to represent all that was undesirable in taverns and licensed liquor establishments, and especially, <em>with varying inflections of overtone, a negro bar.\u2019\u2019 </em>(222 F. Supp. 382)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cIt is important to bear in mind that insofar as the <em>negro population </em>of the City of Grand Rapids is concerned, it comprises about 7% of the population. <em>In Commissioners Lam-berts\u2019 and Jamo\u2019s political calculation this was a negligible force which could be disregarded. </em>Their activities in the case here at issue were before Birmingham.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 382)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201cThere existed in fact a conspiracy on the part of Chief Johnson and Commissioners Lamberts, Sevensma, and Jamo to defeat and deny the transfer, and ultimately to revoke the <em>only negro-owned Class C liquor license </em>in a city of over 200,000 population. (222 F.Supp. 382).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The foregoing subjective inferences are invalid and without evidentiary support. There is no evidence that the Negro population of Grand Rapids was desirous of increasing its share of the city\u2019s liquor establishments. Invidious discrimination cannot be postulated whenever or wherever a city exists in which the ratio of negro-operated bars to the total number of such businesses is less than the Negro percentage of population. The assertion that Commissioners Lam-berts and Jamo politically calculated that this (the ratio of. negro-operated bars to the total Negro population) \u201cwas a negligible force which could be disregarded\u201d is entirely gratuitous. We find no evidence from which to infer the \u201cpolitical calculation\u201d recited; Mrs. Lamberts became acquainted with Lewis through their being coworkers in the Democratic Party. Commissioner Jamo had received a commendation from the NAACP for his testimony before the state legislature in 1960, then serving as Chairman of the Kent County Civil Rights Committee of the Republican Party.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">4) \u201cChief Johnson was determined to keep the only <em>negro-owned </em>Class C liquor establishment closed.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 359)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">\u201cChief Johnson wanted to close Barnett\u2019s Bar, the lone <em>negro-owned </em>Class C liquor license in Grand Rapids.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 375)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>As Chief of the Grand Rapids Police Department, Johnson had approved the reopening of Barnett\u2019s Bar in 1959 after a previous bad record. The approval was signed by Chief Johnson upon condition that Lewis, a Negro, take over its management. It is a fair inference that Chief Johnson\u2019s estimate of Mr. Lewis\u2019 qualifications as a bar manager deteriorated as the bar\u2019s troubles mounted thereafter. As in the case of Mrs. Lamberts, the District Judge supports his charge of malice against the Chief by reference to his witness stand demeanor. \u201cHe testified with great difficulty; he was quickly exasperated, and clipped off his answers. When extensive questions were asked by Mr. Lewis, the Chief grew red-fhced and tightlipped; the blood vessels in his head bulged out.\u201d 222 F.Supp. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The Chief may have remembered Lewis calling him a liar at one of the Safety Committee meetings. Lewis'\u2019 cross-examination of the Chief covers 133 pages of transcript; it contains unfounded charges of official misconduct, as well as unsupported reflections upon the Chief\u2019s personal life. Perhaps the Ghief should have better controlled his emotions, but his very natural responses under attack do not convict him of conspiracy, malice, or racial bias.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">5) \u201cDred Scott Madison [a <em>negro police </em>officer] claimed that Chief Johnson practiced discrimination, and cited his own demotion as evidence of this discrimination.\u201d (222 F. Supp. 370)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">This officer testified: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that he [Chief Johnson] was biased against me himself.\u201d He did not cite his own demotion as evidence of racial discrimination by Chief Johnson. He did state that negro officers were constantly \u201cat the bottom of the list\u201d on efficiency ratings. However, Chief Johnson did not control the efficiency ratings and in all events the official and not questioned records of the efficiency ratings ranked officer Madison himself as number 21 out of 62, far from the bottom of the list. The Chief gave the reason for the demotion of Madison and its validity was sustained by the Civil Service Board. It was shown that the negro officer, Madison, was, upon the recommendation of Chief Johnson, promoted to the rank of Sergeant, bypassing several white officers with greater seniority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">6) \u201cThe court\u2019s discussion of the gambling charges need not be repeated here. The action of the city police in this regard, however, constituted a <em>discriminatory enforcement of the gambling laws </em>against a licensed liquor establishment.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 382)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The investigation of gambling at Barnett\u2019s Bar was the product of the voluntary action of the negro officer Madison, without previous knowledge of or request from the police department. Discovering or suspecting the gambling, he reported it; this was followed by a customary police practice of bringing in an officer from another city, and the officer selected was a negro. After several days of surveillance, he reported that the \u201cnumbers racket\u201d was going on at Barnett\u2019s Bar and swore to a complaint that named individuals who were carrying on such an enterprise. We cannot join the District Judge\u2019s trial characterization of this as \u201can intensity of surveillance of this establishment.\u201d Some of these charges pended for over a year, Lewis appearing for all defendants; they were concluded by a plea of guilty by one of the accused to possession of gambling paraphernalia at \u201c58-60 Ionia Ave.\u201d This is the address of the building where the bar is located, and was used in official papers as the address of Barnett\u2019s Bar. The District Judge infers that the bar was not involved, but the plea of guilty does not exclude it. The Liquor Control Commission\u2019s file contains a report of \u201cItems confiscated from 58-60 Ionia Ave during the Numbers Raid of 8-5-60.\u201d The report mentions torn numbers slips and adding machine tapes \u2014 indicia of the \u201cnumbers . racket\u201d \u2014 found on the main floor of Barnett\u2019s Bar, in its office wastebasket, and in the trash barrel at the rear of Barnett\u2019s. Numerous other items of relevant paraphernalia were reported as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>seized at 58-60 Ionia, without specification as to whether they were in Barnett\u2019s Bar. \u201cFive Green Sheets [familiar to the numbers game] for the week ending 8-4-60\u201d with other material were reported as taken from the office located in the \u201cbasement of 58-60 Ionia, S.W. under Barnett Bar.\u201d We do not understand how the bar was excluded from involvement. The District Judge\u2019s impression of \u201cundue surveillance\u201d may have arisen from lack of evidence of like surveillance or raid of any other bar. There was, however, no evidence that any other bar had been suspected as a base of operations for the \u201cnumbers racket\u201d. Both the Chief and officer Madison told of raids on gambling establishments \u2014 gaming rooms \u2014 and the arrest of their white patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We conclude consideration of racial bias by mentioning that the original complaint filed in this cause on November 19, 1962, made no such claim. It was brought into the case by an amended complaint filed on January 2, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">B. Other discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The District Judge inferred malice and conspiracy from other conduct which he does not specifically relate to racial bias. With repetitive vigor he indicts the entire City Commission of Grand Rapids, with the exception of the Mayor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the evidence does not disclose their content, the news media, radio, TV and newspapers are alleged to have carried stories so extensively \u201cand it was the purpose of Chief Johnson and Commissioner Lamberts to cause this result \u2014 \u25a0 that Barnett\u2019s Bar became synonymous with all that is undesirable in liquor establishments, and especially in a <em>negro-owned-operated </em>liquor establishment. Barnett\u2019s Bar and Alphonse Lewis as a consequence <em>are unpopular in this community.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) (222 F. Supp. 383) Without relevant record evidence, we are unable to probe the com-, munity mind of Grand Rapids. The District Judge hypothesizes that because of what happened, if a popular vote were held on the question \u201cShall Barnett\u2019s Bar license be revoked?\u201d the vote would be overwhelmingly in the affirmative. (222 F.Supp. 383).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Mrs. Lamberts was found to be the chief offender, with other members of the Commission succumbing to her persuasion. The District Judge concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">1) \u201cHer [Lamberts\u2019] rise to Chairman of the Safety Committee and President of the City Commission, <em>and the evident voting bloc which she had acquired in the City Commission, </em>gave her substantial power, which she wielded arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably in this instant case.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 381)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Mrs. Lamberts was not Chairman of the Safety Committee at the time of the events here involved. If there is any support for the assertion that Mrs. Lam-berts \u201chad acquired\u201d a voting block which \u201cgave her * * * power, which she wielded arbitrarily,\u201d etc., it must be found in the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">\u201cQ. * * * isn\u2019t it true that there is a faction * * * of which Mrs. Lambert <em>is a part </em>which controls at least four votes * * * ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">\u201cA. Well, sometimes I think so, <em>sometimes </em>I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">In quoting from the foregoing (222 F.Supp. 371) the District Judge assumed that the question was whether Mrs. Lamberts <em>controlled </em>the faction, not whether she was <em>a part of </em>a faction. The last part of the answer, \u201csometimes I don\u2019t\u201d is omitted. The same examination went on to inquire whether the Commissioners from Mrs. Lamberts\u2019 ward and another ward did not always vote on the same side. The answer was, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say so.\u201d We find without support the District Judge\u2019s further inference that the City Commission \u201cwas under her [Mrs. Lamberts\u2019] dominating control insofar as this transaction was concerned.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-16\">2) \u201cThe court is also aware of one time * * * when Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Lamberts chose to demonstrate her <em>omniscient attitude </em>by expostulating that a certain question \u2018was not worthy of answer.\u2019 \u201d (222 F.Supp. 375)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The question which provoked the quoted answer is not set out. It came during plaintiff Lewis\u2019 cross-examination of Mrs. Lamberts. It was \u201cIn other words, if you want a liquor license don\u2019t say anything bad about the police, is that right?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">3) \u201cWhen she [Mrs. Lamberts] phoned the LCC * * * she told them there <em>was going to be a grand jury investigation </em>of this transaction.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 381)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">A memorandum in the Liquor Control Commission records, unidentified as to authorship, referred to a call from Mrs. Lamberts (this was in October, 1962, long after denial of the transfer) wherein she allegedly stated \u201cthat the county prosecutor <em>is thinking about </em>asking for a grand jury investigation * * The prosecuting attorney testified that he had not told Mrs. Lamberts that he was going to call a grand jury <em>to investigate the Liquor Control Commission, </em>but said that he had discussed with the Chief of Police the possibility of petitioning for a grand jury \u201cto investigate all of Barnett\u2019s Bar affairs, not Mr. Lewis or his connection with it.\u201d He never did so, however. Mrs. Lamberts testified that she had heard of this talk from Chief Johnson.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">4) \u201cWhen Commissioner Sevensma on cross-examination was informed <em>of the facts </em>in the alleged gambling cases, he stated that if he had known these facts, his judgment about the case <em>would </em>have been different.\u201d (222 F.Supp. 373)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Commissioner Sevensma did not so testify. Mr. Lewis\u2019 questions contained Lewis\u2019 hypothesis of facts which he contended would have failed to establish that there was gambling in Barnett\u2019s Bar. Asked if he knew such to be the facts, would his judgment have been different, Sevensma answered \u201cI would say yes, <em>perhaps </em>it would have been different * * *. It <em>might </em>have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">We find other factual inferences by the District Judge which, in our view, are without substantial evidentiary support. We forego, however, further extension of the subject. All who questioned Mr. Lewis\u2019 conduct were accused as conspirators. An investigator for the LCC who was dissatisfied with Lewis\u2019 cooperation was included. \u201cMr. Arens [LCC investigator for the State] knew, understood, and participated in Chief Johnson\u2019s and Commissioner Lamberts\u2019 program of delay and denial.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (222 F.Supp. 362) All of the condemned City Commissioners were responsible, reputable citizens, elected and re-elected by the people of Grand Rapids. Mrs. Lamberts, the most seriously accused, had taken the trouble to consult with a Dr. Cowles, a negro member of the city\u2019s Human Relations Committee, upon the subject of Mr. Lewis\u2019 application for transfer. Development of the subject, however, was foreclosed by its exclusion as hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">We believe that Mr. Lewis\u2019 record of management of Barnett\u2019s Bar and his handling of his client\u2019s affairs was such that it cannot be said that denial of the transfer was arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. Commissioner Sevensma, a graduate of the University of Michigan and a practicing lawyer of upwards of twenty years, when pressed by Lewis to tell why he questioned Lewis\u2019 handling of his client\u2019s affairs, answered \u201cthere was definitely a conflict of interest * * you were the manager, you were the lawyer, you were the creditor, you sued your own client and the licensee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">Commissioner John Vandenberg, a graduate of Calvin College at Grand Rapids and now a professor of economics there, an M.A. and Ph.D graduate of and now a part time teacher at the Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>versity of Michigan, was elected in 1960, and was a member of the Safety Committee which recommended denial of transfer. He stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cI had no bias toward Mr. Lewis and I had no bias toward anyone. This is against my own personal philosophical and religious commitments; this was against my commitment to the City which I made when I was sworn in as a City Commissioner to protect the rights of all the citizens of the Community * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">He testified that Mr. Lewis was given and employed ample opportunity to present his position to the Safety Committee. He disclosed the reasons which prompted his vote to deny the transfer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u201cI was astonished to have before me a man who, one, first was legal counsel to the licensee, Mrs. Bell,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> two, who then became manager of the Bar, which she had acquired by virtue of the death of her father * * *. Three, who was in court on the same case. Four, who was trying to acquire this and there would be no payment for Mrs. Bell. I cannot conceive of a situation where one person can be in so many roles which are obviously in conflict. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\"For someone to be in management position and in the period of approximately 18 months to see an asset which is alleged to have been worth from $18,000 to $25,000 turn out to be worth nothing, leads me to suspect' that the person who is managing that bar is incompetent, or dishonest, or he is more interested in himself than he is in his client. This was the chief reason why I could not see transferring this particular license to Mr. Lewis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">\u201cIn addition to this, we have other matters such as the infraction of the law; we have the recommendation of the Chief of Police; we have the fact that taxes were not paid. All these together could only convince me that this would not be for the welfare of the City to make this transfer. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-13\">\u201cIt was my opinion that Mr. Lewis, because of these many roles, the law infractions, and the recommendation of the Chief, the failure to pay taxes and being in control, as he repeatedly said to us he had the power of attorney, he could hire, fire, he ran the bar and having done such a poor job, in the background of all these roles, I, in good conscience, could not vote for that transfer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">Mr. Vandenberg was not sure as to how much of his reasoning was explicitly addressed to Mr. Lewis although he recalled giving some of them to him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He questioned the policy of public announcement of all of such reasons. He said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-15\">\u201cMr. Lewis is a public figure. He is an attorney and as such I think he has a perfect right to go about his business as a lawyer. I think that Mr. Lewis would have been damaged had we expounded in great detail on this particular request, giving the reasons why he did not transfer his license. I have given those by request in this courtroom. I have never given these publicly any other place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">To sustain a finding that denial of Lewis\u2019 application was the product of racial bias or other discriminatory motive would require us to leave unreversed a holding that Commissioner Vanden-berg\u2019s above recital was but a perjurious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>mask<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to hide his real and vicious motives. We cannot do so. Neither can we discern any basis for the enormous immorality and malfeasance attributed to the other Commissioners by the District Court. These others, of varying professions or means of livelihood<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> were of equally responsible standing and there was nothing in their backgrounds to forecast their capacity for the vicious conduct of which they were convicted. It is significant indeed that plaintiff Lewis does not deny the factual high points of his management of Barnett\u2019s Bar and his client\u2019s affairs which, justifiably in our view, led an entire City Commission to find him unsuited to manage or become the licensee of Barnett\u2019s Bar. Even though this history may have caused some personal dislike of Mr. Lewis that, by itself, does not add up to a denial of equal protection of the law. That no Commissioner had any beginning opposition to Mr. Lewis, racial or otherwise, is shown by the following excerpt from his cross-examination :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201cQ. And looking back at it now, even as of this date, do you assert there was any antagonism toward you by any of the members of that committee as of that date, January 16, 1962?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We make clear just what we decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">1. Plaintiff Lewis was not, under Glicker v. Liquor Control Commission, 160 F.2d 96 (CA 6, 1947) entitled to a full dress, trial type, hearing on his applicati onfor transfer; he was not deprived of any federally granted constitutional right by the manner in which such application was considered and approval withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">2. Plaintiff Lewis was, under <em>Glicker </em>and other authorities, entitled to the \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">3. If denial of Lewis\u2019 application for transfer was the product of racial bias or other discriminatory motive, such denial would be a deprivation of the equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">4. The District Judge\u2019s findings as to racial bias and discriminatory motive on the part of the Grand Rapids City Commission are clearly erroneous, within the meaning of Rule 52 Fed.R.Civ.P. as the term \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d has been articulated by United States v. United States Gypsum, 333 U.S. 364, 375, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746, 766 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">5. We do not reach the question of whether Lewis or the trustee in bankruptcy were denied due process or equal protection of the law by the revocation of the license for Barnett\u2019s Bar. The appeal does not present such question.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">The judgment of the District Court as it conflicts with this opinion is reversed; the cause is remanded to the District Court with direction to vacate its order setting aside the July 31, 1962, resolution of the Grand Rapids City Commission denying approval of the Lewis application for transfer and with direction to dissolve the mandatory injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>order requiring the City and its Chief of Police to approve a transfer to Lewis of the involved license.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The judgment of the District Court is, to the foregoing extent, reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\">. The letter, addressed to . the \u201cSuperintendent of Police,\u201d read:</p>\n<p id=\"AeK\">\u201cIt has been brought to the attention of this office that Mr. Alphonse Lewis, Jr., Attorney at Law, Grand Rapids, Michigan, has applied for the transfer of the Liquor License held by Patricia Ettress, DBA Barnett Bar, 60 Ionia Ave. S.W., Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"ApV\">\u201cFor your information, Patricia Ettress is indebted to the Federal Government for past due Federal taxes for which</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u201cA \u2018Stop Order\u2019 has been placed on the transfer of this license with the Michigan Liquor Control Commission asking for their cooperation in holding up any transfer until the Government\u2019s obligation is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u201cIf at all possible, this office would like a similar order be made a part of your file in the matter of the transfer of the license to Mr. Lewis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\">. \u201cMr. Forell came into my office with Captain Szumski, explained the tax difficulties that they had had with this establishment, <em>informed me he placed a \u2018Stop\u2019 order with the Michigan Liquor Control Commission, </em>and seemed to be quite concerned that * * * <em>\u201d </em>(Here an objection was sustained on the ground of hearsay)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\">.

These excerpts from the Safety Committee members give an idea of what went on.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Commissioner Jamo described Lewis\u2019 conduct: \u201cWe never seemed to get to the meat. We always went round and round. You were there and we figured today you are going to bring up your testimony and we will get this resolved. You never seemed to touch on the point we were talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Commissioner Lamberts testified to discussions, in Lewis\u2019 presence, at the Safety Committee hearings and which exhibited Lewis\u2019 attitude toward his own responsibilities: \u201cOn some occasions he would say that he was not \u2014 he had no responsibility for the fact that the bar was losing money, the fact that the taxes were not paid, the fact that a gambling operation had been going on in that bar. He had no responsibility for the things that went wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u201cQ. And was there discussion then among the Committee members with and in the presence of Mr. Lewis with reference to what his responsbilities in the bar were and had been?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u201cA. Yes. We discussed that with him. We talked about the taxes, I think, at every meeting in which he was in attendance. He said he acquired the personal property through a tax sale for $50.00 * * *. So he said he owned the personal property. The personal property taxes had not been paid * \u00bb * since the bar had opened in \u201959. The sales taxes he said were her responsibility and the income taxes were her responsibility * * *. We discussed that he was the manager and he declared he had no responsibility to see that * * * any of the taxes were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">\u201cQ. * * * With reference to gambling, what discussion, if any, was there with reference to it?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">\u201cA. Lewis said that one of the excuses that the Chief gave for holding up the approval of his license was that there was a violation pending relative to gambling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Commissioner Barto testified concerning the involved Safety Committee meetings: \u201cLewis was recognized and heard repeatedly and allowed to make statements with reference to his position on any and all matters that were brought up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">Commissioner Vandenberg, talking of the July 24, 1962, meeting of tlie Safety Committee and of the fact that Lewis was given, and used, opportunity to speak, said: \u201cMr. Lewis had voluminous documents with him. He referred to these documents frequently and I think Mr. Lewis had a long time in which to present his position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Commissioner Sevensma testified to talking to Lewis between meetings of the Safety Committee'. \u201cI had asked you [Lewis] some time after the January 16th meeting * * * X said, \u2018This is a very involved matter and has many complications and 1 would advise you, Mr. Lewis, that you should sit down and write in plain Anglo-Saxon words an exact and detailed chronology of what had happened in the case, beginning at the beginning and right up through the time when the Safety Committee was considering the matter.\u2019 However, you [Lewis] chose not to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">Commissioner Sevensma\u2019s testimony that Lewis\u2019 lawsuit with his client was disclosed at the January 16, 1962, meeting and that adjournment was had to allow investigation of the case, is agreed to by Lewis. Sevensma testified to what he found from examining the Circuit Court file,</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">\u201cMr. Lewis indicated on January 16, 1962, that he was then and had been for sometime the manager of this bar; that he had a management agreement with Patricia Ettress and also that he was her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">\u201cSo in examining the Circuit Court record, I was particularly interested in seeing what allegations were made in reference to what I deemed to be a supposedly conflict of interest that he had, where on the one hand he was the manager and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>on the other hand he was the attorney, and then in this Court action, he was suing his client and the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u201cAnd so I ascertained from Paragraph 2 of the Bill of Complaint that Dr. English had entered into a contract in November of 1960, with Patricia Ettress for the purchase of this business and that later on, in May of 1961, Mr. Lewis had acquired a one-half interest in this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u201cI further noticed * * * that the defendant, Patricia Ettress, had requested the Liquor Control Commission to withhold this transfer for the reason that her debts were greater than the amount that she was going to receive for the business and the transfer of the license, and I recall that on January 16th Mr. Lewis was asked about that, what monetary consideration was involved, and he stated that the price was $18,000.00, but that Patricia Ettress was indebted to him on various items, attorneys fees and other expenses, although I do not recall that he at that time presented an itemized listing of these debts, but anyway the statement was made that the amount of her debt to him was $18,000.00, and that the one would cancel the other, and immediately I wondered about that. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u201cI also noticed the matter of unpaid taxes, as related in Paragraph 5; that the Federal Taxes had not been paid, and I believe that I learned subsequent to my examination of this Bill of Complaint that there were not only income taxes of Patricia Ettress but also withholding taxes that had not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">\u201cAnd then the further examination showed that Mr. Lewis was the manager of this business; that he had advanced apparently certain sums of money to pay the debts and obligations of the business. And so after reading <em>those items which </em>appeared in Paragraph 6 and 8, and then also reading Paragraph 9, that the defendant was indebted to him, I might say that my suspicion as to the correctness and the ethics of this matter were confirmed by what he had told us on January 16th and what appeared in the Bill of Complaint, and it seemed to me that he, that is, Mr. Lewis, stood in an untenable position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">Dr. English, present with Lewis at the next to the last meeting on the matter, said \u201cI remember Mr. Vandenberg saying that this woman, this Mrs. Ettress, was losing her legacy and he was interested in protecting her legacy. That was <em>one of the things </em>that 1 remember * * *. Mr. Vandenberg seemed to be very perturbed. The only thing that seemed to worry him was Patricia Et-tress losing her legacy.\u201d He also remembered Chief Johnson saying to Lewis that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the right temperament * * * to run a bar.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b342-15\">. Dr. English is not a party to this lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b345-17\">.

The Internal Revenue Service is accused in Lewis\u2019 complaint which alleges \u201c * * * despite said sale [by which Lewis obtained title to the bar fixtures for $50,00] said Internal Revenue Service has failed, refused and neglected to remove a so-called \u2018stop\u2019 request filed with the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">. Patricia Ettress had become Mrs. Bell during the time involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\">. There can be little question, though, that these matters were before the City Commission on July 31, 1962, when the transfer application was denied. It was so testified by Commissioners Bnrto, Jamo, Sevensma and Vandenberg. There was no attempt to refute any of this testimony except for the District Court\u2019s observation that because all the Commissioners agreed, all of their testimony was questionable. 222 F.Supp. 372.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">.
