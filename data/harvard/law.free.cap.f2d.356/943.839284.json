This is apparently included in the goods named in its registration No. 664,928, July 29,1958, for \u201ctubing, pipe, unions for connecting pipes or rods, and filters.\u201d Opposer has two other registrations of the same word, or name, for goods more remote from circuit breakers in particular and electrical goods in general, No. 160,916, October 31, 1922, and No. 664,043, July 8,1958. The earliest registration was issued to Mark Manufacturing Company and the other two to its successor, Clayton Mark &amp; Company. Clayton Mark III testified that the company was founded by his grandfather, that his father was associated with it, and that he himself had been employed continuously by it from 1938 when he graduated from college and had worked for the company eight previous summers.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-23\">Passing for the moment the probable impact on the public of the trademark \u201cMARK,\u201d it is clear that it is in fact a family name employed by a family business to indicate the origin of its wares.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-24\">\u201cMARK 75\u201d was adopted by Westinghouse Electric Corporation as its designation for a new line of industrial circuit breakers \u2014 devices which open an electrical circuit when it is overloaded \u2014 \u2022 designed to have an interrupting capacity of 75,000 amperes at 240 volts a.c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the line was promoted by advertising emphasizing that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-25\">\u201cMARK\u201d is a term with an unusually large number of meanings \u2014 as a noun alone nearly a column in Webster\u2019s unabridged dictionary. It is a family name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>a proper name, and the name of the author of the second Gospel of the New Testament. It is also commonly used in an entirely different sense in combination with a numeral to designate a particular model or type. Some examples from the record are: \u201cDC-8 Mark IV\u201d airplanes, \u201cMark 5\u201d shotgun shells, \u201cMark Ten\u201d panelboards, \u201cMark 16\u201d layout tools, \u201cMark 313\u201d electric cooking appliance, \u201cMark III\u201d capacitors, \u201cMark III\u201d boilers, \u201cMark II\u201d oil furnaces, \u201cMark IV\u201d electron beam welders, and \u201cMark 8\u201d color television. There are many others. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Merriam) recognizes this usage, citing as an example a nuclear power plant known as \u201cMark I.\u201d There is evidence of a General Dynamics \u201cTRIGA mark III\u201d reactor.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">When Westinghouse made a search on its proposed trademark \u201cMARK 75\u201d it found that Minneapolis-Honeywell Company was already using the same trademark on a slide projector but obtained consent to its use on circuit breakers. We cite this merely as an added example of this type of \u201cmark\u201d designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The price range of \u201cMARK 75\u201d circuit breakers is from $40 to $600. They are not sold in stores. The line contains between 150 and 160 different styles only 20 to 25 of which are stocked, the rest being manufactured only to order. A highly trained electrical engineer, not a mere electrician, is required to select the proper circuit breaker for the particular installation. Being more expensive than ordinary circuit breakers, it would appear that \u201cMARK 75\u201d breakers would not be used if ordinary breakers would be adequate. Purchase of \u201cMARK 75\u201d breakers would therefore be on a very discriminating basis, by persons who not only know what they are buying and why but who is producing it. We think it highly improbable that a buyer of a \u201cMARK 75\u201d breaker would not know it was a Westinghouse product.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">This being so, we do not see that any confusion as to origin of the goods is likely by reason of the factors relied on by appellant, namely, that \u201cMARK\u201d electrical conduit and \u201cMARK 75\u201d circuit breakers may be bought from the same distributors, used by the same contractors, in the same structure, and included in the same specification sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">In spite of the obvious similarity we consider the trademarks to be of different types. Appellant\u2019s mark is not simply opposer\u2019s mark with the \u201cmere\u201d addition of \u201c75.\u201d That addition converts what has every appearance of being a name of some sort into a trademark of the type- or model-designating variety.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">The record shows that opposer uses \u201cMARK\u201d as a house designation, the way Westinghouse uses the dominant portion of its corporate name, on conduits of various types bearing the designations \u201cELECTRICTUBE,\u201d \u201cGALVAKOTE,\u201d \u201cHOTKOTE,\u201d AND \u201cENAMELKOTE.\u201d Its advertising features these products collectively as \u201cMARK Conduit\u201d but also prominently associates with the above type designations its company name as \u201cClayton Mark &amp; Co.\u201d We believe that in general purchasers of \u201cMARK Conduit\u201d would be aware of the fact that it comes from a company named Mark and not Westinghouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">We have here pointed out what appears to us to be the salient features of this case. There are, of course, others mentioned in the briefs and record and in the board\u2019s opinion. Having considered all of these we find no reason to disagree with the decision of the board and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">MARTIN, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-19\">. Apparently 75,000 amperes is the capacity of the largest unit in the line, which covers a range of 20,000-75,000. The interrupting capacity of the Westinghouse \u201cstandard\u201d line of circuit breakers is from 5,000 to 50,000 amperes. This refers to the ability to interrupt fault currents without injuring the circuit breaker.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
