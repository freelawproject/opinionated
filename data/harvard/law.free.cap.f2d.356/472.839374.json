He was convicted by a jury in two counts of violating the Mann Act. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421) He urged below there had been (a) a denial of his right to direct appeal, and (b) that there was a denial of his constitutional rights in that (a) he was not advised of his right to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); (b) that, without counsel, he had made an involuntary confession, contrary to Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964); and (c) that there was no proof an unlawful act was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-21\">The district court judge established, by record references, that points (b) and (c) were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Finding appellant\u2019s attorney had failed to appeal the original conviction (as he had been requested to do), the district court, relying on Dodd v. United States, 321 F.2d 240 (9th Cir. 1963), nevertheless found there had been no reversible error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">\u201c * * * a failure of counsel to file notice of appeal will only justify relief under Section 2255 where there is also a showing of \u2018plain reversible error in the trial.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">We agree there exists no proof of plain reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">Appellant raises a third point on this appeal \u2014 the arguments used by government counsel to the jury. This was not urged below, and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. But were we to consider it, we would hold it to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">The denial of relief under \u00a7 2255 by the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
