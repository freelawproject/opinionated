Section 7237(d), Title 26 U.S.C. provides in substance that upon conviction of offenses under the narcotic laws \u201cthe imposition or execution of sentence shall not be suspended, probation shall not be granted\u201d nor shall Section 4202, Title 18 U.S.C. relative to \u201creleased on parole after serving one-third\u201d of a sentence be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">After serving his full sentence with statutory good time allowance as provided in Section 4161, Title 18 U.S.C., petitioner was issued a certificate of mandatory release as provided in Section 4163 \u201cas if on parole\u201d pursuant to Section 4164. Subsequent to his release, he was retaken into custody for violation of the terms of his release. While serving the remainder of his sentence of about 1200 days, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that since by the terms of the statute (\u00a7 7237(d)) he was not subject to being \u201creleased on parole after serving one-third\u201d of his term under Section 4202, he was not subject to release \u201cas if on parole\u201d under Section 4164; that the Parole Board was therefore without jurisdiction to retake him by warrant under Section 4205, and he is therefore entitled to be released forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The crux of his argument is to the \u2022effect that the Board\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction on parole is found in Section 4202, and since that Section is expressly inapplicable, the Board is without jurisdiction of one who is mandatorily released \u201cas if on parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The full and complete answer to this contention is that Sections 4164 and 4205 are unaffected by the exclusionary provisions of Section 7237(d). Parole under 4202 is discretionary in the Board. But, release of a prisoner who has served the full term of his sentence, less statutory good time deductions, is mandatory, and he is to \u201cbe treated as if released on parole, and shall be subject to all provisions of law relating to the parole of United States prisoners until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Section 4205 authorizes the Parole Board or a member thereof to issue a warrant for the retaking of any prisoner who has violated his parole within the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced. These two Sections are <em>sui generis, </em>and the jurisdiction of the Parole Board to revoke the parole of a prisoner who has been mandatorily released under Section 4164 is not dependent upon its discretionary jurisdiction under Section 4202. United States v. Figueroa, 2 Cir., 325 F.2d 418; Conley v. United States Board of Parole, D.C. 221 F.Supp. 445; Cf. Hicks v. Reid, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 194 F.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">The statutes are not indefinite or ambiguous with respect to their applicability to this petitioner or the conditions imposed by their terms. The Board did not lack jurisdiction to issue the warrant and retake the prisoner for the service of the remainder of the term of his sentence. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
