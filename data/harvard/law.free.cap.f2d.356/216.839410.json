Emmet Clarie, District Judge, upon one count of entering a bank with intent to commit a felony affecting the bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) \u00b6 2. On this appeal he claims that certain evidence taken from his hotel room three days after the bank entry was erroneously admitted at the trial because obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure; that evidence of his fingerprints was erroneously admitted at the trial because obtained as tainted fruit of an unlawful arrest and detention; and that the indictment failed to charge an offense against the United States in that it did not charge the essential elements of a federal felony. We hold that Judge Clarie properly admitted the evidence of which \u00e1ppellant complains and that he correctly rejected appellant\u2019s claim as to the insufficiency of the indictment which was first raised on a motion in arrest of judgment. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">Illegal Search and Seizure</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">On the night of September 11, 1964, the First National Bank of Windsor Locks, North Thompsonville Branch, was forcibly entered and a sum of money in excess of $100 was taken. That same night a fishing pole and tackle box were taken from a garage adjoining the bank. Appellant was seen with a fishing pole and tackle box across the street from the bank on the same night.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">Two nights later, September 13, an automobile agency in Windsor (12 miles from North Thompsonville) was broken into; cash, a money bag, a gun and ammunition were taken. The following morning, September 14, at about 8 A.M., the owner of the automobile agency turned over to the Windsor police a receipt dated September 13 for Room 1540 at the Statler Hotel in Hartford which he had found under the window through which the break at the automobile agency had been made the night before. The police inspected the scene of the break at the automobile agency and found bloodstains from which they inferred that whoever broke into the building may have cut himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">That same morning, September 14, the Windsor police, pursuing their investigation of the automobile agency break, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>learned from the manager of the Statler that the occupant of Room 1540 was one \u201cFred Herter\u201d who had registered the night of September 11; and one of the clerks at the Statler told the police, \u201cThere was a man there with a bandage on his face.\u201d Three Windsor police officers, together with a Hartford police detective, thereupon went to the Statler in Hartford (7 miles from Windsor) where they arrived at 9:15 A.M. They had neither a search warrant nor an arrest warrant. Accompanied by the manager, the four police officers proceeded to Room 1540 and knocked several times on the door. There was no response, although movements in the room were heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">One of the police officers went to a house phone 40 or 50 feet down the hall and called Room 1540. When the occupant answered, the officer said, \u201cThis is the police; we would like to come in and talk to you.\u201d The occupant replied, \u201cAll right.\u201d After the occupant opened the door and before the officers entered, they again identified themselves as policemen and again asked permission to enter. The occupant said, \u201cCome on in.\u201d As they entered the room, the officers explained they were investigating several burglaries in the area and asked permission to look around the room. The occupant said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As the door to the room was opened, one of the officers noticed a 3\" x 1%\" bandage over the occupant\u2019s right forehead. Another of the officers testified that when he saw the freshly bandaged cut on the occupant\u2019s head as he opened the door, he \u201cfelt 99 per cent sure\u201d that the occupant was the man they were looking for in connection with the automobile agency break.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Upon entering the room, the officers saw protruding from an open bureau drawer a money bag which proved to be the one taken from the automobile agency. Once the police were in the room, upon request of one of them, the occupant pointed to a gun under the bed which turned out to be the one taken from the automobile agency. They also discovered in the room the fishing pole and tackle box which had been taken from the garage adjoining the bank the night the bank was entered. Several rolls of coins were found in the room which later were traced to the bank which was entered the night of September 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The occupant of the room was formally arrested by one of the Windsor police officers immediately upon discovery of the money bag. He was taken to Hartford police headquarters and booked on the charge of breaking and entering the automobile agency; later that day he was taken to Windsor and booked on the same charge. The following morning, September 15, the occupant, having been identified as appellant on the basis of the name found in his wallet in the room at the Statler, was arraigned in the State Circuit Court at Enfield on the same charge and was remanded to the State Jail at Hartford. The following day, September 16, he was interviewed by two FBI agents who obtained his fingerprints, under circumstances related below, to compare them with fingerprints discovered at the bank after its entry. Appellant was indicted by a Federal grand jury on September 18 on the charge of entering the bank with intent to commit a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Pursuant to Rule 41(e), Fed.R.Crim. P., appellant moved to suppress the evidence seized from his hotel room, including the money taken from the bank, the gun, ammunition and money bag taken from the automobile agency two nights later and the fishing pole and tackle box taken from the garage adjoining the bank the night the bank was entered, all of which was either directly or circumstantially relevant and material (its competence being the ground of objection) to connecting appellant with the offense of entering the bank. After a full evidenti-ary hearing before trial, the motion to suppress was denied on the ground appellant voluntarily consented to the search. At the trial, a renewed motion to suppress was denied and the evidence was admitted over appellant\u2019s objection. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>hold that Judge Clarie\u2019s rulings in each instance were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\n<em>Voluntary Consent to Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In upholding voluntary consents to search, we have said that \u201cOf course the search and seizure in each case must stand or fall on its own special facts, and in the district court\u2019s judgment of the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d United States v. Dornblut, 261 F.2d 949, 950-951 (2 Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 912, 79 S.Ct. 1298, 3 L.Ed.2d 1262 (1959), and that \u201cA consent is not a voluntary one if it is the product of duress or coercion, actual or implicit. Moreover, to be voluntary, a consent must have been unequivocal, specific, and intelligently given.\u201d United States v. Smith, 308 F.2d 657, 663 (2 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 906, 83 S.Ct. 717, 9 L.Ed.2d 716 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Appellant need not have had a positive desire that the search be conducted in order for his consent to have been voluntary and effective. He had three opportunities to object to the entrance and search by the police. Each time, in response to the requests of the police to enter his room or to look around, he replied, \u201cAll right,\u201d \u201cCome on in,\u201d or \u201cGo ahead.\u201d The record is devoid of any evidence of displeasure on his part. Nor was there any evidence of exhaustive questioning, persistent demands or coercive action on the part of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Appellant testified, at the hearing before trial on the motion to suppress, that he did not object because it would have been ineffectual. From our perspective his permissive attitude may seem foolhardy; it is on this basis that we are asked to draw an inference of coercion. Perhaps there is a coercive effect inherently produced when several police officers, with their uniforms and accompanying paraphernalia, confront a suspect and ask for permission to search. To sustain such a claim of coercion, absent any coercive words or acts by the police, would preclude a voluntary consent to search whenever more than one armed police officer confronts a suspect; it is only their number, their equipment and the fact they were police that appellant claims adds up to coercion. We refuse to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Appellant had to make a hurried choice. He lacked knowledge as to whether the police were searching the entire hotel or had focused on him. He knew nothing of the police discovery of the room receipt, of the bloodstains at the'automobile agency, of the indication that the room occupant had a bandage on his face or of the money bag protruding from the open bureau drawer. It is irrelevant whether appellant consented in the hope that the officers were only routinely checking the hotel and would-move on, or because he believed the police had caught up with him and his best course would be to cooperate. In either circumstance his consent was \u201cunequivocal, specific and intelligently given.\u201d On the facts of this case, Judge Clarie properly denied the motion to suppress after hearing the evidence and evaluating the credibility of the witnesses; and he correctly admitte'd the seized evidence at the trial over objection. United States v. Smith, supra at 663-664; United States v. Dornblut, supra at 950-951; United States v. Bracer, 342 F.2d 522, 524-525 (2 Cir. 1965); United States v. Simpson, 353 F.2d 530, 531 (2 Cir. 1965); United States v. Ziemer, 291 F.2d 100 (7 Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 877, 82 S.Ct. 120, 7 L.Ed.2d 78 (1961); cf. United States v. Page, 302 F.2d 81 (9 Cir. 1962) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">We are mindful of the importance of careful delineation of the facts of a case such as the instant one, where the district court\u2019s finding of voluntary consent to search was based on a consent which was unequivocal, specific and intelligently given, from cases where the consent to search was the product of deceit and coercion, actual or implicit, rather than an understanding and intentional waiver of a constitutional right. Compare Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948); Amos v. United States, 255 U.S. 313, 41 S.Ct. 266, 65 L.Ed. 654 (1921); Gouled v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>States, 255 U.S. 298, 303-306, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647 (1921); United States v. Como, 340 F.2d 891 (2 Cir. 1965); United States v. Gregory, 204 F.Supp. 884 (S.D.N.Y.1962), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 309 F.2d 536 (2 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 953, 83 S.Ct. 1684, 10 L.Ed.2d 707 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">This is another sensitive area where constant vigilance is required to maintain the delicately calibrated balance between the rights of the individual suspected or accused of crime and the rights of society to be protected from criminal interference with its liberty and property. Cf. United States v. Cone, 354 F.2d 119, 128 (2 Cir. 1965) (en banc); United States v. Robinson, 354 F.2d 109, 114-115 (2 Cir. 1965) (en banc); United States v. Drummond, 354 F.2d 132, 143 (2 Cir. 1965) (en banc). In dealing with the difficult issues of a voluntary consent to search, we have observed that \u201cin few branches of the law is a precise case by case analysis and meticulous comparison of precedential authority so essential.\u201d United States v. Como, supra at 893. We think it also important in this process of defining the permissible bounds of searches and seizures to make clear what we believe to be correct police procedure, as we have not hesitated to condemn it when wrong. The instant case is part of a swelling wave of federal bank robberies which has been engulfing the Country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The tools the police most need and deserve to cope with this emergency are guideline decisions from the courts telling them what is right as well as what is wrong with their procedure so that they may get on with their job intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">We think the police work in the instant case was commendable. The bank entry in North Thompsonville occurred Friday night, September 11; no clues were left. The breaking and entry at the automobile agency in Windsor came two nights later, Sunday night, September 13; the only clues were the receipt for Room 1540 at the Statler in Hartford, bloodstains near the broken window and the missing gun, ammunition and money bag \u2014 all of which the Windsor police learned about at 8 A. M. on Monday, September 14. An hour later the Windsor police and a Hartford detective were at Room 1540, accompanied by the Statler manager. The steps which the police pursued in gaining entrance to the hotel room, searching it, seizing the contraband and arresting appellant speak for themselves in reflecting credit upon police activity of the highest order.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\n<em>Search Incidental to Lawful Arrest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">While we uphold Judge Clarie\u2019s ruling that the evidence in question was seized pursuant to a voluntary consent to search, we note that the record also would support a holding that the search was permissible as an incident to a lawful arrest. United States v. Simpson, supra; United States v. Hall, 348 F.2d 837, 841-842, 843 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 408, 15 L.Ed.2d 355 (1965); United States v. Bracer, supra at 523-524; United States v. Smith, supra at 661-663.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Although formal announcement of appellant\u2019s arrest was made upon discovery of the money bag protruding from the bureau drawer in the hotel room, actually his arrest was complete as soon as the police entered the room and restricted his liberty of movement. Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 103, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959); United States v. Boston, 330 F.2d 937, 939 (2 Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 1004, 84 S.Ct. 1940, 12 L.Ed.2d 1053 (1964). Immediately upon entering the room, the police told appellant not to move. Although no force was used to obtain entry or after entry, appellant considered himself under restraint for he requested and obtained permission to get dressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"> Appellant having been arrested immediately upon entry of the police into the hotel room, the question arises whether there was probable cause for the arrest at or before that time and without regard to what the subsequent search disclosed. Henry v. United States, supra at 103; Johnson v. United States, supra at 14-17; United States v. Boston, supra at 938-939. Before entering the hotel room, the police inferred, on the basis of the receipt for Room 1540 found under the window through which the break at the automobile agency had been made, that the occupant of the hotel room may have had something to do with that crime. Strong corroboration for such inference is found in the information given to the police by one of the Statler clerks that the occupant of Room 1540 had a bandage on his face, coupled with the police knowledge that bloodstains had been found near the broken window at the automobile agency. Moreover, although the police did not intend to arrest appellant when they went to Room 1540, one of the officers said he felt 99 per cent sure that appellant was the man they were looking for in connection with the automobile agency br\u00e9ale when appellant opened the door and the officer saw the bandage on appellant\u2019s head. This was more than mere suspicion; and certainty is not required for a finding of probable cause. Henry v. United States, supra at 101-104; Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 311-312, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed. 2d 327 (1959); United States v. Heitner, 149 F.2d 105, 106 (2 Cir. 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\"> There was probable cause for appellant\u2019s arrest; and the search, aside from having been consented to, may be sustained on the alternative ground of being a reasonable one<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> incidental to a lawful arrest. Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 367, 84 S.Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>2d 777 (1964); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 34-37, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed. 2d 726 (1963); United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 60-66, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950); Brinegar v.

Bracer, supra at 523-524; United States v. Boston, supra at 938-939; United States v. Williams, 336 F.2d 183 (2 Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 857, 85 S.Ct. 112, 13 L.Ed.2d 60 (1964); United States v. Wai Lau, 329 F.2d 310 (2 Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 856, 85 S.Ct. 108, 13 L.Ed.2d 59 (1964); United States v. Smith, supra at 661-663; Crawford v. Bannan, 336 F.2d 505 (6 Cir. 1964); Bartlett v. United States, 232 F.2d 135, 138-139 (5 Cir. 1956); United States v. Lodewijkx, 230 F.Supp. 212, 217-218 (S.D.N.Y.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">As a second string to his bow, appellant argues that even if there was probable cause for the arrest it was unlawful because made in Hartford by a Windsor police officer outside of his precinct (referring to the Town of Windsor) m violation of the Connecticut Arrest Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> State law is controlling on this issue of the validity of an arrest without a warrant absent an applicable federal statute. United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 589-590, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948); United States v. Viale, 312 F.2d 595, 599 (2 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 903, 83 S.Ct. 1291, 10 L.Ed.2d 199 (1963). The Connecticut courts, so far as we can determine, have not ruled upon the issue here presented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The second clause of the first sentence of \u00a7 6-49 (the italicized portion of the statute printed in the margin) clearly authorizes any state police officer, local police officer or county detective to arrest without a warrant <em>any place in the State </em>any person who he has reasonable grounds to believe has committed or is committing a felony; \u201creasonable grounds\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d in this context have substantially the same meaning. United States v. Boston, supra at 938 n. 1. The limitation in the first clause of the first sentence of \u00a7 6-49 to warrantless arrests \u201cin their respective precincts\u201d applies (i) to the arresting officers specified in that clause <em>and </em>(ii) to suspects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>taken or apprehended in the act or on the speedy information of others. The second and third sentences of \u00a7 6-49, added in 1961 by Public Act 239, authorize local police officers, in immediate pursuit of anyone they are empowered to arrest under this statute, to pursue such person any place in the State to arrest him, and to return him to the place of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Appellant\u2019s arrest was clearly lawful under the Connecticut Arrest Law. At the time of his arrest in the hotel room in Hartford, the police (three from Windsor and one from Hartford<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) had probable cause, as we have held above, to arrest him; that is to say, in the statutory language of \u00a7 6-49, the police had reasonable grounds to believe he had committed a felony. The offense of which he was suspected \u2014 breaking and entering the automobile agency in Windsor\u2014 is a felony under Conn.Gen.Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20141, 53-76, 53-77, 53-78 (1958). After being arrested and booked at Hartford popolice headquarters, he was taken the same morning to Windsor police headquarters where he was booked again.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Fingerprint Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant claims that \u201cmajor case fingerprints\u201d taken by two FBI agents from appellant while he was held at the Hartford State Jail on September 16, two days after his arrest, were erroneously admitted over his objection because obtained as the tainted fruit of his unlawful arrest and detention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Having held that appellant\u2019s arrest was lawful, we turn directly to his claim that he was unlawfully detained at the time the fingerprints in question were taken.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The short answer to appellant\u2019s claim of unlawful detention on September 16 is that he had been arraigned the previous day, September 15, at 10 A.M. in the State Circuit Court at Enfield, at which time, among other things, counsel had been appointed to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Appellant argues that unnecessary and unreasonable delay until the morning of September 15 in arraigning him, having been arrested by Windsor and Hartford police the previous morning, resulted in an illegal detention on September 15 which somehow carried over to invalidate his detention on September 16 when the fingerprints were taken by FBI agents, even though subsequent to arraignment. Without accepting appellant's conclusion, there is no merit whatsoever in his premise that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>there Was unnecessary and unreasonable delay in arraigning him, even assuming that cooperation (for which there is no support in the record) between state and federal officials resulted in his detention during the 24 hour period prior to arraignment. Cf. United States v. Coppola, 281 F.2d 340 (2 Cir. 1960) (en banc), aff\u2019d, 365 U.S. 762, 81 S.Ct. 884, 6 L.Ed.2d 79 (1961). The sole purpose of appellant\u2019s detention between his arrest on September 14 and his arraignment on September 15 was investigatory \u2014 to question him, to check his story and to run down leads either confirming or contradicting his story. Cf. United States v. Middleton, 344 F.2d 78, 83 (2 Cir. 1965); United States ex rel. Corbo v. LaVallee, 270 F.2d 513, 518 (2 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 950, 80 S.Ct. 403, 4 L.Ed.2d 382 (1960). The reasonableness and necessity of the period during which this investigation continued is borne out by the number of offenses of which he was suspected (three breaks and entries, in addition to the bank entry), the fact he had used a fictitious name and the fact he had escaped three days before the bank entry from a mental institution apparently without knowledge of that institution. The purpose of his detention was not to keep him in custody for an indefinite period until he confessed; in fact, no claim is raised on this appeal of any alleged confession obtained during his detention other than the fingerprints taken after he was arraigned. Appellant\u2019s detention prior to arraignment was not unlawful. United States v. Hall, 348 F.2d 837, 842-843 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 408, 15 L.Ed.2d 355 (1965); United States v. Middleton, supra at 82-83; United States v. Vita, 294 F.2d 524 (2 Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 823, 82 S.Ct. 837, 7 L.Ed.2d 788 (1962); United States v. Ladson, 294 F.2d 535 (2 Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 824, 82 S.Ct. 840, 7 L.Ed.2d 789 (1962); United States v. Coppola, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">We hold that appellant\u2019s fingerprints were not obtained as the product of an unlawful arrest or detention and therefore were properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether appellant freely consented to the taking of the fingerprints in question after being fully informed of his rights and of the purpose for which the fingerprints were sought, although we do note there is substantial evidence that he did so consent. Moreover, we need not, and therefore do not, reach the question whether fingerprints obtained during detention following an unlawful arrest are necessarily inadmissible. See Bynum v. United States, 262 F.2d 465 (D.C.Cir. 1958); Note, Excluding From Evidence Fingerprints Taken After an Unlawful Arrest, 69 Yale L.J. 432 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Insufficiency of Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Finally, appellant claims that the indictment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> failed to charge an offense against the United States in that, in charging that appellant entered the bank \u201cwith intent to commit in such bank a felony affecting such bank, that is, the taking of money in excess of $100.00 from the said bank,\u201d the indictment did not charge the essential elements of a federal felony affecting such bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">The indictment charged an offense under, and in the language of, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) \u00b6 2,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that appellant entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>bank with intent to commit in the bank a felony affecting such bank in violation of -a federal statute. Specifying the \u201cfelony affecting such bank,\u201d the indictment went on to add, \u201cthat is, the taking of money in excess of $100.00 from the said bank,\u201d intending to incorporate the offense covered by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b) \u00b6 1.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In omitting the essential element of \u201cintent to steal\u201d from its specification of the \u00a7 2113(b) \u00b6 1 offense, the indictment certainly was defective. At best the indictment was poorly drawn;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> at worst it did not constitute a \u201cplain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged,\u201d Rule 7(c), Fed.R.Crim.P., and as such would have warranted corrective action by the district court upon a timely motion to dismiss, Rule 12(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., or a motion for a bill of particulars, Rule 7(f), Fed.R. Crim.P. No such motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The case was tried by both sides upon the clear understanding that the \u201cfelony affecting such bank\u201d referred to in the indictment was the offense specified in \u00a7 2113(b) \u00b6 1. Judge Clarie so charged the jury. Among the essential elements carefully included in the charge was that of intent to steal. Compare United States v. Byrd, 352 F.2d 570 (2 Cir. 1965). No exceptions were taken to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the indictment did not charge an offense against the United States was first made on a motion in arrest of judgment, Rule 34, Fed.R.Crim.P., filed five days after conclusion, of the trial and six months after the indictment was returned. The claim came too late. Technically, a claim that the indictment does not charge an offense may be raised on a motion in arrest of judgment and such motion was made in time here. But the courts of the United States long ago withdrew their hospitality toward technical claims of invalidity of an indictment first raised after trial, absent a clear showing of substantial prejudice to the accused\u2014 such as a showing that the indictment is \u201cso obviously defective that by no reasonable construction can it be said to charge the offense for which conviction was had.\u201d Finn v.

Donlin, 151 Conn. 402, 409, 198 A.2d 700, 704 (1964), cited by appellee, holds no more than the statute says, namely, that even though a police officer did not see a suspect commit a felony or receive speedy information to that effect, he could still make a lawful arrest without a warrant if he had reasonable grounds to believe the suspect has committed or is committing a felony (second clause of first sentence of \u00a7 6-49).</p>\n<p id=\"ayp-dedup-0\">See Burke v.

The presence of a Hartford police detective. together with the three Windsor police officers, when the police entered the room and restricted appellant\u2019s liberty of movement' \u2014 thus completing appellant\u2019s arrest as we have held above\u2014 would make the arrest lawful even under appellant\u2019s erroneous reliance on the first clause of the first sentence of \u00a7 6-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">. Appellant argues that, under Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), any evidence obtained as the product of an unlawful arrest (without a warrant when there was time to obtain one) should be excluded for the same reasons that the fruit of an illegal search and seizure is excluded, the Fourth Amendment requiring the same standards for testing an unlawful arrest as an unlawful search and seizure. We have recently considered and rejected this argument, noting that it \u201cwould impose on the law of arrest a requirement thus far confined to the law of search and seizure\u201d and that \u201cit does not follow that the test of propriety with respect to the two subjects has been or should be precisely the same.\u201d United States v. Hall, 348 F.2d 837, 841 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 408, 15 L.Ed.2d 355 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b276-14\">. Appellant raises no claim regarding the routine fingerprints taken from him when he was booked at Hartford police headquarters on September 14 immediately following his arrest and those taken later the same day when he was booked at Windsor police headquarters, in each instance prior to his arraignment in the State Circuit Court. Taking of such fingerprints was proper as a \u201cmethod of identifying persons charged with crime which has now become widely known and frequently practiced both in jurisdictions where there are statutory provisions regulating it and where it has no sanction other than the common law.\u201d United States v.

We regret that we feel constrained to deny Mr. Heiman\u2019s motion (which we invited at the time of the argument) to reappoint him as counsel for appellant effective as of a date subsequent to August 20, 1965 so that he might apply for compensation for services rendered appellant on this appeal pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act, IS U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A. Upon the discharge of appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel in the District Court, Judge Clarie appointed Mr. Heiman on May 10, 1965 to represent appellant on appeal. The bulk of his work, including preparation of the brief and arguing the appeal, was done subsequent to August 20, 1965, the effective date of the plans of this Court and the District Court under the Criminal Justice Act. Once appointed by the District Court, he was required to continue to represent appellant unless or until he was relieved by this Court (Connecticut District Court Plan, Article V, Section (C)); hence no further order of appointment by this Court was required to authorize him to represent appellant in this Court. And he is on the panel of counsel designated by this Court from which appointments are made to represent appellants in this Court. The sole reason for our denying his motion is that, although the services for which he wishes to be compensated were rendered subsequent to August 20, 1965, his appointment was prior thereto. In administering funds appropriated by Congress, we are not authorized to approve payments for services rendered or for reimbursement of expenses incurred unless the services were rendered or the expenses were incurred pursuant to an order appointing counsel entered on or after August 20, 1965. Entry now of a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order of reappointment as of a date subsequent to August 20, 1965 to permit compensation for services rendered subsequent thereto would be contrary to what we understand to be the intention of Congress with respect to the administration of funds appropriated under the Criminal Justice Act. The motion accordingly is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">Our denial of Mr. Heiman\u2019s motion for reappointment as' counsel for appellant, however, is without prejudice to his filing an application pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of this Court for reimbursement (out of the fund of admission fees held by the clerk) for his out-of-pocket expenses incurred as assigned counsel in representing an indigent person.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
