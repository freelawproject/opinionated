Subsequently two other parties filed like applications. A \u201ccomparative hearing\u201d was held which ultimately culminated in the granting of the permit to Loyola. Loyola University, et al., 12 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R. 1017 (1956), rehearing denied, 12 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R. 1116a (1957), aff\u2019d sub nom. Noe v. Federal Communications Commission, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 221, 260 F.2d 739 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 924, 79 S.Ct. 607, 3 L.Ed.2d 627 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">Among the subjects considered by the Commission in reaching its decision was that of \u201clocal live programming,\u201d including local live musical programming. In its application and during the comparative hearing, Loyola presented its programming plans, including its proposal to broadcast live programs utilizing local musical talent. Members of the AFM Local voluntarily supported the application by aiding Loyola in the preparation and production of various musical programming proposals. The Commission\u2019s final decision granting the application to Loyola did not accord it any preference over the other applicants on the basis of its programming proposals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">Loyola commenced operation of station WWL-TV on September 6, 1957, received a license to cover its construction permit on March 5, 1959, and on March 3, 1961, filed its first license renewal application. On April 25, 1961, AFM filed a petition to deny the renewal application, pursuant to Section 309(d) (1) of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1085, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (1) (1964).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Appellants\u2019 petition to deny raised a question of \u201cpromise versus performance,\u201d <em>id est, </em>whether Loyola\u2019s actual operation with respect to its broadcast of live programs (particularly live musical programs) during the preceding license period conformed to the program proposals set forth in its original construction permit application. AFM contended that Loyola had represented in its 1952 application and at the comparative hearing that it would devote 24.27% of its broadcast time to local live programming, while in the license period it actually devoted only 11.6% of its broadcast time to such programs. It was further asserted that whereas Loyola had promised 38 local live programs using community talent, 13 of which would use musical talent, including- a staff orchestra, Loyola never in fact employed a staff orchestra, and actually hired only one staff organist in the entire period, and that he was released early in the license period.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Loyola\u2019s promise for the future in its 1961 renewal application was that it would provide 17.3% live programming. AFM made no showing that the projected programming proposals contained in the 1961 renewal application were contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On December 17,1962, the Commission unanimously decided to dismiss AFM\u2019s petition to deny on the ground that the union lacked standing as a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the Communications Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Commission, on its own motion, considered the merits of the petition as well as the station\u2019s overall programming performance. On the basis of its independent review and inquiry into Loyola\u2019s past programming proposals and its overall programming performance, the Commission found a \u201csubstantial variance\u201d between the previous programming proposals and the actual performance during the license period. Accordingly, the Commission held that a short-term grant for a period of one year, instead of the normal three-year term, would best serve the public interest. It noted that its decision was based on the station\u2019s overall performance in rendering a diversified program service, and was not grounded on any one aspect of its programming. The unions did not request the Commission to reconsider its decision nor did they seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s final order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">On September 3, 1963, Loyola filed its second license renewal application, the grant of which is being challenged by this appeal. AFM again filed a petition to deny. On May 12, 1965, the Commission unanimously granted the application of Loyola University for renewal of the license and dismissed AFM\u2019s petition to deny.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>held that AFM failed to meet the standard necessary to confer standing as a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d Notwithstanding the lack of standing finding, the Commission, on its own motion, again considered the merits of the petition to deny. On the basis of its review of the record, it held that Loyola had substantially complied with the live programming proposals contained in the 1961 application (17.3% promise versus 16.14% performance). The Commission determined that a grant of the renewal application for the full three-year term would serve the public interest, since Loyola had satisfactorily resolved the promise versus performance question which had previously resulted in the limited one-year grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The issues which the parties have stipulated to on this appeal are: (1) Does AFM have standing to file a petition to deny Loyola\u2019s license, <em>id est, </em>are they \u201cparties in interest\u201d within the meaning of Section 309(d) (1) of the Communications Act? (2) Did the Commission err in refusing to designate for an evidenti-ary hearing Loyola\u2019s 1963 renewal application pursuant to Section 309 of the Communications Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">AFM\u2019s position on the standing issue is, in summary, that it is a \u201cparty in interest\u201d because it has a direct and substantial economic interest in the employment of musicians by television stations in their live presentations; that this economic interest has been injured by Loyola\u2019s failure to program more live music and to use union musicians to the degree that it had promised; and that this economic interest is \u201cplainly sufficient\u201d to qualify the unions to participate in administrative proceedings. The unions also urge that they properly represent the public interest in local, live musical programming and this suffices as an additional basis to support a \u201cparty in interest\u201d finding. With respect to the question of the holding of an evi-dentiary hearing, AFM argues that the record presented \u201csubstantial and material questions of fact\u201d and that the public interest would be served by the holding of a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Both the Commission and intervenor argue that appellants\u2019 economic interest in the employment of professional musicians is not sufficient to confer standing, that the legislative history of the amendments to the Communications Act clearly negatives appellants\u2019 \u201crepresentative of the public interest\u201d argument,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that there were no \u201csubstantial and material questions of fact,\u201d and consequently that no hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Although this case presents some interesting and intriguing questions which were briefed extensively with much skill by all counsel concerned, the judicial function is best served, we believe, when appellate decision, after appropriate review, is limited to only those questions necessary to decide the case (except, of course, in extraordinary circumstances, which we do not find here). Accordingly, we confine our consideration to the limited questions of whether appellants, by their failure to seek review of the Commission\u2019s 1962 decision and order granting the one-year renewal, waived their right to complain at some later date about errors they may have believed to exist at that time, or whether, in any event, the Commission erred in failing to direct that an evidentiary hearing be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">In order to properly decide the first question, it is necessary to consider it in the factual context within which it arose. In its 1962 decision granting Loyola the limited one-year renewal, the Commission noted \u201csubstantial deviations in your record of program representations and performance.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission found that Loyola\u2019s attempt to \u201cupgrade\u201d its programming at renewal time in an effort to improve its performance posture did not obviate the serious questions raised by the substantial deviations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>found. The Commission determined that extraordinary action was necessary to rectify the disparities and therefore granted the limited one-year renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">That appellants were put to a difficult policy decision by the Commission\u2019s decision is abundantly clear. In essence, this decision was whether to seek review immediately, attempting to set aside both the no-standing finding and the one-year grant made without evidentiary hearing, or to adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d position and file another petition to deny if the promise versus performance rating did not improve.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants certainly must have been aware of the risk inherent in such an approach, <em>id est, </em>that Loyola\u2019s performance might improve substantially to the point where the Commission would grant a full three-year license renewal, but that this still might not be satisfactory performance from the point of view of the unions, especially in view of the earlier promises. In point of fact, this is precisely what happened, Loyola\u2019s performance percentage rising to 16.14% compared to its 1961 renewal promise of 17.3%.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Appellants attempt to overcome this problem by arguing that the post-1961 performance should not be compared to the 1961 promise, but rather, that Loyola should be held to its 1952 construction application promise of 24.27% live pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>gramming. If such a figure were used, there would then be a difference of 16.14% performance as compared to 24.27% promise, a deviation of a much more serious magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">In considering the case on the merits in 1965, the Commission determined to renew Loyola\u2019s application for a full three years, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">\u201con the basis of over-all program performance, and in the absence of a question of substantial variance between program performance and the program proposals <em>in the 1961 application for renewal </em>we today granted the application of Loyola University * * 5 R.R.2d at 240. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Appellants would have us reverse the Commission\u2019s determination to utilize the 1961 promise figures, and require that Loyola be strictly held to its earlier promises. This court, however, is not .persuaded to adopt such a course.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">We hold that by failing to seek review of the 1962 decision, appellants are now foreclosed from asserting the 1952 promise percentages as the basis for comparison with the post-1961 performance figures. In so holding, we note that appellants\u2019 situation is not unlike that of the appellant in Colorado Radio Corp. v. F. C. C., 73 App.D.C. 225, 227, 118 F.2d 24, 26 (1941), wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\">\u201cWe cannot allow the appellant to sit back and hope that a decision will be in its. favor and then, when it is-n\u2019t, to parry with an offer of more evidence. No judging process in any branch of government could operate efficiently or accurately if such a procedure were allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">And compare Albertson v. F. C. C., 100 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 105, 106, 243 F.2d 209, 211, 212 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Appellants had an opportunity available to them in 1962 to seek review of the case as it then stood, including the question of their status as a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Failing that, appellants are now bound by events which have transpired since that time. Cf. WLIL, Inc. v. F. C. C., 122 U.S.App.D.C. -, 352 F.2d 722 (1965); Valley Telecasting Co. v. F. C. C., 118 U.S.App.D.C. 410, 336 F.2d 914 (1964); Springfield Television Broadcasting Corp. v. F. C. C., 117 U.S.App.D.C. 214, 328 F.2d 186 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">The other question posed for our consideration \u2014 whether the Commission erred in failing to order an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Section 309\u2014 is similarly without merit. This question falls clearly within that area where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-17\">\u201ccustomary deference [is given] by us to the Commission\u2019s judgments so long as they are supported by substantial evidence of record.\u201d Deep South Broadcasting Co. v. F. C. C., 120 U.S.App.D.C. 365, 347 F.2d 459, 460 (1965) (dictum). South Florida Television Corp. v. F. C. C., 121 U.S.App.D.C. 293, 295, 349 F.2d 971, 973 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-18\">As previously noted, Section 309 of the Communications Act specifies that an application may be granted without hearing unless \u201ca substantial and material question of fact is presented,\u201d or the Commission is otherwise unable to find that a grant would serve the public interest, convenience or necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-19\">On the basis of our review of the record in this case, we do not find any substantial or material questions of fact, nor can we say that the Commission\u2019s decision does not \u201cserve the public interest, convenience, or necessity.\u201d To so find would be to hold that the unions should be rewarded for their dilatoriness and that Loyola should be held strictly in the period after 1961 to its promises made in 1952. Such an approach ignores the fact that change in station programming really</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>\u201cpoints up the impracticability of expecting an applicant to give absolute assurance that some several years after filing of its application it will effect the exact operation originally proposed.\u201d WJR, The Goodwill Station, Inc., 16 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R. 321, 351.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Static and unchanging programming policies are not necessarily a good thing for the \u201cpublic interest, necessity and convenience.\u201d As the Commission has observed, \u201ca station * * * must necessarily change to meet changing community conditions.\u201d Columbia Amusement Co., 12 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R. 509, 567. Also, \u201cconsiderable flexibility and discretion [in the area of programming] is not only permitted but called for in the public interest.\u201d KORD, Inc., 21 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R. 781, 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Loyola promised 17.3% live programming in 1961 and it achieved 16.14%. Clearly there was no error in the Commission\u2019s determination that there was not substantial deviation warranting denial of renewal. The decision of the Commission must therefore be</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-11\">.

Loyola did establish preferences over the other applicants on the basis of its past record of performance in the operation of' standard broadcast station WWL, as well as on the issue of diversification of media of mass communication. Although there appears to be some controversy among the parties on the question, it is clear from the record that the preference for <em>local live programming </em>did not go to Loyola, but rather to one of its competitor-applicants, the Times-Picayune Publishing Co., 12 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R. 1104-1106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-18\">. \u201c\u00a7 309(d) (1) Any party in interest may file with the Commission a petition to deny any application (whether as originally filed or as amended) to which subsection (b) of this section applies at any time prior to the day of Commission grant thereof without hearing or the day of formal designation thereof for hearing; except that with respect to any classification of applications, the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>mission from time to time by rule may specify a shorter period (no less than thirty days following the issuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial amendment thereof), which shorter period shall be reasonably related to the time when the applications would normally be reached for processing.

Appellants now say that it was their willingness to give Loyola another chance that excuses their failure to seek review of the one-year renewal order. But this hardly squares with a realistic view of appellants\u2019 interest. That interest has only an incidental relationship to live local programming in the abstract. It is rather \u2014 and very properly so in view of appellants\u2019 organizational purposes \u2014 \u2022 an interest in live local programs using paid professional musicians. This is clear from appellants\u2019 statement in the supplement to the petition to deny that \u201cits [intervenor\u2019s] use of any local musical talent seems to be limited to amateurs appearing on special programs * * *. Despite its promises at a comparative hearing which were relied on by the Commission in granting it a construction permit, [intervenor] still does not employ any professional musicians.\u201d And, in the reply to intervenor\u2019s opposition, appellants summed up their grievance in these terms: \u201cDespite its promises to the Commission, [intervenor] has not, in fact, used and paid local, live professional musicians to produce local, live musical programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">This was the gravamen of appellants\u2019 complaint when they sought to intervene at the time Loyola\u2019s license first came up for renewal. There was no question then that there was a gap between inter-venor\u2019s promise and its performance with respect to live programs using professional musicians. There was equally no question as to intervenor\u2019s program intentions for the future if its license were renewed, whether for one year or three. Those intentions did not include the use of professional musicians in local, live musical programs. This was apparent throughout the renewal proceedings, for intervenor sought to justify its failure to use professional musicians as a deliberate judgment, arrived at in terms of effective programming and business practicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Thus, when the one-year renewal order was forthcoming, appellants had no reason to think that the probationary period would see any improvement in the situation <em>vis-a^vis </em>professional musicians. Indeed, what appellants isolate as indicating a variance between promise and performance are the original representations as to professional musicians made by intervenor at the time it obtained its construction permit. The Commission apparently regarded that precise issue as over the dam and, at the next renewal hearing, did not expect to measure intervenor\u2019s performance by reference to its use of professional musicians. It was then that appellants\u2019 interest, as a matter of practical effect, was most sharply in conflict with the Commission\u2019s action; and it was then that appellants most appropriately should have pressed their claim that that interest was entitled to recognition as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b883-14\">. As noted, Loyola had begun upgrading its program performance shortly before filing the application for license renewal. Since the grant was limited to a one-year period, and not the theretofore almost automatic three-year renewal, appellants should have foreseen that Loyola would not allow this valuable broadcast asset to be placed in further jeopardy, but that Loyola would heed the warning implicit in the limited grant by bringing its promise versus performance percentages more into line.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b884-12\">.
