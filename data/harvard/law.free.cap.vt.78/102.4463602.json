The State\u2019s evidence did not tend to show more than six offences of selling or furnishing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b119-5\">The exceptions do not state whether a foundation for the admission of the hostile statements referred tO' in1 the opinion was laid or required to be laid. In respect of this exception, the bill of exceptions states only that certain specified persons were witnesses for the State; that the respondent, as part of his defence, offered to show that .those witnesses made out of court certain specified statements of hostility to him; that this offer was excluded, to which respondent excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-6\"><em>Taylor &amp; Dutton </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">It was error to exclude respondent\u2019s offer that the witnesses for the State had m\u00e1de the specified hostile statements out of court. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Gilson, </em>9 Vt. 222; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>35 Vt. 340; <em>Ellsworth </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>41 Vt. 689; 1 Greenl.

The only effect of such evidence would have been to impeach, the witnesses, and no foundation was laid for its admission. <em>State </em>v. <em>Glynn, </em>51 Vt. 577; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Tupper, </em>58 Vt. 409.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>RowEEE, C.

It not appearing that such foundation was laid, no error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The court sufficiently charged that each offence must be found on the evidence that particularly related to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The other questions are like some of those in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barr </em>and Pianfetti, ante. p. 97, and are decided against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Judgment that there is no error, and that the respondent take nothing by his exceptions.
