H. Dubois; defence, that by an agreement with Dubois the defendant had a right to sell the wagons, also-, that\u2019 the plaintiff bought them with knowledge of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The court instructed the jury that, as the plaintiff had alleged fraud in the sale, the burden was upon him to prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. The plaintiff contends that this was error; that, as the defendant had attempted to justify .the sale upon the ground of the mortgagee\u2019s permission, the burden was upon him to' prove such permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>When the defendant had introduced evidence tending to prove the fact of permission, the burden was upon the plaintiff to overcome this evidence by a greater weight of his evidence in order to establish his claim of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The record of the trial is not before us, but presumably the plaintiff proved the allegations in his declaration, and, resting there, was entitled to a verdict. The defendant did not set up an affirmative defence,, but sought to relieve -the case of the element of fraud claimed by the plaintiff to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Fraud is not presumed, but must be proved; therefore the plaintiff was bound to maintain the affirmative of the issue tendered in his declaration. It is the rule that the obligation of proving a fact rests upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue, i Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 74; <em>Bosworth </em>v. Bancroft, 74 Vt. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The burden of proof, in the sense of the duty of producing evidence, may pass from one party to the other as a case progresses, while the burden of proof, meaning the obligation to establish the truth of the claim upon which the plaintiff\u2019s case rests, is upon him throughout the trial.
