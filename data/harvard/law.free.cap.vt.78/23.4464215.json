The defendant\u2019s director replied that he was not empowered to make any contract for the board. The defendant\u2019s directors did not, during the time in question, designate any school for their children to attend. Children residing in the defendant town continued to' attend the plaintiff\u2019s schools, and the plaintiff furnished them; such instruction as the defendant was bound to provide relying upon the notice given by one of its-directors to one of the defendant\u2019s directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">It not appearing that there was an express promise by the defendant\u2019s directors to pay for instruction, the defendant insists that there can be no recovery. But it is not necessary that such a promise should be shown. The facts and circumstances appearing show a contract in fact, and this is sufficient. <em>Parkhurst </em>v. <em>Krellinger, </em>69 Vt., 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The notice given, by one of the plaintiff\u2019s directors of the action of the plaintiff\u2019s directors, in regard to the price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>for tuition to be thereafter paid, to one of the defendant\u2019s directors, was notice to the defendant\u2019s directors; and the defendant\u2019s directors after such notice having omitted to designate a school for the children to attend; and the children having continued to attend the plaintiff\u2019s schools, without dissent from the defendant\u2019s directors, and there receive the instruction that the defendant 'was under a legal duty to furnish ; the defendant\u2019s directors are deemed to have assented to a modification of the contract, under which children residing in the defendant\u2019s town had been instructed in the plaintiff\u2019s schools, as'insisted upon by the plaintiff\u2019s'directors; and to have assented to the instruction of the children in the plaintiff\u2019s schools at the modified price which is charged by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff\u2019s directors had a right to understand that the defendant\u2019s directors so assented, and to furnish the instruction in reliance thereon, and upon the credit of the defendant, notwithstanding the fact that there was no \u25a0 express promise. A contract enforceable against a municipal corporation, may be proved by circumstances, acts, conduct, and sayings of municipal officers having authority to bind the corporation. <em>Worcester </em>v. Ballard, 38 Vt. 60; <em>Rowell </em>v. <em>School </em>District, 59 Vt. 658; <em>Durfey </em>v. Worcester, 63 Vt. 418; <em>Sheldon </em>v. Fairfax, 21 Vt. 102; <em>Gassett </em>v. Andover, 21 Vt. 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">The case of <em>Aldrich </em>v. Londonderry, 5 Vt. 441 and some others, cited by the defendant, which seem to hold that a municipal corporation is only liable upon an express promise have, in effect, been overruled by more recent holdings of this Court. Then in <em>Worcester </em>v. Ballard, before cited, it is-held that when the claim against a town rests upon a contract or agreement the same facts and language which would constitute a contract between indviduals will also between an individual and an overseer of poor acting in behalf of his town; and in <em>Gassett </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>before cited, it is held, that corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tions may be held liable upon an implied promise as well as individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">No. 23 of the Acts of 1900, which provides, in part, that in case of the failure of the school directors to agree as to the tuition, either board of directors may appeal in writing to the examiner of teachers whose decision in the premises shall be final, has na application to a case, like the one at bar,, where the question is one of liability or no liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and judgment for the plaintiff to recover the sum of eighty-seven dollars and forty-six cents with interest thereon from February pth, ipo\u00a1, and its costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
