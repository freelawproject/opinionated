It appeared that on Sunday, October 9, 1904, the prisoner was in his rpom where he lived and had his home, and had his gun on his shoulder and was about to go out hunting; that while the prisoner was standing with his gun thus, Frank Phillipi, the deceased, a friend and fellow-workman of the prisoner\u2019s, came into the room and asked the prisoner where he was going. The prisoner said he was going hunting. Thereupon the deceased grabbed the gun back of the prisoner, and told him he could not go hunting. The prisoner said, \u201cMy friend, let me go.\u201d But the deceased kept hold of the gun and bore down on it, and the prisoner hung on and bore down on the end, until the stock was broken from the barrel so that it hung only by a little piece of iron. Thereupon the prisoner, not liking- this, threw the gun upon the floor, and told the decease'd that he had broken his gun and must pay him for it or get him a new' one the next day. The deceased stooped down and picked up the barrel and raised it up' and said, \u201cSince you want a new gun, I will give it to you in this way,\u201d or \u201cI will give it to you on the head,\u201d- or some such words. The prisoner said, \u201cMy friend, I will blow your brains out,\u201d or \u201cSince you want to- strike me, I will blow your brains out,\u201d or some such words and thereupon drew a revolver from his pocket and shot the deceased in the breast, inflicting a mortal wound, of which he died the same day.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-6\"><em>W.
