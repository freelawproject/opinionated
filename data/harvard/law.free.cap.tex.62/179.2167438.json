The exact date of its passage was 15th February, 1878. It was subsequently re-enacted <em>totidem verbis </em>on 31st July, 1878.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">So much of this ordinance, which is quite lengthy, as is necessary now to be considered in this connection, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\u201c Art. 100. In all cases of misdemeanor brought before the mayor, when the party pleads guilty the city attorney shall be entitled to a fee of \u00a72, to be taxed in the bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">\u201c Art. 101. In all cases of misdemeanor, when the party pleads not guilty, the city attorney shall prosecute the case on trial either before the mayor or a jury, and on conviction of the party accused the city attorney shall be paid a fee of $5, to be taxed in the bill of costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">\u201c Art. 103. The city attorney shall receive ten per cent, upon all sums of money collected for the city; and for all civil cases brought for or against the city, other than for the collection of money in the district court, he shall receive the sum of $25, and in the magistrate\u2019s court the sum of $5 for his services. It shall further be the duty of the city attorney to draw up all ordinances in legal form at the request of the mayor or any committee appointed by the council to have an ordinance drawn for any purpose whatever, and also to draw up all deeds or articles of agreement to which the city may be a party, free of charge to the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">It is plain that under the terms of the amended charter the city council has express authority to allow the city attorney, in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>to his annual salary of $600, therein provided, also such, <em>fees </em>as the council shall, in the exercise of their judgment and discretion, see fit to allow him.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">No question is made but that they can, in addition to the salary and fees they have by ordinance already allowed him, also allow him still other fees for the many necessary and valuable services that he now performs without having any compensation for the same other than his annual salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">It is argued, however, that this power, granted to the council, to allow him <em>fees, </em>does not authorize them to grant him <em>commissions, </em>on money collected. There is no force in this objection. The word \u201c Fees,\u201d as defined by Burrill (see Burrill\u2019s Law Diet., vol. 1, p. 474, <em>verb. \u201c </em>Fee.\u201d See, also, Bouvier\u2019s Diet., vol. 1, p. 577, <em>verb. </em>\u201c Fee \u201d), is said to be the reward or compensation or wages allowed by law to an officer for services performed by him in the discharge of his official duties. The latter author cites cases showing the difference between <em>fees </em>of an attorney, counselor and physician and the <em>costs </em>of a suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Webster, in his Unabridged Dictionary, p. 444, <em>word </em>\u201c Fee,\u201d following the elementary law writers, also gives, in substance and quite fully, the same definition of this word.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Under this, the well-known and correct legal definition of the word \u201c fee,\u201d as used in the charter, we have no doubt that the city council has authority to allow the appellee, as city attorney, by way of compensation and remuneration for his official services, commissions on all sums of money collected for the city where he has rendered professional services in that behalf, and through his official instrumentality such sums of money have been in fact collected and paid into the city treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">It is, however,, contended that, conceding this to be the fact, that the city council, having already provided, as we have seen from the above extracts from the ordinances of the city, for his fees in misdemeanor cases, they could not in addition, in that same class of cases, allow him also commissions on the sums collected for further attention to the collection of the fines imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">We think the appellant, under the charter as amended, had the power, in such criminal cases as its tribunals had jurisdiction to try and determine, to allow the city attorney fees for appearing in and prosecuting such suits, and also, in addition, if it saw fit to do so, allow him additional fees for representing the city and superintending the subsequent collection in money of the judgments so rendered in favor of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The language is as follows: \u201c The city attorney shall receive ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>per cent, upon <em>all sums of money collected </em>for the city.\u201d Art. 103, (7). These terms are broad and unequivocal. Ho difference whatever is made by this ordinance between sums of money collected in civil suits and sums of money collected in criminal suits. As the city council has not seen fit to make a distinction in the ordinance between moneys collected in civil and in criminal cases, we certainly have no power to do so. Our duty is to construe the law; we cannot add to it or take from it. We administer it as we find it.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b207-9\">[Opinion delivered June 28, 1884.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">All the authorities cited by both parties have been examined; in addition, we have ourselves referred to the following cases: State <em>v. </em>Horrell, 53 Tex., 427; Spencer <em>v. </em>Galveston County, 56 Tex., 384; State <em>v. </em>Moore, 57 Tex., 307; Looscan <em>v. </em>County of Harris, 58 Tex., 511. They, however, throw very little light on the question now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Our opinion is that the district court was correct, under the facts and law of this particular case, in the conclusions arrived at, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
