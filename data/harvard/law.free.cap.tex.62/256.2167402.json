Railway passenger.\u2014A passenger who takes passage on a through train, with notice that under the regulations of the company the train will not stop at a designated intermediate point, cannot require the train to stop at such point to enable him to get off there. If, in ignorance of such regulation, he takes passage on a through train, with a ticket to a station at which the train will not stop, the company has a right to correct his mistake at any regular stopping station for that train, before reaching the station desired; and if, being informed of his mistake, after being afforded an opportunity to quit the train at a regular stopping station and wait for the proper train, he refuses to do so, the conductor of the train may put him off in a proper manner,</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b280-14\">2.

Hassell against the International &amp; Great Horthern Railroad Company for damages for personal injuries received in being wrongfully ejected from a passenger train, near Palestine. The appellant set up as a defense that it was not guilty as charged; that appellee was wrongfully on the train, and that he contributed to or caused the injury received. The case was tried on the 3d day of December 1883, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee for \u00a7600.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">The important facts are stated in the opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-7\"><em>John Young </em>Gooch, for appellant,</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anf\">cited: Beauchamp <em>v. </em>I. &amp; G.

To that person the cost of passage to Elkhart was paid, and the appellee received in good faith a ticket from him, which on its face was good, and entitled him to be carried from Jacksonville to Elkhart. After paying for and receiving a ticket, bearing the signature of the proper officer of the company, in good faith he entered the car of the appellant, believing, as he had been told by the person who sold him the ticket, that on that train he could go to Elk-hart.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>After he entered the train and the journey began, the conductor recognized the validity of the ticket which he held, by receiving it'as an evidence that the holder of it was entitled to and had commenced a journey paid for and evidenced by it. These facts made the appellee a passenger on the appellant\u2019s train, and not a mere intruder or trespasser. Such would have been his character if he had held no ticket at all, if he entered the car of the appellant in good faith intending to make the journey and to pay his passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The court instructed the jury, among other matters, as follows: \u201c The proof shows that the railroad company runs two daily trains between points named in plaintiff\u2019s ticket, and the regulation that one of these trains shall not stop at all stations is a reasonable regulation and one they had a right to make, and a passenger who travels on said road with notice of such regulation cannot get on a through train and demand to be carried to a point at which said through train does not stop, even if he has a ticket to such point, unless he goes on the train by direction of the railroad\u2019s agents. If the person who acted as agent, and sold the ticket, directed the plaintiff to get on the through train, he had the right to get on said train and travel upon it; but if, after getting on, he was, at a regular station, notified that the train would not stop at Elkhart, it was his duty then to get off and take the proper train; for if the railroad agent at Jacksonville made a mistake, the railroad had a right to correct the mistake at any regular stopping station for that train. If, then, he was informed at Palestine of the mistake, it was his duty to get off, and if he did not do so, the conductor had a right to put him off in a proper manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">There was no question made as to the right of appellee to a passage on the other train, from Jacksonville to Elkhart, on the ticket which he held,\u2014 that right was recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Under the facts of the case we believe that the charge of the court correctly presented the law of the case; and that in so far as it made the right of the appellee, in any respect, to depend upon the act of the person who was in the ticket office of appellant, assuming to discharge the duties of its agent, and from whom he purchased the ticket on which he was traveling, even if incorrect, could not have prejudiced the appellant; for the uncontroverted facts showed that the appellee was informed at Palestine that the train on which he was, under the regulations of the road, would not stop at Elkhart, and that the following train would, and that he was requested to wait for that train.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The jury was also fairly instructed, under such a state of facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>that it was not thereafter wrongful to eject the appellee from the train, if this was clone in a proper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The other parts of the charge carefully presented to the jury the right of the appellee under his several causes of action, and unless the jury disregarded the charge, which cannot be presumed, they could not have embraced in their verdict damage for failure to transport the appellee to Elkhart on the train which he boarded at Jacksonville.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">There is no evidence that the appellee had notice at the time he boarded the train at Jacksonville that it would not stop at Elkhart, and the court correctly ruled that evidence that such fact was generally known at Jacksonville was not admissible to show notice to the appellee, who did not live at Jacksonville, and who was not shown to have had the means of acquiring such knowledge as may have been generally in the possession of those who did live there.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The right of the appellee to recover damage which may have resulted from his ejectment from the car was clearly presented to the jury by the charge of the court, which informed the jury, after having correctly instructed them as to the right of the appellant to eject the appellee in a proper manner, \u201cif the ejection was by the use of unnecessary force, or he was injured in getting off by the carelessness of the conductor, without any fault of his own, then you will give him such damages as will c\u00f3mpensate the injuries he received in getting off or being forced off, not to exceed $2,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">There is a direct conflict in the evidence of the conductor and the appellee in reference to the manner in which he was put off of the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The conductor stated that after conducting the appellee to the steps of the car, the appellee was about to leap from the car while still moving slowly, and that he told him not to jump, that the train would stop, and that, disregarding this instruction, the appellee leaped from the train while moving slowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The appellee, however, stated that while the train was moving slowly the conductor said to him, \u201c now is your time, jump,\u201d and that he did so, from which resulted the injuries of which he complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Under such a state of facts a judgment cannot be reversed on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, unless it be the law that one who leaps from a moving train, when instructed to do so by the conductor, as matter of law may be charged with contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">We do not so understand the law to be.
