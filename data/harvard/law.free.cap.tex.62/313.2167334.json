Pape against the I. &amp; G. N. R\u2019y Co. for $1,000 damages. The petition alleged four grounds of damages, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">1. For carelessly constructing its road-bed over his land in such a manner as to cut off and separate about five acres of his land from the remainder of his tract, so as to deprive him of access to the five acres, to his damage $250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-7\">2.

For carelessly constructing the road-bed across plaintiff\u2019s land in such a manner as to cause about ten acres of it to be inundated with water, to his further damage $250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-9\">4. For reasonable cost of drains and culverts necessary to enable plaintiff to use his land, the further sum of $250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-10\">The petition stated in the third count that on account of the incapacity of the culverts and ditches made on plaintiff\u2019s land, that the rain-water falling on the same was not drained off, \u201c and by reason of this, about ten acres of his main farm had been inundated with rain water, and the uses and benefits lost to him.\u201d It was claimed in the petition that the company knew the proper manner in which to build the road, and the crossings, and also as to digging the ditches and making the culverts, but that it failed and refused to construct them properly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-11\">Defendant pleaded general and special demurrers to the petition, also answered by general and special denial, claiming that the land had been legally condemned for the road of defendant to be laid upon it, one hundred feet in width; that damages for condemnation were <em>awarded and paid; </em>that plaintiff was present at the award, which was for $225, for the <em>right of wag </em>and all damages for inconvenience or otherwise to plaintiff. A copy of the judgment of condemnation was attached to defendant\u2019s answer. Specially denied that it built its road in a careless and negligent or indifferent manner ; but had built it in the proper manner, and with as little damage as possible to plaintiff, and denied making any promise to make bridges or culverts for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-12\">The jury found in favor of plaintiff, $150 on each count \u2014 $600 \u2014 for which the court gave judgment.

J. Com. App.</author>\n<p id=\"AtW\">The legal sufficiency of the first count of the petition is involved under the fifth assignment of error. The fifth assignment is that \u201c The court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s eighth special exception to plaintiff\u2019s petition, which sought to strike out the claim for damages for \u00a7250 for failure on the part of defendant to provide a crossing over its road for the convenience of plaintiff in passing to and fro over the same, because the said count showed no legal obligation on the part of defendant to make such crossing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The special exception referred to is that \u201c It does not appear that defendant is under any obligation to provide a pass-way for plaintiff\u2019s convenience across its road to enable him to go from one part of his farm to another; if so, then the plaintiff\u2019s remedy does not sound in damages, but by a process to compel the defendant to build the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The first count in the petition claimed damages resulting from the defendant\u2019s so constructing the earthwork and roadway of its railroad through his land, that owing to its height he Avas prevented from having convenient passage and access to a certain five acres of his land, from which he was thus cut off; and that said defendant, having thus constructed its road, failed to provide against plaintiff\u2019s inconvenience by placing or making for plaintiff proper and necessary crossings over and upon said roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Damages resulting from increased difficulty of communication betAveen the parts of a severed tract are such damages as are construed to be included in the assessment of damages sustained by the owner of the land in proceedings for condemning the land to the railroad\u2019s use for its right of way. See Pierce on Railroads, 174, and authorities there cited; also Mills on Em. Domain, sec. 216. The plaintiff\u2019s petition does not allege that the defendant trespassed upon his land without authority derived from its due condemnation for right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\u201c The appraisement embraces all past, present and future damages which the improvement may thereafter reasonably produce. . . . Any damage not resulting from negligent or unskilful construction is presumed to be included in the assessment.\u201d Pierce on Railroads, 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s petition does not show that the alleged damage was caused from a negligent or unskilful construction of the defendant\u2019s railroad. It alleged, it is true, \u201c that in the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>said earthwork, defendant, although fully aware of the proper manner and mode of so constructing said earthwork and roadway so as not to injure and damage plaintiff, did negligently and carelessly so construct and erect across and upon plaintiff\u2019s land before described, said earthwork and roadway as to cut off from the said tract of one hundred acres by such road-bed, about five acres more or less of good arable and cultivable land,\u201d etc. But, if this allegation means to import that the defendant was under.a legal obligation to so construct its line of road through plaintiff\u2019s land as to cause no greater injury or inconvenience to the plaintiff in his farming operations than the knowledge and skill of the defendant would allow; or in other words, to construct its earthworks and road-bed with reference to the least possible inconvenience to the plaintiff, we apprehend that such a proposition is not maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">It is to be inferred from the plaintiff\u2019s allegations that the impediments of which he complains consist in the defendant having constructed its line of road on a line and course through plaintiff\u2019s land, which required the raising of the railroad bed to a height above the ordinary level of the adjacent land, and that the embankments thus formed constituted an obstacle to the plaintiff\u2019s direct passage across the road to the five acres in question. The defendant, it must be supposed, had sufficiently indicated the line along which it claimed its right of way when it made compensation therefor under a proper condemnation and assessment of damages, and the damages which might probably result, it must be held, were then taken into consideration, and the defendant was not limited in building its said line of road to its construction with reference especially to the greatest convenience of the plaintiff, but was entitled to construct it in accordance with its general plan and consistently with its own advantage with reference to cost and the requisites of a safe and good road.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In the condemnation of land for a railroad\u2019s right of way, damages are to be assessed upon the assumption that the road will be constructed with due care and skill, and with proper precautions necessary to prevent unnecessary injury to land-owners. Pierce on Railroads, 218. In order to subject the defendant to liability on the grounds relied on in the first count, the facts alleged must be such as to show that the defendant had violated the above rule of law; but we conceive that the petition does no such thing as that, nor does it negative with sufficient distinctness the idea that the defendant constructed its road-bed on a proper line and direction through plaintiff\u2019s land, and that in so doing the embankments com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>-plained of were constructed as a matter of right on the part of defendant, and with due care and skill, and such consideration for plaintiff\u2019s right as he had a right to exact. The defendant\u2019s exceptions to the first count of the petition ought to have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The second count was subject to the defendant\u2019s exceptions upon similar grounds to those we apply to the first count. It appears from the charge of the court that the plaintiff abandoned, on the trial, a right to recover on this second count, and the jury were instructed not to find upon it for the plaimtiff; the jury, however, did find upon it $150 damages for the plaintiff, which amount was remitted by the plaintiff, and the <em>remittitur </em>duly entered upon the verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The seventh assignment of errors is as follows: \u201cThe court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s tenth special demurrer, which is as follows, viz.: Defendant specially demurs to plaintiff\u2019s fourth count, which seeks damages for the reasonable costs of drains and culverts necessary to enable plaintiff to use his land, and says it shows no cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We will here insert the fourth count as taken from plaintiff\u2019s petition : \u201c Plaintiff further alleges, and so charges the fact to be, that, to enable him to use and enjoy his said estate, as he is in law entitled to, and to protect him from the injury and annoyance of said accumulation of waters as aforesaid, it is necessary that good and sufficient ditches or drains be made along the right of way of defendant\u2019s railroad, and . . . culverts be made through the roadbed of defendant to conduct and carry off the excess and surplus water which, flowing over plaintiff\u2019s land, is obstructed in its natural outlet and passageway by the earthwork of defendant\u2019s road-bed. That the reasonable cost for the construction of said drains and culverts, necessary and proper to enable plaintiff to enjoy and use his land as he is in law entitled to, is the sum of $250, and they claim damage in that sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">This count was specially demurred to, as stated in the seventh assignment above. The jury gave a verdict on this count for $150. The above assignment embodies the language of the exception to the fourth count.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action on this count consisted of the damages sustained by him by the alleged default of the defendant. The grounds for the recovery of such damages consisted of the injury sustained by the plaintiff to his land, his crops growing thereon, or other injury to his premises flowing from the alleged failure of defendant to construct sufficient ditches, drains and culverts along the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>right of way of said railroad. The plaintiff\u2019s petition alleges no facts which afford a basis for such damages, but alleges instead that the cost of constructing such amounts to \u00a7250, which sum he claims as damages. Although the statement thus made may not furnish the true measure of damage, it might be disregarded, and the count in question held sufficient nevertheless, provided other facts had been alleged from which damage to the plaintiff might be legally inferred; but the plaintiff does not allege that he has sustained any pecuniary damage from the defendant\u2019s alleged default, but simply alleges that it is necessary to construct such drains to enable him to use and enjoy his estate, and he distinctly predicates the amount of damage claimed by him, not upon any actual pecuniary loss, but upon the cost of constructing the works referred to, and he does not allege that he has constructed such, nor that he has expended labor, time or money in so doing.
