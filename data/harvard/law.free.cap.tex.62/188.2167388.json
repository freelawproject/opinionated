Shumatte and Jno. A. Matthews, upon two instruments in writing alleged to be promissory notes, one of which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201c$2,100.

They also set up other defenses, which, for the purposes of the opinion, need not be stated. The court below sustained the exceptions and dismissed the suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-10\">T. <em>J.

A.

See Alves <em>v. </em>Hodg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>son, 7 Term R., 241; Manrow <em>v. </em>Durham, 3 Hill (N.

See, also, in this connection, Salinas <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 Tex., 572; Hutchins <em>v. </em>Wade, 20 Tex., 7.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b214-9\">[Opinion delivered October 11, 1884.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Many other authorities have been examined and could be referred to, but the above are deemed to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The statement of the nature and character of the instrument made the basis of the appellant\u2019s cause of action was not in the pleadings set forth with sufficient certainty. Hnder the circumstances the special exceptions of appellees were properly sustained. The judgment of the district court, dismissing the case, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
