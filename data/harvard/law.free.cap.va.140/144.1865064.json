E. 268, the learned judge deals most elaborately with the questions of \u201cvaluation for rate making purposes;\u201d \u201cwater and waterworks;\u201d \u201crate fixing;\u201d \u201cvaluation;\u201d \u201cpresent value theory;\u201d \u201cweight to be given to Commission\u2019s decisions on appeal;\u201d \u201cvaluation of property;\u201d \u201ccost of obtaining a substitute supply;\u201d \u201creasonableness of return of seven per cent on investment;\u201d \u201cprudent investment theory;\u201d \u201cappreciation and depreciation;\u201d \u201cvaluation based on reproduction or replacement of plant;\u201d \u201cwater rights value;\u201d \u201cother items of value;\u201d \u201caccrued depreciation;\u201d \u201cgoing value;\u201d \u201cworking capital and supplies;\u201d \u201cdeficiency in earnings\u201d and \u201cpre-war unit prices.\u201d After so masterful a discussion of these most complex questions by the distinguished former president of this court (Judge Kelly, resigned January, 1924), a further discussion thereof on our part would be \u201can affectation of erudition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In obedience to the remand order of this court, the Corporation Commission, on the twenty-first day of March, 1924, after having heard evidence upon the three questions stated, <em>supra, </em>certified to the Supreme Court of Appeals the facts and evidence upon which the action of the Commission in the said proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>was based, together with its opinion, which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u201cFacts and reasons in pursuance of section 156-f of the Constitution of Virginia and the conclusions of the Commission under the order of the Supreme Court of Appeals entered September 20, 1923, remanding the ease for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u201cTo the Supreme Court of Appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u201cThe Commission, in its opinion of August 31, 1922, in concluding the discussion of the value of the water rights of the Roanoke Water Works Company, summarized the situation as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u201c \u2018From all authorities the determination of the amount of water rights value is stated to be a matter of judgment. The Commission takes as a basis the cost of purifying the amount of water used during the year 1921, which, capitalized at nine per cent, gives a valuation of $199,540.00. Accordingly we allow a valuation of $200,000.00 for the water rights.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of Appeals in remanding the case quoted the above paragraph, and said:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u201c \u2018It is clear from the concluding portion of this extract from the opinion that the Commission has made no allowance for pumping equipment installed since the 1913 appraisement, and none on account of the fact that since that appraisement conditions have arisen which would make a substitute supply from Roanoke river cost much more than it would have cost at that time. The appraisers in 1913 adopted the cost of such substitution as the measure of value. The effect of what the Commission has done, as we understand it, is to adopt the same measure of value which the appraisers adopted in 1913, but without making any allowance for changed conditions.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\u201cIt is evident that the Supreme Court understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that Commission based its valuation on the full cost of a substitute supply from Roanoke river, since it said:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u201c \u2018So far as we are able to understand, the Commission, in effect, has adopted as the measure of value of the water rights the cost of purifying the water.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u201cOn the contrary, the Commission meant by the \u25a0expression \u2018cost of purifying\u2019 to include only the operating expenses of a substitute filtration plant and not the fixed charges connected therewith and included in the .appraisal of 1913, made by Mr. Maury. The Commission used a basis of $9.80 per M. for this purpose and arrived at an operating expense amounting to $15,963.00 for 1,626,000 M. gallons, the 1921 usage. Capitalizing this at eight per cent, the Commission arrived at a valuation of $199,540.00 and allowed a value to water rights amounting to $200,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u201cSince the 1922 hearing, the water company has filed exhibits showing detailed analyses of water taken from Roanoke river and the operating expenses of a filtration plant based upon these analyses of $12.60 per M. gallons, including taxes. We think these figures should be accepted as correct, and used in place of the $9.80 used by the Commission in its opinion of August 31, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u201cUpon the basis of these figures and the Commission\u2019s memorandum the value of the water rights will be found as follows: 1,626,000M. gallonsx$12.60 \u2022equals $20,488.00, which, capitalized at eight per cent, .gives $256,100.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u201cWhile the Supreme Court understood the Commission in its former opinion \u2018adopted as a measure of value of the water rights the cost of purifying (operating expenses and fixed charges included) the water,\u2019 it added:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">\u201c \u2018We do not perceive any reason for adopting this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>method, except that the appraisers in 1913 adopted it in order to determine what a substitute supply from the Roanoke river would cost.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u201cThe board of appraisers, in 1913, allowed a valuation of $200,000.00 for water rights (page 17, appraisers\u2019 report), arrived at as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<img

width=\"1258\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-28\">\u201cAccordingly the appraisers find the aggregate value of the water rights of the Crystal, Muse and River Springs to be, in round numbers, $200,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-29\">\u201cIn 1920, Dabney H. Maury, the company\u2019s witness,, who was a member of the board of appraisers in 1913, stated that in his opinion the 1913 value should have been $140,000.00, and increased this amount by seventy per cent to give $238,000.00 as the average value during the five years ending March 1, 1920. In 1922 this value was increased by company\u2019s witness Moore to $593,487.00, due to the necessity having arisen, the company claimed, of having to secure this water from the Roanoke river at a point above Salem.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-30\">\u201cSince the 1922 hearing the company has further increased this claim to $1,522,253.00, the increase being caused by a corrected estimate as to the cost of a substitute shpply from a point above Salem.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-31\">\u201cWhile the company\u2019s claim depends upon the necessity of securing the substitute supply from the Roanoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>river at a point above Salem, and upon tbe proof that tbe supply described by the exhibits would constitute the cheapest substitute, it appears that the project as proposed shows \u2018insufficient consideration to the fact that a water supply works located on........................the Roanoke river would entail a design of a distribution system, reservoirs and water supply works different from those of the present water works, when furnishing substantially an identical water service throughout the city, and that when thus worked out would give different values for comparison and would lead to different results\u2019 than those submitted by the company. This was the view held by the appraisers in 1913 relative to this method (see page 15). Furthermore, no consideration is given to the fact that any plant located at Salem would almost certainly supply other consumers than those in the city of Roanoke. Thus, the substitute supply urged by the company has not been definitely proved to be the cheapest one.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u201cBut for the purpose of argument such a method will be considered the cheapest, and therefore, if sound, the correct basis for the valuation of the water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u201cThe facts are that the springs of the company have an estimated flow of 2,151,000 M. gallons annually, of which amount, when last reported, the annual usage was approximately 1,626,000 M. gallons. It appears proper that any method based upon a capitalized savings calculation should capitalize the savings actually effected from year to year to give the valuation sought. Otherwise, the savings calculated by using the full flow of the springs might far exceed the cost of providing from a more expensive substitute supply the amount of water actually necessary at a given time. Therefore the capitalized savings method, if used here, should be based on 1,626,000 M. gallons, or at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>last reported annual usage, which, is in line with the decision of the Commission in the <em>Virginia Railway and Power Company Case, </em>No. 1138, P. U. R. 1922 D, p. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u201cThis Commission, however, has never approved the-theory of capitalizing in favor of the company the total savings actually achieved by taking the water from springs or generating power by water instead of steam. See <em>Va. R. &amp; P. Co. Case, supra. </em>In this ease the Commission allowed a valuation of lands and water rights of $750,000.00 which it is said \u2018approximately divides the net savings between the company and the public.\u2019 This division was deemed advisable in order to encourage the development of the State\u2019s hydro resources, which necessitate much larger initial construction expenditures, involve greater subsequent risks than the development of power by the substitute method of steam generation. These elements are not present to the same degree in the present case where the natural resources used make possible a supply cheaper from an initial investment standpoint than the proposed substitute and involve little risks after development. In both the <em>Va. Ry. &amp; P. Co. Case </em>and the present case, the Commission held \u2018the company is entitled to benefit in valuation for its foresight and risk in acquiring the water rights, and the public is entitled to benefit in lower rates than would otherwise be necessary because of its proximity to the water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u201cThe policy of the Commission is upheld, practically without exception, by a-large number of cases which will be quoted below. In a number of these cases the water rights valued are those relating to hydroelectric developments as distinguished from springs. The capitalized sayings method considered is, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u2022ever, the method urged in the present ease, and the principle of valuation and the arguments thereon apply \u2022similarly to springs, except as may be modified by the lower first cost and risk which usually attend a spring\u2019s \u2022development.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u201cThe Oregon Commission rejects the capitalized \u2022savings method of determining the fair value of water rights on the basis of being unsound in principle, in its order No. 211 of July 16, 1917, in the <em>Case of California-Oregon Power Company, </em>reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201c \u2018On the question of the value of water rights at the Oregon plant, the company has presented elaborate computations showing the estimated saving in cost of \u2022service which might be accomplished by the present hydro-electric operation, as compared with the operation of theoretical steam plants designed to produce an equivalent amount of power. These estimated savings have been capitalized to give theoretical values for the different rights, aggregating $2,115,205.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201c \u2018This theory, with slight changes in detail occasioned by local conditions, has often been advanced in this behalf. As an exact measure of the value of such property, it is not entitled to consideration; and, at best, assuming that the fundamental principles are correct, the theory as developed can indicate only the maximum value that might be claimed for the right in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u201c \u2018Furthermore, the value derived from such computations differ so widely upon small changes in the variable elements introduced, such as the assumed cost of capital, cost of fuel, and the freight rate, that their consideration is justified only for the general information which they may contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u201c \u2018In addition to the water power rights, the company also owns, in Klamath Falls, a large spring which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>been developed to furnish water for domestic, commercial, and municipal purposes in that city.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u201c \u2018As evidence of the value of this water right, the company introduced computations designed to show the annual saving which might result from the use of this source of supply over the cost of similar service from what was claimed to be the next available source,, a stream approximately forty-five miles distant from the city. The saving thus estimated when capitalized, amounted to $2,200,266.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u201c \u2018This calculation affords a splendid demonstration of the absurd results which may be obtained by the application of this familiar theory. At the date of this calculation, the utility had 832 customers from a total population of approximately 5,000. The interest alone on the above capitalization would be $227.19 per year for each customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u201c \u2018Furthermore, this Commission cannot concede that any theory in connection with the valuation of water rights <em>of </em>(for) either power or domestic purposes is sound in principle which permits an individual, or group of individuals, to capitalize without limit a natural resource, and thus virtually deprive a community of all advantages from its proximity thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u201c \u2018In its capacity as a regulatory body, this Commission has had numerous computations submitted and theories advanced as to the value of water rights, many of them without equitable or practicable foundations. Under our present enlightenment it is apparent that the determination of water rights values, at least for the purpose in which this Commission is interested, must rest upon the exercise of reasonable judgment- and discretion in the consideration of all elements relevant thereto. If there have been sales of fairly comparable water rights, sufficient in number and under-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>such circumstances as to establish fair market values therefor, we are impressed with the idea that this feature should receive serious and earnest attention. Artificial rules and formulae may produce figures which are of assistance in arriving at a fair and reasonable value, but, segregated to themselves and standing alone, are of little consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u201c \u2018In the present case no showing as to market value has been made; and, in accord with the views expressed, the Commission has found a value of these rights, which it believes to be fair and equitable.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cIn the <em>Roanoke Case </em>the allowance of the water rights value claimed would require an annual interest charge, at seven per cent, of $106,558.00, an amount greater than the total operating expenses and taxes of the company during its largest year\u2019s operations. This value would call for approximately $10.00 annually per customer for interest on water rights value, aside from interest and depreciation charges on the plant value and the cost of operating the plant itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201cA clear statement of the same method as being contrary to any reasonable public policy is given by the Idaho Commission in <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Washington Water Power Company, </em>Case No. F-54, order No. 504, in which the Commission said, in discussing the \u25a0savings over steam method of valuing water rights:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u201c \u2018One feature of the \u201csaving over coal\u201d method of determining the value of a water right should not \u25a0escape attention. We live in a region remote from the coal fields, the cost of transportation is heavy, and the price of coal is higher than in almost any other part of the country. On the other hand, ours is a mountainous State, with many streams having large fall and furnishing an abundance of water power, much of which is still undeveloped. If we. adopt the policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>valuing water power in rate and capitalization eases by capitalizing their \u201csaving over coal,\u201d the people of this State are left subject to all the disadvantages attendant upon the remoteness from the coal mines, while enjoying no advantage from living in a region abundantly supplied with water powers. A \u201cfair value\u201d of a water power in Idaho cannot be a value which takes no account of our natural resources, and makes electricity produced by water as expensive to the public as if produced by coal.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u201cSee also: <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company </em>(Cal.), P.

The Commission does not consider that the cost of a substitute supply project at a point above ' Salem, as presented by the company, was proved the cheapest substitute supply possible. However, the Commission has given this consideration along with the risk and development cost, pending the use of these springs. The Commission believed that the city of Roanoke should benefit by its proximity to its natural resources, as well as the utility through its ownership of such resources. And, in arriving at such a decision, believed the Roanoke Water Works Company should have its water rights valued upon the capitalized \u2018out of pocket\u2019 operating expenses of filtering the amount of water used from the springs and withheld requiring from the city of Roanoke fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>charges on a substitute purification plant until such a plant becomes actually necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\n<em>\u201cAppreciation of Pre-war Property Value.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u201cIn the present case, as in others, the Commission began with the pre-war property at pre-war unit reproduction prices and appreciated this pre-war value twenty per cent. All war time and post-war additions were included at estimated or actual cost. The Supreme Court says:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u201c \u2018We are unable, from any facts found by the Commission, to understand why only twenty per cent appreciation was allowed upon pre-war prices. The evidence seems to us to show without conflict that prices had increased at the time of the valuation at least seventy per cent, and there was a liberal deduction by the Commission on account of depreciation. We do not think any reason is assigned by the Commission for allowing so small an amount on account of increased cost. It is true that, in the general discussion which we have quoted from the opinion, the Commission refers, at least indirectly, to the settled rule that present replacement cost is not controlling in fixing the rate base, and while it may be true, as a matter of fact, that the Commission did take into consideration elements which were proper to be considered in reaching what, of course, is believed to be a just and reasonable allowance for appreciation, the fact remains that the Commission did not certify to us the facts upon which it adopted twenty per cent as the amount to be allowed for appreciation, or the reason which guided it in that particular. As the matter appears to us at this time upon the record it seems that this allowance for appreciation is too small in view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>evidence, and that \u201cproper consideration\u201d has not been given to replacement cost. At any rate, we feel that the case as to this item must be remanded to the Commission for further consideration and report in accordance with the course which was taken in the case of <em>Appalachian Power Company </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u201cAs stated by the Commission and confirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals, recognition was given to the \u2018settled rule that present replacement cost is not controlling in fixing the rate base.\u2019 See <em>Galveston Electric Co. </em>v. <em>City of Galveston, </em>258 U. S. 388, 42 Sup. Ct. 351, 66 L. Ed. 678, in which thirty-three and one-third per cent appreciation was used in fixing rate base, although actual prices had risen to 110 per cent at time of hearing; <em>Southern Bell Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of Missouri, </em>262 U. S. 276, 43 Sup. Ct. 544, 67 L.

S. 625, 43 Sup. Ct. 680, 67 L. Ed. 1144, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u201c \u2018First. The objections mainly urged relate to the rate base; and one of them is of fundamental importance. The companies assert that the rule to be applied in valuing the physical property of a utility is reproduction cost at the time of the inquiry less depreciation. The 1921 construction costs were about seventy per cent higher than those of 1914, and earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>dates when most of the plant was installed. So much of it as was in existence January 1, 1914, was valued at an amount which was substantially its actual cost or its reproduction cost as of that date. The companies claim that it should have been valued at its replacement cost in November, 1921 \u2014 the time of the rate inquiry; and that the increase in construction costs was ignored in determining the rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u201c \u2018The case is unlike <em>Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission </em>(No. 158, 262 U. S. 625, 43 Sup. Ct. 680, 67 L. Ed. 1144, decided May 21, 1923.) Here the Commission gave careful consideration to the cost of reproduction; but it refused to adopt reproduction cost as the measure of value. It declared that the exercise of a reasonable judgment as to the present \u201cfair value\u201d required some consideration of reproduction costs as well as of original costs, but that \u201cpresent fair value\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cpresent replacement cost,\u201d particularly under abnormal conditions. That part of the rule which declares the utility entitled to the benefit of increases in the value of the property was, however, specifically applied in the allowance of $125,000.00 made by the Commission to represent the appreciation in the value of the land owned. The lower court recognized that it must exercise an independent judgment in passing upon the evidence; and it gave careful consideration to the replacement cost. But it likewise held that there was no rule which required that in valuing the physical property there must be \u201cslavish adherence to cost of reproduction, less depreciation.\u201d It discussed the fact that since 1914 large sums had been expended annually on the plant; that part of this additional construction had been made at prices higher than those which pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u25a0vailed at the time of the rate hearing; and it eonelnded that \u201caveraging results and remembering that values are * * matters of opinion * * no constitutional wrong clearly appears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u201c \u2018The refusal of the Commission and of the lower court to hold that, for rate making purposes, the physical properties of a utility must be valued at the replacement cost, less depreciation, was clearly correct. As was said in <em>Minnesota Bate Cases, </em>230 U. S. 352, 434:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u201c \u2018The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u201c \u2018What these relevant facts are had been stated in <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>169 U. S. 466, 546-547:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u201c \u2018 * * The original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stocks, the present as compared with the original cost of construction,, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the other hand, that which the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\u201c \u2018And in <em>Willcox </em>v. <em>Consolidated Gas Company, </em>212 U. S. 19, 52, it has been made clear\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201cthat the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding the rates. If the property which legally enters into the consideration of the question of rates has increased in value since it was acquired, the company is entitled to the benefit of such increase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u201c \u2018The rule laid down in these eases was expressly recognized as controlling, both by the Commission and by the lower court. Evidence bearing on most of the facts there declared to be relevant facts was before them. The court states, and the record establishes, that \u201cthe opinion of the * * Commission * * evinces a full and conscientious consideration of the evidence. The opinion of the court shows that it also made careful examination of the evidence submitted and that it recognized the applicable rules of law. While it differed from the Commission in some matter of detail, it sustained the latter\u2019s findings that the value was $5,250,000.00. The question on which this court divided in the <em>Southwestern Bell Telephone Case, supra, </em>is not involved here.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u201cIn the ease of <em>Bluefield Waterworks and Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of West </em>Virginia, 262 U. S. 679, 43 Sup. Ct. 675, 67 L. Ed. 1176:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u201c \u2018It was shown that the prices prevailing in 1920 were nearly double those in 1915 and pre-war time. The company did not claim value as high as its estimate of cost of construction in 1920. Its valuation engineer testified in his opinion the value of the property was $900,000.00 \u2014 a figure between the cost of construction in 1915 and before the war, less depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u201c \u2018The record clearly shows that the Commission in arriving at its final figure did not accord proper, if any, weight to the greatly enhanced cost of construction in 1920 over those prevailing about 1915, and before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>war, as established by uneontradicted evidence; and the company\u2019s detailed estimate cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, at 1920 prices, appears to have been wholly disregarded. This was erroneous. <em>Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of Missouri, </em>262 U. S. 276,43 Sup., Ct. 544, 67 L. Ed. 981, decided May 21, 1923. Plaintiff in error is entitled under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the independent judgment of the court as to both law and facts. <em>Ohio Valley Co. </em>v. <em>Ben Avon Borough, </em>253 U. S. 287-289, 40 Sup. Ct. 527, 64 L. Ed. 908, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u201c \u2018It is clear that the court also failed to give proper consideration to the higher cost of construction in 1920 over that in 1915, and before the war, and failed to give weight to cost of reproduction, less depreciation, on the basis of 1920 prices, or to the testimony of the company\u2019s valuation engineer, based on present and past costs of construction, that the property, in his opinion, was worth $900,000.00. The final figure, $460,000.00, was arrived at substantially on the basis of actual cost, less depreciation, plus ten per cent for going value and $10,000.00 for working capital. This resulted in a valuation considerably and materially less than would have been reached by a fair and just consideration of all the facts. The valuation cannot be sustained. Other objections to the valuation need not be considered.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cThe basis of the appreciation used was the method described and employed in the <em>Virginia Railway and Power Company Case, supra </em>(P. U. R. 1921-C, p. 207, par. 1), reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u201c \u2018To the probable fair 1914 reproduction value may reasonably be added a normal appreciation for the years since that time. Had there been no war, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u25a0would have been a gradual rise in prices due to increasing costs of production. Thus, we have a basis which allows the company the benefit of appreciating values in normal times, based on pre-war values plus actual additions made at war prices.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u201cIn the present case the Commission employed two per cent as representing the normal annual appreciation of the water plant during the years prior to the war and applied this percentage to give twenty per cent appreciation over the pre-war property since the war, with allowance of actual cost of all war time and post-war property.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u201cThe percentage employed for annual advance in prices was derived, as in case of the <em>Lynchburg Traction &amp; Light Company, </em>P. U. R. 1921-E, p. 92, from the annual advance in prices in the years between 1900 and 1915 as published by the United States Department of Labor in its bulletin Whole Number 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201cAt the time of the last hearing Mr. H. P. Gillette, witness for the company, testified that, in his opinion, the prices of January, 1922, would be fully 100 per cent higher than those during the five years ended 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cIn view of the weight which it appears the. Supreme Court has accorded present reproduction cost in these cases where testimony indicated present prices from sixty to 100 per cent above the pre-war prices, the Commission is of opinion that not less than forty per cent appreciation of the value of the pre-war property should be allowed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201c <em>Going Concern Value.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u2018The prevailing reasons which were in view in arriving at the $60,000.00 allowance for going concern value, were that the proper interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Galveston Electric Company decision seemed to be that large going concern allowances were made unnecessary by that decision, and that the apparently poor management of the water company in Roanoke during its past history should affect the going concern value, inasmuch as it would lessen the amount which a purchaser would pay for the property over and above its physical value.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u201cAt the last hearing the company\u2019s witness testified that the going concern value, in his opinion, should be not less than twenty per cent of the present value of the property, exclusive of water rights. This final testimony gives evidence as to going concern value ranging from ten to twenty per cent, all by the company\u2019s witnesses. Under the circumstances there should be an allowance of not less than $114,881.00, particularly in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s reference to this feature in its concluding paragraph on this element of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201cThe allowance of the percentages mentioned above will cause necessity for an increase in rates above those allowed by the Commission in the order under appeal. A calculation based on the foregoing facts and reasons, and applying the conclusions resulting therefrom, gives a valuation for ratemaking purposes of one \u25a0 million seven hundred eighty-six thousand three hundred and fifty-eight ($1,786,358.00) dollars as of January 1, 1922, and makes necessary an increase of approximately twenty-five thousand seven hundred seventy-five ($25,775.00) dollars in annual revenue over that authorized by the Commission in its order of August 31, 1922. These conclusions appear to the Commission, under all the circumstances and in the light of the evidence at both the original and supplementary hearings, to be right and proper, and according to the Commission\u2019s best judgment. An order will be en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>tered putting into effect the conclusions reached herein and certifying the foregoing facts and reasons, together with the evidence taken at the supplementary hearing in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In addition to the action taken in regard to the first appeal, the Commission entered the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u201cThis case came to be again heard on the order of the Supreme Court of Appeals remanding the case for further proceedings before the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, on the evidence introduced at the original hearing and on the additional evidence taken upon the rehearing, and was argued by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u201cUpon consideration whereof the State Corporation Commission being of opinion, upon the statement of facts and reasons and the opinion this day rendered and filed with the papers in these proceedings and made a part of the record, and upon the original and supplementary evidence, that the conclusions reached on the original hearing should be modified in accordance with the said facts, reasons and opinion, and as hereinafter appears, that is, the value of the used and useful property of the Roanoke Water Works Company on January 1, 1922, is $1,786,358.00, thus requiring an increase in annual revenue of approximately $25,775.00:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u201cIf is ordered that the Roanoke Water Works Company file with the State Corporation Commission a revised schedule of rates and charges so as to produce said increase in revenue over rates authorized in the order of this Commission entered on August 31, 1922; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u201cIt is further ordered, that the Roanoke Water Works Company refund to its consumers the several sums of money arising out of the difference between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>rates and charges hereby authorized and those charged since March 1, 1923; * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">It is this order which is the subject of the second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">To the report of the Commission dealing with the matters remanded to it on the first appeal the water company files eleven exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">A number of these exceptions deal with questions which have been disposed of by the decision in the former ease, <em>supra. </em>The remainder of them will be disposed of by what we shall say below.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">For the reasons stated in the report of the Commission above copied, which need not be repeated here, we have reached the following conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">1. That the action of the Commission in fixing upon the appreciation of the property value .over prewar prices at forty per cent instead of the twenty per cent fixed upon by the Commission prior to the former appeal, has, in result, and from sufficient findings of fact as substantially stated, at least, as we think, given due consideration to the \u201cpresent value theory\u201d (which includes due consideration of reproduction value), in conformity with the opinion of this court rendered upon the former appeal; which theory, as stated in that decision, must be considered as \u201cone which must control the decision in this case;\u201d and, hence, there is no error in such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">2. That there is no error in the action of the Commission in rejecting the cost of substituted water supply theory of the water company as decisive of the value of the water rights, and in fixing upon $256,100.00 as the value thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">3. That there is no error in the action of the Commission in fixing upon $114,881.00 as the \u201cgoing value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>This leaves for consideration only one question presented for decision by the assignments of error, namely: Whether the Commission erred in refusing to consider the claims of the water company that certain items of omitted property, of certain aggregate values, referred to in the petition of the water company filed before the Commission on November 23, 1923, should be added to the property valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">4. Of these claims, the larger item, namely, that of Item j, aggregating $807,796.00, appears on its face to consist of items of expense entering into the cost of a substituted water supply, which, in view of our conclusion on the subject above expressed, could not be properly allowed. Item h, aggregating $34,621.00, concerns the \u201cgoing value,\u201d and if not covered by the increased allowance which has been made by the Commission, or in so far as not covered thereby, would be precluded by that allowance; since, as we have above held, we consider such allowance of \u201cgoing value\u201d correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">5. Of the remaining items of the claims under consideration, we will say that if there has been a substantial omission of property from the valuation as of January 1, 1922, which should have been included under the principles applicable to the case as settled by our above stated conclusions and by the decision of this court on the former appeal, the proper value of such property should be added to the total property value of $1,786,358.00 last found by the Commission. We are, therefore, of the opinion\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">4. That the Commission erred in undertaking to fix the rate as of March 21, 1924. It should have fixed the rate as of January 1, 1922, as it was only as of that date that it fixed upon the value of the property, of the water company. A property valuation as of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>latter date could not properly furnish the basis for fixing the rate as of a date so long subsequent as the former date.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"> The failure of the Commission to permit the water company to prove the value of any omitted property grows out of an erroneous construction upon the part of the Commission and attorneys of the decision of the court heretofore adverted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In remanding the case, Judge Kelly says: \u201cThe facts and the reasons upon which the Commission based its action as to (1) the appreciation of values over pre war unit prices, (2) water rights, and (3) going value, have not been stated in such manner as would justify this court in presuming <em>prima facie </em>that the findings of the Commission are correct, and it would be unfair to the Commission not to make the presumption until the matter has been brought to its attention and it has been allowed the opportunity to certify to this court the facts and reasons required by section 156 of the Constitution. It may be also that the Commission may desire to hear further testimony on the above questions, and if so an opportunity therefor should be afforded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In construing this language, counsel for the water company contended before the Commission that it. was not the intention of the court to limit the inquiry to the three questions mentioned, but that the practical question involved was the right of the company to show the real value of the property for rate-making purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">This position was combated by counsel for the Commonwealth. The chairman of the Commission, in ruling upon the question, said: \u25a0 ' ;</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u201cGentlemen, the Commission thinks^ that Colonel Anderson\u2019s position is a practical one \u2014 is the correct one; nevertheless, we think that under the holding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the Supreme Court, \u2018the facts, and the reasons upon which the Commission based its actions as to (1) the appreciation of values over pre-war unit prices, (2) water rights, and (3) going value,\u2019 etc. * * it seems to the Commission that the Commission is limited to those three questions, in taking additional evidence, and that we would not be justified in going into any investigation outside of those questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">It was not the intention of this court to deprive either of the parties litigant of any rights in the premises. To base a rate upon an inequitable valuation would amount to a confiscation of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">As said by Judge Burks in the <em>Petersburg Gas Company Case, </em>132 Va. 82, 110 S. E. 533, 20 A. L. R. 542: \u201cBoth the State and Federal Constitutions forbid the taking of private property for. public use without making just compensation therefor, and the common law forbids the taking of private property of one person and giving it to another, with or without just compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">If, therefore, a rate should be fixed either by the State Corporation Commission, or by this court, based upon an insufficient valuation, the same would be illegal. The company is entitled to have its products sold to the users thereof, so as to yield it a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is being used for the public. <em>San Diego, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>City of National City, </em>174 U. S. 739, 19 Sup. Ct. 804, 43 L. Ed. 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">On the other hand, what the consumer of water is entitled to is a just value and not a fictitious one based upon fine spun theories as to what enters into the valuation of the plant. In speaking of the difficulty attending the making of rates for the conduct of the business of public service corporations, Judge Kelly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>in <em>Roanoke W. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>says: \u201cThe subject involves inherent difficulties which up to the present time have baffled the best experts and judicial minds in their efforts to evolve a system sound and just in principle and uniform in application. The reported decisions upon the subject by rate making bodies and by the courts are in a state of conflict and confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">To our mind the source of all this \u201cconflict and confusion\u201d is greed \u2014 greed upon the part of both seller and consumer. Neither can well exist independent of the other. So long as there is a suggestion by the consumer that public utility companies gather in a pile a handful of rusty nails and old scrap iron and list the \u201cassembled assets\u201d as \u201cworking capital and supplies,\u201d and so long as the consumer fails or refuses to recognize the real burdens of the companies, just so long will the rate making bodies be called upon to fix rates upon a basis of speculation and not upon something tangible.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Since the \u201cpresent value theory\u201d and the \u201cprudent investment theory,\u201d as applied by experts and judges, have fallen far short of solving the difficulty, we would suggest as a panacea for this grievous economic evil the application of the \u201cgolden rule theory\u201d upon the part of both the seller and the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">With respect to the other assignments of error, we are of the opinion that there is no merit in them, and we are further of the opinion that as to the other items, the facts and reasons set forth by the Commission fully meet the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">It is urged, however, that this court should decide upon said remaining items of claim and fix the proper rate; but such items are not shown in the record before us sufficiently specifically to enable us to pass upon them. It is with much regret that we find our<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>selves not in a situation to decide what should be added to the value of the property of the water company, if anything, on account of these remaining claims, so as to be able to enter a final decree or order disposing of the case before us. But in view of the condition of the record we see no escape from a reference back to the Commission, in order that it may hear proof upon the aforesaid remaining items, namely, those designated in said petition as items a, b, c, d, e, f, g and j, and decide what property covered by such items, if any, was omitted property which should have been included in the valuation of the property of the water company as of January 1, 1922, and at what value, if any, under the principles adopted by the Commission in its findings under review which have been approved by our conclusions above stated and by the decision of this court on the former appeal; and accordingly to increase, or not increase, its fixing of the total value of the property of the water company as of January 1, 1922, and to enter its order requiring the Roanoke Water Works Company to file with the Corporation Commission a revised schedule of rates and charges to go into effect as of January 1, 1922, accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">It follows from what has been said that the case will have to be reversed in part and remanded; and the Roanoke Water Works Company having substantially prevailed in its contention as to rates, it is awarded its costs in this behalf expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\n<em>Reversed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
