Boyer and Elva C. Boyer, and before delivery indorsed by defendant Carroll (also an appellant).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-26\">Accompanying the declaration was an affidavit of merit containing an averment thai the payees \u201cfor value received, and before maturity thereof, in due course, transferred said note to plaintiff.\u201d A hill of particulars also accompanied the declaration and contained a copy of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-27\">Defendants filed a joint plea and an affidavit by the defendant Bulow \u201con behalf o\u00ed Ms co-defendant, Harry R. Carroll, as well as on his own behalf.\u201d In the affidavit it is alleged that on April 2, 1932, defendant Bu-low entered into a contract with Jacob S. Boyer and Elva C. Boyer in which the Boy-ers agreed to sell and deliver, unincumbered in any manner whatsoever, unto the defendant Bulow, 226 shares 'of a total outstanding 230 shares of the capital slock of the Boyer Motor Sales, Incorporated (hereinafter referred to as the motor company), for which Bulow agreed to pay the Boyers $500 in cash on delivery of the shares of stock, and to issue and deliver his two promissory notes, each hearing date April <em>2, </em>1932) one payable 60 days after date in the sum of $1,000, and the other, the note sued on, each note to be indorsed by defendant Carroll; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>that in the contract the Boyers agreed to exhibit, and did exhibit, to the defendant Bu-low, certain books, statements of account, and records, and did \u2022warrant that they contained an accurate and complete record of all the assets and liabilities of the motor company; that from time to time after the execution and delivery of the notes defendants discovered that such books, statements, and records did not contain a true and accurate record of all the assets and liabilities of the motor company, in that they listed large and divers assets which the motor company did not possess) and failed to list large and divers liabilities of the motor company; that on maturity of the $1,000 note defendants had discovered various and divers errors in such books, accounts, and records, for which they claimed and received credit against such note; \u201cthat between the date of the maturity of said note in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) and the time of the filing of the said declaration, the defendants have discovered and are still discovering various and divers errors in the said books, statements of account and records, to their loss and damage, which, by reason of said warranty, they are entitled to have set-off against said note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Affiant further alleges that \u201che is advised and believes and expects to prove at the trial hereof that the said plaintiff, William L. Jenkins, is not a holder in due eourse of said note in that he knew of the aforesaid warranty; and further that he is an uncle and close friend and represented in this action by the attorney of the said Jacob S. Boyer and Elva C. Boyer, and knew of their breach of said warranty and of the controversy between them and these defendants because of said breaeh of warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We have many times suggested that the object of the seventy-third rule of the court below is to promote justice by preventing, so far as possible, fictitious defenses. Codington v. Standard Bank, 40 App. D. C. 409. The rule provides, in part, that the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment, \u201cunless the defendant shall file, along with his plea, if in bar, an affidavit of defense, denying the right of the plaintiff as to the whole or some specified part of his claim, and specifically stating also, in precise and distinct terms, the grounds of his defense, which must be such as would, if true, be sufficient to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim in whole or in part. And where the defendant shall have acknowledged in his affidavit of defense his liability for a part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as aforesaid the plaintiff, if he so elect, may have judgment entered in his favor for the amount so confessed to be due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In the present case the averments in the affidavit of defense are vague and indefinite. No amount is confessed, and it would therefore be impossible for plaintiff to have judgment entered in his favor for any amount less than the whole. See King v. Curtin, 31 App. D. C. 23. The affidavit discloses that the defendant Bulow on April 2, 1932, purchased from the Boyers substantially all the stock of the motor company, and in payment therefor gave two promissory notes dated April 2, 1932. The first note for $1,000 was payable in 60 days. Under the terms of the agreement, the Boyers were to exhibit, and did exhibit, to the defendant Bulow \u201ccertain books, statements of account, and records,\u201d which they warranted to contain \u201can accurate and complete record of all the assets and liabilities\u201d of the motor company. Defendants discovered that these books, statements, and records did not contain a true and accurate reeord of all the assets and liabilities of the motor company; that upon maturity of the $1,000 note defendants had discovered \u201cvarious and divers errors\u201d in such books, accounts, and records, \u201cfor which they claimed and obtained eredit against the said note.\u201d The amount claimed and for which credit was given is not stated, but it does appear that the adjustment was made as of the date of the maturity of the 60-day note, since which time, it is alleged in the affidavit, \u201cthe defendants have discovered and are still discovering various and divers errors in the said books, statements of account, and records, to their loss and damage.\u201d The nature and extent of the \u201cvarious and divers errors\u201d is not stated. Whether they amount in the aggregate to $1, $5 or $100 is left to conjecture. In view of the fact that an adjustment was made upon the maturity of the first note, and that, so far as disclosed, the defendants have had access to the books and records since the date of the notes, we think the affidavit should have been more specific. We therefore agree with the trial court that, \u201capart from any other question,\u201d the affidavit of defense is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
