Not only has appellant violated Rule 9 of this court (Barber Asphalt Paving Company v. Standard Asphalt <em>&amp; </em>Rubber Company, 275 U. S. 372, 48 S. Ct. 183, 72 L. Ed. 318), but it-has failed to secure any approval or certification of the evidence as being all of the evidence received on the trial or necessary to present the case to this court on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-24\">We have, however, acted on the assumption that all of the evidence is in the record and have overlooked appellant\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 9 of this court and have studied the briefs and records with the result that we are entirely satisfied with the decree which was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-25\">The appeal is from a decree dismissing a bill which sought relief because of the appel-lee\u2019s alleged unlawful infringement of appellant\u2019s patent No. 1,461,967. \u2019 It appears that two patents were issued out of the patent office on the same day to the same party, appellant\u2019s assignor. One covered a machine and the other was a process patent. \u25a0 The suit was originally brought on both patents, but at the trial appellant dismissed or withdrew that part of the complaint which charged an infringement of the machine patent. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b528-26\">Claim 2, quite typical of all claims, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-27\">\u201cThe herein described process of making paper-^folding boxes, consisting in preparing blanks of uniform size, in feeding the blanks progressively to a box making apparatus, in causing the blanks to be moved without pause through said apparatus, in effecting simultaneously folding of the opposite corners of the front end of each blank, and thereafter to effect simultaneously folding of the opposite corners of the rear end of each blank, and in a still later operation to effect folding of the opposite side edges of each blank, as. the same are advanced through said apparatus, in causing adhesive junctures to be made between folded portions of each blank, and in causing the blanks to be delivered singly from said apparatus in knoeked-down form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-28\"> In disposing of this and other similar claims, the court said (2 F. Supp. 531):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-29\">\u201c * * * The machine Patent, No. 1,461,-966, has been dismissed out of the case, leaving only the process patent in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-30\">\u201cDefendant claims this patent is invalid and void for the reason that it does not set up a patentable process, but only statements of a function of the automatic machine covered by Patent No. 1,461,966. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-31\">\u201cThe patent in issue is process Patent No. 1,461,967, issued to Charles Butterfield July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>17, 1923, and belongs to plaintiff. The finished box that Butterfield describes is old and known to the trade as a paper box scored diagonally, which has been made for a long time, either by hand or by the use of machines which folded the cardboard on the diagonal scores and produced the exact same box. Butterfield does not claim an improved box, but he does claim that the boxes are produced more rapidly than before because certain folds are made while the blank is progressing on the machine. This is an improvement in the automatic machine, not in the process. Butterfield, in the language of the Supreme Court, \u2018Cannot describe a machine which will perform a certain function, and then claim the function itself, and all other machines that may be invented to perform the same function.\u2019 And that is just what Butterfield has attempted to do. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cIn Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 14 L. Ed. 683, the Supreme Court held that \u2018all that he, the patentee, invented in fact was a machine for the more perfect manufacture of such pulleys. The operation or function of such machine, however, is not patentable as a process.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cAnd in Risdon Locomotive Works v. Medart, 158 U. S. 68, 15 S. Ct. 745, 751, 39 L. Ed. 899, the same court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201c \u2018Medart may or may not have been entitled to a patent for the machinery employed in the manufacture of the belt pulleys in question, but he certainly was not entitled to a patent for the function of such machine.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201cWhat plaintiff invented, if anything, was a machine that speeded up the manufacture of folding paper boxes. He claims that the principal feature of this machine is the device that folds the flaps while the blank is being moved forward without pause, and that lilis feature is a novel process. This, defendant denies, and claims that under certain British patents the same feature was used long before the patent in this case issued. I do not deem it necessary to decide this question, and in'my opinion, even if plaintiff\u2019s claim is true, all that plaintiff invented was a machine or parts of a machine upon which he may have been entitled to a patent, but, under the authorities, he did not discover or invent a new and patentable process or method.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">\u201c \u2018A valid patent cannot he obtained for a process which, involves nothing more than the operation of a piece of mechanism, or in other words, for the function of a machine.\u2019 Risdon Locomotive Works v. Medart, 158 U. S. 68 at page 77, 15 S. Ct. 745, 748, 39 L. Ed. 899. \u00bb *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">\u201cProcess Patent No. 1,461,967, is invalid for the reason that it does not describe a pat-tentable process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">We agree with the views thus expressed by Judge Slick and add the following to meel appellant\u2019s argument in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">The steps of the process claim (conceding they were sufficiently definite to support appellant\u2019s argument in its behalf) were limited to the successive \u201cmechanical transactions\u201d of the machine which was itself covered by the patent issued on the same day as the process patent and upon identical specifications. No step of any of the process claims was new nor was there novelty in the order or the number of said steps nor in the product that resulted therefrom. The steps were individually and collectively the acts \u2014 that is, the operations \u2014 of the machine, and <em>as described, </em>were limited to <em>the </em>machine covered by the patent. Under such circumstances there is no valid basis for support of the process patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">It is the lack of novelty in the steps or in their combined use that defeats validity rather than the uso of a machine to perform an act which constitutes a stepin the process claim. The act which is one of the successive steps of a valid process claim may he performed by a machine as well as by a hand. But if all such acts are but the successive functions of the machine covered by a simultaneously granted patent, then the claims of such process patent are invalid. This is the situation which is presented in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">The decree is</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
