In due course United\u2019s answer raised two defenses, first, that the patent was invalid; second, that, if valid, the plaintiff had granted it a patent license. We here note plaintiff thereupon petitioned the court to first try out the question of the existence of a license, but defendant objected thereto, and sueh objection was heard and determined by the court in accord with defendant\u2019s contention. Thereafter proofs were taken, and, after final hearing, the court filed an opinion in which it stated: \u201cWe have considered all the questions raised by counsel. The result of our labor is that we find the patent in suit valid, and that the defendant has not infringed the same by reason of the license contract.\u201d Thereafter the court entered its decree, viz.: \u201cAnd now, to wit, this 9th day of January, 1933, this cause came on to be heard at this term, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, upon .consideration thereof, it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed as follows, viz.: That the bill be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff.\u201d From sueh decree dismissing its bill the plaintiff took no appeal. The defendant-appealed, and its pertinent assignment of error is: \u201cThe Court erred in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint, without qualification, because, while on its face said decree purports to be wholly in defendant\u2019s favor, it is not in fact so, since, if interpreted to sustain the defense of license under the patent in suit\u2014 as it must be in view of some of the Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law \u2014 it saddles upon defendant the burdens imposed by said license, and it also, necessarily, in view of other of the Court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, upholds the validity of said patent and overrules defendant\u2019s specific defense of invalidity of said patent, all of which is prejudicial and injurious to defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">In view of the fact that the. decree dismisses the plaintiff\u2019s bill and the further fact that sueh decree is in accord with the specific relief prayed for in the defendant\u2019s answer, namely, \u201cDefendant therefore prays that this \u00a1bill of complaint be dismissed with costs to plaintiff,\u201d is the defendant, which has not surrendered or canceled the license, and is now enjoying the monopoly of the patent, warranted in asking this court in this appeal to convict the court below of error in its decree and here contest the validity of the patent? In that connection we note that, assuming for present purposes the defendant could plead whatever defenses it chose, the situation of standing on its unsurrondered license and insisting on a decree which does not invalidate, and therefore leaves it in possession of a licensee\u2019s rights, it follows that, enjoying and possessing sueh license, the defendant is not in a position to contest the validity of its licensor\u2019s patent, the monopoly and rights to which it retains. Such holding is in line with recognized authorities. Platt v. Fire-Extinguisher Mfg. Co. (C. C. A.) 59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>F. 897; Harding v.
