Appellant\u2019s notice of opposition reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-30\">\u201cIn the matter of an application for the registration of the trademark for diverse surgical, ehirurgical and medical instruments, Serial No. 315,461 filed June 5, 1931 by the Kny-Seheerer Corporation, of New York, N. Y., which was published on page 41, volume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>409, No. 1, of the Official Gazette of August 4, 1931, the Aktiengesellsehaft f\u00fcr Fein-mechanik vormals letter &amp; Scheerer, a German Corporation, residing and having its principal place of business in Tuttlingen, South Germany, in the German Republic, believes it would be damaged by such registration and it hereby gives notice of its intention to oppose the registration of said trademark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\">\u201cThe grounds of opposition are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-5\">\u201c1. That the predecessor of the opposer was the firm of letter <em>&amp; </em>Scheerer of Tut-tlingen in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg (now South Germany), and Empire of Germany and caused its trademark to be duly registered in the United States Patent Office as No. 17,761, on April 15, 1890, by virtue of the use of said mark since the first day of December, 1889;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-6\">\u201c2. And that thereafter on or about 1895 the opposer, the Aktiengesellsehaft f\u00fcr Fein-meehanik vormals letter <em>&amp; </em>Scheerer, succeeded the firm of letter &amp; Scheerer and became the owner of all rights to use the said registered trademark in business, and on the 12th day of December, 1903 the said trademark was duly assigned to opposer and said assignment was duly recorded in the United States Patent Office on the 4th day of January, 1904;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-7\">\u201c3. That from a date prior to 1895, op-poser\u2019s predecessor, the firm of letter <em>&amp; </em>Scheerer, manufactured and sold certain surgical, chirurgieal and medical instruments under their trademark as represented by the United States registration No. 17,761, both in Germany, -and in export trade to other countries and in particular to the United States of America;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-8\">\u201c4. That since the establishment of the opposer\u2019s company, Aktiengesellsehaft f\u00fcr Feinmeehanik vormals letter <em>&amp; </em>Scheerer, instruments of this same description have been by the opposer continuously manufactured under this trademark and sold both in Germany and by export to foreign countries including the United States of America;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-9\"><em>\u201c5. </em>That for the purpose of importing into the United States these goods under this and other trademarks the Kny-Scheerer Company, of New York, N. Y., was established and was made the exclusive agent of opposer\u2019s predecessor and later of the opposer company for the importation, sale and distribution of said goods within the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-10\">\u201c6. That thereafter, to facilitate The Kny-Seheerer Company in its business solely as agent for opposer, and for the agreed-upon use of the mark exclusively on merchandise obtained from opposer only and for such period as said agency should exist, but not for any period subsequent to the expiration of such agency, an assignment was executed purporting to convey from tho opposer company to the Kny-Scheerer Company the bare legal whole right, title and interest in and to the said trademark registered No. 17,761 of April 15, 1890, without however conveying the good-will and business in which this mark was then used by opposer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-11\"><em>\u201c7. </em>That in furtherance of opposer\u2019s business and the existing agency of The Kny-Scheerer Company a variation of registered trademark No. 17,761 was registered March 12, 1907, No. 61,298 and a further variation was registered September 24, 1908 No. 65,359 both to the Kny-Seheerer Company as agent for opposer and thereafter both registrations were duly renewed by the successor of The Kny-Seheerer Company still as agent of opposer\u2019s company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-12\">\u201c8. That opposer is the owner of the similar trademark registered July 8, 1930, No. 272,668 for related articles of manufacture and sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-13\">\u201c9. That the trademarks registered No. 17,761; No. 65,359 and No. 272,668 have been used exclusively on goods manufactured by opj)oser and imported, sold and distributed within tho United States of America by opposer\u2019s agents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-14\">\u201c10. That the articles upon which the said trade-marks are applied are hand instruments affording very little space for marking or display of the trade-marks and therefore the marks when placed- on the instruments are necessarily greatly reduced in size to the extent that slight variations in marks are not readily discernible to the ordinary observer thus materially increasing the probability of confusion as to trade-marks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-15\">\u201c11. That opposer has prepared and distributed at frequent intervals catalogues of these goods as manufactured under the said trade-marks and that from the time of the establishment of the original firm of letter &amp; Scheerer the marks have been recognized as representing goods manufactured by them and by opposer as their successor and that the marks have established throughout the world a reputation for the goods of high quality manufactured by opposer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-16\">\u201c12. That the Kny-Scheerer Company of New York has been succeeded in business by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>the applicant, Kny-Seheerer Corporation of New York, and.that the latter and its predecessor in title have np until approximately February 1,1931, enjoyed the exclusive agency for the United States of America for the goods manufactured by opposer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-4\">\u201c13. That since the date last stated the agency of the applicant has been terminated and that the exclusive agency for the goods manufactured by opposer has been otherwise established;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-5\">\u201c14. That the trade-mark sought to be registered by applicant under application, Serial No. 315,461 is applied to identical goods manufactured by the opposer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">\u201c15. That the trade-mark sought to be registered under the said application above identified is substantially identical and similar to those used on goods of opposer\u2019s manufacture and is certain to be confusing to the trade, and misleading to the publie and will work a hardship, injustice and damage to the opposer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-7\">, \u201c16. Two specimens of the mark as used by the opposer are attached hereto, together with the required fee.for opposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-8\">\u201c17. Wherefore opposer prays that the application Serial No. 315,461 of Kny-Seheerer Corporation for registration of the trade-mark, published August 4, 1931, be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">Thereafter appellee entered a motion to dismiss said opposition, which motion reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-10\">\u201cNow comes Kny-Scheerer Corporation, the applicant in the above entitled ease, through its counsel, and moves that the opposition herein be dismissed, and that the proceedings be suspended pending the determination of this motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-11\">\u201cThis motion is based upon the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-12\">\u201c(1) Opposer herein in his grounds of opposition alleges that the title of the three controlling United States trade marks Nos. 17,761 of April -15, 1890, 61,298 of March 12, 1907 and 65,359 of September 24, 1908 are in applicant. Said allegations are found in paragraph 6 of the opposition as to trade mark No. 17,761 and in paragraph 7 as to trade marks Nos. 61,298 and 65,359.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-13\">\u201c(2) Opposer alleges that trade mark No. 272,668 of July 8, 1930; which is the trade mark declared on and relied upon as the basis for this opposition, is similar to the three said controlling trade marks Nos. 17,761, 61,298, and 65,359 and is for related articles of manufacture. This allegation is found in paragraph 8 of the opposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-15\">\u201c(3) Opponent therefore' declares upon this opposition in total disregard of and in defiance of the title records of the Patent Office by which records the Examiner of Interferences of Trade marks is absolutely bound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-16\">\u201c(4) On the allegations of opponent referred to above and set forth in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the opposition herein, opponent has failed to set forth a cause of action as opponent has admitted that the title of the three said controlling trade marks Nos. 17,-761, 61,298 and 65,359 are in applicant and that opponent\u2019s registration No. 272,668 is similar to said three trade marks and for similar goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-17\">\u201c(5) Any question of agency or other question attempted to be raised by opponent in connection with the title of said three controlling trade marks Nos. 17,761, 61,298 and 65.359 is an attack on the title of said three trade marks Nos. 17,761, 61,298 and 65,359 and cannot be raised in this opposition proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-19\">\u201c(6) Opponent by alleging the title of the three original and dominating trade marks Nos. 17,761, 61,298 and 65,359 in applicant has thereby admitted applicant\u2019s exclusive right to the trade mark of the application herein and the opposition should for this additional reason be dismissed and the application allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">Trade-mark registrations Nos. 17,761, 61,-298 and 65,359, as granted by the Patent Office, appear in the record. Registration No. 61,298 has the notation \u201cRenewed to the Kny-Seheerer Corporation of America, a corporation of New York,\u201d and registration No. 65.359 bears the notation \u201cRenewed The Kny-Seheerer Corporation of America, a Corporation of New York, assignee by mesne assignments.\u201d Trade-mark registration No. 272,668, which appellant alleges it owns, does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-22\">The Examiner of Interferences granted the motion to dismiss upon the ground that appellant <em>'\u25a0 </em>in its notice of opposition admitted tljiat the record title to the trade-mark involved; was in appellee, and that therefore the Pateht Office tribunals were without jurisdiction to pass upon the issues raised in said notice, but that such jurisdiction was vested exclusively in the federal courts under the provisions of section 17 of the TradeMark Act of February 20, 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 97).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Said section 17 reads as follows: \u201cSec. 17. That the district'and Territorial courts of the United States and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia shall have original jurisdiction, and the circuit courts of appeal of the United States and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia shall have appellate jurisdiction of all suits at law or in equity respecting trade-marks registered in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision of this chapter, arising under the present act, without regard to the amount in controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The Examiner of Interferences accordingly dismissed the notice of opposition and adjudged that appellee was entitled to registration of the mark applied for. Upon appeal by appellant to the Commissioner of Patents, as hereinbefore noted, the said decision of the Examiner of Interferences was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">In his decision the Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atl-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * The opposer claims ownership of the same mark used upon the same class of goods and sets up its ownership of trade-mark registration No. 272,668 issued July 8, 1930, for a quite similar mark used upon pocket-knives, knives, forks, and spoons of base metals for the table, kitchen knives, hunting knives, leather-cutting knives, razors, scissors, shears, metallic knife sharpeners, pinchers, tweezers, wrenches, monkey wrenches, screw drivers, cigar cutters, corkscrews, metallic coasters, and axes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">\u201cThe motion to dismiss was granted substantially upon the ground that the matters presented by the opposition for adjudication were without the jurisdiction of the Patent Office and constituted matters more properly reviewable and determinable by a court of equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">As hereinbefore stated, said registration No. 272,668 does not appear in the record, and the only information before us as to the goods covered by sueh registration is the foregoing quoted statement of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">The Commissioner further recited certain facts, preceded by the following: \u201cThe record as presented in the opposition <em>and the briefs </em>discloses. * * * \u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">The Commissioner concludes such' recital with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">\u201cThe applicant sets up, and the opposer does not deny, that the three trade-marks and all rights thereunder and business connected therewith were duly seized by the Alien Property Custodian under the Trading with the Enemy Act approved October 6, 1917 [see 50 USCA Appendix \u00a7 1, et seq.] and that subsequently title to these marks and the business connected with them was again obtained by the applicant here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-14\">\u201cUpon the foregoing state of facts, which are virtually agreed upon by both parties, it is deemed to be clear enough this Office is without jurisdiction to determine whether the opposer has any rights in these trademarks as registered and renewed. The record title is now in the applicant company. Whether the opposer has any equity in the ownership of or equitable title to these marks could not be established by the instant procedure, but presumably only by a proceeding in equity. It would in consequence not be of utility for the opposer to take testimony to establish the allegations set forth in its opposition. It would appear further to be necessary for the opposer to establish title in this registered mark or marks in order to establish legal damage by the registration now applied for by the applicant. It is held this office is without jurisdiction to determine the issue raised by the notice of opposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">We can find nowhere in the record any statement by the applicant respecting seizure by the Alien Property Custodian of the marks referred to, or their disposition by him. Appellant\u2019s counsel in his brief states that the transfer of said marks by the Alien Property Custodian was made \u201csubject to sueh rights, if any, as Kny-Scheerer Corporation held.\u201d If this be a fact, it may or may not be material to the issues raised by the opposition, but obviously, upon the record before us, we may not consider any matters with relation to the connection of the Alien Property Custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">The motion to dismiss was based upon the theory that the notice of opposition failed to state any grounds upon which appellee\u2019s application should be denied, and the decision of the Commissioner of Patents should have been based wholly upon the allegations of the notice of opposition, as was the decision of the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">Following the language of the Commissioner last above quoted, he further stated: \u201cThe decision of the examiner of interferences dismissing the opposition and adjudging the applicant entitled to the registration for which it has applied is affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-18\"> The Examiner of Interferences makes no reference to registration No. 272,668, which appellant, in its notice of opposition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>alleges is owned by it, and which, it states, was issued July 8, 1930, and the only reference thereto by the Commissioner in his decision is the statement that appellant sets up in its notice of opposition ownership of said mark, and the Commissioner, as hereinbefore quoted, stated in detail the character of goods for which such registration was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">It would seem from such recital that the goods covered by said registration No. 272,-668 may be of the same descriptive properties as the goods set forth in appellee\u2019s application, and, if they are, it would seem that such registration would bar appellee\u2019s application unless said registration No. 272,-668 has been canceled in a proper proceeding'or has been abandoned. At any rate, appellant in its notiee of opposition alleges ownership of said registration, and further alleges that said mark is for \u201crelated articles of manufacture and sale.\u201d Appelle\u00e9\u2019s motion to dismiss the notiee of opposition states that said mark No. 272,668 is the mark \u201cdeclared on and relied upon as the basis for this opposition.\u201d We think the notice of opposition supports this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">It is well established that in an opposition proceeding the court will not consider the validity of opposer\u2019s prior registration pleaded in its notice of opposition. Sharp &amp; Dohme v. Parke, Davis <em>&amp; </em>Co., 37 F.(2d) 960, 17 C. C. P. A. 842; Celanese Corporation of America v. Vanity Fair Silk Mills, 47 F.(2d) 373, 18 C. C. P. A. 958; Revere Sugar Refinery v. Joseph G. Salvato, 48 F.(2d) 400, 18 C. C. P. A. 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal are sufficiently specific to enable us to consider the question of error upon the part of the Commissioner in not holding that the motion to dismiss the notiee of opposition should be denied in view of the allegation therein that appellant is the owner of said registration No. 272,668.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">It is clear from all the foregoing that ap-pellee\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">In view of the state of the record, we do not feel called upon at this time to consider the proceedings had by the Alien Property Custodian, whatever they may have been, or whether- appellant has any rights in the registrations issued or assigned to appellee which should bar appellee\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-1\"><em>r </em>For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed, and the proceeding is remanded for further action consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
