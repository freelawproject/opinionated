He was driving to school.\u201d He did not \u201cown the ear; the defendant owns it.\u201d The registration card for the car produced by the witness bore the name of the defendant as owner. The defendant admitted that the application for the certificate . of title for the ear bore his signature and that the certificate of title had been issued to him pursuant to that application, and that the application for the registration of the car had been signed by him as the owner of 'the vehicle. Plaintiff testified that after the accident the defendant stated to him that he (defendant) owned the car driven by his son; that he had turned it over to his son for'use in going to school and otherwise; that his son was using it the morning of the accident with his authority and permission. There was no denial of this testimony by the defendant, although he testified that he \u201cgave the ear to his son on the express understanding that he should not be responsible because of the dangerous nature of an automobile in the hands of young persons; because you cannot foresee what will happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-23\">The evidence that the ownership of the car was in the defendant was overwhelming. It is not denied that the minor son was using the car with the father\u2019s knowledge and consent in driving to school. In our view the court erred in reaching the legal conclusion from this evidence that \u201cthere was no relation of agency or master and servant.\u201d That the son at the time of the accident was acting within the scope of the authority conferred upon him by the father is plain. The legal effect was the establishment of the relationship of agency. Smith v. Jordan, 211 Mass. 269, 97 N. E. 761; Denison v. McNorton (C. C. A.) 228 F. 401; see, also, Young v. Masci, 289 U. S. 253, 53 S. Ct. 599, 77 L. Ed. 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-24\">It results, therefore, that the judgment must be reversed, with costs, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-25\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
