The only evidence offered was documentary. The case was submitted upon such evidence, stipulation of facts by counsel, and admissions by the pleadings. The court granted defendant\u2019s motion to find for defendant and against plaintiff. Upon findings of fact and conclusions of law judgment was entered for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The court found that on October 21, 1922, appellee and appellant\u2019s predecessors in interest entered into a written contract, a copy of which was made a part of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, by the terms of which the latter were appointed \u201cGeneral Agents\u201d or \u201cManagers\u201d for appellee for the state of California, the contract to take effect and be in force on and after January 1, 1923. By the terms of the contract the said genera] agents or managers were allowed \u201ca flat commission of thirty-five per cent of the net premiums written,\u201d and, in addition thereto, \u201ca contingent commission of fifteen (15) per cent of the net profits of the business under their charge, said profits to be computed as of the 31st day of December, 1923, and annually thereafter on the business of each \u2018single\u2019 year so long as this agreement shall continue.\u201d The contract contained specific provisions for determining the net profits for any \u201csingle\u201d year, and further provided: \u201cIn ease of the termination of this contract no Contingent Commission or profit and loss statement shall be rendered until the ex. piration of six months from date of the termination of said contract; but said Contingent shall be settled as of the date of the termination of said contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">The \u201cTenth\u201d subdivision or section of the contract contained the following provisions concerning the termination of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">s \u201cThis contract may be terminated at any time by either party giving the other sixty (60) days notice in writing, at the expiration of which time this contract shall cease and determine. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">\u201cIn the event of such termination and after the expiration of the time named in said notice, all property and vouchers in the hands of said Managers, relating to the business of the Company, shall be turned over to said Company, and there shall be a complete adjustment and settlement of all matters between the parties hereto growing out of this agreement, upon the basis of its terms and conditions, and any balances due from either party to the other shall thereupon' be paid, excepting as hereinbefore provided as to the Contingent Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">The court made additional findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-15\">\u201cTh\u00e1t plaintiff received said statement of account and by telegraph of February 17th, 1926, and letter of February 18th, 1926, confirmed said statement so rendered by defendant and plaintiff and defendant by mutual agreement adjusted and determined the amount due one from the other, struck a balance and it was then and there determined and agreed that the balance due or to become due from defendant to plaintiff was the said sum of Fourteen Thousand Five Hundred Fifty-five Dollars ($14,555.00), and defendant thereupon and on February 25th, 1926, paid to plaintiff the said sum of Fourteen Thousand Five Hundred Fifty-five Dollars ($14,555.00) and plaintiff then and there received and accepted said sum in full satisfaction and final determination of all matters and things between plaintiff and defendant with reference to said contingent commission account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-16\">\u201c * * * That plaintiff is barred by paragraphs 1 and subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of paragraph 2 of section 337 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California and that the Statute of Limitations of this State has run as against the alleged claim of plaintiff herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of errors all go to the question whether the court below \u201cerred in finding that the contract between plaintiff and defendant became terminated on-June 29th, 1925, by notice of defendant to plaintiff and by mutual consent of the parties thereto,\u201d and \u201cthat plaintiff and defendant by mutual agreement adjusted and determined the amount due one from the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">The portions of the notice of termina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tion of the contract material to the questions presented on this appeal read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">\u201cJune 29, 1925</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\u201cHarris and Watson, Inc. (Formerly Labry and Harris and Watson, Ine.) Los An-geles, Calif.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cGentlemen: Pursuant to Section 10, Paragraph 1, of our General Agency contract with you, dated the 21st day of October, 1922, and effective as of January 1st, 1923, which paragraph reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">\u201c \u2018This contract may be? terminated at any time by either party giving tho other sixty (60) days notice in writing, at the expiration of which time this contract shall cease and determine.

Wollacger, President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">It is clear both from the provisions of tho contract and the notice of termination that two settlements were required to he made between the parties, one to be made within sixty days of the notice involving all matters excepting contingent commissions, and one to be made respecting contingent commissions within six months after such termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">By letter of dato February 13, 1926, ap-pellee transmitted to appellant\u2019s predecessors in interest a \u201cStatement of Contingent Commission,\u201d covering the period January 1, 1925-July 1, 1925. By letter of February 18, 1926, appellant\u2019s predecessor replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-19\">\u201cThis is to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 13th accompanied by the Contingent Statement and to confirm my telegram to you of the 17th confirming the figures. # # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-21\">\u201cThere are a few slight differences with our records in the statement. * * * The net difference between these two items is nominal and not worthy of a change in the statement and we accordingly telegraphed you our confirmation of the figures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-23\">A letter of date March 1, 1926, to the president of appellee, in part reads: \u201cThis is to acknowledge receipt of your remittance of $14,555.00 together with the Supplementary Recapitulation covering the several small differences, for ail of which we duly thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-24\">It was stipulated \u201cthat subsequent to June 29, 1925, and continuously up to November, 1928, there were numerous transactions between plaintiff and defendant consisting of credits and debits with proper accounting therefor of return premiums arising by means of policies that were cancelled between said last mentioned dates, said policies having been written in defendant corporation prior to June 29, 1925, by plaintiff pursuant to the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">It was not until July 11,1930, that appellant by letter of that date made claim for an additional amount as then owing on account of contingent commissions. The letter recites that the date thereof \u201cmarks the expiration of the last Concordia policy written,\u201d and calls attention to the fact that the statement of contingent commissions furnished February 13, 1925, relative to the settlement as of date July 1, 1925', showed a premium reserve as of that date in the amount of $83,639.94, in which it was claimed appellant \u201cshould have a substantial interest in the remaining portion of the premiums after deducting the net loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-26\">It is clear from the provisions of tho contract that, upon a termination thereof, a final settlement was to be made both of \u201cfiat\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d commissions. The first mention of \u201cContingent Commission\u201d is in tho seventh subdivision of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>providing for a 15 per cent, commission on. the \u201cnet profits of the business * * * to be computed as of the 31st day of December * * * on the business of each \u2018single\u2019 year so long as this agreement shall continue.\u201d This seventh subdivision of the contract also provides how the \u201cnet profit\u201d is to be computed, and concludes with the proviso that: \u201cIn ease of the termination of this contract no contingent commission or profit and loss statement shall be rendered until the expiration of six months from date of the termination of said contract; but said contingent shall be settled as of the date of the termination of said contract.\u201d The tenth subdivision of the contract provides for its termination \u201cat any time by either party\u201d on sixty days\u2019 notice \u201cat the expiration of which time this contract shall cease and determine. * * * In the event of such determination and after the\u2019 expiration of the time named in said notice, * * * there shall be a complete adjustment and settlement of all matters between the parties hereto * * * excepting as hereinbefore provided as to the contingent commission.\u201d The exception last referred to clearly- relates to the difference in the times when the respective commissions were to be adjusted and settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The language of the contract is not susceptible of any other construction than upon termination thereof a complete adjustment and settlement of all matters between the parties was to be arrived at, and when so arrived at the same was to be final. It is clear that adjustments were made both in respect to flat commissions and the contingent commissions. It does not appear that there was any controversy respecting the settlements reached. The contract provided that, upon the expiration of the sixty days\u2019 notice when the contract became terminated, there was to be \u201ca complete adjustment and settlement of all matters between the parties * * * and any balances * * * thereupon be paid, excepting as hereinbefore provided as to the contingent commission.\u201d The provisions of the contract to which the words \u201chereinbefore provided\u201d related recited that contingent commissions were payable annually on the net profits of the business \u201cso long as this agreement shall continue,\u201d and, in ease of termination, that \u201cno contingent commission or profit and loss statement shall be rendered until the expiration of six months * * * but said contingent shall be settled as of the date of the termination of said contract.\u201d That the parties at the time of making these settlements considered they were to be final, or substantially so, is clearly indicated by the correspondence at the time. In the letter of the president of defendant, of date February 13, 1926, transmitting the \u201cContingent Commission Account\u201d appears the statement: \u201cI believe there are some small matters in abeyance\u2014 by that I mean small differences in the account and possibly some missing endorsements, etc. \u2014 but all of this will sooner or later be straightened out. We shall be very glad to assist you in having your books correspond with ours and we feel that you will also assist us to bring to a close any and all matters still open.\u201d Replying of date February 18, 1926, the letter on behalf of plaintiff, after referring to two items in the statement regarded as \u201cnominal and not worthy of a change,\u201d proceeded to say: \u201cIn the matter of small differences that might be in abeyance, pro and eon, between the two offices, you can feel assured of our hearty cooperation at all times.\u201d If plaintiff\u2019s predecessors were of opinion there remained in abeyance for future settlement a claim for contingent commissions which might aggregate the sum of ten thousand or more dollars, it is hardly conceivable that some mention of it would not have been made at the time instead of some five years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The case of Thompson v. Frelinghuysen, 191 Ill. App. 204, is cited as supporting appellant\u2019s position. A brief excerpt from the opinion in that ease discloses that the contract therein under consideration while dealing with the same subject-matter \u2014 contingent commissions \u2014 did not contain provisions similar to those in the contract in the case at bar. From the opinion we quote: \u201cIt is also to be noticed that in the contract of August 3, 1905, no special provision is made for a settlement of plaintiff\u2019s contingent commissions, in the event of the termination of said contract by notice or by mutual agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">In the instant case the contract specifically provides that \u201csaid contingent shall be settled as of the date of the termination of said contract,\u201d and further fixes the time when a \u201ccontingent commission or profit and loss statement shall be rendered.\u201d Whether the agents were entitled to some adjustment of contingent commissions based on the \u201cPremium Reserve\u201d shown as of date of the termination of the contract is a question not here involved. The contract fixed the time with reference to which a determination of contingent commissions should be made. Such a determination was made and the amount so agreed upon was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
