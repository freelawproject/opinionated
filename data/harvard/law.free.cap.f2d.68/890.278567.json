It will suffice, therefore, to state the facts with reference to 1928 only. During that year the taxpayer made charitable contributions in the amount of $43,995.92, which she claims the right to deduct from gross income under section 23 (n) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 801 [26 USC A \u00a7 2023 (n) ]). This permits a deduction <em>not </em>exceeding \u201c15 per cent-um of the taxpayer\u2019s net income as computed without the benefit of this subsection.\u201d Her \u201cnet income\u201d for tbe year, as defined by section 21 (26 USCA \u00a7 2021), and without any deduction for charitable contributions, was nearly half a million dollars and included an item of $211,544.82 \u201ccapital net gain,\u201d upon which she elected to be taxed at the 3 2% per cent, rate under section 103 (a), 45 Stat. 811 (26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (a). If this item may properly be included in net income to compute the 15 per cent, allowance as a deduction for charitable contributions, the taxpayer was entitled to deduct the full amount of her charitable gifts and no deficiency exists; but if, as the Commissioner contends, and as the Board held, it may not be so included, then her deduction was limited to $40,573.62 and the deficiency order was correct. Stated abstractly the question is whether, if a taxpayer elects to be taxed under section 101 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (a), capital net gain may be included m his net income when computing the 15 per cent, deduction allowable for charitable contributions under section 23 (n).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">This question has been decided in favor of the taxpayer in two District Court eases. Atkins v. White, 3 <em>F. </em>Supp. 694 (D. Mass.); Blow v. United States (D. C. N. D. Ill.) 5 <em>F. </em>Supp. 737, decided September 21, 1933. It was decided adversely to the taxpayer by three different divisions of the Board of Tax Appeals, including the proceeding here sought to be reviewed. Harbison v. Com\u2019r, 26 B. T. A. 896; Bliss v. Com\u2019r, 27 B. T. A. 205; Colgate v. Com\u2019r, 27 B. T. A. 506. Compare, Elkins v. Com\u2019r, 24 B. T. A. 572; <em>Livingood v. </em>Com\u2019r, <em>25 </em>B. T. A. 585. Subsequently, however, the question was reviewed by the entire Board, and its position was completely reversed. Straus v. Com\u2019r, 27 B. T. A. 1116. This opinion has been adhered to in Robinette v. Com\u2019r, 28 B. T. A.--, and Igleheart v. Com\u2019r, 28 B. T. A. -. Prom each of the foregoing decisions we are told that the losing party has taken an appeal, but none of the appeals has yet been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-20\">The provision permitting a deduction from gross income of charitable contributions to <em>the </em>extent of 15 per cent, of the net income computed without the benefit of this deduction was introduced into the income tax law by section 1201 (2) of the Revenue Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 330. Its obvious purpose was to encourage gifts for charity, education, and science. Cong. Eee., September 7, 1917, p. 5728. It has been continued in substantially the same form in each successive revenue act. In the Revenue Act of 1921, \u00a7 206, the provision for taxing \u201ccapital net gain\u201d at a rate different from that applied to income from other sources first appears. 42 Stat. 232. The reasons for this enactment are concisely stated in Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U. S. 103, 106, 53 S. Ct. 74, 77 L. Ed. 199. The provision appears in the 1928 Act as section 101. Paragraph (a) thereof provides that an individual taxpayer who derives a \u201ccapital not gain.\u201d as defined in paragraph (c), may, at his election, have his tax determined as follows: \u201ca partial tax shall first be computed upon the basis of tbe ordinary net income at the rates and in the manner as if this section had not been enacted and tbe total tax shall be this amount plus 12% per centum of the capital net gain.\u201d Paragraph (b) provides for determining the tax when an individual taxpayer sustains a \u201ccapital net loss\u201d; a partial tax is computed as in paragraph (a) and from this amount 12% per centum of the capital net loss is deducted to arrive at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>total tax. Since the \u201cpartial tax\u201d is first to be computed upon the basis of the \u201cordinary net income,\u201d we turn to section 101 (c) (7), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (e) (7) for a definition of that phrase: \u201c(7) 'Ordinary net income\u2019 means the net income, computed in accordance with the provisions of this title, after excluding all items of capital gain, capital loss, and capital deductions.\u201d In the construction of this definition lies the controversy. The taxpayer contends that \u201cnet income, computed in accordance with' the provisions of this title,\u201d requires computation according to sections 21, 22, and 23 (26 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 2021-2023), and that from the computation thus made there are then \u201cexcluded,\u201d that is, stricken out or \u25a0disregarded, all <em>items </em>of capital gain, capital loss, and capital deductions; that the figures remaining give \u201cordinary net income\u201d and the figures excluded give \u201ccapital net gain.\u201d The commissioner, on the other hand, asserts that clause (7) should be read as though it directed net income to be computed \u201cafter excluding from the computation all items of capital gain, capital loss and capital deductions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">It is to be noted that the phrase \u201cordinary net income\u201d occurs in both paragraph (a), which deals with the case of capital net gain, and paragraph (b), which deals with the ease of capital net loss. It must have the same meaning in each. A construction favorable to the taxpayer in the former will operate to his detriment in the latter, and vice versa. Hence the canon of strict construction invoked by the commissioner on the theory that the taxpayer is claiming the benefit of an exemption seems inapplicable. We can hardly say that there is any plain advantage to be gained by taxpayers from one construction rather than the other;- it depends on whether in the long run cases of capital bet gain involve larger sums than eases of capital net loss. Canons of interpretation aside, it seems to us that merely as a matter of verbal construction the meaning contended for by the petitioner is the more reasonable and the more compatible with the purpose of the statute. There is nothing in section 101 which expressly indicates that the taxpayer was intended to lose any part of the deductions allowed by section 23 when his tax is determined according to the rates provided in section 101. Paragraphs (a) and (b) deal with computation of the tax rather than with computation of taxable income; the usual rates are applied,\u201d \u201cas if this section had not been enacted,\u201d to that part of the taxable income called \u201cordinary net income\u201d and the special 12% per cent, rate to \u201ccapital net gain\u201d or \u201ccapital net loss.\u201d Paragraph (e) defines the terms used in the earlier paragraphs. It does not indicate an intention to modify the definitions of \u201cnet\u201d and \u201cgross\u201d income contained in sections 21 and 22 (26 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 2021, 2022), nor to change the deductions allowed by section 23 (26 USCA \u00a7 2023). On the contrary-clauses (3) and (4) of-section 101 (e) indicate that they are to remain unchanged (26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (c) (3, 4). They divide such deductions into \u201ccapital deductions\u201d and \u201cordinary deductions.\u201d The latter mean \u201cthe deductions allowed by section 23 other than capital losses and capital deductions.\u201d Clause (5), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (c) (5), defining \u201ccapital net gain\u201d makes it necessary to determine whether \u201cordinary deductions\u201d exceed \u201cgross <em>income </em>computed without including capital gains.\u201d We do not understand this to be a direction that in computing \u201cordinary deductions\u201d gross income is to be decreased by the exclusion of capital gains. It means to us that ordinary deductions are to be figured in the ordinary way and then compared with \u201cgross income computed without including capital gain\u201d to. see if they exceed it. If this be the correct construction, there is harmony between clause (5) and clause (7), and \u201cnet income\u201d computed in accordance with sections 21, 22, and 23 is composed of two parts, \u201cordinary net income\u201d and \u201ccapital net gain,\u201d to which respectively the appropriate rates may be applied as provided in paragraph (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">This was the view of the. Bureau of Internal Revenue for many years. On February 6, 1923, the deputy commissioner telegraphed in response to an inquiry: \u201cContributions; 15% limitation; Capital Net Gains: fifteen per cent limitation for deductions account charitable contributions applies to total net income inclusive of gain from sale of capital assets.\u201d C. C. H. Fed. Income Tax Service 1924, par. 2033. In 1924 a corresponding ruling as to capital losses was made: \u201cCapital losses cannot be excluded in computing net income for the purpose of determining the amount of charitable contribution deductions.\u201d I. T. 404, Cum. Bul. III-2, p. 152. In 1928 the government argued before this court that section 206 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 232 (corresponding to section 101 of the 1928 Act [26 USCA \u00a7 2101]) related merely to rates and did not affect the computation of the allowance of charitable deductions, and we by dictum approved this construction. Sadowsky v. Anderson (C. C. A.) 29 F.(2d) 677, 679. In November, 1931, the Board of Tax Appeals decided Elkins v. Com\u2019r, 24 B. T. A. 572, and held, contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>the ruling of the bureau, that capital losses should be disregarded in computing the 15 per cent, deduction for charitable contributions. The commissioner announced that this decision was \u201ccontrary to the position which the Bureau has consistently followed,\u201d and would be appealed. Tnt. Rev. Bul. XT-7, 5386; Mim. 3931. But when tho decision in Harbison v. Com\u2019r, 26 B. T. A. 896, was announced in August, 1932, the commissioner withdrew his determination to appeal the Elkins Case and acquiesced in the Harbison decision. lilt. Rev. Bul. XI-49, 5896; Mim. 3986. The consistent administrative rulings of the commissioner from 1923 to 1932, during which time the provisions in question were thrice re-enacted, may properly ho given weight by the courts. Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 336, 50 S. Ct. 115, 74 L. Ed. 457. We do not think that the commissioner\u2019s subsequent about-face renders the principle inapplicable. It is not a ease where the administrative ruling was ambiguous, as in Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., 285 U. S. 1, 21, 52 S. Ct. 275, 76 L. Ed. 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">In our opinion the taxpayer was entitled to the deduction claimed and no deficiency in taxes existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The order is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b921-7\">L. HAND, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ak4-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">In spite of the contrary ruling for nine years in the treasury and its very belated change of front, it appears to me that the intent is too plain for latitude of interpretation, though of course in view of the difference of opinion that has arisen I cannot feel as sure as T should, if tho matter had come before me first. Section 23 (n) (2), 26 US CA \u00a7 2023 (n) (2), puts a limit upon charitable gifts of \u201c15 per centum of the taxpayer\u2019s net income as computed without the benefit of this subsection\u201d; so that in first computing the net income all charitable gifts must be omitted. That gives a net income, but only tentatively; all charitable gifts may be then deducted until they reach the prescribed limit, which is 15 per cent, of the net income, already provisionally computed. Thus the final taxable income is computed in two steps. If that he so&gt; it appears to mo that section 101 (c) (7), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (e) (7), becomes plain. The \u201cordinary net income\u201d there defined is to he \u201ccomputed in accordance with the provisions of this title,\u201d which as regards charitable gifts means that the limit must he fixed on a tentative net income. However, it is to he so computed only after excluding certain items; and \u201cexcluding\u201d seems to me necessarily to relate to the first computation. It would be very unreal to suppose that it referred to the deduction of items not \u201cexcluded\u201d but once included in the provisional computation; that after they had been included, and 15 per cent, of the result deducted, the same items should be reversed; the gains subtracted and the losses added. That is not \u201cexcluding-\u201d them from the computation; \u201cexcluding\u201d means dealing- with them oneo and for all. But if it is possible to suppose that they were to affect the computation at all, the more natural way was to use tho definitions in (c), subd. (5)- and subd. (6), 26 USCA \u00a7 2101 (e) (5, 7), which had just been made; \u201ceapital net gain\u201d would bo subtracted from, or \u201ccapital net loss\u201d added to, the net income. The definition would then have read: \u201c \u2018Ordinary net income\u2019 means net income computed in accordance with the provisions of this title after deducting \u2018capital net gain,\u2019 or adding \u2018capital net loss.\u2019 \u201d I think that the Board was right.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
