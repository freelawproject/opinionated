He had no recollection of any other father and mother, but states that his earliest reeolleetion was crossing a large body of water and that the people he called father and mother with whom he lived had told him he was bom in Camden, N. J.; that they stated to him the name of his parents but that he had never seen either of them. Appellant took the witness stand in his own behalf and repeated most of the statements he had made before the immigration authorities above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"a7l-dedup-0\">The records of the ship Puget Sound on which he shipped as a coal passer in 1917 were introduced in evidence and showed that Basil Couyanos was a member of the crew and his signature to the records was intro-dueed in evidence. When the Puget Sound arrived at Baltimore, Md., appellant first entered this country. He applied for admission to the United States as a citizen but withdrew his application and entered as an alien. He was allowed to enter to reship foreign, but he did not reship. He went to New York and remained there. On October 17,1924, he applied for a marriage license, giving the name Renault Demetri Duncan; place of birth, Rumania; place of father\u2019s birth, Rumania; place of mother\u2019s birth, Rumania; father\u2019s name, Demetri J.; mother\u2019s name, Theodore Marienne. On March 29,1926, he applied for life insurance giving his name as Renault \u25a0 Duncan Couyanos; date of birth, April 23, 1904; and place of birth, Rumania. On De-eember 14,1927, he wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Immigration stating that he desired to become naturalized and giving the name of Basil D. Couyanos. On January 14, 1929&gt; lust thr6e months before he made his aPP^tion for passport as an American citihe made a written applicatron for life in\u2122cf ^ 23\u2019190d' De\u00bf\u00aember 18 1930, aM&gt;e\u00fcant procured a false affidavit to be made for the purpose oi effecting an entry-in the record of vital statistics at C'am-d N&gt; j purport\u00cd31g to show that he was bam there on April 33 1904. In that record thug obtained <em>&amp;e </em>\u00a3athei,s lace o\u00a3 birth wag ^V0n M United stat t]le mother,s ^ Rnmania, name of father, Francis B. Dunearlj and name of mother, Marie Marienseo. Tbe witness who- made the affidavit on which the registration of birth was entered in the records of Camden, N. J., as of April 23, 1904, testified that the affidavit was made by him without knowledge of the facts at the request of the appellant, who knew the statements in the affidavit as to affiant\u2019s aequaintanee with appellant, and of affiant\u2019s knowledge of the facts sworn to, were untrue. In the register of births in the city of Camden, N. J., the entries were arranged alphabetieally and not chronologically. Under the head-big \u201cDU\u201d was the entry \u201cRenault Duncan, April 23,1904,\u201d giving place of birth as 217 Federal street, and showing entry by affidavit 12/18/30. There is no other record of birth \u00b0f Renault Duncan. There was no entry of birth under the name of Couyanos in the Camden, N. J., records that could apply to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiaq\">The most serious question presented by the record is the question of the admissibility 0f a photographic copy of the records of births for the year 1904 in the custody Qf the mayor of Oancea, district of Covurlui, Kingdom of Rumania, purporting to show that appellant was born there April 20,1904.

The signature of the Minister of the Interior of Rumania was certified by the Consul of the United States at Bucharest, who, after certifying to Ms own official position as Consul of the United States in and for the Kingdom of Rumania, certifies that the person who signed the above-mentioned certificate \u201cwas a delegate of the Minister of the Interior of Rumania at the time of so doing and as such competent to certify such authentication,\u201d that the signature is the signature of the official in question, and that the official seal attached is that of the Rumanian Minister of the Interior. To this certificate of the Consul is attached a certificate of Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of State of the United States, by his chief clerk, accompanied by the seal of his office, certifying that the C\u00f3nsul who subscribed the above-mentioned certificate was Consul of the United States at Bucharest, Rumania, duly commissioned at the time of the signing of such certificate, and that full faith and confidence are due to his acts as such. Attached to these documents was a translation thereof by a member of the bar of Ilfov, Bucharest, Rumania, sworn to he-fore the American Consul at Bucharest.

In view of this, coupled with the similarity of the names of the father and mother shown in the birth certificate to the names of the persons with whom the appellant resided in Rumania and whom he called father and mother, respectively, we think the special objection that the birth cer-tifieate did not purport to be that of the appellant was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\">The only other special objection to the method of authentication of documents relates to the mayor of the town and is not sufficiently clear to raise any point.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">It is a fundamental rule that objections to the admissibility of evidence must be made in the trial court and must be speeifie, and that general objections such as those advanced here that the evidence is \u201cincompetent, irrelevant and immaterial and not the best evidence, and no proper foundation laid,\u201d are insufficient. See Curtis v. No. American Indian (C. C. A. 9) 277 F. 909. To this latter rule there is an exception sometimes applied on appeal where the evidence offered is not competent for any purpose and the defect is such that it cannot be cured by the proponent. In such a case the admission of the testimony over the general objection of ineompeteney has sometimes been held to be error. This is merely another way of holding that even if it were admitted in the face of a general objection it could have no probative value because it is so incompetent as to be no evidence at all.</p>\n<p id=\"ark-dedup-0\">In the assignment of errors appellant is more specific as to his objections to the Rumanian birth certificate. Seven objections to the certification are stated, of which we need mention but three: \u25a0'</p>\n<p id=\"AqMJ\">First; L is no f aat <em>the laws </em>o\u00a3 Runiania require the keepi of reeords of *</p>\n<p id=\"Abuk\">, _ <em>Be\u2122a*\u2019 </em>2\u2018 There is no proof that the Purported record was kept in accordance with t]le laws o\u00a3 Rumama-</p>\n<p id=\"Au_\">Tllird&gt; 7. There 1S 110 certificate under the great seal of the Kingdom of Rumania au^eating the signature or the official caPffles ^of tlle Persons who sl^ed of the eertlfieates- \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AYnV\"> We will diseuss now these specific assignments in part because the probative value 0f foreign or domestic records depends upon the question whether or not such records are required by law to be kept, and this question is involved in the question of their admissibility over the general objection of ineompeteney made by the appellant. Where such records are required by law to be kept, a presumption arises that they are an accurate reeord of the facts, and thus they become prima facie proof of the facts required by law to be so recorded. In Stanglein v. State of Ohio, 17 Ohio St. 453, 463, it was held, however, that the record was incompetent in the absenee'of proof of some law requiring reeords, of marriages to be made and kept. The court said: \u201cNo such proof was given, and we ?re unable to see how we can presume the ex-*stenee o\u00a3 *uehJaws\\ And the books are uni- \u2122 to tke effeet that jt 1S essential to the official character of any record, and to its competency as evidence, that it has been made and kept by a person whose duty it was to make and keep it. 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev, \u00a7 485. And before an instrument, made in a foreign country, which derives a legal effeet and operation from the laws of that country, can be admitted in evidence, the existence of the law itself must be proved. 2 Starkie on Ev. 460; 1 Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, \u00a7 478. We are forced to the conclusion, therefore, that there was error in the admission of the Seibeldingen record in evidence, and in the charge of the court to the jury as to its legal effeet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in Re Derinza, 229 Mass. 435, 118 N. E. 942, 946, dealt with papers purporting to he copies of the certificates of marriage of the deceased and the birth of his several children, which were received in evidence. They were apparently certified by the custodian of the records in an Italian town. It was held that these copies of certificates were not competent evidenee. The court there stated: \u201cThere was n\u00f3 proof of the law of Italy requiring or permitting the keeping of such records by the town, the deposition of the custodian of the records covering material points was not proffered, nor was there any evidence respecting their character, the eireumstanees under which the records were kept, or the source from which the certificates came, No one testified that they were copies of an official original. There was no authentication of them^ as genuine by a consular offieer of the United Stales. There was ahsolutely nothing beyond the bare production of the copies of the certificates. In the absence of a statute making such certificates admissible by themselves, or something to show that they were entitled to a degree of credence, they were not competent. [Citing cases.] It is not necessary to decide just what formalities would have been required to render them competent evidence, as the present record is entirely bald of anything m that direction. An examination of all the cases eollected in 26^ Cyc. 885, note, and re led on by the arbitration committee and the industrial accident board, as to foreign marriages, shows that m none of them was the marriage certifieate admitted without either an express statute admitting the certificate or evidence 01 some statute of the foreign state or nation requiring the record to be made, or some evidence showing a legal obligation or established practice to keep the record, or some fact respecting the authenticity of the record of the effect of which the' court can take judieial notice. No one of these elements is present in the ease at bar. We can have no judicial knowledge respecting records of town officials in Italy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqqQ\">In Guerra v.

There was no proof of the genuineness of the original record by facts and circumstances, or by any person able to testify thereto. The evidence does not disclose who is the proper custodian of such record, and who is authorized to certify to copies thereof. If the law be proved, and the genuineness of the record, an examined copy can bo used, or a certified copy, but in the latter case the genuineness of the signature of the officer certifying thereto must be properly au-thentieated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A91\">it was held that the order of court exeludjng the record was correct.

Conscquently, in order that such a record should be admitted in evidence it should be jroved that the record was kept in compliance with the local law. The order of proof is not important. Preferably the proof of the foreign law should accompany the an-the\u00f1ticated copy of the record and be made by certificate. The law could undoubtedly be proved in other ways. In the case at bar the facts stated in the various certificates come close to, but still fall short of, evidence that the record of vital statistics kept at Oancea, Rumania, was kept in compliance with the local law. There are two statements and documents presented which tcnd strongly to that conclusion, but still fall short of the requisite proof. The first is the record itself to the effect that \"it is verified in accordance with law.\" Taken literally this applies only to the method of authentication of the record slid not to the fact that the law requires a rec-oid to be kept. In addition thereto, we have the certificate of the prefecture to the effect that the mayor who signed the certified copies is custodian of the registers of vital statistics from which the photographic record is taken, and to the effect that he is the custodian thereof \"in accordance with Art. 159, Paragraph 8, and Article 536, of the law for the organization of local administration.\" This clearly indicates that he is the proper officer to make the certificate, but it still falls short of the requirement that it should dppcar that the record was made at the time it purported to he made, in conformity with the law then in force. There are a multitude of books and documents in the custody of public officials, as such, which were not made in conformity with the law and which have no! probative value of the facts stated therein. Inasmuch as no special objection was made to ~he certificates on the ground that there was no certificate or other proof to the effect that the record in question was required by the law of Rumania to be kept at the time it purported to have been made, and that such an objection if made could have been overcome by proof of such a law, the general objections made were properly overruled, and the more specific assignment of this ruling as error cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">There is, however, another aspect of this question which we must now consider. The appellant, at the conclusion of the evidence, moved for a directed verdict and assigns as error the refusal to grant the motion. Appellant argues that: \"Aside from the purported birth certificate * * * the record is wholly void of any evidence whatever to prove the most essential part of the corpus delicti, viz., the falsity of his alleged statements, except his extra-judicial statements and admissions.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Before directing our attention to this contention, we should state that the appel-~ lant's principal argument upon the alleged error in denying his motion for instructed verdict is based on the proposition that there is no competent evidence that the appellant made the affidavit or the representations alleged in the indictment. This is predicated on the testimony of the appellant that at the time he signed the affidavit which was filed with the Secretary of State for the purpose of securing a passport, the blanks in the printed affidavit were not filled in and the alleged false statements as to his age and birth place were subsequently inserted therein without his knowledge or consent. It is true that he contended then, as he does now, that he was born in Camden, N. J., and he contended then, as he does now, that he was a citizen of the United States and that he intended to apply as such for such passport, yet it is claimed by him that he did not make the aforementioned representations or affidavit. It is sufficient to say that the jurat of the clerk of the Distriet Court of the United States for the Southern District of California to the oath is sufficient prima fade proof that the affidavit was made in. the form in which it is now pm-seated in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">We turn now to the contention that without the certificate the evidence was insufficient to justify a verdict of guilty, and that a motion ef the defendant for instructed verdict of not guilty should have been given. Appellant argues that all these proofs as to appellant's Rumanian birth and alien citizenship arc based on statements and admissions of the defendant, and, therefore, have no higher probative value thpn the statements and admissions by the appellant, and that such statements and admissions are insufficient to prove the corpus delicti. There can be no doubt of this fundamental rule relied on by appellant. In that view of the case, the fact that the appellant procured false affidavits for the purpose of substantiating his claim that lie -aras born in Camden, N. J., would amount to nothing more than proof of his belief that he was born in Rumania, and would have no higher probative value than a confession or an admission that he was born in Rumania; such admissions are abundant in the record. Appellee claims that the fact that the defendant entered the United States as an alien from a vessel on which he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>shipped in a foreign port as an alien is independent evidence of alienage and eonse-quently sufficient to support the verdict of the jury. In this connection it should be oh-served that shipping as ah alien on board an alien ship was necessarily predicated on belief of the defendant that he was such an alien and is in effect nothing more nor less than an admission on his part of alienage. The same is true of his application for naturalization, It is shown, however, that there was no record of the birth of Basel Couyanos or Vasilc Cou-yanos in the official records of births in Camden, N. J., and no record of birth of Renault Duncan other than the one entered in 1930 on the false affidavit procured by the appellant for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AuT\">Appellant represented m Ins sworn application for passport that he was born m Camden, <em>N. </em>J. This was a material fact, for if he was born m Camden, N. J., he was a citizen of the United States It was not neeessary to prove that he was born m a foreign country to prove that perjury had been com-matted. We flunk there was sufficient evidence of the corpus delicti on the charge of perjury to justify the introduction of the admissions and statements of flie appellant and that the evidence of P^jury is amply trai\u00fccient to support the verdict without reference to the Rumanian birth certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"AZN\">With reference to the first count eharg-ing the defendant with making false statements in his application for passport, the allegation and proof that he stated that he was born in Camden, N. J., on April 23, 1904, coupled with tbe proof that the records of Camden, N. J., showed no birth of the appellant other than by the false record caused to he inserted therein by the appellant, was sufficient proof of the falsity of a material statement.</p>\n<p id=\"a1d-dedup-0\">With reference to the second count, the charge is that the appellant falsely represented himself to be a citizen of the United States without having been duly admitted to citizenship, etc., in violation of 18 USCA \u00a7 141. In order to establish this charge it is not only necessary for the prosecution to show that the appellant was not bom in Camden, N. J., but also to show that he was not a eitizen of tho United States. There is no evidence to establish that fact other than, the admissions of the appellant as hereinbefore stated. These were insufficient to prove the corpus delicti.</p>\n<p id=\"arh-dedup-0\">What we have said disposes o\u00a3 all the points raised by the appellant other than \u00a3}je one y^t the verdict in the ease was in iCgai effect an acquittal of the appellant, There is nothing in this point. We merely mention it to show it has not been overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"ASpL\">It follows that the judgment on the first and third counts must be affirmed, and that on the seeond count must be reversed. It should be here stated that the sentences on the first and third counts run concurrently, The \u00aerst count is for a violation of 22 USCA \u00a7 220, the third count is for a violation of 18 USCA g 231 and tlle second colmt is \u00a3or a o\u00a3 18 ugcA \u00a7 14L In view of tho rovergal of ^ jlld t and sentrace on the geeond c it is to not\u00edco the fact ^ ^ llant elaims that thig eount does ^ gtate an offense.
