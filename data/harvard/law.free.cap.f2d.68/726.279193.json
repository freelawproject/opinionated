On hearing by this court, it was agreed the case might be disposed of as if on final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-20\">The patent involved was considered by this court in Hartford-Empire Co. v. Hazel-Atlas Glass Co., reported in 59 F.(2d) 399, 413. Reference thereto obviates needless restatement of the art. It suffices to say the patent in question (Peiler\u2019s patent, No. 1,-655,391) was there held valid, and in passing on the question of infringement the court said: \u201cThe pertinent element of apparatus, claim 8, is \u2018means for so moving the implement dovynwardly during the issue of each mold charge, and upwardly after the issue of said charge, that each charge will be produced and selectively shaped in suspension by the movement of the implement.\u2019 True, Peiler showed a particular mechanical construction for so doing, but the Patent Office, in granting this claim, did not restrict it to the particular mechanical connecting Peiler showed, but protected that element in a broader and more generic character, to wit, \u2018means for moving,\u2019 etc., and thereby meant to in-' elude any mechanical equivalent of the particular means Peiler showed.\u201d Accordingly, we held in the Hartford-Empire-Hazel-Atlas Case that the claims of the Peiler patent there in suit were broad enough to cover the Hazel-Atlas deviee. For the same reasons we hold that the claims of the patent here in suit are broad enough to cover the defendants\u2019 device.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">Briefly stated, the functional invention of that patent was the swelling of a gob in suspension to desired shape and shearing such shaped gob in suspension. The patentee showed it could be done by the use of what he called an \u201cimpeller,\u201d saying: \u201cThe various characteristics of the impeller action may be varied\u201d; adding: \u201cAs the impeller moves upward it gives an upward or intrusion impulse to the glass within and below the outlet,\u201d and \u201cthe downward or extrusion impulse of the impeller may be used to control the shape of the body and upper end of the. gather and its resulting mold charge.\u201d The particular form of impeller the patentee showed was a metallic plunger which discharged or retarded the glass as desired. The present defendant, as its discharge or retard apparatus, uses a double-acting diaphragm, which, actuated by compressed air, will discharge or retard the glass as desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-22\">It is clear that, if the defendants\u2019 apparatus, with a diaphragm acting to discharge or retard glass in suspension to desired form, and shearing the glass, as it does, in suspension, had been in use before the patent in suit, it would have been a complete anticipa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tion thereof. Coming after the patent, it is as clearly an infringement, and the court committed no error in so holding. We therefore dismiss the appeal and remand the ease fo-r proceeding in due course.</p>\n<author id=\"b755-4\">WOOLLEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In the Hartford-Empire-Hazel-Atlas Case, this court held the claims in suit valid and broad enough to cover the alleged infringing device there in question. Differing sharply as to the scope of the claims and, in consequence, differing on the issue of infringement, I dissented. Regarding myself bound by that decision of the court, I concur in the findings of validity and infringement of the claims here in suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
