L. 603 [69 PS \u00a7 361 et seq.J), left the system liable to seizure and sale by an execution creditor and therefore by the trustee in bankruptcy. Such being the ease;, the court rightly denied the reclamation petition of the Lamson Company. We affirm its dc;eroe without prejudice to the right of the claimant to present a money claim as a general creditor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
