Between the several long sections, which are of uniform, but of progressively smaller, diameter, are groups of the short sections, also of uniform, but of progressively smaller, diameter. By such an arrangement of the cylindrical sections, the \u201cannular junctions between\u201d them give an ornamental appearance to the shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-20\">The design patent to Cowdery, No. <em>73,777, </em>discloses a shaft for a golf club' \u201cparticularly characterized,\u201d according to the patent, \u201cby the provision of a handle shaft of gradually stepped short substantially cylindrical portions of progressively less and less diameter from the handle to the head end of the shaft wherein a distinctive ornamental appearance is imparted to the shaft by the annular junctions between the sections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-22\">The patent to Cowdery, No. 1,676,531, discloses a tubular metallic golf club shaft composed of cylindrical sections of progressively smaller diameter, the drawings of which closely resemble the Cowdery patented design heretofore described. It differs from the patented design, however, in that, although the cylindrical sections extending from the middle of the shaft to the head of the club are approximately uniform in length, those extending from the middle to the handle of the shaft are varied in length, being progressively longer; whereas, the cylindrical sections composing the shaft disclosed in the patented design, although also progressively smaller in diameter from the handle to the head end of the shaft, are apparently uniform in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-23\">In the reference patent, No. 1,676,531, the patentee stated that, in order to obtain \u201crelatively more flexure in the portion of the shaft more nearly adjacent the head,\u201d he <em>varied the rate of change of diameter </em>in different <em>portions of the shaft by varying the length </em>of the cylindrical sections. The patentee further stated that the invention was not intended to be limited to a shaft \u201cwherein the rate of change of diameter <em>is thus increased toward the head end of a golf shaft, </em>as I contemplate making any beneficial change that may be desired and which is capable of being accomplished <em>by varying the rate of change of diameter of the shaft. * </em>* * <em>A user may desire a greater number of short sections than shown on the drawings </em>in order to produce a shaft having greater \u2018whip\u2019 in use, while another user <em>may desire a less number of short sections and a greater number of long sections </em>to produce a less distributed \u2018whip\u2019 action but with a \u2018snap\u2019 action limited to a smaller length at the club end of the shaft. Such variations from the embodiment illustrated in the drawings depending upon individual preference, are herein contemplated as a part of this invention broadly considered.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-25\">It is evident, we think, that the patentee not only contemplated, but clearly disclosed, the idea of <em>varying the rate of change of diameter </em>of a golf club shaft <em>by varying the length of the cylindrical sections at any point or points desired. </em>Accordingly, we are of opinion that such disclosure is sufficient to suggest appellant\u2019s design to one skilled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the art; that appellant has done nothing more than to select one of the many designs therein suggested; and that, therefore, appellant\u2019s design is not patentable over the references. See In re Barber, 62 F.(2d) 364, 20 C. C. P. A. 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
