Todd, Jr., and Howard E. WilsoN, Jr., both, of Kingsport, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\">Nat TiptoN, Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-6\">Mr. Justice McKiNNey</author>\n<p id=\"AdS\">delivered the opinion of the Conrt.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Plaintiff in error has appealed to this conrt from a conviction for forgery, his term of imprisonment having been fixed at a year and a day in the State penitentiary. It is his contention that the evidence does not support the verdict, the State having failed to prove that he forged the involved instrument as well as an intention to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The alleged forged check is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">\u201cKingsport, Tenn., 7-16-1938 \u201cThe First National Bank</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">\u201cPay to the order of Garland Store $12.00 Twelve dollars Dollars</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">\u201cOscar McMurray\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">Oscar McMurray testified that he did not execute said check nor authorize anyone else to sign his name thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Mr. S. F. Dobyns, of the firm of Dobyns-Taylor, a mercantile establishment in Kingsport, testified that one day in July, 1938, plaintiff in error came into his place of business and asked the cashier to cash the above check. Since the check was not endorsed by the payee this witness telephoned to the payee, and upon the information obtained from him had the plaintiff in error arrested immediately after paying him the twelve dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">The State offered no direct testimony that the plaintiff in error actually wrote this check or procured some other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>person to write it, but relies solely upon tlie presumption arising from the possession of and an attempt to realize upon this recently forged check.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We quote from the testimony of the plaintiff in error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cQ. What is your name? A. Buck Ratliff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201cQ. Buck, how old are you? A. Twenty-five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201cQ. Did you write any of this?

Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">\u201cQ. Did Squire Bradley issue the warrant? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">\u201cQ. Who gave you the check? A. Isaac Anderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">\u201cQ. Did you know anything about the check being forged? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-17\">\u201cQ. Until they called up Mr. Garland? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-18\">\u201cQ. That was the first you knew about it? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-19\">\u201cQ.

What did he ask you to do with it? A.

Is that the first knowledge you had about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>check? A. The first knowledge I had was when they grabbed me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t know anything about it until that time? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">Plaintiff in error gave the following additional testimony on cross-examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cQ. \"Who is this fellow Anderson? A. Isaac Anderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cQ. Where does he live? A. He told me he lived on the Bloomingdale Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">\u201cQ. How long have you known him? A. About a year and a half or'two years. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201cQ. Where is Anderson now? A. I don\u2019t know where he is now. John .Martin swore out a warrant for him and they was supposed to prosecute him one day at two o\u2019clock, and he wasn\u2019t there to prosecute and George Bradley dismissed the case. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">\u201cQ. How many times have you been convicted? A. Two or three times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Forgery is defined in section 10979 of the Code as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-13\">\u201cForgery is the fraudulent making or alteration of any writing to the prejudice of another\u2019s rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">The offense of forgery is complete by the mere forgery, with the fraudulent intent, whether any third person be actually injured thereby or not. It is sufficient that the instrument forged, with the fraudulent intent, might have been prejudicial to the rights of another. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>State, </em>21 Tenn. (2 Humph.), 36, 37, 36 Am. Dec., 293; <em>State </em>v. <em>Humphries, </em>29 Tenn. (10 Humph.), 442; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>State, </em>41 Tenn. (1 Cold.), 167, 78 Am. Dec., 488; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>66 Tenn. (7 Baxt.), 76; <em>Girdley </em>v. <em>State, </em>161 Tenn., 177, 29 S. W. (2d), 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">This court, in <em>State ex rel. Barnes </em>v. <em>Stillwell, </em>165 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Term., 174, 179, 54 S. W. (2d), 978, 979, quoted approvingly the following text in 26 O. J., 903-904: \u201cThe second element of the crime of forgery is the knowledge of the falsity of the instrument and the intent to defraud. This is of the very essence of the offense and without proof of it there can he no conviction, in the absence of some statute changing the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">The question which we are called upon to determine is whether an attempt to cash a forged check raises a presumption that it was forged by the possessor, or that he procured it to he forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The state did not undertake to prove that plaintiff in error forged this check hy comparison of hand writing or otherwise, and must have proceeded upon the theory that he falsely conspired with or procured another to forge it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Counsel for the state relies upon the following text from 26 C. J., 961:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cPossession of a forged paper by accused with a claim of title thereunder, if unexplained, raises, a conclusive presumption that he forged it, or procured it to he forged, and this is so, although the instrument is payable to accused or hearer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In the cases supporting the foregoing text the courts seem to emphasize the fact that the possessor of the forged instrument asserts \u201ca claim of title thereto.\u201d For example, in <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Ala., 1, 6, the court said: \u201cOne found in the possession of a forged instrument of which he purports to he the beneficiary, and applying it to his own uses, must, in the absence of explanation, be presumed to have fabricated it, or to have been privy to its fabrication. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>133 Iowa, 135, 137, 110 N. W., 328, 329, especially relied upon hy the state, it was said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u201cAn intent to defrand may be inferred from knowingly passing an instrument as true which, is known to he false. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>84 Iowa, 83, 50 N. W., 570. And such knowledge may be inferred from the possession or utterance of a forged paper in which the person in possession or uttering the same is the payee or beneficiary. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>14 N. C., 122, 125, the rule was announced in this language: \u201cThat the order was not in the hand-writing of the defendant did not rebut the legal presumption of his guilt. Being in possession of the forged order, drawn in his own favor, were facts constituting complete proof, that either by himself or by false conspiracy with others, he forged or assented to the forgery of the instrument. . . . But it is next to impossible that the defendant could get possession of such an instrument as this, purporting to be for his own benefit, without having fabricated, or aided in the fabrication of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Other cases to the same effect could be cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In the instant case, however, the check was not drawn in favor of the accused, and he did not claim to be the owner or beneficiary thereof, but stated to the cashier \u201cthat a boy outside gave me the check.\u201d This statement is not contradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterbury, supra, </em>the accused was convicted for having knowingly uttered a forged check. The check was for $10.80, payable to F. Miller, endorsed \u201cF. Miller,\u201d and purported to have been signed by C. L. Besler. The accused, Waterbury, purchased some bananas from the prosecutor, and tendered this check in payment, receiving the difference in money. It was conceded that the check was a forgery. The judgment below was reversed, the court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">\u201cIn <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>2 Allen (Mass.), 161, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the defendant was accused of uttering and also of forging a receipt in full, and an instruction that the possession of it by a person claiming under it or seeking to derive a benefit from it was strong evidence tending to show that he made the false signature or caused it to be made was approved. But this inference ought not to he drawn from the naked fact of uttering a false negotiable instrument as true when the payee named therein does not purport to be the person charged with uttering and it appears to have been indorsed by such payee in blank. Title to such an instrument passes by delivery, and one not familiar with the signatures might acquire possession without any benefit resulting and consistently with entire innocence. Should a person receiving such a check or draft or note, subsequently discovered to be forged, be presumed guilty of a heinous crime <em>1 </em>Something more is essential to such a result, as proof of statements of the accused in passing the instrument, or of his connection with other forgeries, or that he pretended to be the payee when he was not, or that he passed the instrument under an assumed name. Here the person passing the check asserted nothing save by the act of paying for the bananas purchased with it, and calling attention to the name of purported maker, neither of which acts is so inconsistent with innocence that guilty knowledge of the falsity of the instrument should be inferred therefrom. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>51 Ind., 405, the defendant was charged with forging the name of one Mullen upon the back of the draft, and also with having-uttered the instrument with such forged indorsement, and an instruction saying that upon the utterance of the draft with the forged indorsement thereon the presumption arose that the defendant forged the same, unless his possession was explained, was held erroneous on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ground that being indorsed by the payee in blank the draft -would pass upon delivery so as to vest title in each successive bolder without further indorsement. Scien-ter is a necessary element of this crime, and the mere fact that the defendant bad in his possession a check, purporting to be indorsed by a payee other than himself, and the title to which would pass upon delivery was not alone sufficient to justify his conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\"While the Waterbury and the Miller cases are not exactly in point, they more nearly accord with the case on trial than any other we have found. They are similar in that (1) the payee named therein does not purport to he the person charged with forging or uttering it, (2) the accused did not claim to be the payee named therein; (3) he did not attempt to dispose of the instrument under an assumed name; (4) there is no proof of his connection with other forgeries; <em>(5) </em>there is no evidence of false statements by the accused at the time he sought to cash the check; on the other hand, he stated to the cashier that another hoy had asked him to get the money on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In the Waterbury, Miller, and other cases referred to the defendants did not testify, while in this case the accused did testify, relating the circi^ lances of his possession of the check, the name and esidence of the hoy who procured him to cash it, the subsequent arrest of this hoy, and positively denied that he forged the check, procured it to he forged, or knew that it was forged. The accused was not involved in any material contradictions on the witness stand, and the state did not offer any evidence to impeach his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">While the accused admits that he has been convicted two or three times, it does not appear for what offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>They may have been misdemeanors or felonies not rendering him infamous.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">Taking the record in its entirety, we are of the opinion that any presumption arising from the possession and cashing of this forged check is overcome by the facts and circumstances referred to herein, and the direct testimony of the accused denying any complicity in this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">For the reasons stated the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
