In view, however, of appellants\u2019 earnest insistence to the contrary, we have carefully reread the record, subjecting it to the most critical inspection and' analysis, and we have found no support in it whatever for appellants\u2019 view. This being so, no useful purpose would be served by setting any of the record out here. It is sufficient to say that the judgment was right and must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
