However, some uncertainty has arisen as to the meaning of some of the language in the opinion, which it is desirable to clarify. The following passages will be deemed amended as set forth below. The second sentence of the first full paragraph of the left column of page 380 of 148 F.2d will read as follows: \u201cWe agree that he must prove that he did not mean to undercut his competitors\u2019 price; but when he has in fact undercut that price, we reserve the question whether it is necessary as part of that proof, for him to show that he did not know what that price was.\u201d The fourth sentence of the same paragraph will read as follows: \u201cThat is to say, we need not now decide more than the offer shall be made without actual intent to undercut his competitors\u2019 price.\u201d The sixth sentence of the last paragraph of the left column on page 380 will read as follows: \u201cOnce the petitioner was shown to have charged different prices and failed to prove that this did not \u2018lessen competition,\u2019 it could not escape without showing that the offers which it made were either in fact no lower than that of its competitors, or that it did not mean them to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-20\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
