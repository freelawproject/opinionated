The order of which the petitioner seeks judicial review fixes definitions and standards of identity for cacao products and permits the use of lecithin as an optional ingredient in such products, but, when so used, requires the label to carry the statement \u201cEmulsifier Added\u201d or \u201cWith Added Emulsifier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">The petitioner does not challenge the respondent\u2019s determination of standards of identity but asserts that the statute confers no power to order petitioner\u2019s product to be designated on labels by any word other than \u201clecithin,\u201d and that the term \u201cemulsifier\u201d is erroneous as applied to lecithin in chocolate products. It prays that the order be set aside only in so far as it (1) requires the above mentioned label statement for the optional ingredient lecithin and (2) \u201cprohibits the use of the specific word \u2018lecithin\u2019 as the label statement for petitioner\u2019s product when used as an optional ingredient\u201d in cacao products.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">The first problem for consideration is whether we have jurisdiction to review the order. The respondent\u2019s authority to make the order is to be found in section 401 of the Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 341. The provisions for review of such an order appear in section 701(f), 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371(f). This section provides that \u201cIn a case of actual controversy as to the validity\u201d of any such order, \u201cany person who will be adversely affected by such order if placed in effect\u201d may petition the appropriate circuit court of appeals for a judicial review of the order. The respondent contends that the petitioner is not a person \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the order \u201cin a case of actual controversy.\u201d The petitioner is not a member of, nor does it represent the cacao products industry. The order does not touch the manner in which the petitioner\u2019s business shall be conducted: petitioner may still sell its product under the name \u201clecithin.\u201d The label requirements are directed only to its customers. Nor does the order, as the petitioner\u2019s prayer for relief has erroneously assumed, \u201cprohibit\u201d them from using the word \u201clecithin\u201d on their labels provided they observe the prescribed label declaration; that is to say, petitioner\u2019s customers may if they wish, use a label statement reading \u201cEmulsifier Lecithin Added\u201d or \u201cWith Added Emulsifier Lecithin.\u201d That such a label would comply with the order is expressly conceded in the respondent\u2019s brief. We accept this reasonable construction by the Administrator of his own order and shall decide the question of jurisdiction on this basis. So construed the order does not, in our opinion, \u201cadversely affect\u201d the petitioner. Since its customers are privileged at their option to use or not use the word \u201clecithin\u201d on their labels, if they do not use it it is their election, not the terms of the order, which will deprive the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>tioner of any advertising or competitive advantage that might be gained from having the label carry the word \"lecithin.\u201d Nor can we see how the petitioner can be damaged by the addition of the word \u201cemulsifier\u201d as descriptive of lecithin. The findings of fact made by the respondent state that emulsifiers are commonly added to sweet chocolate and that lecithin and other named substances \u201care suitable for use as such emulsifying ingredients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In support of its right to a judicial review the petitioner relies on A. E. Staley Mfg. Co. v. Secretary of Agriculture, 7 Cir., 120 F.2d 258, and Land O\u2019Lakes Creameries, Inc., v. McNutt, 8 Cir., 132 F. 2d 653. In the Staley case the effect of the order was to prevent makers of sweetened condensed milk from using petitioner\u2019s corn syrup as a sweetener. In the Creameries case the effect of the order was to put oleomargarine into keener competition with petitioner\u2019s butter. Both of those cases were differentiated by this court in United States Cane Sugar Refiners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. McNutt, 2 Cir., 138 F.2d 116, where cane sugar producers objected to an order which permitted fruit canners to use dextrose and corn syrup as optional ingredients without having so to state on the labels. We held that any adverse effect of that order was too remote and indirect to give the petitioner standing to review the order. In the case at bar the damage is even more speculative than in the Cane Sugar case, for it will turn on whether or not the petitioner\u2019s customers elect to mention lecithin as the emulsifier they have added.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Petition dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
