There is little, if any, dispute between the parties as to the rules of law applicable. The appellant makes the point that the court\u2019s conclusion did not properly apply the law to the facts before it. This matter was thoroughly considered by Judge Kalodner in the District Court and every important phase of the matter was discussed in his opinion. 1945, 61 F. Supp. 905. We agree with that opinion and affirm his judgment for the reasons stated by him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
