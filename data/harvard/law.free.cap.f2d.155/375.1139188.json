Protests were filed, evidence was introduced by both complainant and Administrator and the cases were considered by a board of review which heard oral argument and recommended that the protests be denied. The board\u2019s recommendation was followed b'y the Administrator who denied the protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> The questions raised in the protests were wholly factual in nature. Consequently the Administrator\u2019s determination of them in the protest proceedings, if supported by substantial evidence, is conclusive. Rabkin v. Bowles, Em.App. 1944, 143 F.2d 600. We have carefully read the entire transcript of the proceedings before the Administrator and we are satisfied that there was substantial evidence before the Administrator to support his determination in each case. The complaint must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">A judgment will accordingly be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
