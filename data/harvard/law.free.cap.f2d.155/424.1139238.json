The District Court found that as to certain contracts obtained before August 19, 1943, appellant and appellee had been engaged in a joint adventure. The court directed its auditor to determine the amount of appellee\u2019s one-half share in the profits. Afterwards, on November 5, 1945, the court appointed appellee\u2019s counsel as receiver to take possession of the joint funds and hold them until further order of the court. This appeal is from the order of November 5. Appointment of 'a receiver was within the court\u2019s discretion. Creel v. Creel, 63 App. D.C. 384, 73 F.2d 107. It is immaterial that the Creel case involved partners while this case involves joint adventurers. Appellant interprets the order of November 5 as including funds arising from contracts obtained after August 18, 1943, but this interpretation is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
