That one question is rather important. The defendants violated the record-keeping provisions of GMPR<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>was brought pursuant to the Price Control Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They failed for twenty-seven months after the Regulation became effective to provide the Price Administrator with the information required from them as manufacturers of certain types of women\u2019s underwear. The information was furnished only after this suit had been begun, but was given prior to the date of hearing. The District Judge enjoined the defendants from further violation of the record-keeping provisions. He also enjoined them from violating price ceilings with regard to the goods manufactured by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The defendants do not contest the validity of the injunctive order so far as it relates to record-keeping. Indeed they could hardly do so if they would. They do object, however, to the injunction forbidding them to violate price ceilings. They say, correctly, that there was no allegation made against them charging them with violation of price ceilings. Therefore, they say, they should not be enjoined for what nobody has ever claimed they did or threatened to do. Their reliance is, naturally, upon the Express case, National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 426, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930; also New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford, etc., R. Co. v. I. C. C., 1906, 200 U.S. 361, 26 S. Ct. 272, 50 L.Ed. 515. The doctrine in the Express case is well known and has been applied since its pronouncement in this <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and other <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Circuit Courts of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">We think the general problem of injunctions in the type of case here considered is the same as that involved gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>erally in the granting of an injunction by an equity court. This view is fortified by the decision of the Supreme Court in the Hecht case (Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 1944, 321 U.S. 321, 64 S.Ct. 587, 591, 88 L.Ed. 754)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and by the Senate Committee Report<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in presenting the statute to that body. There is a latitude of discretion on the part of the District Court in the granting of this form of relief and the order is not to be upset if an appellate court finds it to be within the bounds of that discretion. It is not necessary to cite authorities for the proposition that the discretion is not an uncontrolled one but is a legal discretion to be exercised within the limits of rules of law. With that as a background, we proceed with the injunction issued in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The case for the Administrator may be stated in this wise: These defendants failed for more than two years to file the information material required of them. The record does not show why they failed to file the required reports. Whatever their state of mind may have been, the effect was as complete a disregard of the wartime control statute as if they were operating at the North Pole. It is not correct to say, as the defendants do, that the effect of the violation was complete at the end of the first day\u2019s failure to file so far as that failure bears upon their state of mind and attitude toward wartime price controls. They did withhold the information for twenty-seven months and only supplied it after the lawsuit had been brought against them. Furthermore, this information was the only foundation on which their price structure could be raised if that structure was to be in accordance with law. Their ceiling price was to be built upon sales during base period, or other information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>withholds the data on which ceiling price is based makes it almost impossible to tell whether the price violation has occurred. Defendants say they kept books and the information could have been found by examination of their books. Some of it could, of course. The O.P.A. claims that all of the necessary figures could not be assembled even with accountants in defendants\u2019 plant to look over their records. At any rate, the defendants were required to furnish the information to the O.P.A. rather than have the Administrator come and get it. A defendant who has thus made it practically impossible for anyone to tell whether he is violating price ceilings or not, by withholding the fundamental information, is not unlikely to violate those ceilings under cover of the darkness which his failure to give information has created. At least it is not unreasonable for one to conclude that such a happening is within the range of probability and to guard against it by injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">We think this view is sound and we adopt it. In doing so we quite realize that the question is new, and our path is not clearly marked out by authority. The precise problem with which we are concerned has not been considered by the other circuits. Five cases, arising in four different circuits have dealt with related problems. Bowles v. Sacher, 2 Cir., 1944, 146 F. 2d 186; Bowles v. Town Hall Grill, 1 Cir., 1944, 145 F.2d 680; Bowles v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., <em>7 </em>Cir., 1944, 143 F.2d 38; Bowles v. May Hardwood Co., 6 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 914; Henderson v. Burd, 2 Cir., 1943, 133 F.2d 515, 146 A.L.R. 714. In both Bowles v. Sacher and Bowles v. Town Hall Grill, the latest of the circuit cases, the courts affirm a narrow injunction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That, of course, is the converse of our problem. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>other three cases present three levels of our problem, but in a corollary field since in all three cases, there was a price violation to start with, as distinguished from the instant case. In Bowles v. May Hardwood Co., the plea for injunction was dismissed by the district court because a new ceiling higher than the violative price had been set prior to trial; the circuit court reversed and remanded on authority of the Express decision. The Burd case involved a broad decree which the appellate court narrowed on a ground not relevant here \u2014 namely, that the violation occurred because of a mistaken conception of relationship between defendants and a manufacturer, and hence was not likely to carry over into fields where the mistake had not occurred. Bowles v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. involved a broad decree which the circuit court affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At best, the light shed by these decisions is indirect. Nor do the many district court decisions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> bring the problem into brighter focus. The Supreme Court decisions have already been discussed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">In affirming we are not running contrary to decided cases. We conclude we are taking a position on a set of facts not heretofore dealt with by this Court nor any other of the Circuit Courts of Appeals. Every question must have its first decision and if we are otherwise right, are none the worse off for being first.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-24\"> General Maximum Price Regulation (7 F.R. 3153 et seq.) as amended, provides: \u00a7 11 (\u00a7 1499.11) \u201cBase period records \u2014 Every person selling commodities or services for which, upon sale by that person, maximum prices are established by this regulation, shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-25\">\u201c(a) Preserve for examination by the Office of Price Administration all his existing records relating to the prices which he charged for such of those commodities or services as he delivered or supplied during March 1942, and his offering prices for delivery or supply of such commodities or services during such month; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-26\">\u201c(b) Prepare, on or before July 1, 1942, on the basis of all available information and records, and thereafter keep for examination by any person during ordinary business hours, a statement showing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-28\">\u201c(1) The highest prices which he charged for such of those commodities or services as he delivered or supplied during March 1942, and his offering prices for delivery or supply of such commodities or services during such month, together with an appropriate description or identification of each such commodity or service; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-29\">\u201c(2) All his customary allowances, discounts, and other price differentials. * <em>* * \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-30\">\u00a7 12 (\u00a7 1499.12) \u201cCurrent records\u2014 Every person selling commodities or services for which, upon sale by that person, maximum prices are established by this Regulation, shall keep, and make available for examination by the Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of Price Administration, records of the same kind as he has customarily kept, relating to the prices which he charged for such of those commodities or services as he sold after the effective date of this Regulation; and, in addition, records showing, as precisely as possible, the basis upon which he determined maximum prices for those commodities or services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Section 1315.1557 of Maximum Price Regulation No. 220 was also breached.

Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.\u201d A few sentences later the Court goes on to say, \u201cHence we resolve the ambiguities of \u00a7 205(a) in favor of that interpretation which affords a full opportunity for equity courts to treat enforcement proceedings under this emergency legislation in accordance with their traditional practices, as conditioned by the necessities of the public interest . which Congress has sought to protect.\" The opinion adds that, \u201cMr. Justice Frankfurter agrees that \u00a7 205(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act, apart from dispensing with any requirement for a bond, does not change the historic conditions for the exercise by courts of equity of their power to issue injunctions, according to which the Court of Appeals should now dispose of this cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b178-16\"> Senate Report No. 931, 77th Cong., 2nd Sess. p. 10: \u201cSuch courts are given jurisdiction to issue whatever order to enforce compliance is proper in the circumstances of each particular case.\u201d While this language is less specific than the Hecht ease, the broad conception of jurisdiction envisaged by the legislative committee is only consonant with the general powers of a court of equity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-17\"> The ceiling prices of the commodities sold by defendants are determinable in one of four ways. Section 2(a) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>GMPR (7 F.R. 3153) fixes the maximum at the March 1942 level; if there were no sales during March 1942, the highest price charged by the elosesfe competitor, during that period becomes the ceiling, under section 2(b); if there was no competitor to go by, the maximum is determined by formula based on nearest comparable commodities sold, under section 3; and finally if none of these methods can determine a ceiling, the seller must file application with the O.P.A. for approval, of a proposed ceiling price. It is readily apparent that the filing of information applicable to the preceding provisions is the sine qua non for establishing a maximum price. The ceiling can only be determined in one of the specified four ways. Which of these ways is to be used depends entirely on information that the records would have revealed. The requirements as to the kinds of records that must be kept are found in Sec. 11 and 12 of GMPR. See note 1. The Administrator was well within his power in requiring specified kinds of records to be kept. Section 2(a) of Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. See note 2. Nor do defendants controvert this power. Uniformity and ease of administration coupled with inadequacy of ordinary bookkeeping records to indicate the kind of information needed, make the specified records a prerequisite to price control.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">While the instant case goes on the ground that records and prices are sufficiently closely related in the Express case sense so that \u201ccommission in the future [of price violations] unless enjoined may fairly be anticipated from defendants conduct in the past\u201d, this is not the only rationale possible. It dearly indicates, of course, that the District Court was well within its discretion. But the interrelation of records and prices is direct enough here so that proper records\" may be regarded simply as a means to the end of ceiling price control. It is difficult to doubt that an injunction broad enough to cover the means may also take into account the end served thereby. The powers of equity are flexible not rigid and its essence has been \u201cthe power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mold each decree to the necessities of the particular case.\u201d Hecht Co. v. Bowles. See note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> The Town Hall decision [145 F.2d 681], points out, however, that \u201c * * * as a guide for the dedsion of future petitions of this sort we think it advisable to indicate that in our view, if the court below had seen fit to grant the broad injunction asked for, we would affirm on the authority of National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 312 U.S. 426, 436, 61 S.Ct. 693, 699, S5 L.Ed. 930 * * The Sacher decision [146 F.2d 187], avoids direct commitment but expresses a caveat that \u201cThis is not to say that an injunction should never be issued broader in scope than the violations actually proved; decision of that question may properly await a case which presents it.\u201d The dissenting opinion in the Sacher case is in terms of that very point; the ground of the dissent'is that the broad injunction should have been ordered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><em> </em>It is doubtful whether this decision is of much help as a precedent for us here, however, since it is open to some question whether the broad decree therein was broader than the violations proved. The decree was against the doing of any act in violation of any regulation issued by O.P.A. The defendant had made no effort to comply with the regulation breached and was already under injunction for another regulation violated in the past. This, coupled with a strict view of violative acts because of the court\u2019s consciousness of a duty to share in the fight against inflation, led to affirmance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\"> Bowles v.

This case is earlier than the Express decision and involves rate contracts and the I.C.C. It only emphasizes the limitation that a violation does not serve as a basis for injunction beyond the reasonable area of threat created. As the Supreme Court there said, \u201cIn other words, the proposition is that, by the effect of a judgment against a carrier concerning a specific violation of the act, the carrier ceases to be under the protection of the law of the land, and must thereafter conduct all its business under the jeopardy of punishment for contempt for violating a general injunction.\u201d There can be no support for such a proposition.
