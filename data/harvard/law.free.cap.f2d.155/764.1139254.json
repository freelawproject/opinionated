The James Henry Packing Company will hereinafter be referred to as the packing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">The parties to the action stipulated as to certain facts and these facts were found as stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">The 25 retail markets in July 1943 were unable to adequately supply their trade. To furnish these markets with more meat and meat products, the packing company delivered to the 25 retail markets during July two instruments, entitled \u201cLease\u201d and \u201cContract of Employment\u201d, by which the operators of the 25 retail markets leased their markets to the packing company, and contracted to operate the markets for the packing company for a percentage of the gross receipts. Eight of the 25 markets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>'were owned <em>by </em>the operators of the markets, but the other 17 had rented premises. No permission was obtained from the owners of these buildings to enter into a so-called lease with the packing company. No rent was ever paid by the packing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The markets under this arrangement paid the maximum prices for the meat and meat products, and in addition paid a total of $19,149.64 to the packing company as a percentage of the gross business of the retail markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">About July 1, 1943, at the time of entering into the leases, the packing company submitted the instruments to the Office of Price Administration, and the packing company was advised that the lease and contract of employment were evasions of the Maximum Price Regulation No. 169, and the Office of Price Administration particularly objected to a provision for a 30-day cancellation, which was then omitted. On July 30, 1943, the packing company was notified that the leases and contracts constituted evasion, and was again notified on August 30, 1943, and then allowed a reasonable time within which to terminate the leases and contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The lower court found that the packing company sent notices on September 24, 1943 to the 25 retail markets to \u201comit or deduct all receipts of beef and veal furnished by us,\u201d but continued to enforce the leases and contracts, collecting from 5% to 7% of the gross sales until November 8, 1943. On November 1, 1943, the packing company had requested rescission of the leases and contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The lower court further found that the packing company never paid or made any provision to pay any social security tax for the alleged managers and employees of the markets in question. The packing company never applied for any license to operate said retail establishments as required by the laws of the State of Washington. The packing company did not pay any retail sales tax nor file any returns for said sales tax due the State of Washington as provided by law; the packing company never gave any instructions as to management, records, etc., and never authorized any obligations that were incurred by these markets, and the invoices Continued to be the same as before the execution of the leases and contracts. The retail markets did get more meat and meat products.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">The lower court found that up to September 15, 1943 a reasonable time had been allowed the packing company to cancel the leases and contracts, that failure to cancel them by that time was unreasonable delay in view of the notices to do so on July 30, and August 30, 1943. Collections made after September 15, 1943 were knowingly in violation of the regulations, and thus a result of failure to take practicable precautions, the court found.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The trial court found the leases and contracts were evasions of the regulation, and entered judgment for just the amount of the overcharges from July 1, 1943 to September 15, 1943, in the sum of $13,995.14, and one and one-half times the amount of overcharge from September 15, 1943 to November 8, 1943, in the sum of $7,731.75, together with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Both the Administrator of the Office of Price Administration and the packing company have appealed. The Administrator contends that the lower court erred in not awarding judgment in treble the amount of overcharges for the' entire period during which the leases and contracts were in effect. The packing company insists that the leases were bona fide to begin with, and that after securing the interpretation from the Office of Price Administration that the leases and contracts were considered evasions of Maximum Price Regulation No. 169, the packing company did effectuate termination of the leases within a reasonable length of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">The record discloses that the packing company did not intend to assume the maintenance of the retail markets, that the employees or operators of the markets never received any rents from the packing company. The record shows that the terms of the leases and contracts were never carried out, that the operation of the markets continued to be the same, except that the packing company collected a percentage of the gross sales. The record does support the lower court\u2019s finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>leases and contracts of employment here were entered into to circumvent the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">It was within the lower court\u2019s discretion to award less than treble the amount of overcharges. Inasmuch as the amendment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Maximum Price Regulation No. 169, which definitely fixes such leases and contracts as evasions of the regulation, did not become effective until August 16, 1943, there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the lower court in awarding the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\"> -The pertinent provisions of Maximum Price Regulation No. 16!) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">\u201cSection 1364.401.
