The Commissioner determined deficiencies aggregating $31,-236.79, being the amount of trustees\u2019 fees and expenses attributable to the collection of tax-exempt income for the taxable years, and -.\u00a1ssessed it against the taxpayer, life beneficiary of a testamentary trust, whose assets consisted in large part of Government bonds wholly exempt from taxation. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner\u2019s determination that such fees and expenses were not deductible; that the statute precludes such a determination; that the expenses were not incurred in carrying on a business, and that the assessment was not barred, since the applicable statutory limitation is five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The taxpayer urges that the Board of Tax Appeals in an earlier decision involving the taxable year 1932 (35 B.T.A. 706) held that the expenses of the same trust in collecting, conserving and distributing the trust income from tax-exempt securities'for the year 1932 were deductible, and contends that this decision is binding under the doctrine of res judicata, since the former action was between the same parties and, as the taxpayer claims, involved the same claim or demand. The Commissioner had disallowed deductions of fees and expenses incurred in 1932 for administering the tax-exempt assets of the trust, and a petition for redetermination was filed. The Board held that the expenses al-locable to the collection of tax-exempt interest were deductible. In its opinion the Board overruled the contention of the Commissioner that the management of a trust estate of this character is not the carrying on of business under \u00a7 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 489, and that the expenses of such management therefore cannot be deducted. The Commissioner filed no petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It is conceded that there has been no change since 1932 in the character of the activities and operations of the trust estate. The Commissioner contends here that the question whether the trust was carrying on a trade or business in 1932 was not presented to the Board of Tax Appeals in the earlier case. Assuming, although not deciding, that this issue was before the Board of Tax Appeals and was squarely decided, we think the Tax Court clearly was correct in holding herein that the previous decision between the same parties does not preclude the Commissioner from increasing the taxpayer\u2019s income by the amounts disallowed as deductions. The declaration in the Board of Tax Appeals\u2019 opinion to the effect that the trust operations constituted doing business within \u00a7 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932 was in effect overruled by the Supreme Court in Higgins v. Commissioner, 312 U.S. 212, 61 S.Ct. 475, 85 L.Ed. 783; City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Helvering, 313 U.S. 121, 61 S.Ct. 896, 85 L.Ed. 1227, and United States v. Pyne, 313 U.S. 127, 61 S.Ct. 893, 85 L.Ed. 1231. The Higgins case was cited with approval in McDonald v. Commissioner, 323 U.S. 57, 61, 65 S.Ct. 96, 155 A. L.R. 119. Under these cases the activities of property-owners and fiduciaries which are confined to holding and safeguarding funds and securities, collecting income, making investments, distributing income, keeping accounts, etc., do not constitute carrying on a business within the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Act. After these holdings, the questions presented upon the deductibility of expenses such as herein involved were no longer the same under the law and upon the facts, for the opinions of the Supreme Court created \u201ca new situation\u201d and prevented the application of res judicata. Blair v. Commissioner, 300 U.S. 5, 9, 57 S.Ct. 330, 81 L.Ed. 465. Cf. Vanderbark v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 311 U.S. 538, 61 S.Ct. 347, 85 L.Ed. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Also under \u00a7 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, which was carried into the later revenue acts, the deduction in computing net income of \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business\u201d was allowed. Section 24(a) (5) of the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938 and of the Internal Revenue Code prohibited any deduction for \u201cany amount otherwise allowable as a deduction which is allocable to one or more classes of income other than interest * * * wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by this title.\u201d Deduction, therefore, of expenses allocable to tax-exempt interest was not prohibited as to transactions occurring in 1932. However, \u00a7 121 of the Revenue Act of 1942, amended these sections by adding a new provision, \u00a7 23(a) (2), allowing deduction of \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>incurred during the,- taxable year for the production or collection of income, or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income.\u201d Section 24(a) (5) was also amended to provide that no deduction was to be allowed for \u201cany amount otherwise allowable under section 23(a) (2) which is allocable to interest * * * wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Section 121(e) of the 1942 Revenue Act, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 23 note, further provided that these amendments were to be effective as though they were a part of each revenue act on the date of its enactment. Thus under the statutes applicable, to the 1932 deductions, deduction of the expenses allocable to tax-exempt interest was allowable, while under the amendment of 1942 made specifically applicable to the taxable years involved herein, it was prohibited. Moreover, the same amendments designated expenses incurred by an individual in \u201cthe production or collection of income, or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for \u25a0 the production of income\u201d as \u201cnon-trade or non-business expenses.\u201d The Tax Court correctly held that the effect of the amendments of 1942 was to deny deduction of items of the very character involved in this case, and since the decision here depends upon this new and changed law and not upon the earlier statutes, the doctrine of res judicata is not applicable. To sustain the taxpayer\u2019s contention would be to give her a vested right in a decision now clearly erroneous. Cf. Henricksen v. Seward, 9 Cir., 135 F.2d 986, 989, 150 A.L.R. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Moreover, the 1932 case did not cover the period of 1937 to 1941. The parties are the same, but the issues are not identical. The precise questions of fact were not litigated. Cf. Pelham Hall Co. v. Hassett, 1 Cir., 147 F.2d 63. The operations of the trust in 1932 were similar to the operations of the later years; but they were not \u201cstatic events incapable of change.\u201d Henricksen v. Seward, supra, 135 F.2d 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Under the weight of authority, the principle of res judicata does not apply to decisions of the Tax Court involving separate taxable periods where the facts determined in the first decision were not unchangeable in nature. As persuasively stated in Stoddard v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 76, 80:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">\u201cThe point as to res adjudicata falls when considered in the light of the statutory scheme of income taxation. Each taxable year is a separate taxable period; different taxes are involved, and the events of each period are given their significance in tax matters in the light of what actually took place in that taxable year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">To the same effect are Monteith Bros. Co. v. United States, 7 Cir., 142 F.2d 139; Commissioner v. Netcher, 7 Cir., 143 F.2d 484, certiorari denied, 323 U.S. 759, 65 S. Ct. 92. Cf. United States v. Stone &amp; Donner Co., 274 U.S. 225, 47 S.Ct. 616, 71 L.Ed. 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The taxpayer contends that the assessment and collection of these deficiencies is in any case barred by \u00a7 275(a), I.R.C., 2'6 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 275(a), which provides that \u201cThe amount of income taxes imposed * * * shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period.\u201d The Tax Court held that the case is governed by \u00a7 275(c), which declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">\u201cIf the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time within 5 years after the return was filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">The taxpayer urges that the five-year limitation does not govern, upon the ground that the proposed increases in her income taxes result from the disallowance of deductions from gross income and not from omissions from gross income. The income of the taxpayer was increased by the amount of the deductions taken which was in excess of twenty-five per cent of the amount of gross income stated in the return. Since she did not report this amount in her return, she omitted it from gross income. The fact that the trustee in its return set out the entire trust income and deductions claimed does not relieve the taxpayer from her obligation to include these amounts in gross income. The omission falls squarely within the terms of \u00a7 275(c) and the five-year limitation applies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Ketcham v.
