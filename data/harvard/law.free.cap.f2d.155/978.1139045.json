The jury brought in a verdict of guilty on all four counts, but the court arrested judgment upon Counts Three and Four, and only Counts One and Two are before us on this appeal. The first count charged that Ba-neth was a purchasing agent for the \u201cNew York Ordinance District\u201d of the War Department, and that he had asked a bribe of $300 of one, Joseph Brown, and of Brown\u2019s company known as Poloron Products, Inc., for approving the rental to that company of \u201ccertain electric welding machines\u201d ; and the second count charged that he accepted the bribe. The third count charged that he had agreed to receive a bribe \u201cin relation\u201d to his official action as to a lathe and two \u201csurface grinders\u201d; and the fourth count charged that he received the bribe. The points raised upon this appeal are the insufficiency of evidence to sustain the verdict on Counts One and Two; the incompetence of testimony as to other similar offences; and the impropriety of joining the third and fourth counts with the first and second. The evidence permitted the jury to find the following facts. Brown was vice-president of Poloron Products, Inc., which was engaged in making \u201cmined crates\u201d under contracts with the War Department. Ba-neth was an employee of the War Department, and it was among his duties to allot tools and machines belonging to the \u201cDefense Plants Corporation\u201d to manufacturers under contract with the Department. Until about the middle of May, 1944, Brown had got such machinery as he needed from another employee of the War Department, named Tighe. Apparently it was from Tighe that he got the lathe and one of the \u201csurface grinders\u201d mentioned in the third and fourth counts. The evidence as to the second \u201csurface grinder\u201d is somewhat ambiguous, and for argument we shall assume, as apparently the judge did when he arrested judgment upon those counts, that it was too uncertain to support a verdict. Be that as it may, Baneth succeeded Tighe during May, and Brown asked him for other machines to be used by the Poloron company, among which was a \u201cspot welder,\u201d which is a kind of \u201celectrical welding machine.\u201d Baneth at that time threw out some equivocal intimations looking towards a bribe, but no money passed. On the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>day of May they had another talk\u2019 when Baneth made his purpose plain, after which Brown advised persons in the Department, and finally on August 5th, by pre-arrangement, Brown paid Baneth $300 in marked bills and Baneth was at once arrested. Before making this payment Brown had told Baneth that he was \u201chere to sign up for the equipment that we need\u201d and Baneth had answered \u201cHave you got the stuff with you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">The argument is that it does not appear that the bribe was given to secure Baneth\u2019s consent to the delivery of any \u201celectrical welding machines,\u201d as alleged in Counts One and Two. However, as we have already said, Brown had included in his first request a \u201cspot welder\u201d; and, since Ba-neth was at that time already asking for a bribe, though in covert terms, that evidence was alone enough to support Count One. It was evidence enough to support Count Two also, provided that the \u201cequipment\u201d to which Brown referred on August 5th, still included a \u201cspot welder.\u201d The record is not perhaps perfectly clear whether that was so, but that makes no difference. Even though they were not still bargaining for any \u201celectrical welding machines\u201d on August 5th, the variance was to the last degree unimportant. They were certainly bargaining about \u201cthe rental of machines\u201d as Count Two alleged; and it is not suggested that it was in the least prejudicial to Baneth\u2019s defense whether these machines still included the \u201cspot welder\u201d mentioned in May. United States v. Remington, 2 Cir., 64 F.2d 386. Unless we are to revert to notions, generally regarded as obsolete for at least fifty years, such errors do not count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The next objection is that the prosecution was allowed to prove that upon an earlier occasion Baneth had proposed to another company, under contract with the War Department, that he should be paid for allowing certain tools to be retained for that company\u2019s use. This was, indeed, a quite separate crime, but the testimony falls exactly within the doctrine that, when intent is in issue, other similar crimes may be proved. Our decision to the contrary in Marshall v. United States, 2 Cir., 197 F. 511, was almost immediately in substance overruled by two of the same judges who made it (Farmer v. United States, 2 Cir., 223 F. 903, 911), and, as we said in National Labor Relations Board v. National Seal Corporation, 2 Cir., 127 F.2d 776, 778, the cases to the contrary \u201care legion.\u201d Section 207 of Title 18, requires that the accused shall \u201cask\u201d and \u201creceive\u201d the bribe with a specific intent, and so the indictment alleged. The doctrine could not be more closely applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">The last point is the misjoinder of Counts Three and Four with Counts One and Two. In answer it is enough to say that no such objection appears in the record ; and that it cannot be made after verdict. Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 296, 297, 12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 429; Bucklin v. United States (No. 2), 159 U.S. 682, 685, 16 S.Ct. 182, 40 L.Ed. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
