HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b140-21\">The Price Administrator sued the defendants to recover treble damages under \u00a7 205(a) and (e) of the Emergency Price Control Act, \u2014 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix \u00a7 925 (a) and (e) \u2014 for selling goods above the \u201cceiling\u201d prices, fixed by the General Maximum Price Regulation; but the parties have stipulated that the recovery shall be limited to the difference between the actual prices' received and the lawful price. There is no dispute as to the facts, the substance of which is as follows. Before March, 1943, the defendants had been in the habit of buying finished \u201cinterlinings\u201d from the Edwards Manufacturing Company and selling at prices fixed by the General Maximum Price Regulation; these goods are a rough cotton fabric, whose surface has been \u201cnapped\u201d to make it look like flannel. In that month the Edwards Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>pany announced that it would no longer sell such goods; but that, instead, it would sell the rough fabric at a price, billing, but not delivering, it to the defendants as such; and that it would then \u201cnap\u201d the surface at a price and separately bill the defendants for that service, which is called \u201cconverting.\u201d This the Edwards Company did, and the defendants argue that it was lawful for them to sell the \u201cinterlinings\u201d so purchased and so \u201cconverted,\u201d as \u201cFinished Cottons\u201d under No. 127 of the regulations of the O.P.A. The plaintiff on the other hand insists that the General Maximum Price Regulation controlled as before; he does not seek to impose Regulation No. 118 which regulates \u201cCotton Products,\u201d although it sets a lower ceiling than the General Maximum Price Regulation. Indeed, even though No. 118 were the proper regulation, the stipulation on which the case was tried, would leave us no choice except between No. 127 and the General Maximum Price Regulation. The judge found that the plaintiff was right as between these two, and that the General Maximum Price Regulation controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">We start with the fact that the \u201cinterlinings\u201d were \u201cfinished piece goods\u201d; hence, if there were no other regulation, they would fall within No. 127, which covers such goods generally. However, 1400.-78(c) (32) of No. 127 excludes from \u201cFinished Piece Goods\u201d \u201cany fabric covered by Maximum Price Regulation No. 118. Cotton Products.\u201d The \u201cinterlinings\u201d are concededly cotton products; and, indeed, 1400.115(5) (iii) of No. 118 expressly includes them. It therefore follows that No. 118 sets the \u201cceiling\u201d for them, unless there is something in that regulation to the contrary. There is nothing unless it be 1400.-115(5) (ii) of No. 118, which excepts from No. 118 all products \u201cwhich are subject to maximum prices established and in effect under any other Maximum Price Regulation\u201d except the General Maximum Price Regulation. If the \u201cinterlinings,\u201d as \u201cfinished piece goods,\u201d are to be considered as covered by No. 127, and if for that reason 1400.115(5) (ii) excepts them from No. 118, there emerges a circuity of reasoning, like the \u201cRenvoi\u201d in conflict of laws. In that event, as soon as the \u201cinterlinings\u201d resume their place in No. 127 as \u201cfinished piece goods,\u201d 1400.78(c) (32) of No. 127 again excepts them as \u201cCotton Products,\u201d and we are back again where we started, embarked upon an infinite regress which makes nonsense. It seems to us that the escape is fairly plain: i. e., that 1400.115 (ii) of No. 118 is to be read as meaning some regulation addressed specifically to some of the products covered by No. 118: i. e., to \u201cCotton Products,\u201d eo nomine. \u201cFinished Piece Goods\u201d is a category of the most general character, meant to apply regardless of the raw material used. When it excepted \u201cCotton Products\u201d it exscinded a species whose differentia was raw material; when 1400.115(5) (ii) of No. 118 in its turn exscinded goods which any other regulation covered, it created a species of \u201cCotton Goods\u201d: a subspecies. It would be most unnatural to assume that the second exception- \u2014 that is, the exception to the first exception \u2014 should restore its contents to the genus, \u201cFinished Piece Goods,\u201d even though it must be owned that no logical solecism would be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">A quite separate argument might be made as follows. There is another provision in No. 118 \u2014 1400.104(a) (1) \u2014 which excepts \u201csales and deliveries of cotton products in the performance of a recognized distributive function by any wholesaler, jobber or retailer, not * * * controlled by * * * the producer\u201d; and \u201cproducer\u201d includes a \u201cconverter.\u201d Before March, 1943: i. e., while the defendants were getting completely finished \u201cinterlinings\u201d from the Edwards Company, they were selling as a \u201cjobber,\u201d and they might then have argued that 1400.104(a) (1) of No. 118 excluded their sales, which fell within No. 127. However, that was, apparently, not their position, perhaps because they thought that 1400.78(c) (32) of No. 127, in excluding \u201cfabrics covered by\u201d No. 118, excluded all sales of cotton fabrics of whatever kind, including sales by \u201cjobbers\u201d under 1400.104(a) (1) of No. 118. Indeed, we are disposed so to read 1400.78(c) (32) of No. 127: i. e., as putting the defendants\u2019\u2019 sales within the Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>eral Maximum Price Regulation before March, 1943, just as they and indeed the Administrator seem to have agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">But if we were to take the contrary view, and hold that before March, 1943, the defendants\u2019 sales were under No. 127, certainly after that date the .sales were no longer within that regulation, if the defendants are now right in asserting that it made a difference when the Edwards Company sold them the rough goods as one transaction, and \u201cnapped\u201d the goods as a separate transaction. If these two transactions are to be so separated, the defendants\u2019 position became worse after March, 1943, than it had been before, because they certainly became \u201cconverters,\u201d which cut from under them any support from 1400.104 (a) (1) of No. 118. This is true because 1400.104(a) (1) of No. 118 covers only those \u201cjobbers,\u201d who are not \u201ccontrolled,\u201d or \u201ccontrolling,\u201d producers, and it certainly does not cover such \u201cjobbers\u201d as are themselves \u201cproducers\u201d as well as \u201cjobbers.\u201d True, if they are right in dividing their transactions with the Edwards Company into two separate parts, and if also 1400.78 (c) (2) of No. 127 does not exclude all cotton fabrics, however sold, they should be within No. 118; but, as we have said, that question is not before us. All we need now decide is that, taking as true the defendants\u2019 position that their dealings with the Edwards Company after March, 1943, should be treated as two separate transactions, they cannot fall within No. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In what we have said, we have not taken into account the Administrator\u2019s \u201cStatement of Considerations.\u201d We do not decide whether these could have been applied retroactively, if, except for them, the defendants would have been within No. 127. They appear to be an effort to make the regulations establish \u201cceilings,\u201d based upon what was the custom in the greater part of the industry, and not based upon the actual transaction. Assuming that that would be valid prospectively; a question might arise whether they could be made to apply retroactively. It is that question which we mean to leave open. Addison v.
