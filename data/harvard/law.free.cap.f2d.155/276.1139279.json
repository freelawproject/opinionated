In a fairlead for a two-drum winch, the combination of: a base; a T-shaped mast, comprising an erect portion and a cross-piece at the top of the erect portion; two fixed sheaves, each journaled on one end of the cross-piece; a bar secured across one face of the erect portion of the mast, parallel to the cross-piece of the mast; two swivel sheaves; two housings, one being for each swivel sheave, each housing having a swivel-axle; two sockets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>carried by the base, one being for each axle; two sockets carried by the bar, one being for each axle; and means for remov-ably securing the mast to the base, so as to demountably secure the swivel housings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ad-dedup-0\">\u201c7. In a fairlead for a two-drum winch, the combination of: a base; a deck-plate; a T-shaped mast, supported by the deck-plate, and comprising an erect portion and a cross-piece at the top of the erect portion ; two sheave-housings, one being rigidly mounted at the extreme end face of each end of the cross-piece; a fin along the cross-piece, rigidly secured thereto and to the two sheave-housings; two sheaves, one being journaled in each sheave housing; two swivel-housings, swiveled on the base and mast; and two sheaves, one being journaled in each swivel-housing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\"><em>\u201c9. </em>In a fairlead for a two-drum winch, the combination of: a base; a T-shaped mast, supported by the base, and comprising an erect portion and a cross-piece; and two sheaves each journaled on one end of the cross-piece.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201c11. A fairlead according to Claim 7, further characterized by the fact that the erect portion of the mast is made out of a single piece of sheet metal bent into a C horizontal cross-section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The following general description is taken from the decision of the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APp\">\u201cThis application is concerned with improvements in winches of the type used with tractors. The winch is of the two drum type in which the drums are in alignment. These drums. are supported by a base member bolted to the rear end of the tractor frame, and are activated from the power take-off of the tractor. The base frame extends over the drums and to this part is attached a plate carrying an upright mast of T-shape. To the head or cross member of this mast are pivoted two sheaves, one on each end of the head. About midway of the pedestal of the mast is attached a horizontal bar' having openings for two sheave housings. These housings have pintles mounted in the openings in this plate and at the bottom there are smaller bearings for the lower ends of the pintles. Within these housings are sheaves over which ropes pass to the work not shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In rejecting the claims the examiner cited the following references:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">LeTourneau, 1,912,645, June 6, 1933;</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Lawler, 2,301,782, November 10, 1942;</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Hutchins, 2,312,552, March 2, 1943;</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">French, 2,321,905, June 15, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">It is noted that the LeTourneau patent was cited in connection with the rejection of claim 6, and also another claim numbered 5, which was dismissed from the appeal before the board and is not involved here. The board made no reference to that patent in its decision but it was not overruled as a reference and appellant has covered it in the reasons of appeal before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">In the brief for appellant each of the claims is separately analyzed and discussed. Before making such analysis, however, the brief set forth a general statement, the substance of which is that the application is in a crowded art; that the \u201coutstanding feature\u201d of appellant\u2019s fairlead is that the housings of his upper sheaves are rigidly mounted on the ends of the top piece of a T-shaped mast; that additional details (claimed to be important) are the presence of a bracing-fin extending from sheave-housing to sheave-housing along the top piece of the T and the fact that the stem of the T is C-shaped in horizontal cross-section, and that \u201cOf some cumulative importance\u201d is the method of demounting the swiveled housings of the two <em>lower </em>sheaves by unbolting certain described bolts.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">It is alleged that \u201cThe whole ensemble produces a more sturdy and compact tractor-winch fairlead than has ever been known before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Much emphasis is placed upon the allegation' that the application is in a crowded art.- Appellant concedes that there are many similarities between his fairlead and the fairleads of the references but contends that \u201cthe recital of as much as one essential element, patentably distinct from anything in any of the references, should render a claim allowable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">Near the end of the brief five elements, claimed to constitute novel features in appellant\u2019s winch, are set forth as follows, the italics being those used in the brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>\u201cFirst, </em>a <em>T-shaped </em>mast. French\u2019s sheave-support <em>approaches </em>T shape. Hutch-in\u2019s sheave support <em>is </em>T-shaped, it is true, but is associated with his sheaves in a manner not at all comparable with Appellant\u2019s device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><em>\u201cSecondly, </em>the <em>rigid </em>mounting of the' housings of the upper sheaves transversely <em>on the end faces </em>of the cross-piece. None of the references mounts its upper sheaves rigidly on the end faces of <em>anything.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\"><em>\u201cThirdly, </em>the ready demountability of the <em>swiveled </em>housings of the two <em>lower </em>sheaves (not to be confused with the <em>rigid </em>housings of the two upper sheaves mentioned above). Although each of the four references has lower sheaves which are swiveled, none of the references plans to demount its sheaves in the manner claimed by Appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\"><em>\u201cFourthly, </em>the reinforcing fin 32. Not only does none of the references have such a <em>fin </em>\u2014 none <em>of them has even some other form of reinforcement performing the function of such a fin.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\"><em>\u201cFifthly, </em>the C-shaped cross-section of the <em>stem of the mast. </em>None of the references has this structure. Lawler has merely a D-shaped <em>flat slab, </em>which is something quite different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The brief then adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\u201cSurely these five features, which singly and in combination make Appellant\u2019s fair-lead the light compact sturdy little tractor-accessory that it is, entitle this fairlead to the limited degree of patent protection which Appellant is asking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The brief criticizes with some severity both the decision of the examiner and that of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">It alleges, in substance, that the former\u2019s analyses of appellant\u2019s fairlead and the fairleads of the references are \u201cverbose and complicated\u201d; that he gave most emphasis to features not relied upon by appellant for patentability, and that his rejection was based on a most complicated combining of the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Concerning the decision of the board, the brief asserts, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">\u201cThe Board of Appeals of the Patent Office appear to have given this case a very superficial and ununderstanding [sic] consideration. This fact is indicated by their complete failure to grasp the identity of one of the elements relied upon. In this connection, will the Court please note that Claim <em>7 </em>* * * calls for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">' \u201c \u2018a fin along the cross-piece, rigidly secured thereto and to the two sheave-housings;\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">Elsewhere in the brief it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">\u201cThe Examiner\u2019s complicated analysis seems to have so bewildered the Board, that in the first place they did not attempt to follow and confirm it, and in the second place they showed their lack of understanding of the structure by misapplying Claim <em>7. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">\u201cSo we suggest that Your Honors totally disregard the actions of the Examiner and the Board, and start from scratch in a comparison of Appellant\u2019s claims with the showings of the three reference patents.\u201d \u2018</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">In an early part of the brief, counsel for appellant states, in substance, that he was prevented \u201cby urgent personal reasons\u201d from attending the hearing before the board to make oral argument in consequence of which he submitted on briefs, and expressed regret that he did so submit the case. In connection with this statement the brief before us states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-20\">\u201cThat the Board did .not make sufficient study of the papers to identify correctly the element in which the inventiveness of one of the claims inhered, coupled with the fact of submission to the Board, without argument, is a strong indication that Appellant has not yet had his day in Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">Discussing, first, the criticism leveled at the decision of the examiner, we do not share the view that his statements describing the features of the application and the features of the references are \u201cverbose and complicated\u201d to any objectionable degree. It is true that it required considerable space to analyze them so as to bring out clearly the elements of structure and their arrangement in the combination, but it does not seem to us that the examiner is subject to criticism for taking the necessary space to explain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">Of course, the question of whether his application of the references to the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u25a0closures of the application was correct is a matter for legitimate argument, but so far as his descriptions of the features are \u25a0concerned, we do not find their correctness \u2022challenged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We deem it unnecessary to our decision, therefore, to quote, or paraphrase, the examiner\u2019s detailed descriptions of the features of the application and those of the references, but we think it proper to quote that part of his statement applying the references to the claims before him. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201cThe claims have been rejected as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cClaims 5 and 6 are rejected as unpat-entable over Lawler in view of Le Tour-neau, Hutchins and French combined as indicated below. It would be merely following the teachings of Le Tourneau to provide the sheaves 24 of Lawler with an axle and the plates 21 and 22 of Lawler with sockets. It would be merely following the teachings of Hutchins or French to have the mast of Lawler T-shaped. Matching the elements in claim 5 (claim 6 is similar to claim 5) with the equivalent parts in Lawler; \u2018a base\u2019 should [sic] be the transmission housing A; \u2018a deck-plate\u2019 would be plate 12; \u2018a T-shaped mast\u2019 would be column 14, the \u2018erect portion\u2019, and plate 17, the \u2018cross piece\u2019 (the patents to Hutchins and French show constructions having their erect portions supporting their cross pieces in the center and such construction is merely a matter of \u2022choice in Lawler); \u2018two fixed sheaves\u2019 would be sheaves 18; 'each journaled on \u25a0one end of the cross piece\u2019 interpreted broadly would appear to be fairly met by the structure of Lawler wherein sheaves 18 are journaled in housings secured to the ends of plate 17; \u2018a bar secured across \u2022one face of the mast\u2019 is plate 21 which is integrally secured to plate 12; \u2018two swivel sheaves\u2019 would be sheaves 24 when the sheave on the right looking at Fig. 2 of Lawler is in its lower position between plates 21 and 22; \u2018two housings\u2019 are the housings for sheaves 24; \u2018each housing laving an offset swivel-axle\u2019 is structure -equivalent to that shown by Lawler and shown in Fig. 2 of Le Tourneau; \u2018two sockets carried by the base\u2019 is the plate 22 with its perforations carried by transmission housing A; \u2018two sockets carried by the bar\u2019 is the plate 21 with its perforations; \u2018and means removably securing the deck-plate to the base, so as to demount-ably secure the swivel housings\u2019 would be bolts 13 which would removably secure the swivel housings of Lawler with the swivel mounting shown by him or with swivel mountings such as shown by Le Tourneau.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">\u201cClaim 7 is rejected as unpatentable over Lawler. The particular form of support and bracing used by applicant does not involve invention over Lawler. Many forms of frame and bracing could be used to support the upper sheaves of Lawler and in the absence of a novel result the use of another form than that shown by Lawler would not involve invention. It does not appear to the examiner that the statement \u2018one being rigidly mounted at the extreme end face of each end of the cross-piece\u2019 is sufficiently definite as to how it applies to applicant\u2019s own structure to define invention over the structure shown by Lawler or such modifications of Lawler\u2019s structure that could be made by those skilled in the art without involving invention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">\u201cClaim 9 is rejected as fully met by French.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">\u201cClaim 11 is rejected as unpatentable over Lawler like claim 7. To do away with plates 15 and 16 in Lawler would not involve invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">The board approved the decision of the examiner for the reasons embraced in his statement following the appeal to it, but it did not give descriptions with the same minuteness as those given by the examiner. We find no justification for the assertion in the brief for appellant hereinbefore quoted to the effect that the board seems to have been \u201cso bewildered\u201d by the \u201cExaminer\u2019s complicated analysis\u201d that \u201cthey did not attempt to follow and confirm it.\u201d Had the board disagreed with the examiner\u2019s analysis, or with his application of the references, doubtless it would have so stated, and given its reasons for disagreement. Since it agreed, it was not incumbent upon it to state in minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>detail the reasons for its agreement, even though it might properly have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Furthermore, we find no justification for the assertion in appellant\u2019s brief, as here-inabove quoted, to the effect that the board \u201cshowed their lack of understanding of the structure by <em>misapplymg </em>Claim 7.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We do not understand just what is meant by the expression \u201cmisapplying\u201d the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The particular feature of claim 7 which appellant emphasizes is \u201ca fin along .the cross-piece, rigidly secured thereto and to the two sheave-housings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In its decision the board said, inter alia: \u201cThe patent to Lawler shows at 16 a reinforced web used in much the same manner as appellant\u2019s webs 36.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The accuracy of this statement does not appear to be questioned by appellant, but it is insisted that \u201cAppellant is <em>not </em>claiming his webs 36; rather he is claiming his fin 32,\u201d and it seems to be his view that the above statement of the board constituted the basis of the board\u2019s rejection of claim 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We do not so understand the board\u2019s decision. It made no specific analysis of any one of the claims, and the statement quoted was simply as to one feature of the Law-ler reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">It is true that the examiner specifically rejected claim 7 as unpatentable <em>over </em>Law-ler, but it was not held that Lawler disclosed a fin such as that of appellant. The specific holding reads in part, \u201cMany forms of frame and bracing could be used to support the upper sheaves of Lawler and <em>in the absence of a novel result </em>the use of another form than that shown by Lawler would not involve invention.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">We are not convinced that the holding of the examiner was erroneous, and, as of course, are not convinced that the board erred in affirming it.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">Hereinbefore we have quoted appellant\u2019s suggestion to the effect .that we disregard the action of the examiner and the board and \u201cstart from scratch\u201d in comparing the claims and the references. The suggestion is somewhat novel to say the least of it. It would seem to require that the court assume the functions of the Primary Examiner which we may not do. The statute defines our duty and limits our authority. We are required to review the decision of the board affirming the decision of the examiner when that decision is adverse to an appellant, and our review must be confined to the errors alleged in the reasons of appeal. Obviously, we cannot disregard a decision and at the same time review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">We have quite carefully considered the decision appealed from in the light of the reasons of appeal and the arguments made thereon, and we are not convinced that appellant\u2019s modifications of the prior art constituted invention. It may be that appellant\u2019s activity was in a \u201ccrowded art,\u201d or field, but unless his modification required the exercise of the inventive faculty, he may not be granted a patent because of such modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">We do not share appellant\u2019s view that he did not have his day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
