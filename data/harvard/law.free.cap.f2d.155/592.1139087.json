From judgment and sentence of the District Court for the District of New Jersey, Bozza appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">In a midnight raid on a dilapidated farmhouse at Woodbridge, New Jersey, state police officials discovered an illicit still, set up but not cooking. Though barren of normal house furnishings, the apparently deserted structure contained the usual paraphernalia essential to an illicit still enterprise. In addition to the distillation plant, the officials found bags of sugar, 600 gallons of fermenting sugar mash, and 2% gallons of alcohol which were in the receiving tank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">From the government\u2019s case, it is fairly apparent that Chirichillo was the dominant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>member of the group which carried on the illicit enterprise. He leased the house. He brought raw materials there. With the help of Bozza and one other he operated the still. And, finally, Chirichillo transported the finished product, alcohol, to Newark for disposition there.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Because appellant challenges the sufficiency of the proof to sustain conviction on any count, the charges against him and the evidence in support thereof will be summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The first count charges Bozza, Chirichillo, Ellen Vettor, and Peter Milito with the unlawful carrying on of the business of a distiller and the making and distilling of 2% proof gallons of spirits with intent to defraud the United States of the tax thereon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second count charges the same parties with unlawfully having in their possession and custody and under their control a still set up for the unlawful production of distilled spirits for beverage and commercial purposes, which they failed to register as required by law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third <em>count </em>charges them with unlawfully making and fermenting 600 gallons of mash intended for distillation and production of spirits in a building not duly authorized as a distillery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The fourth count charges them with the unlawful concealment of 2% gallons of distilled spirits with intent to defraud the United States of the tax thereon.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fifth count charges Bozza and Chirichillo with the unlawful transportation of 35 gallons of distilled spirits with intent to defraud the United States of the tax thereon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">To sustain conviction of Bozza on any of the five counts, reliance must be placed on the testimony of Ellen Vettor. She testified that Chirichillo was the moving party throughout the enterprise. She identified Bozza as a man called \u201cJack\u201d who \u201chelped out\u201d Chirichillo in the making of the alcohol inside the farmhouse. She swore that Bozza \u201cwasn\u2019t there every day in the week\u201d and that \u201che would just come around between two and three times a week he would appear there; he was not there steady.\u201d In response to a question of the court, \u201cWhen he did come there what did he do?\u201d she replied, \u201cHe would help, he would take instructions from Nick and help him around.\u201d The only other evidence she gave against Bozza was in describing how Chirichillo transported the alcohol from the farmhouse to Newark. She testified that the cans of alcohol were in Chiri-chillo\u2019s car, in which she rode, and that \u201csometimes we would follow Jack Bozza\u2019s car.\u201d She testified further that so far as she knew there never was any alcohol carried in Bozza\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The question for our determination is whether Vettor\u2019s testimony, relating to Bozza, as summarized above, is sufficient to sustain conviction on any of the counts. Section 332 of the Criminal Code <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> makes every person who \u201cdirectly commits any act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission\u201d a \u201cprincipal.\u201d Vettor\u2019s testimony justified a jury finding that Chirichillo directly committed and Bozza aided, abetted or counseled the commission of the offenses charged in the first three counts: Cf. United States v. Johnson, 1943, 319 U.S. 503, 514, 63 S.Ct. 1233, 87 L.Ed. 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">But, the concealment and transportation counts stand on a different footing. Mere evidence that Bozza \u201chelped around\u201d in the cooking of alcohol would not justify a finding that he directly concealed or that he aided or abetted in the concealment of the specific 2% gallons of alcohol found in the still\u2019s receiving tank: Cf. Czarnecki v. United States, 3 Cir., 1938, 95 F.2d 32; United States v. Sail, 3 Cir., 1940, 116 F. 2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">We reach a similar conclusion regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the conviction on the transportation count. Mere evidence that Chirichillo in transporting the alcohol sometimes followed Bozza\u2019s automobile would not warrant a finding that Bozza transported or aided or abetted in the illegal transportation of 35 gallons of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"> Consequently, the convictions on the fourth and fifth counts cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Appellant challenges the legality of the sentence on the first three counts. On the morning of July 23, 1945, following the return of the guilty verdict, the trial judge sentenced Bozza to two years\u2019 imprisonment on each of the first three counts and to two years\u2019 and six months\u2019 imprisonment on the fourth and fifth counts, all the sentences to run concurrently, That same day, about five hours later, Bozza was recalled and the court added certain minimum mandatory fines and penalties to the sentences.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the interim, Bozza had been taken to a marshal\u2019s detention room in the same building in which the United States District Court is held and from there removed to the Hudson County Jail in Jersey City, a federal place of detention, where he awaited transportation to the place where his sentence was to be served. Appellant now contends that because he had begun service of his sentence (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 709a) the trial judge lacked the power to increase his punishment by adding the fines and penalties. It is true that a judge is powerless to add to a sentence, once validly imposed, after the prisoner has begun to serve it. This is \u201cupon the ground that to increase the penalty is to subject the defendant to double punishment for the same offense in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that no person shall \u2018be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\u2019\u201d: United States v. Benz, 1931, 282 U.S. 304, 307, 51 S.Ct. 113, 114, 75 L.Ed. 354. Cf. Roberts v. United States, 1943, 320 U.S. 264, 64 S.Ct. 113, 88 L.Ed. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">However, it is well established that imposition of a sentence at variance with the statutory requirements is a \u201cvoid act\u201d. Such a sentence may be superseded by a new sentence in conformity to the provisions of the statute. It is no hindrance that the correction- \u2014 even when it entails a greater punishment \u2014 occurs after sentence has been partially served or after the term of court has expired: See King v. United States, 1938, 69 App.D.C. 10, 98 F.2d 291, DeBenque v. United States, 1936, 66 App. D.C. 36, 85 F.2d 202, 106 A.L.R. 839, certiorari denied, 1936, 298 U.S. 681, 56 S.Ct. 960, 80 L.Ed. 1402, rehearing denied, 1936, 299 U.S. 620, 57 S.Ct. 6, 81 L.Ed. 457; Anderson v. Rives, 1936, 66 App.D.C. 174, 85 F.2d 673; Egan v. United States, 1923, 52 App.D.C. 384, 287 F. 958; Harman v. United States, C.C., 1892, 50 F., 921; D.C., 1895, 68 F. 472 (same case on resentence).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These authorities are dispositive of appellant\u2019s reliance on the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment unless they are distinguishable because, here, the trial judge corrected the erroneous sentence on his own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">\u201cDouble jeopardy\u201d is a plastic concept. Its application has never been immutably fixed, either at common law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>under the protective Bill of Rights. Palko v. Connecticut, 1937, 302 U.S. 319, 322, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288. Uncorrected, the court\u2019s action was violative of congressional will: Ex parte United States, 1916, 242 U.S. 27, 37 S.Ct. 72, 61 L.Ed. 129, L.R.A. 19.17E, 1178, Ann.Cas.1917B, 355. Corrected, it merely imposed upon the defendant a penalty fixed by Act of Congress. This is neither double jeopardy nor double punishment. We see no constitutional hindrance to the court\u2019s action: cf. United States v. Roberts, 320 U.S. 264, 276, <em>277, </em>64 S.Ct. 113, 88 L.Ed. 41 (dissent by Frankfurter, J.) We conclude that the sentence as amended by the court below is valid and operative:\u2019 cf. Rowley v. Welch, 1940, 72 App.D.C. 351, 114 F.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\">Appellant\u2019s final contention that the charge of the trial judge \u201ctook the form of animated argument and amounts to acts of advocacy in favor of the government\u201d is without merit. Taking the charge in its entirety, we believe it to be a fair presentation of the case and without prejudice to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Since we have concluded that the government\u2019s proof was insufficient to sustain a: conviction on either the fourth or fifth counts, a reversal must follow. The question' is whether we must remand for a new trial or whether it is proper to direct entry of judgment of acquittal. A directed verdict of acquittal requires action by a jury and it has been held, under common law criminal practice, that upon an erroneous refusal of a trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal, the appellate court must remand for a new trial. Cf. Tatcher v. United States, 3 Cir., 1939, 107 F.2d 316 with United States v. Tatcher, 3 Cir., 1942, 131 F.2d 1002. But see Commonwealth v. Benz, 1935, 318 Pa. 465, 472, and 477, 178 A. 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">By the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the District Courts of the United States, effective March 21, 1946, motions for directed verdict, are. abolished and in their place are substituted motions for judgment of acquittal. Rule 29(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And, Rule 29 (b) permits judgments non obstante veredicto.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ' In the Advisory Committee Note to Rule 29.(b), it is stated that, \u201cThis rule is in substance similar to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S. ,C.A. following section 723.c] and permits the court to render judgment for the defendant notwithstanding a verdict of guilty. Some Federal courts have recognized and approved the use \u00f3f a judgment non obstante veredicto for the defendant in a criminal case, Ex parte United States, 7 Cir., 101 F.2d 870 [131 A.L.R. 176], affirmed by.an equally divided court, United States v. Stone, 308 U.S. 519, 60 S.Ct. 177, 84 L.Ed. 441. The rule sanctions this practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Rule 59 provides that the Rules \u201cgovern all criminal proceedings\u201d commenced after their effective date, \u201cand so far as just and practicable all proceedings then pending.\u201d The present is a \u201cpending\u201d proceeding. It is both just and practicable to reverse and remand for entry of judgment of acquittal on the fourth and fifth counts because of insufficiency of proof to sustain such convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Accordingly, judgment of the court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>is affirmed' as to the conviction and sentence on the first three counts. It is reversed and remanded for entry of judgment of acquittal on the fourth and fifth counts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-21\"> This is a receptacle into which the alcohol drips in the process of distillation. Presence of rust and water gives rise to appellant\u2019s speculation that the 2% gal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Ions of alcohol thus found might easily have been the residue in the tank remaining after the operators thought they had emptied it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> 26 I.R.C.

Punishment for conviction on the second count is fixed by Act of Congress at a penalty of $500, fine of not less than $100 nor more than $1000 and imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than two years. Under count 4, conviction required a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $5000 and imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than two years. As to each count, on recalling the prisoner, the court added the minimum fine and penalty as required in order to bring the sentence into conformity with the Internal Revenue Code provisions cited in footnotes 2, 3, 4 supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\"> In these eases, the defendant attacked the original improperly imposed sentence.
