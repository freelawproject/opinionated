Appendix, \u00a7 925(e), so as to vest the statutory right of action for a price overcharge under that section in the purchaser instead of in the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-18\">This court has already passed on the precise question here presented, deciding it adversely to the defendant. See Bowles v. Rogers, 7 Cir., 149 F.2d 1010. The same conclusion has been reached in other cases subsequently decided by other Circuit Courts of Appeal. See Bowles v. Madl, 10 Cir., 153 F.2d 21; Bowles v. Trullinger, 9 Cir., 152 F.2d 191; Bowles v. Whayne, 6 Cir., 152 F.2d 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-19\">Judgment reversed on the authority of Bowles v. Rogers, supra, and other cases cited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
