The sale was reported to the Court, and the case was referred to the auditor to state an account distributing the proceeds, and ascertaining the amount due Thomas EL Gaither hy virtue of a lien he held on the property. The auditor stated an account showing the amount due Thomas EL Gaither and distributing the proceeds of sale. In his account he allowed James T. Perkins, trustee, for State and County taxes for some twelve years \u2014 from 1874 to 1885 inclusive \u2014 which with interest amounted to $1917.93. To this allowance Thomas EL Gaither excepted, and among the reasons filed he charged that the claim of said Perkins included taxes levied hy Prince George\u2019s County more than four years before the decree was passed appointing the trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>to take charge of the property, and he therefore pleaded section 82 of the Act of 1874, chap. 483 in bar of any recovery of such taxes. The Court (Brooke, J.,) passed an order remanding the case to the auditor with instructions to discriminate in his account between the taxes due and in arrear to the State, and those due and in arrear to the County; to allow all taxes due and in arrear to the State ; and to allow all county taxes due and in arrear within four years prior to the date of the passage of the decree in the cause. The auditor stated an account in conformity with the opinion and order of the Court. This account was filially ratified and confirmed. From the order of ratification in so far as it disallowed a part of the claim of James T. Perkins, trustee, this appeal-was taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">The cause was argued for the appellee before Alvey, C.

Section 82 provides that all taxes levied for county or city purposes shall be collected within four years after the same shall be levied; and if not collected within four years, \u201cThe parties from whom such taxes may be demanded may plead this section in bar of any recovery of the same.\u201d The taxes now claimed are county taxes, and were levied more than four years before the trustees were appointed to sell the property, and this being so the appellee had the right to plead the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>statute in bar of their recovery. The fact that trustees were subsequently appointed to sell the property, and that the proceeds of sale are now in a Court of equity for distribution, does not deprive the appellee of his right to rely upon the plea of limitations provided by the Act of 1814. Section 63 of that Act provides, it is true, \u201cthat whenever a sale of either real or personal property shall be made by any ministerial officer under judicial process or otherwise, all sums due and in arrear for taxes from the party whose property is sold, shall first be paid.\u201d But this section must be construed in connection with section-82 of the same Act, .and as thus construed, it means all taxes <em>not barred by the provisions of section </em>82.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b158-6\">(Decided 10th January, 1889.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
