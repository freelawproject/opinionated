Certainly, such a construction would be in harmony with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>spirit of the registration Acts,-which are founded on the policy of requiring that every circumstance should appear on the face of the registry which is necessary to the devolution of title to real estate.\u201d <em>Schaidt vs. Blaul, </em>66 Md., 141, 144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-5\">If the mortgage is void as such, and invalid to pass the legal title, the <em>ex parte </em>decree .is also void as <em>coram non judice. </em>If \u201cthe firm of Wehr, Hobelman &amp; Gottlieb\u201d have any equitable rights under it, they can only he enforced by a regular bill in equity, to which all persons Avhose interests are to be bound by the decree must be made parties. The appellants, as judgment creditors of the mortgagor, would be proper parties to such a proceeding, and upon their establishing the fact that- their judgments are based upon contracts made after the execution of the defective mortgage, a Court of equity would subordinate to the lien of their judgments the equitable lien of the parties for Avhose benefit said mortgage was intended to be made. <em>Dyson vs. Simmons, </em>48 <em>Md., </em>207, 218.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-6\">The Court below refused to entertain the appellants' exceptions, upon the ground that they were not parties to the proceedings, and had no right to intervene, and relied upon the case of the <em>Patapsco Guano Co. vs. Elder, </em>53 <em>Md., </em>465. There is clearly no parallel between that case and the one at bar. In the former case an attempt was made to gain by exceptions to a sale, the benefit of a bill in equity to. set aside a mortgage on the ground of fraud, which being a matter to be shown by proof <em>aliunde, </em>could only be properly adjudicated upon bill, answer and testimony. In the case at bay it appears upon the face of the proceedings that the mortgage is invalid, and the decree therefore void. The exceptions do nothing more than call the attention of the Court to the fact of its want of jurisdiction in this proceeding, in order that the Court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>refuse to ratify a void sale and stop all further proceedings thereunder. The appellants, as judgment creditors, clearly have an interest in the property which justifies their intervention. That questions of jurisdiction may always be raised by exceptions to a sale filed by a judgment creditor, is a well-established rule in Maryland, as shown by the following cases: <em>Black vs. Carroll, </em>24 <em>Md., </em>251; <em>Dircks vs. Lagsdon, </em>59 <em>Md., </em>113; <em>Slingluff vs. Stanley, Trustee, </em>66 <em>Md., </em>224; <em>Fahey vs. Mottu, </em>67 <em>Md., </em>250 ; <em>Coward, Garn. vs. Dillinger &amp; Stevenson, </em>56 <em>Md., </em>61.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-6\"><em>J.

It has been held that the words <em>\u201c </em>the heirs-at-law,\u201d of a deceased person, would be a lawful description of grantees. <em>Shaw vs. Loud, </em>12 <em>Mass., </em>447; <em>Thomas vs. Marshfield, </em>10 <em>Pick., </em>364, 367; <em>Schaidt vs. Blaul, </em>66 <em>Md., </em>144.

And that any mode which will certainly identify the grantee is enough. See <em>Herman on Mortgages, secs. </em>223-4 and 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-8\">There is nothing in the statute law of Maryland which alters this common law rule. The Act of 1856, chapter 154, was enacted for the purpose of simplifying conveyances and preventing persons from suffering-loss from innocent mistakes, and immaterial matters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The codification in Article 24 of the Code of 1860, was in the same spirit. Section 28 requires mortgages of any interest in land to he executed, acknowledged and recorded as absolute deeds. Section 9 provided that any deed should be sufficient which contained the consideration, a description of the land, the interest or estate, and the <em>names </em>of the grantor and grantee. This section has been complied with, if the names have been given in any manner, whether it be by means of both the surname or the Christian name, or of the surname only in such connection as to supply the Christian name upon enquiry. And section 67, from abundant caution, provided that any other forms conforming \u201cto the rules of law\u201d shall be sufficient, thus recognizing the validity of any mode of describing the grantee which was admissible before the adoption of the Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-5\">The appellants rely upon sections 52, 53 and 54 of Article 18, hut these sections occasion no difficulty. The Act of 1865, ch. 157, required the clerk -of the Superior Court to record all deeds, mortgages, etc., in a book, which shall contain an alphabetical index, \u201c in the names of all the parties to such deed, mortgage,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">Sec. 52 of Art. 18, required the clerk to make \u201ca full and complete general alphabetical index,\u201d * * \u201cboth in the names of each and all the grantors * * and each and all the grantees.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-9\">Section 53 merely provides in general terms for the continuance of the indices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-10\">None of these sections forbid the recording of an instrument when the Christian name is not given. The record would be good even if it could not be indexed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-11\">The general creditors of Mrs. Berger could have no relief in any manner against the mortgage, even if it be in part defectively executed. A defectively exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>cuted mortgage for a <em>tona fide </em>debt will always be regarded in equity'as a contract to be enforced in favor of tbe mortgagor against creditors. <em>Dyson vs. Simmons, </em>48 <em>Md., </em>207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">The mortgage in question calls peculiarly for the application of this equitable principle, because the instrument contains a contract binding the mortgagees to renew the notes. They complied with it, and it was one which could have been enforced against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">The exceptants have no standing in Court. If their contention is right and the mortgage is invalid, their rights remain unaffected by the proceedings. <em>Warfield vs. Ross, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>85; <em>Kershner vs. Carroll, </em>47 <em>Md., </em>262; <em>Patapsco Guano Co. vs. Elder, </em>53 <em>Md., </em>463.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-7\">Bryan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AD\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">A mortgage was made to a partnership in the partnership name; and the principal question in this case depends on the effect and operation of this form of conveyance. The mortgage stated that it was made by Elizabeth M. Berger to secure the payment of her indebtedness to the <em>\u201c </em>co-partnership firm of Wehr, Hobelman and Gottlieb of Baltimore City.\u201d It embraced certain real and leasehold estate in the City of Baltimore, and sundry personal chattels; and was made subject to the sections of Article four of the Public Local Laws relating to mortgages, and it also-contained a power of sale under Article 64 of the Public General Laws. The mortgagees were describ\u00e9d as \u201cthe firm of Wehr, Hobelman and Gottlieb,\u201d and in no other way. A petition was filed by the mortgagees in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City for a sale of the mortgaged property, and a decree was passed ordering it to be sold. The real and leasehold property was sold under the decree, and the sales were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>reported for ratification. Thereupon certain creditors, who had obtained judgments subsequently to the mortgage, filed exceptions to the ratification. The first exception maintained that the decree was beyond the jurisdiction of the Court and void, because it included personal goods and chattels; whereas the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City relating to mortgages authorized a decree only for lands and chattels real. The second exception alleged that the mortgage was not valid in law, because it was not executed to any natural person, nor to anybody corporate; -hut to \u201cthe firm of Wehr, Hobelman and G-ottlieb\u201d which is neither. The exceptions were overruled and the sales ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">There was undoubtedly error in the decree, in so far as it ordered the sale of all the mortgaged property. There is no authority in the statute to decree the sale of personal chattels. It was decided in <em>Williams vs. Williams, 7 Gill, </em>302, that an appeal would lie from a decree of this character, notwithstanding the assent embodied in the mortgage. If an appeal had been taken, the decree would have been necessarily reversed in part. Ho appeal was taken, and the present question arises exclusively on the exceptions. The seven hundred and eighty-sixth section of the fourth Article of'the Public Local Laws is as follows: \u201cAny allegations may he made, and proof under the orders of the said Court exhibited, and a trial of the allegations had as the Court shall prescribe, to show that the sale ought not to have been made.\u201d Of course if the decree was erroneous, it could not he held that the sales ought to have been made. But there was no error in that portion of the decree which ordered the sale of the real and leasehold estate; and there has been no attempt to execute the portion which related to the personal chattels. There could he no reason or propriety in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>saying that a sale was improperly made which a Court had the authority to order; simply because at the same time, it ordered something else which was beyond its authority, and which was separate and distinct from the matter properly decreed. It is very frequently the case in Chancery appeals, that a decree is affirmed in part, and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Let us consider the second exception. In mercantile dealings promissory notes are constantly made payable to partnerships, and bonds are frequently made payable in the same manner. A partnership is an association of individuals; hut what is due to the partnership is due to all the partners collectively, and what is due by the partnership, is due by all the partners collectively; and suits by and against them must he prosecuted in the names of the individuals composing the firm. A contract by or with a partnership is a contract by or with all the partners. By the common law it was not necessary that a deed should contain the name of the grantee; hut a sufficient description of him was always indispensable. Lord Coke says: \u201cBut purchases are good in many cases by a known name, or by a certain description of the person without either surname or name of baptism, as to the wife ,of I. S., or his first horn son, or his second horn son, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., or to the right heirs of I. S.\u201d <em>Co. </em>Littleton, 3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">And even in the \u2019case of corporations a misnomer of the grantee does not defeat the grant; provided it can he shown by proof what corporation was intended to he designated by the parties to the deed. In the case of the <em>Mayor and Burgesses of Linne Regis, </em>10 Coke, 122, a bond was given to the plaintiff, a corporation; but the corporate name was misdescribed- in the bond; it being however,\"found by special verdict that the bond was given to the plaintiff by the erroneous description,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>judgment was given for the plaintiff. And in reporting this case, Lord Coke cites a case where the Abbot of York was incorporated by the name of \u201cThe Abbot of the Monastery of the blessed Mary of York,\u201d and a bond was made to the Abbot by this name \u201cThe Abbot of the Monastery of the blessed Mary without the walls of the City of York.\u201d The Abhot brought his action of debt by his true corporate name, and in his declaration, he averred that the bond was made to the plaintiff by the name stated in the bond, which, Lord Coke says, implied an averment that the abbey was within York; \u201cand the writ was awarded a good writ by the opinion of the whole Court; and yet the name in the bond doth not import, of itself, the true name of the corporation without averment <em>dehors.\u201d </em>In <em>African Society vs. </em>Varick, 13 Johns,, 38, the Court said \u201c where a deed is made to a corporation by a name varying from the true name, the plaintiffs may sue in their true name, and aver in the declaration that the defendant, made the deed to them by the name mentioned in the deed.\u201d In the <em>Linne Regis </em>Case, Lord Coke says: \u201cThere will be found a difference between writs and grants, for if a writ abates, one might of common right have a new writ, but he cannot of common right have a new bond or a new lease.\u201d Let us now consider the description of the grantees in this mortgage. They are designated as \u201cthe firm of Wehr, Hobelman and Gottlieb;\u201d and in the recitals of the instrument they are called \u201cthe co-partnershijD firm of Wehr, Hobelman and Gottlieb of Baltimore City.\u201d The petition for sale filed in the cause has this caption: \u201cFrederick Wehr, Herman H. Hobelman, and Frederick H. Gottlieb, co-partners, trading as Wehr, <em>Hobelman and Gottlieb vs. Elizabeth M. Berger. </em>And it commences in these words: \u201cThe petition of Wehr, Hobelman and Gottlieb, co-partners as above men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tioned, respectfully represents, &amp;c.\u201d It then alleges that Elizabeth M. Berger made the mortgage in question to the petitioners, and Frederick H. G-ottlieb, in the affidavit filed with the petition, styles himself a member of the said firm, and swears that the facts stated in the petition are true. The identification of the persons described as grantees could not he more certain. It is not a case of misnomer or misdescription to he explained by averment and proof; but simply a case, where an apt and proper designation of parties is to he applied to the individuals answering to the description. But we must now consider whether a deed naming the grantees in this way is entitled to registration; because the proceeding in the Circuit Court would not be proper except where the deed was regularly recorded. Art. 4, sec. 182, of Public Local Laws. It is stated in section nine of Article 24 of the Code that certain deeds therein mentioned shall he sufficient, if executed, acknowledged and recorded as required. It is not stated that deeds of any other form and character may he recorded. The deeds mentioned are required among other things to contain the names of grantor and grantee. The mortgage in this case does not contain the Christian names of the grantees or any of them. The surnames, however, are all stated and they are all identified as belonging to a\u2019 particular co-partnership in the City of Baltimore. The use of both Christian name and surname is howrever the regular and approved method, and ought always to he adopted. Centuries ago untitled persons were better known by their Christian names than in any other way; hut at the present day the surnames are the more important and controlling appellations. And when to the surname a circumstance is added which belongs to the individual intended to be named and to no other person, the certainty of description is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>complete. If for instance we say Smith, the Postmaster of the city; or Thompson, the green grocer; or Peterson, the tailor, there is no difficulty in recognizing the persons we mean; and in fact they are usually hetter known by their occupations, than by their Christian names. Upon these considerations, we think that the requirements of the statute are reasonably gratified in this case. The fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth sections of the eighteenth Article of the Code, enact that after the clerk records a deed, he shall make an entry, among other things, of the Christian names and surnames of the parties. These sections impose certain duties on the clerk; hut, in our opinion, were not intended to change or affect the requirements necessary to entitle a deed to registration. They recognize the fact, that in the usual course of business, deeds would contain both names of the parties; hut they do not authorize him to refuse to record a deed when there has been a departure from the accustomed methods.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b63-7\">(Decided 9th January, 1889.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Some of the questions which we have been considering were decided in <em>Schaidt vs. </em>Blaul, 66 <em>Md., </em>141; hut the circumstances of this case required a more full discussion of them than they then received.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We will affirm the order of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
