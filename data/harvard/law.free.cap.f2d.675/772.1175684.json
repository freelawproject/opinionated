BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b836-24\">Eluterio Morales, a former police chief for the City of La Joya, Texas, appeals from his conviction for making a false material declaration before a grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. He challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and the behavior of the prosecutor. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-25\">The conviction at issue in this case stems from the arrest of Fernando Perales for driving while intoxicated. Morales was charged with one count of depriving a citizen of constitutional rights in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 and two counts of making false declarations before a grand jury. One of the two counts for lying to the grand jury was dismissed. Morales was convicted by a jury of both remaining counts. He was subsequently granted a new trial on the civil rights violation conviction and therefore appeals only his conviction for the one count of false declaration to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-27\">Morales first contends that there is insufficient evidence to support his convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>tion of false declaration before a grand jury for falsely denying that he had hit Perales at the time of the arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Morales asserts that the evidence does not establish that he made false statements knowingly, as required for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. <em>See United States v. Caucci, </em>635 F.2d 441, 444 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 128, 70 L.Ed.2d 108 (1981). He argues that he admitted \u201carm twisting, hair pulling, falling and forceably keeping Perales on the ground,\u201d and that his statement that he did not hit Perales is ambiguous. We find no ambiguity in the following statement: \u201cI can tell you this in front of anybody. I did not hit Fernando Perales at any point.\u201d Morales unequivocally stated before the grand jury that he did not hit Perales and at other points indicated that he neither kicked nor pushed the prisoner. From this testimony, in direct contradiction to the testimony of three witnesses and the victim himself, the jury could determine that Morales had testified falsely and knowingly. As to any issue of ambiguity, we would agree with the District Judge\u2019s order denying Morales\u2019 motion for rehearing or new trial in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-18\">The Court was presented with ample opportunity to observe Mr. Morales\u2019 demeanor and behavior during the trial. The Court finds that based on these observations and from examination of the Grand Jury transcripts that Mr. Morales\u2019 command and understanding of the Eng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>lish language was entirely adequate for him to fully comprehend the examination and appreciate the gravity and import of Grand Jury proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Morales next challenges the behavior of the prosecutor in introducing evidence of an extrinsic offense. In his closing argument, the prosecutor referred to a statement by Morales to the grand jury, distinct from the statement for which he had been indicted, that had been contradicted at trial by another witness, calling such statement \u201ca lie\u201d. The District Judge quickly interrupted the government attorney and issued a strong curative instruction to the jury, requiring them to disregard for all purposes this statement. The government contends that the reference to a related false statement by Morales before the grand jury was not error. Assuming without deciding that the reference was improper, the error would be harmless. First, the statement was followed immediately by a curative instruction by the District Judge. Second, counsel for Morales made no objection, nor did he move for a mistrial. Finally, in a discussion with the attorneys, the District Judge indicated that he did not believe that the prosecutor had acted deliberately.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Morales\u2019 final contention is that the prosecutor, in his closing argument, impermissibly commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The statement at issue was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">But what\u2019s more important, instead of character witnesses coming in and saying that a bum from La Joya, Texas, or from Sullivan City or from Penitas is alleging, falsely perhaps, that his civil rights were violated, what\u2019s more important is the actual live witness testimony that you heard and not what the former mayor of La Joya may think about the credibility or about some individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">Of course, those are factors for you to consider. I am not saying they are not. But where you hear so much of this stuff, what\u2019s more important are the five individuals that were out at the scene of the arrest of Freddie Perales. That\u2019s what is important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">In his brief, Morales states that the \u201cprosecutor pointed the jury down a path that would naturally and necessarily lead them to consider that each person at the scene testified except the defendant.\u201d The path would have been a rugged and winding one, with the insinuation hidden from view of anyone not looking for it. In fact, the only possible flagging of Morales\u2019 failure to testify was by defense counsel\u2019s objection \u201cas commenting on the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d We find the government\u2019s comment as merely suggesting that eyewitness testimony should be accorded strong weight by the jury. Even if we were somehow to construe the comment as one referring to Morales\u2019 silence, reversal would not be necessary. We simply cannot infer that the speaker\u2019s \u201cmanifest intention is to focus on that silence or the remark was such that a juror would naturally and necessarily take it as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>655 F.2d 59, 64 (5th Cir. 1981). <em>See United States v. Magana-Arevalo, </em>639 F.2d 226, 229 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>United States v. Diezei, </em>608 F.2d 204, 208 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\">.

Up to this point, do you care to change anything that you\u2019ve testified to before this Grand Jury, as to maybe something false you said earlier, or anything that may not be clearly understood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">A. I haven\u2019t said any false statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9A\">Q. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">A. What I\u2019m telling you is the truth, I swear by God.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-11\">Q. And you understand that this Grand Jury would consider important and material anything going to how the person was arrested, what force was used in arresting that person, whether or not he was handcuffed, whether or not he was resisting, or whether or not the officers \u2014 what stories or what statements they might make to the Grand Jury that those matters are important and material to this Grand Jury to get the truth out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-12\">A. 1 understand. I understand that everything is important, but apparently Margarita Morin is lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-13\">Q. Okay. Do you know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-14\">A. I can tell you this in front of anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al7\">Q. Okay. Go ahead and repeat that, because it was off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-15\">A. I can tell you this in front of anybody. I did not hit Fernando Perales at any point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtK\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A64\">A. I did struggle a lot with him, and I even scratched my knees keeping him down because a two hundred and forty pound man, it\u2019s kind of hard for a hundred and forty-four pound man to handle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdX\">Q. He\u2019s two \u2014 you\u2019re saying that Fernando Perales was two hundred and forty pounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4p\">A. Yes Sir, he\u2019s pretty heavy. He\u2019s about two hundred and forty pounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA7v\">Q. But didn\u2019t we understand earlier that it was you, and Margarita Morin, Roberto Longoria, and Duane Snyder out there arresting one drunk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM6O\">A. No, Mr. Snyder was standing on the\u2014 opening the door to the patrol car, and he was really pushing everybody away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APmd\">Q. Who was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1a\">A. Fernando Perales. And then when I was \u2014 I was attached to him, to his hand, and I was grabbing his hand, and so was Margarita Morin, because he had already pushed Longoria towards the patrol car, and he was grabbing me and Morin at the time when he fell. He fell and he also took me with him. And I don\u2019t know whether \u2014 I know that he fell to his back, but I don\u2019t know how far he went because I didn\u2019t see far, and then I went crawling all the way to where he was so that he won\u2019t get up, because I saw him trying to stand up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQr6\">Q. All the way to where Perales was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As2\">A. Yes, he was, I would say about four feet away from where I landed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMN\">Q. I thought that you said you fell on top of him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8g\">A. I didn\u2019t fall on top of him, you know, I fell on the side.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7a\">4. The material declarations of the defendant, ELUTERIO MORALES, as set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Count were false, in that, as the defendant then and there knew that he had hit and otherwise assaulted Fernando Perales during Perales\u2019 arrest on July 29, 1979, and the defendant then and there knew that Perales was not resisting arrest.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
