J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">We granted review in these matters to determine whether, when a driver who has been detained for citation for a Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Code infraction fails to produce vehicle registration or personal identification documentation upon the request of the citing officer, the officer may conduct a warrantless search for such documentation, and, if so, the permissible scope of such a search. After briefing was complete, we consolidated these two matters for purposes of oral argument and opinion. We conclude that in these circumstances the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, permits limited warrantless searches of areas within a vehicle where such documentation reasonably may be expected to be found. Applying that standard, we conclude that the document searches in both cases were proper, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment in <em>In re Arturo D. </em>(S085213), and affirm the judgment in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hinger </em>(S085218).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">A. <em>In re Arturo D.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">At approximately 11:30 p.m. on a weeknight in late August 1998, Suisun City Police Officer Rowe stopped minor Arturo D.\u2019s extended cab truck, which had been traveling more than 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. Arturo was driving and was accompanied by two passengers, one of whom was stretched across the truck\u2019s rear pull-down seat. When asked for his identification, Arturo gave his name, date of birth, and a Vallejo address, but admitted that he lacked a valid driver\u2019s license and that the truck was not his. Arturo provided no documentary evidence as to his identity, proof of insurance, or vehicle registration. At that point, Officer Rowe planned to issue defendant a citation for speeding and for driving without a license. Rowe asked the occupants to exit from the truck, and they did so. From inside the front of the truck cab, Rowe then blindly felt with his hands under the driver\u2019s seat for documentation relating to the driver and the vehicle. Not encountering such documents, Rowe repositioned himself behind the driver\u2019s seat, bent down, and looked under the seat. Rowe found a glass smoking pipe located \u201ctowards the center\u201d of the floor under the driver\u2019s seat. In the same location Rowe also found a blue box containing a white vial, which itself contained an unusable amount of white powder. Rowe asked whether the items belonged to Arturo, and he replied that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Rowe issued a citation to Arturo for speeding and driving without a license, and because there was no licensed driver to drive away the truck, Rowe made arrangements to have the vehicle towed. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12500, subd. (a), 14602.6, subd. (a), 22651, subd. (p).) Arturo went to the police station, planning to make a telephone call to arrange a ride home. At the police station Rowe examined the blue box more closely, discovering in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>internal compartment a plastic bindle containing a usable quantity of a white powdery substance that, after testing, proved to be methamphetamine. Arturo then was placed under arrest. The district attorney subsequently filed a petition alleging that Arturo came within the provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, in that <em>he </em>possessed methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)) (count I) and an opium pipe <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 11364) (count II), and had driven without a license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500, subd. (a)) (count III).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">At the jurisdictional hearing, the trial court denied Arturo\u2019s suppression motion and sustained the petition as to counts II and HI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter the court adjudged Arturo a ward of the court, and he appealed. In a published opinion, Division Four of the First District Court of Appeal reversed the order denying Arturo\u2019s motion <em>to </em>suppress the smoking pipe, reasoning that \u201cthe scope of the officer\u2019s intrusion went beyond that justified by the need to locate registration [and other identifying documents] and accordingly, it was unreasonable as a search for registration [and other identifying] documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">B. <em>People v. Hinger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In August 1997, while driving alone in his automobile, defendant Randall Hinger was stopped by Orange Police Officer Skinner for making unsafe lane changes. Hinger told Skinner that his name was \u201cRandy Hinger\u201d but that he did not have his driver\u2019s license with him, and that he had no documentation concerning the car he was driving. At some point during this process, Skinner noticed Hinger open the glove compartment of the vehicle. According to the officer, Hinger explained that he only recently had purchased the vehicle, or that he was in the process of purchasing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">With Officer Skinner\u2019s permission, Hinger exited from the car. While Skinner used his radio to conduct a record check on Hinger\u2019s name and automobile, a backup officer arrived. While waiting for the requested record check, Skinner asked Hinger whether he could search the car. Hinger declined to consent. After Skinner informed Hinger that he would look for identification and registration notwithstanding Hinger\u2019s refusal, Hinger said he might have a wallet in the car after all, suggesting it could be in the glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Officer Skinner noticed that the glove compartment that Hinger previously had opened was still ajar, exposing some loose papers. As Skinner later explained, \u201cI wanted <em>to </em>find out who [defendant] was. I wanted to make sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that the name he gave me was his real name and make sure that the vehicle that he was driving either was in the process of belonging to him or was not stolen, or just to document who the vehicle belonged to.\u201d Skinner opened the front passenger door and lifted up the loose papers in the glove compartment, but found no identifying documents or wallet. Skinner then walked to the driver\u2019s side of the car, opened the door, and looked under the front seat for the wallet, finding nothing there. The officer walked back to the passenger side of the car and looked under the passenger seat (apparently doing so from the vantage point of the front of the seat). There Skinner saw and seized a wallet. Upon opening the wallet, he found inside a form of identification\u2014a check-cashing card with Hinger\u2019s photograph on it\u2014and a clear plastic baggie containing methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Hinger was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and pleaded guilty to that charge after the superior court denied his motion to suppress the foregoing evidence. In an unpublished opinion, Division Three of the Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, finding that the officer\u2019s search for identifying documentation was reasonable under the circumstances and that the contraband found during the course of that search was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Vehicle Code sections 4462 and 12951<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> long have required that the person in the immediate control of an automobile present evidence of registration and a driver\u2019s license upon proper command of a peace officer. Section 4462, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cThe driver of a motor vehicle shall present the registration or identification card or other evidence of registration of any or all vehicles under his or her immediate control for examination upon demand of any peace officer.\u201d Section 12951, subdivision (b), provides: \u201cThe driver of a motor vehicle shall present his or her license for examination upon demand of a peace officer enforcing the provisions of this code.\u201d The reason for these provisions is plain: An officer who has stopped a vehicle for a traffic infraction and who plans to issue a citation needs to ascertain the true identity of the driver and the owner of the vehicle, in order to include that information on the citation and the written promise to appear. <em>(People v. McGaughran </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 577, 584, fn. 5 [159 Cal.Rptr. 191, 601 P.2d 207] [registration and license \u201cdocuments are . . . the source of most of the information needed by the officer to complete the citation\u201d].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But what action by the officer is permissible when, upon proper demand, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>motorist who has been stopped for a traffic violation fails to produce the registration or license documentation required by statute?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Although it is well established that motorists have a cognizable privacy interest against unreasonable searches and seizures, the United States Supreme Court frequently has observed that, in light of the pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on the public highways, individuals generally have a reduced expectation of privacy while driving a vehicle on public thoroughfares. (E.g., <em>New York v. Class </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 106, 112-113 [106 S.Ct. 960, 964-966, 89 L.Ed.2d 81] <em>(Class) </em>[upholding limited warrantless search of automobile to discover its vehicle identification number].)  The threshold question posed in the two cases before us is this: In the context of a valid traffic stop during which a driver fails to produce the required automobile registration, driver\u2019s license, or identification documentation upon an officer\u2019s proper demand, do the government\u2019s regulatory needs and the reduced expectation of privacy on the part of the driver operate to allow an officer, consistently with the Fourth Amendment, to conduct a limited warrantless search for such documentation?</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The leading case on this subject is <em>People </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 429 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273] <em>(Webster). </em>There, California Highway Patrol (CHP) Officer Abbott stopped the defendant for speeding on a freeway. In response to the officer\u2019s request for a driver\u2019s license, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>defendant produced only a birth certificate. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 4.) As the officer wrote out the ticket, he asked who owned the vehicle. The defendant responded, incongruously, that his five passengers were hitchhikers and that one of them owned the car. The officer thereafter learned via radio that the defendant was wanted on an outstanding warrant and placed him in the officer\u2019s patrol car. Upon the subsequent arrival of backup officers, the officer returned to the stopped vehicle to ask the passengers which one of them owned the car. After all five denied ownership, Officer Abbott ordered the passengers out of the car, searched unsuccessfully for registration papers in the vehicle\u2019s glove compartment and on the sun visor, but did not find any registration document. In the course of that search he did notice, however, a wallet on the front seat, where one of the passengers had been sitting. Abbott asked each of the passengers and the defendant whether he owned the wallet. When all denied ownership, Abbott opened the wallet to determine its ownership, then observed that it belonged to another person. Later it was discovered that the defendant and four of his passengers earlier that day had robbed the individual who owned the wallet and on the preceding day had murdered another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The defendant challenged the search on the grounds that \u201cAbbott had neither a warrant, nor probable cause, nor justification based on exigent circumstances.\u201d (Webster, <em>supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, 430.) This court upheld the search against the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim. We observed, in relevant part: \u201cAt the outset, we conclude Abbott acted properly when he . . . entered the car for the limited purpose of finding the registration. Then, as now, the Vehicle Code allowed a CHP officer, among others, to inspect a [registerable] vehicle and its title in order to determine ownership. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2805, subd. (a).)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] The law also required the driver of a motor vehicle to produce his or her license and registration for examination upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>peace officer\u2019s demand. ([Veh. Code], \u00a7\u00a7 4462, subd. (a), 12951, subd. (b).) <em>Within constitutional limits, such statutes authorize an officer to enter a stopped vehicle and conduct an immediate warrantless search for the required documents. </em>(E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Faddler </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 607, 610-611 [183 Cal.Rptr. 328]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnett </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 795, 799-800 [165 Cal.Rptr. 781]; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 361, 367 [142 Cal.Rptr. 299]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martini, supra,] </em>23 Cal.App.3d 444, 447. . . .)\u201d <em>(Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 411, 430, fns. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">We also noted in <em>Webster </em>that the vehicle \u201cwas validly detained on the highway for a moving traffic violation\u201d and that given the \u201cuncertain situation\u201d concerning ownership of the car, the officer \u201cwas amply entitled to inspect the [vehicle\u2019s] registration to ascertain its owner before deciding whether to release or impound the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, 430-431.) Commenting that it was reasonable for Abbott to order the passengers out of the vehicle and to search for the documentation himself,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we observed that \u201c[a]t the time he saw the wallet, Abbott was confining his search to the visor and glove compartment, <em>traditional repositories of auto </em>registrations.\u201d <em>(Webster, </em>at p. 431, italics added.) We concluded: \u201cWhile engaged in these appropriate activities, Abbott saw the wallet lying in plain view in the now-empty interior. The observation and seizure of evidence in plain view from a position where the officer has a right to be is not constitutionally prohibited. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 351, 357 [128 Cal.Rptr. 5, 546 P.2d 293].)\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Prior to and subsequent to <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, California courts have held in analogous circumstances that it is constitutionally proper for an officer to conduct a limited warrantless search of a vehicle for the purpose of locating registration and other related identifying documentation. (See cases cited in <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 430, quoted <em>ante, </em>at p. 70;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see also <em>People v. Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 182 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521] <em>(Tumer)\\ People v. Hart, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th 479, 489; <em>People v. Miranda </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 917, 927 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The parties focus upon two decisions of the United States Supreme Court\u2014one issued several years prior to the 1991 decision in <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, but not cited therein <em>(Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106), and the other issued several years after <em>Webster (Knowles v. Iowa </em>(1998) 525 U.S. 113 [119 S.Ct. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492] <em>(Knowles)). </em>The Attorney General asserts that the first case, <em>Class, </em>supports <em>Webster </em>and the propriety of the searches here at issue. Defendants contend otherwise, and argue that in any event the second case, <em>Knowles, </em>undermines <em>Webster </em>and invalidates both searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In <em>Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106, two officers stopped the defendant driver for traffic infractions. The driver emerged from his car, closed the vehicle\u2019s door, and produced registration and insurance documents, but no license. One of the officers then opened the defendant\u2019s car door in order to look for the vehicle identification number (VIN), which was located on the dooqamb of cars made before 1969. Not seeing a VEST at that location, the officer decided to look for one in the other spot where a VIN regularly is found in more recently manufactured vehicles, on the top of the dashboard\u2014an area normally visible from outside a vehicle. The officer reached inside the car to remove some papers covering that area of the dashboard, and in doing so he noticed the handle of a gun beneath the driver\u2019s seat. The gun was seized, and the defendant was arrested for possession of the weapon. <em>(Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 108 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 962-963].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The high court upheld the warrantless search on a five-to-four vote. All members of the court agreed that the Fourth Amendment was implicated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that a search had occurred. All also agreed that the search was unsupported by probable cause to believe that the car was stolen or that it contained contraband, and that the search could not be justified under the so-called automobile exception<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or any other exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. It was also apparently conceded or assumed that no other recognized exception to the warrant requirement applied to allow the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In nonetheless upholding the search under a balancing test that considered \u201c \u2018the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion\u2019 \u201d <em>(Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106, 118 [106 S.Ct. 960, 968]), the majority emphasized, among other things, (i) the importance of the VIN system in tracking stolen vehicles and in promoting highway safety <em>(id., </em>at pp. 111-112 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 964-965]),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (ii) the generally decreased expectation of privacy that drivers have with regard to automobiles, the VIN in particular,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the pervasive regulatory scheme that surrounds the use of vehicles on public roads <em>(id., </em>at pp. 113-114 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 965-966]), (iii) officer safety concerns <em>(id., </em>at p. 116 [106 S.Ct. at p. 967]), and (iv) the limited nature of the search undertaken. In the latter respect, the majority observed that the officer did not \u201croot about the interior\u201d of the car or \u201creach into any compartments,\u201d but that the search was instead \u201cfocused in its objective, and no more intrusive than necessary to fulfill that objective.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 118-119 [106 S.Ct. at p. 968].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent in <em>Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106, 125 [106 S.Ct. 960, 972], argued that \u201c[b]ecause the Fourth Amendment constrains the State\u2019s authority to search automobiles under the guise of \u2018regulation,\u2019 the fact that the Government uses the VIN as part of its scheme for regulating automobiles is insufficient to justify a search of the passenger compartment to retrieve such information.\u201d (Dis. opn. of Brennan, J., joined by two other justices, italics omitted.) Expanding on this theme, the dissenters argued that the search was not <em>justified </em>in any event, because the officer had no reason to search for the VIN\u2014the driver having previously produced registration documentation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 127-131 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 972-975] (dis. opn. of Brennan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Plainly, the high court\u2019s majority opinion in <em>Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106, did not address the propriety of the limited type of search here at issue. But the majority\u2019s reasoning and approach in approving the limited warrantless search in <em>Class </em>are not inconsistent with a similar analysis and conclusion in the context of Webster-type searches.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See 4 LaFave, Search and Seizure (3d ed. 1996) \u00a7 9.5(e), p. 296 <em>[\u201cClass </em>may mean that in some circumstances the police may, without a reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and presently dangerous, enter a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation to seek out other required documentation\u201d].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, in at least one important respect, Webster-type searches may be more justifiable under the Fourth Amendment, in that the basis for a search for identification and registration documentation preparatory to the issuance of a citation would appear to be more compelling than the justification for a search to discover the VIN of a vehicle for which the driver already had produced apparently valid registration documentation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It may be questioned whether a majority of the high court, or even the dissenters in <em>Class, </em>would have prohibited a limited warrantless search when, as in the cases before us, the driver, in response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>a proper demand, professes to lack the required documentation needed for an officer to issue a proper citation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In sum, we conclude that the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Class </em>does not impair the general validity of Webster-type searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">As noted, defendants also question the continuing validity of limited warrantless searches for license and registration documents under <em>Webster </em>and related cases in light of the 1998 decision in <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113, in which the high court unanimously held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits a <em>full-scale </em>warrantless search of an automobile incident to the issuance of a traffic citation. As explained below, absent a clear indication to the contrary from the United States Supreme Court, we conclude that <em>Knowles </em>does not undermine <em>Webster </em>and related case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113, 114 [119. S.Ct. 484, 486], an officer stopped the defendant for speeding and issued a citation. Thereafter, pursuant to state statute, the officer proceeded to conduct a full-scale warrantless search of the vehicle for contraband. In so searching, the officer discovered a bag of marijuana and a pipe under the driver\u2019s seat. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The state supreme court, analogizing to the full-scale warrantless search for contraband that would be permissible pursuant to a search incident to a custodial arrest <em>(United States v. Robinson </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 218 [94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427] [search of person, incident to custodial arrest]; <em>New York v. Belton </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 454 [101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768] [search of automobile interior, incident to custodial arrest of car occupant]), upheld the search under what was characterized as a \u201csearch incident to citation\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 115 [119 S.Ct. at p. 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The high court held that the twin rationales supporting the search incident to custodial arrest exception to the warrant requirement\u2014officer safety and the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial\u2014were not present on the facts in <em>Knowles, </em>in which the driver already had been issued a citation following a routine traffic stop. <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113, 116-117 [119 S.Ct. 484, 487-488].) In rejecting the argument that a full \u201csearch incident to arrest\u201d was justified in order to discover and preserve evidence, the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>court observed: \u201cOnce [the driver] was stopped for speeding <em>and issued a citation, </em>all the evidence necessary to prosecute that offense had been obtained.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 118 [119 S.Ct. at p. 488], italics added.) Addressing the state\u2019s assertion that nevertheless a <em>full search </em>of the type that would be permissible incident to a custodial arrest also should be permissible \u201c \u2018incident to citation\u2019 . . . because a suspect who is subject to a routine traffic stop may attempt to hide or destroy evidence related to his identity <em>{e.g., </em>a driver\u2019s license or vehicle registration)\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the court disagreed, stating that \u201cif a police officer is not satisfied with the identification furnished by the driver, this may be a basis for arresting him rather than merely issuing a citation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court in <em>Knowles </em>concluded that the Fourth Amendment does not provide the police a right to conduct a <em>\u201cfull field </em>search\u201d <em>{ibid., </em>italics added) incident to the issuance of a citation, and hence found the full-scale warrantless search for contraband at issue in that case to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Defendants assert that <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113, implicitly precludes officers from conducting a warrantless search for registration or identification documents preparatory to the issuance of a traffic citation to a driver who fails to produce such documentation upon demand. We believe, that <em>Knowles </em>is distinguishable. Unlike the situation in <em>Webster </em>and related decisions (and the cases presently before us), in Knowles\u2014as the high court itself emphasized\u2014the officer in that case already had issued the driver a citation (apparently the officer had obtained sufficient identifying information to complete that citation), and <em>thereafter </em>had conducted an unrelated <em>full-scale </em>warrantless search for contraband. Accordingly, the search at issue in <em>Knowles, </em>unlike those at issue in <em>Webster </em>and related cases (and those before us today) was not a limited one conducted for the narrow purpose of discovering required documentation that the driver had failed to produce upon demand and that was needed for the officer to issue a citation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Indeed, in <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113, the court repeatedly stressed throughout its brief opinion that the issue presented was the validity of a <em>\u201cfull search </em>of the car\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 114 [119 S.Ct. at p. 486] [twice so characterizing], italics added), a <em>\u201cfull-blown search\u201d (id., </em>at p. 115 [119 S.Ct. at p. 487], italics added), or a <em>\u201cfull field search\u201d (id., </em>at p. 118 [119 S.Ct. at p. 488], italics added). Absent contrary direction from the high court, at this juncture we agree with the Attorney General that the court in <em>Knowles </em>addressed itself only to the question of allowing a full-scale warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>search for contraband <em>following </em>the issuance of a traffic citation, and that the court did not address (nor do we read its opinion to cast doubt upon) the longstanding authority, established under California law as well as federal and sister state decisions,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> permitting a police officer to conduct under certain circumstances a limited warrantless search of a vehicle for required regulatory documentation, <em>prior </em>to issuing a traffic citation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We proceed to address whether the warrantless searches here at issue were proper under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">A. <em>Arturo D.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Arturo first asserts that Officer Rowe had no reason to enter the vehicle to search for registration because, Arturo claims, the record discloses that the trial com! found that he earlier had given the registration to the officer. The record does not support this reading. At one point during direct examination, the officer testified that when he asked Arturo for his license and registration, Arturo produced neither item. Thereafter, during cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall whether Arturo had produced the requested documentation. Still later, following further discussion concerning the evidence on this point, and in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that Officer Rowe had no right to be where he was or to search, the trial court interrupted defense counsel and asserted: \u201cThere\u2019s no suggestion that the officer was doing anything other than looking for <em>documents of title and driver\u2019s identification.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) To this, defense counsel replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The trial court immediately responded, \u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">This constitutes a finding by the trial court that when the officer searched the car, he was looking for <em>both </em>registration and driver identification.  Of course, \u201cthe power to judge the credibility of the witnesses, resolve any conflicts in the testimony, weigh the evidence and draw factual inferences, is vested in the trial court. On appeal all presumptions favor the exercise of that power, and the trial court\u2019s findings on such matters, whether express or implied, must be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawler </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 156, 160 [107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621]; <em>People v. Martin </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 687, 692 [108 Cal.Rptr. 809, 511 P.2d 1161] [because the trial court ruled on the suppression motion \u201cafter holding an evidentiary hearing pursuant to the motion, all factual conflicts must be resolved in the manner most favorable to the court\u2019s disposition of the motion\u201d].)  Here the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence\u2014Officer Rowe\u2019s testimony on direct examination that when he asked Arturo for his license <em>and </em>registration, Arturo produced neither.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must honor the trial court\u2019s finding that, when conducting his search, Officer Rowe was looking for both registration and license documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Arturo also asserts that because he \u201ccandidly admitted\u201d to Officer Rowe that he was 16 years of age and had no license, the officer accordingly had no right to search his vehicle for any license or other identification. Officer Rowe was not obligated to take the driver\u2019s word on these matters at face value, however. When the officer prepared to cite Arturo for a Vehicle Code violation, he had both a right and an obligation to ascertain the driver\u2019s true identity, to ensure that the driver\u2019s true name appeared on the citation and on the written promise to appear. We conclude that Officer Rowe was entitled to enter the vehicle to conduct a limited search for both registration and identification documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Arturo next asserts that a limited warrantless search under <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, and related cases must be confined to \u201ctraditional repositories\u201d such as a glove compartment or a sun visor, and that the area under a driver\u2019s seat is not a traditional repository for registration or identification documents. The Attorney General, by contrast, asserts that an officer is entitled to conduct a nonpretextual warrantless search for such documents in those locations where such documentation reasonably may be expected to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We agree with the Attorney General. Although we observed in <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, 431, that when the officer in that case \u201csaw the wallet, [he] was confining his search to the visor and glove compartment, traditional repositories of auto registrations,\u201d we did not thereby restrict the scope of such a search to \u201ctraditional repositories\u201d for auto registration documents. Instead, we merely explained that the officer in that case properly was searching in an area where such documentation reasonably could be expected to be found. Neither <em>Webster </em>nor any of the cases that it cited or that preceded it <em>confined </em>the scope of a permissible search for documentation to such so-called <em>\u201ctraditional </em>repositories.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Subsequently, in <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 137, 182, we observed that the warrantless search for documents in that case, \u201cas in <em>Webster,'\u201d </em>was confined to \u201cthe glove compartment, a traditional repository of vehicle registration.\u201d Again, as the Attorney General explains, \u201cthis reference to a \u2018traditional repository\u2019 [was] descriptive rather than restrictive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Although, as noted above, the United States Supreme Court has not specifically approved or defined the scope of a warrantless search of a vehicle for registration or identification documentation, our conclusion that under certain circumstances limited searches for required regulatory documentation are permissible in those locations where such documentation reasonably may be expected to be found, appears to be consistent with the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106, upholding a warrantless limited search to allow an officer to observe a car\u2019s YIN during a stop following a traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Our conclusion is also consistent with general Fourth Amendment case law concerning the scope of permissible searches (e.g., <em>Michigan v. Long </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 [103 S.Ct. 3469, 3481, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201] [protective search of passenger area of automobile is \u201climited to those areas where a weapon may be placed or hidden\u201d]), and as noted above it is consistent with a number of prior California cases (see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 68-71) as well as cases from other jurisdictions (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 16). Finally, our conclusion also parallels the view of noted Fourth Amendment scholar Wayne R. LaFave, who, citing and describing <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, and <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 137, states: \u201cUnder a variety of circumstances, it is reasonable for the police to make a limited search of a vehicle in an effort to determine ownership. . . . [\u00b6] . . . The better view is that if the driver has been given an opportunity to produce proof of registration but he is unable to do so, and even if he asserts that there is no such proof inside the car, the officer is not required to accept such an assertion at face value, at least when his \u2018previous conduct would . . . cast doubt upon his veracity\u2019; at that point, the officer may look for registration papers \u2018on the dashboard, sun visor and steering column\u2019 and, if not found in those places or seen in plain view, in \u2018the glove compartment,\u2019 <em>all \u2018places where it reasonably may be found.' </em>\u201d (3 LaFave, Search and Seizure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.4(d), pp. 566-567, italics added, fas. omitted; see also <em>id., </em>p. 567, fn. 131.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We proceed to apply this standard to the facts of this case. As the Attorney General suggests in his briefs, some persons who are stopped for traffic violations may not wish to provide an officer with valid documentation showing the driver\u2019s true name or identity, or showing the name of the vehicle\u2019s owner. Some drivers who wish to avoid disclosing such documentation to the police may keep the documents under the driver\u2019s seat and yet disclaim their existence. Indeed, at the suppression hearing, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>argued that \u201cit\u2019s not uncommon that people will shove their driver\u2019s license or their wallets underneath the seat while they\u2019re driving.\u201d The Attorney General argues that police officers, knowing this, reasonably may expect to find a wallet, or identification, or registration documents, under a driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We conclude that case law supports the Attorney General\u2019s view. Although Arturo asserts that he was able to find only one case in which a wallet was found under a driver\u2019s seat, in fact numerous published appellate decisions report that drivers\u2019 wallets (and hence, often, identification) have been located under the front seats of vehicles. (E.g., <em>People v. Barrick </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 115, 121 [187 Cal.Rptr. 716, 654 P.2d 1243] [driver\u2019s wallet found under driver\u2019s seat]; <em>Grudt v.

We conclude that in the circumstances of this case, the area under Arturo\u2019s seat was a location where registration or identification documentation reasonably might be expected to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Arturo insists that even if it is generally reasonable to search for identification or registration documents under the driver\u2019s seat, Officer Rowe exceeded the permissible scope of a proper limited search for such documents because he searched an area that the driver could not easily reach and conducted the search from behind the driver\u2019s seat. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">As noted above, Officer Rowe first attempted to search under the seat from the front area of the truck\u2019s cab\u2014he reached blindly with his hand under the seat, but felt nothing. Immediately thereafter, the officer approached the same general area beneath the seat from a different vantage point, behind the driver\u2019s seat of the truck\u2019s extended cab, in a position that allowed him not only to feel, but also to view, the area under the seat. As the Attorney General observes, the space behind the truck\u2019s driver\u2019s seat would have afforded the officer an opportunity to inspect beneath the seat without restriction from the steering wheel and pedals, etc. At that point, Officer Rowe noticed and seized the pipe and the box in the middle of the area under the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Arturo asserts there is no evidence that this area was \u201ceasily accessible\u201d to a driver from the front, or that it could be reached from the front. Initially, we note that the circumstance that a driver might deposit his or her wallet under the driver\u2019s seat from the front, while seated, does not necessarily mean that the driver plans to retrieve that wallet from a sitting position within the cab of the vehicle, instead of, for example, retrieving it from a position standing outside the open door. (See <em>People v. Bauer, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 368, 372 [\u201cAfter a request for his registration,\u201d the defendant, from outside the car, \u201creached beneath the front seat and pulled out the folder portion of a wallet and extracted an expired, temporary driver\u2019s license\u201d].) Moreover, there is no evidence that the area searched was not in fact accessible from the front, easily or otherwise, and Officer Rowe testified that he was searching the area that he believed \u201cwould . . . be in control of the driver, which would be the front area.\u201d Finally, even if the area searched was not easily accessible from the front, this factor would not be determinative. Items placed under a car seat can shift as the car moves, and an item, such as a wallet, placed originally in an easily accessible position near the front of a seat, may, through the movements of the car, migrate to another location under that seat. In this regard, there is no evidence that the floor area under the driver\u2019s seat was partitioned, so as to prevent items placed under the seat in the front from gravitating toward the center area under the seat. We agree with the Attorney General that although the prospective reach of a driver in relation to the location searched is a factor that can be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of the search, it is not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Nor do we find Officer Rowe\u2019s decision to conduct the search from a vantage point behind the driver\u2019s seat to be unreasonable. We agree with the Attorney General that \u201can officer may conclude based upon a variety of factors such as the size of the vehicle, the size of the door opening, the height of the vehicle off the ground, and the positioning of the seat in relation to the steering wheel and pedal, that viewing the area under the driver\u2019s seat is more easily and reasonably accomplished from behind the driver\u2019s seat rather than from the front seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We reject Arturo\u2019s suggestion that allowing the limited search here at issue to be conducted from the more efficient vantage point of behind, rather than in front of, the seat constitutes a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. For example, although it is accepted that an officer under proper circumstances reasonably may search for documentation in a glove compartment, and might gain such access from the driver\u2019s seat area, an officer alternatively, and just as reasonably, may gain such access by opening the front passenger door and searching from that vantage point, rather than restricting his or her entry and positioning to the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>(E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Faddler, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.3d 607, 609.) We agree with the Attorney General that \u201conce the officer is entitled to enter the car and look in the area under the driver\u2019s seat, the act of positioning his or her head behind the seat and looking forward constitutes no greater intrusion and implicates no greater expectation of privacy than positioning his or her head in front of the seat and looking backward, [\u00b6] Moreover, artificially hmiting the vantage point of an officer to essentially the driver\u2019s physical space, namely the area in front of the driver\u2019s seat, places an unjustified and potentially dangerous burden on the officer. If an officer is entitled to search under the driver\u2019s seat but is unable to safely position himself to view that area due to the presence of the steering column and pedals, his only option is to use his hand to blindly feel under the driver\u2019s seat or abandon an otherwise justified search.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In sum, the controlling question is whether the officer lawfully was entitled to search the <em>location </em>where he was looking. We conclude that it was reasonable for Officer Rowe to view the area underneath the driver\u2019s seat. The search was not rendered improper merely because the officer elected to view that area from behind the driver\u2019s seat. And if, as here, the officer observes contraband in plain view while conducting a proper limited search for regulatory documents, the contraband properly may be seized. (Webster, supra, 54 Cal.3d 411, 431, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Finally, Arturo asserts that Officer Rowe\u2019s search was unreasonable because the nature and quality of the intrusion on his Fourth Amendment interests outweighed the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion. (See <em>Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106, 118 [106 S.Ct. 960, 968] .)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Arturo emphasizes that he gave Officer Rowe identifying information\u2014a name, an address in Vallejo, and a date of birth\u2014and accordingly, he argues, no important government interest justified or outweighed the ensuing intrusion upon his Fourth Amendment rights. The record establishes, however, that the officer stopped defendant in Suisun City, more than 17 miles from the Vallejo address given; it was 11:30 p.m., and the driver, a minor, admitted that the truck belonged neither to him nor to his passengers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The driver was unable to provide Officer Rowe with a driver\u2019s license or other documentation of his identity, and as the court found, the driver also failed to provide the officer with vehicle registration documentation. Officer Rowe reasonably decided to have the car towed. Prior to actually issuing the traffic citation, the officer decided to conduct a limited search in an area where he reasonably could expect to find the missing but required documentation. It is apparent that at that point Officer Rowe was attempting to determine for himself whether registration information concerning the vehicle\u2019s owner was available inside the vehicle, and also was attempting to verify and ascertain the driver\u2019s identity (and, indeed, whether he in fact was licensed as a driver), so that the citation could be issued in the driver\u2019s true name and show his true address. Under these circumstances, the officer\u2019s decision to conduct a limited search for registration and identification documents was reasonable, and the contraband found in plain view during the course of that limited search was properly obtained under the Fourth Amendment and not subject to exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The Court of Appeal below reached a contrary conclusion, finding instead that \u201cthe scope of the officer\u2019s intrusion went beyond that justified by the need to locate registration [or other identifying] documents and accordingly, it was unreasonable as a search for registration [or other identifying] documents.\u201d In support of its view, the court asserted as follows: (1) \u201c[T]he problem with this search is that the officer testified that he first searched the area \u2018in control of the driver, which would be in the front area.\u2019 ... It was only when Officer Rowe positioned himself behind the bench seat that the pipe was visible\u201d; (2) \u201c[W]e cannot say that the scope of a search for registration or identification documents in the cab of a pickup reasonably extends to virtually all areas in the physical proximity of the driver\u201d; (3) \u201cThe officer did not testify that he was concerned for his personal safety and was searching for weapons\u201d; and (4) \u201cNor did [the officer] testify that the area below the driver\u2019s seat could even be reached by the driver with or without the rear seat in use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">With regard to the Court of Appeal\u2019s first point\u2014that Officer Rowe testified he was searching the area within the driver\u2019s control, \u201cwhich would be in the front area,\u201d but conducted that search from behind the driver\u2019s seat\u2014as we have explained above, the search was not improper merely because the officer elected to undertake it from behind the driver\u2019s seat rather than from in front of the driver\u2019s seat. Nor do we agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s implication that approving the search here at issue would condone searches for required documentation of \u201cvirtually all areas in the physical proximity of the driver.\u201d As explained above, the scope of such a search is circumscribed, being limited to places where such documentation reasonably could be expected to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Nor do the Court of Appeal\u2019s other two points support a contrary conclusion. It is insignificant that Officer Rowe failed to testify to any suspicion that the driver was armed, because the officer undertook the search in order to find required documentation. Pursuant to <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.Sd 411, and related cases, the limited search here at issue was justified on that basis alone.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Finally, the Court of Appeal\u2019s assertion that Officer Rowe did not testify that the area below the driver\u2019s seat could be reached is problematic as a factual matter on this record,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and in any event, as we explained <em>ante, </em>at pages 81-83, whether the searched area was or was not easily within reach of the driver while positioned in the driver\u2019s seat is a factor to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a limited search for documentation, but is not a dispositive factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Accordingly, we conclude in <em>Arturo D. </em>(S085213) that the trial court properly denied the suppression motion, and that the Court of Appeal erred in determining otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">B. <em>Hinger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Defendant Hinger asserts that the area underneath a front passenger seat is not a traditional repository of registration or identification documentation, and that pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s proposed test, the \u201centire car and all of its compartments\u201d might be subject to a Webster-type search for required documentation, in violation of the teaching of <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">As noted above, the dispositive question is not whether the area searched is a <em>traditional </em>repository for registration or identification documentation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Limited warrantless searches for required registration and identification documentation are permissible when, following the failure of a traffic offender to provide such documentation to the citing officer upon demand, the officer conducts a search for those documents in an area where such documents <em>reasonably may be expected to be found. </em>Under this standard, an officer may not search for such documents on pretext (cf. <em>Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106, 122, fn. * [106 S.Ct. 960, 970] (conc. opn. of Powell, J.) [\u201cAn officer may not use VIN inspection as a pretext for searching a vehicle for contraband or weapons\u201d]), or without first demanding that they be produced (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(C.D.Cal. 1979) 474 F.Supp. 943, 948-949 [search was unreasonable when officer never asked driver for such documentation and ignored plainly visible registration information posted in car window]), and an officer may not search in containers or locations in which such documents are not reasonably expected to be found.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid, </em>[search of crumpled fast-food bag under seat]; <em>State v.

We emphasize that the standard we reaffirm today circumscribes the scope of a <em>Webster </em>search for documents, and, contrary to defendant Hinger\u2019s assertion, does not threaten to condone the equivalent of the full-scale search for contraband prohibited by the high court in <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Defendant Hinger was unable to produce the required registration or license documents upon Officer Skinner\u2019s reasonable demand. Hinger appears to suggest that such documentation would not reasonably be expected to be found under a front passenger seat, but on the facts of this case Officer Skinner had reason to extend marginally his search for Hinger\u2019s wallet. As noted, the officer had seen Hinger look into the glove compartment (an area directly above the front passenger seat), and the officer reasonably might have thought that while Hinger was doing so, Hinger had managed to place the wallet under the front passenger seat. (Cf. <em>Mallet v. Bowersox, supra, </em>160 F.3d 456, 457 [driver hid his wallet and identification under the front seat as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>officer approached vehicle].) Moreover, the cases cited <em>ante, </em>at pages 80-81, in which wallets (which, we note, often contain a driver\u2019s license or other identification or documentation) were found under driver\u2019s seats, passenger seats, and \u201cfront seats\u201d generally, suggest that the area underneath front car seats (including front passenger seats) is not an unusual place to store such items.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">On these facts, and in view of the circumstance that Officer Skinner was preparing to issue a traffic citation and therefore needed to learn the true identity of the person to be cited, we believe it was reasonable for the officer to conduct a limited search of the glove compartment, the area underneath the driver\u2019s seat, and the area beneath the front passenger seat.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Miranda, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th 917, 927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Accordingly, we conclude in <em>People v.

(Stats. 1979, ch. 252, \u00a7 1, p. 543.) Even before the 1979 amendment, the statute had been construed to allow <em>any </em>peace officer\u2014not only members of the CHP\u2014to conduct limited and appropriate searches for registration documents in vehicles stopped or found stopped on roadways and highways. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 444, 447 [100 Cal.Rptr. 272] [approving limited search by police officer for registration documents during traffic stop]; <em>People v.

The legislative history of the 1979 amendment suggests that it was designed not to alter that construction or impair that authority, but merely to <em>expand </em>the scope of the statute to provide police officers and deputy sheriffs, assigned to investigate auto thefts, the authority to examine motor vehicles located in garages, repair shops, and automobile dismantlers\u2019 lots, etc. (See, e.g., Assem.

In sum, we find no indication in <em>Knowles </em>that the court intended to place in doubt any of these state or federal decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We note various problems presented by other possible options in this factual setting. Recognizing the right of a driver to <em>elect </em>between, on the one hand, submission to a limited search for documentation, and, on the other, being arrested and transported to the police station for booking, in most circumstances would subject the driver to considerably greater intrusion. Indeed, if the driver were arrested, in many instances the vehicle also would be impounded and would be subject to an inventory search (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 367, 373-375 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 12] [upholding inventory search of automobile properly impounded upon the defendant\u2019s arrest for driving without driver\u2019s license])\u2014 a result considerably more intrusive than the limited search here at issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Moreover, it might be argued that such a \u201cchoice\u201d would be inherently tainted as coercive. We believe that a court should be wary of imposing a rule that effectively would allow a Vehicle Code violator to require, by his or her own election, that police agencies expend the considerable time and resources necessary to undertake a full stationhouse booking (with possible towing, impounding, and inventorying of a vehicle). As the Court of Appeal below observed in <em>People v. Hinger, </em>\u201c[t]he direct approach\u201d contemplated by a Webster-type limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>search is \u201cmost logically calculated to get [the driver] on his way and the officer back to ferreting out more serious criminals in the least amount of time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">As the Attorney General observed in his briefs, subsequent to the <em>suppression hearing </em>(the ensuing ruling of which we review here), Arturo testified at the <em>jurisdictional </em>hearing that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>in fact gave the registration document to the officer. This testimony was not before the trial court at the time of the suppression hearing, and it is irrelevant to our inquiry now; in reviewing the trial court\u2019s suppression ruling, we consider only the evidence that was presented to the trial court at the time it ruled.

Once properly in that position, Officer Skinner also arguably was authorized to search the area near the glove compartment, including the area beneath the passenger seat.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b133-10\">WERDEGAR, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">The situation is a common one: A police officer stops a driver with the intention to issue a traffic citation for an infraction under state law. We address in this case the question whether an officer making such a stop may conduct a warrantless search of the driver\u2019s vehicle without violating the driver\u2019s right to be free of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has established several ground rules for warrantless vehicle searches: An officer may search a car if he or she is arresting the driver <em>(New York </em>v. <em>Belton </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 454 [101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768]), or if probable cause exists to believe the car contains evidence of a crime or contraband <em>(Maryland v. Dyson </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 465 [119 S.Ct. 2013, 144 L.Ed.2d 442] <em>(per </em>curiam); <em>Carroll v. United States </em>(1925) 267 U.S. 132, 153, 155-156 [45 S.Ct. 280, 285-286, 69 L.Ed. 543, 39 A.L.R. 790]); subject to certain conditions, police also may search a car to inventory its contents when they are impounding it <em>(South Dakota v. Opperman </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 364 [96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000]). It is unconstitutional, however, for a state, by statute, to authorize vehicle searches incident to a traffic citation when no arrest is made. <em>(Knowles v. Iowa </em>(1998) 525 U.S. 113 [119 S.Ct. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Unlike both the majority and dissent in this case, I find that whether an officer also may undertake some type of vehicle search when the driver stopped for a traffic infraction is unable to present a valid driver\u2019s license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12951, subd. (b))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or proof of registration as required by state law (\u00a7 4462, subd. (a))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are two different matters subject to different analyses and rules. As I explain, I concur in the majority\u2019s opinion insofar as it authorizes warrantless searches of \u201ctraditional repositories\u201d for proof of a driver\u2019s vehicle registration. I dissent, however, insofar as the majority holds that the space beneath the driver\u2019s seat is a traditional repository or an otherwise reasonable place to look for a registration document. I dissent also from the majority\u2019s holding that an officer constitutionally can search a vehicle for a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Section 2805, subdivision (a) provides that \u201c[f]or the purpose of locating stolen vehicles, [police] may inspect the title or registration of vehicles, in order to establish the rightful ownership or possession of the vehicle.\u201d (See also \u00a7\u00a7 4000, subd. (a) [illegal to drive a vehicle unless it has been registered], 4454, subd. (a) [owners must maintain registration card with the vehicle].) Section 2805 thus reflects a legislative intent to permit police officers to determine whether the driver is the rightful owner of a vehicle or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>alternatively, whether the vehicle has been stolen. Permitting police to conduct a limited search of the traditional locations within a vehicle where drivers normally keep registration documents is consistent with the high court\u2019s decision in New <em>York v. Class </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 106 [106 S.Ct. 960, 89 L.Ed.2d 81], where the court held the overwhelming importance of vehicle identification numbers (VIN\u2019s) in the scheme for identifying vehicles on the road justified the minor intrusion in that case. We so held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273], noting the officer in that case limited his search \u201cto the visor and glove compartment, traditional repositories of auto registration.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">I agree the glove compartment and visor (and, in days past, the steering column) are traditional repositories for vehicle registration documentation, and an officer, faced with a driver who does not produce the required registration, is permitted under the United States Constitution to conduct a limited search of those locations in an attempt to obtain such information. The small intrusion caused by such limited searches is not much different from that occasioned by the VIN search approved by the high court in <em>New York v. Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. 106. Were that the extent of the majority\u2019s rule, I would concur without comment. But nothing in either <em>New York v. Class </em>or <em>People </em>v. <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 411, authorizes police to conduct a warrantless search for a vehicle\u2019s registration documents outside these limited areas. As the dissent explains, failure to place limits on such searches runs the risk of obliterating the rule requiring that exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement be narrow and well delineated. To the extent the majority holds that the space beneath the driver\u2019s seat <em>{Arturo D.) </em>as well as under the front passenger seat <em>{Hinger) </em>are locations in which a person normally or traditionally keeps his or her auto registration or, indeed, are places where the registration might reasonably be expected to be found, I disagree; I therefore conclude the officers in question were not authorized to search in those locations without probable cause to believe they would discover contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s conflation of registration documentation and a driver\u2019s license as \u201cregulatory documentation\u201d (e.g., maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 76, 79), a driver\u2019s license differs from a vehicle registration document and requires a different analysis. A driver is required by law to carry a valid driver\u2019s license (\u00a7 12951, subd. (a)) and to present it to a police officer upon demand <em>{id., </em>subd. (b)). Failure to do so is an infraction. (\u00a7 40303.5.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But nothing\u2014not the Constitution, nor any statute, nor the cases cited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>majority\u2014authorizes police to conduct a warrantless vehicle search in an attempt to discover the license of a driver who asserts he or she does not have it in the car. Nor does common sense support the majority\u2019s analysis. Drivers\u2019 licenses of themselves, unlike registration papers, are <em>not </em>traditionally placed on visors or in glove compartments, much less under seats. The most \u201ctraditional repository\u201d of a driver\u2019s license is an individual\u2019s wallet, usually worn on his person if a man, or carried in her purse if a woman. Given this fact, consistency would require the majority likewise to sanction a patdown search of a male driver, or a search of a female driver\u2019s purse, to search for his or her wallet and, finding a wallet in either place, would further authorize the officer to open and inspect its contents. Clearly this is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Nor does any asserted need to identify the driver support the majority\u2019s rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By what logic would a police officer believe that searching a vehicle for a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license would be fruitful when the driver has just informed the officer that he does not have a license in his possession? In neither case before the court, nor in any case of which I am aware, did the officer\u2019s search yield the license the driver declared he was without. (Cf. <em>People v. Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 431 [where this court observed that the officer who searched the vehicle for registration papers \u201chad every reason to believe that the occupants, who disclaimed ownership, would not be able to find or produce the registration on their own\u201d]; accord, <em>People v. Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 182 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521].) Is it reasonable to believe that a driver\u2014just stopped by police for violating a traffic law\u2014has actually secreted his driver\u2019s license somewhere in the car and prefers to deny its presence and risk arrest rather than produce it and hope for release pursuant to a traffic citation? The majority\u2019s assertion that taking the driver at his word and therefore subjecting him to arrest with its attendant inconveniences would subject the driver to \u201cconsiderably greater intrusion\u201d than would the search the majority authorizes, and that such a search is \u201c \u2018most logically calculated to get [the driver] on his way and the officer back to ferreting out more serious criminals in the least amount of time\u2019 \u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 77, fn. 17), is patently fallacious\u2014unless, of course, the majority is speaking only of forgetful drivers who have their licenses, but have forgotten that they do. More realistically, if a law-abiding driver has proper identification he will produce it; if, on the other hand, as in the cases before us, the driver states he lacks the requested license, either he in fact does lack it or the information is in some way incriminating. But that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>criminals stopped for traffic infractions might occasionally lie about having a license in their possession is insufficient reason to carve out, as the majority does, a blanket exception to the warrant requirement to authorize police officers to conduct warrantless vehicle searches in all cases where stopped drivers profess to be without their licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The purpose of requiring a driver to present a license is to assure a citation is not being issued to a \u201c \u2018phantom.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 87, fn. 27.) If the driver fails to produce a license, the officer has several choices: run the driver\u2019s name on the computer in an attempt to determine his or her true identity (as the officer did in <em>Hinger </em>via his police radio), ask the driver to submit a thumbprint (\u00a7 40500, subd. (a)), accept other evidence of identification (\u00a7 40302, subd. (a)), or arrest the driver (ibid.; see <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Iowa, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 118 [119 S.Ct. at p. 488]). All these options address the concern that the officer know to whom he or she is issuing the traffic citation, thereby providing some guarantee the infractor will appear in court or pay the required fine. No court has ever sanctioned the alternative the majority endorses here: searching the driver\u2019s vehicle (and by logical implication, the driver\u2019s person) for the missing driver\u2019s license. To the extent the majority endorses such warrantless searches, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Vehicle Code section 12951, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cThe driver of a motor vehicle shall present his or her license for examination upon demand of a peace officer . . .

Today, the majority\u2019s unprecedented decision creates a new exception allowing warrantless vehicle searches when a motorist stopped for a minor traffic violation cannot produce either a driver\u2019s license or the vehicle\u2019s registration. This holding flies in the face of <em>Knowles v. Iowa </em>(1998) 525 U.S. 113 [119 S.Ct. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492], in which a unanimous United States Supreme Court refused to except from the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement a vehicle search incident to citing or ticketing the driver for a traffic offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The majority insists such warrantless searches are \u201climited\u201d to areas within a car where identification documentation might reasonably be found. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 65.) Yet the facts of the two cases here suggest otherwise. In one case the officer reached behind and under a truck\u2019s bench seat, and in the other the officer searched underneath the front passenger seat. The majority would go even further. It favors warrantless trunk searches for documentation when the officer has \u201cspecific information\u201d that those documents \u201creasonably may be\u201d found in the trunk. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 86, fn. 25.) The majority\u2019s new rule may well result in limitless searches throughout a vehicle whenever a driver cannot produce the requisite documentation. Because the scope of these warrantless searches weakens the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection \u201cagainst unreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">After granting review in these two cases, this court consolidated them to decide the validity of warrantless police searches of vehicles during routine traffic stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A. <em>In re Arturo D.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Minor Arturo D. moved to suppress evidence seized during a search of the extended cab pickup truck he was driving on August 26, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Suisun City Police Officer Michael Rowe testified at the suppression hearing that while patrolling Highway 12 he stopped Arturo for speeding. When Officer Rowe asked Arturo for his driver\u2019s license, Arturo said he did not have one, but he gave his full name, date of birth, and home address. Officer Rowe stated on direct examination that Arturo did <em>not </em>produce the registration for the truck. But on cross-examination, Rowe was not so sure, saying he could not recall whether Arturo had given him the truck\u2019s registration, but that Arturo \u201cmight have.\u201d Rowe remembered, however, that Arturo said the pickup truck did not belong to him. Rowe never suggested at the suppression hearing that he ever suspected the truck was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u201cJust to confirm that there was no identification on [Arturo] or in his vehicle,\u201d Officer Rowe did a patdown search of Arturo, after which he searched the truck. Initially, Rowe reached in through the driver\u2019s door and ran his hand under the front area of the driver\u2019s seat, but finding nothing there he leaned into the area behind the driver\u2019s seat and looked under that seat. There, Rowe saw a glass smoking pipe and a small blue box, which upon further examination proved to contain traces of a white powdery substance. Believing that the amount of the substance was \u201cunusable,\u201d Rowe intended only to cite Arturo for speeding and for driving without a license. Rowe explained that because Arturo was an <em>unlicensed </em>driver, Rowe could not release the truck to him, but had to have it towed. Arturo agreed to go with Rowe to the police station to telephone someone who could pick him up. At the station, Officer Rowe took a closer look at the seized blue box and uncovered a false bottom concealing a plastic baggie containing a usable quantity of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">In contending that the search of the truck did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the prosecution stated it was not seeking to justify the search as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>being \u201cincident to the arrest\u201d of Arturo, who was not under arrest at the time of the search of the truck. Rather, the prosecutor sought to uphold the search on the ground that Officer Rowe could properly search the truck for Arturo\u2019s identification and the truck\u2019s registration. The trial court agreed and denied Arturo\u2019s suppression motion. On Arturo\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">B. <em>People v. Hinger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Defendant Randall Hinger moved to suppress a wallet and its contents seized during a warrantless search of his car. At the suppression hearing, Officer Robert Skinner of the City of Orange Police Department testified that on August 20, 1997, he stopped Hinger for making an unsafe lane change. Hinger told the officer he did not have his driver\u2019s license with him and did not have registration documentation for the car, which he was \u201cin the process of purchasing.\u201d Hinger gave the officer his name. Officer Skinner then contacted police dispatch personnel to ascertain whether Randall Hinger was a licensed driver and whether Hinger or someone else was the car\u2019s registered owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">While awaiting that information, Officer Skinner asked Hinger, who had stepped out of the car, for permission to search the car. When Hinger refused to give consent, Officer Skinner said he would search anyway to look for registration and identification. Hinger replied that his wallet might be in the glove compartment, which was ajar. Officer Skinner opened the passenger door and reached into the glove compartment, but found no wallet, no identification, and no registration. Skinner then went to the driver\u2019s side of the car, opened the door, and looked under the driver\u2019s seat. Finding nothing, he returned to the passenger side, looked under the front seat, and saw a wallet. Inside the wallet were a check-cashing card bearing Hinger\u2019s picture and a clear plastic baggie containing a white powdery substance resembling methamphetamine. Officer Skinner confirmed at the suppression hearing that Hinger was <em>not under arrest </em>until Skinner retrieved the wallet, opened it, and found the plastic baggie.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">At the hearing, the prosecution argued that when a motorist stopped for a traffic infraction cannot produce a driver\u2019s license or car registration, an officer is entitled \u201cto look for identification and registration anywhere inside that vehicle.\u201d The trial court agreed, and denied Hinger\u2019s suppression motion. That ruling was upheld on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches or seizures\u201d by the police.

Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement is inadmissible at trial. <em>(Mapp v. Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643, 655 [81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691-1692, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 84 A.L.R.2d 933].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Today, the majority holds that whenever a police officer detains a motorist for a traffic infraction and the motorist fails to produce a driver\u2019s license or car registration, the officer may search those areas of the vehicle where such documentation \u201creasonably may be expected to be found.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 65.) This holding does not fit any of the narrow and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement that the United States Supreme Court has recognized. Worse still, it directly conflicts with the high court\u2019s unanimous decision in <em>Knowles v. Iowa, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113 <em>(Knowles).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Knowles </em>concerned the validity of a search conducted under an Iowa statute allowing a police officer with \u201ccause to believe\u201d that a motorist had committed a traffic violation either to make an arrest and \u201cimmediately take the person before a magistrate,\u201d or to \u201cissu[e] a citation in lieu of arrest.\u201d <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 115 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 486-487].) Iowa law further provided that the officer\u2019s decision to issue a citation instead of arresting the traffic offender did \u201c \u2018not affect the officer\u2019s authority to conduct an otherwise lawful search.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The officer who had cited Knowles for speeding searched the car and found \u201ca bag of marijuana and a \u2018pot pipe\u2019 \u201d under the driver\u2019s seat. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 114 [119 S.Ct. at p. 486].) The trial court, relying on the Iowa statute allowing a search incident to citation, denied Knowles\u2019s suppression motion. The Iowa Supreme Court upheld the search, reasoning that \u201cso long as the arresting officer had <em>probable cause to make a custodial arrest, </em>there need not in fact have been a custodial arrest\u201d before the officer could search the car. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 115-116 [119 S.Ct. at p. 487], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the search of Knowles\u2019s car fit an exception to the warrant requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>similar to the one allowing a search of <em>a person </em>incident to arrest <em>(United States v. Robinson, supra, </em>414 U.S. at pp. 234-235 [94 S.Ct. at pp. 476-477]), or a search of <em>a car\u2019s interior area </em>incident to arresting its driver <em>(New York </em>v. <em>Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 460 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2864]). The court noted the \u201chistorical rationales\u201d underlying the search-incident-to-arrest exceptions: (1) the need <em>to disarm </em>the person to be taken into custody, and (2) the need <em>to preserve evidence. (Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 116 [119 S.Ct. at p. 487].) Neither, the court observed, is present when an officer searches a car incident to citing a person for a traffic violation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 117 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 487-488].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The high court noted that the \u201cthreat to officer safety from issuing a traffic citation\u201d where the suspect is not being transported is \u201ca good deal less than in the case of a custodial arrest.\u201d <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 117 [119 S.Ct. at p. 487].) Officers conducting routine traffic stops have \u201cother, independent bases to search for weapons and protect themselves from danger,\u201d such as ordering the driver and any passengers out of the car, performing a \u201c \u2018patdown\u2019 of a driver and any passengers upon reasonable suspicion that they may be armed and dangerous,\u201d and conducting a limited search inside the car \u201cupon reasonable suspicion that an occupant is dangerous and may gain immediate control of a weapon.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 117-118 [119 S.Ct. at p. 488].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Turning to the second historical justification for the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the warrant requirement\u2014the need to discover and preserve evidence\u2014the court observed that \u201c[o]nce Knowles was stopped for speeding and issued a citation, all the evidence necessary to prosecute that offense had been obtained.\u201d <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S at p. 118 [119 S.Ct. at p. 488].) \u201cNo further evidence of excessive speed was going to be found either on the person of the offender or in the passenger compartment of the car.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In sum, because in the case of a traffic citation \u201cthe concern for officer safety is not present to the same extent [as with an arrest] and the concern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at all,\u201d the United States Supreme Court invalidated the search of Knowles\u2019s car incident to a citation for speeding. <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 119 [119 S.Ct. at p. 488].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Unlike Iowa\u2019s statutory scheme that was before the high court in <em>Knowles, </em>no California statute authorizes a police officer to <em>search </em>a car incident to a traffic citation. California\u2019s statutory law is similar to Iowa\u2019s, however, in granting police in most cases involving minor traffic offenses the discretion either to cite or arrest the driver. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 40302, 40500.) And our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>statutory scheme requires a driver to carry a driver\u2019s license and to have the car\u2019s registration in the car. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4462, subd. (a), 12951.) The failure to produce either upon the request of an officer is an infraction. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40000.1; <em>People v. Superior Court [Simon] </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 186, 193-195 [101 Cal.Rptr. 837, 496 P.2d 1205].)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Today, the majority holds that when an officer detains a driver for a suspected traffic offense and the driver fails to produce a driver\u2019s license or the vehicle\u2019s registration, the officer, even though not intending to arrest the driver either for the traffic offense or for the failure to produce the required documentation, can nonetheless conduct a \u201climited warrantless search[]\u201d for these documents \u201cwithin a vehicle.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 65.) In doing so, the majority writes into California law essentially the same search-incident-to-citation authority that Iowa created by statute and that the United States Supreme Court rejected in <em>Knowles, supra, 525 </em>U.S. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">There, in responding to Iowa\u2019s argument that car searches incident to issuing traffic citations could be justified because drivers \u201cmay attempt to hide or destroy\u201d evidence of identity such as \u201ca driver\u2019s license or vehicle registration,\u201d the high court pointed out that \u201cif a police officer is not satisfied with the identification furnished by the driver, this may be a basis for <em>arresting him </em>rather than merely issuing a citation.\u201d <em>(Knowles, supra, 525 </em>U.S. at p. 118 [119 S.Ct. at p. 487], italics added.) That option was available here too. That an arrest may require the expenditure of \u201cconsiderable time and resources necessary to undertake a full stationhouse booking (with possible towing, impounding, and inventorying of a vehicle)\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 76, fn. 17) is irrelevant under <em>Knowles, </em>given its observation that an officer dissatisfied with a driver\u2019s proffered identification may arrest rather than merely cite the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In trying to distinguish this case from <em>Knowles, supra, 525 </em>U.S. 113, the majority points out that the blanket rule it adopts today would authorize only a <em>limited </em>search for a driver\u2019s license or vehicle registration in those areas of a car where such documents \u201creasonably may be expected to be found.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 65, italics added.) But the car searches here were far from \u201climited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">With regard to the search of Arturo\u2019s extended cab truck, Officer Rowe first looked under the front area of driver\u2019s seat. Not finding identification documentation, he then leaned into the area behind the driver\u2019s seat and reached underneath, finding a small blue box with a substance later determined to be methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">With respect to the search of Hinger\u2019s car, Officer Skinner first searched the glove compartment; then he looked under the driver\u2019s seat; and finally he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>reached under the passenger seat where he found the wallet containing Hinger\u2019s identification and the methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The majority describes each of these two warrantless vehicle searches incident to traffic stops as \u201climited\u201d and thus proper. But such a search is no less broad than the full car search that the high court invalidated in <em>Knowles </em>where, after citing the driver for speeding, the officer searched under the driver\u2019s seat and found \u201ca bag of marijuana and a \u2018pot pipe.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 114 [119 S.Ct. at p. 486].) The majority would also permit a warrantless trunk search for identification and registration documentation when the officer has \u201cspecific information\u201d that those documents \u201creasonably may be\u201d found in the trunk. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 86, fn. 25.) In this instance, too, the scope of such a search goes far beyond the search that the United States Supreme Court rejected in <em>Knowles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In yet another futile effort to distinguish its holding from the type of search prohibited in <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113, the majority stresses that <em>Knowles </em>involved a warrantless search \u201cfor contraband <em>following </em>the issuance of a traffic citation,\u201d whereas here the warrantless searches were for \u201cregulatory documentation, <em>prior </em>to issuing a traffic citation.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 76, italics in maj. opn.) Why should this distinction matter at all? A search incident to a routine traffic stop when an officer has yet to decide either to arrest or merely cite a driver has even less justification than the search invalidated in <em>Knowles </em>conducted after the officer had cited the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Nor should it matter, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion at page 76, <em>ante, </em>that the search in <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113, was for \u201ccontraband\u201d whereas here the searches were for \u201cregulatory documentation.\u201d Invalidating the search in <em>Knowles, </em>the high court expressly rejected Iowa\u2019s contention that a blanket rule allowing car searches incident to traffic citations would be justified because drivers might conceal their \u201c \u2018license[s] or vehicle registration[s].\u2019 \u201d (See <em>ante, </em>p. 75, quoting <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 118 [119 S.Ct. at p. 488].)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Ultimately the majority rests its holding on <em>People </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273] <em>(Webster), </em>which this court decided seven years before <em>Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113. In <em>Webster, </em>four justices of this court signed the majority opinion that affirmed a judgment of death. I concurred in the judgment and wrote separately on an issue unrelated to the Fourth Amendment. (See <em>Webster, supra, </em>at pp. 468-470 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In <em>Webster, </em>an officer stopped the defendant for speeding. The defendant denied owning the car, claiming it belonged to someone in the backseat, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>then said that all five of his passengers were hitchhikers. A radio check revealed that the defendant had an outstanding warrant, and the officer <em>arrested </em>him. When the officer asked the passengers who owned the car, all five \u201cshrugged or shook their heads.\u201d <em>(Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 429.) The officer then looked in the car\u2019s \u201cglove compartment and visor for registration papers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Given the totality of circumstances known to the officer in <em>Webster, </em>he was amply justified in searching the car for registration. All six of the car\u2019s occupants, including the driver, had denied that it was their car, and the officer had arrested the driver on an outstanding warrant, a fact that standing alone gave the officer cause to make an incidental search of the car\u2019s passenger compartment: \u201c[Wjhen a policeman has made a lawful custodial <em>arrest </em>of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d (N<em>ew York v. Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 460 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2864], italics added, fn. omitted; see also <em>United States v. Gonzalez </em>(11th Cir. 1996) 71 F.3d 819, 826 [applying the <em>Belton </em>rule to uphold the search of a car\u2019s glove compartment incident to its driver\u2019s arrest on a warrant].)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The majority, however, seizes upon this sentence in <em>Webster: \u201cWithin constitutional limits, </em>such statutes [requiring drivers to carry licenses and vehicle registration in a car] authorize an officer to enter a stopped vehicle and conduct an immediate warrantless search for the required documents.\u201d <em>{Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 430, italics added.) The majority reads far too much into this isolated sentence from <em>Webster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">As the qualifying phrase \u201c[w]ithin constitutional limits\u201d suggests, <em>Webster </em>recognized that an officer\u2019s mere desire to secure license or registration documents from a motorist would be insufficient by itself to qualify as an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. <em>(Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 430.) And when read in the context of the facts of that case, the sentence stands for this unremarkable proposition: When an officer has <em>arrested </em>a car\u2019s driver and is determining whether to impound the car or release it to one of its passengers, and no occupant of the car claims to know who owns the car, the officer is justified to search for evidence of ownership in the \u201cglove compartment and visor\u201d of what apparently is an abandoned car. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 429.) The <em>Webster </em>language at issue does not support the majority\u2019s far broader rule that whenever a traffic violator cannot produce either a driver\u2019s license or car registration, the officer, without making an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>arrest, can conduct a full search of the car for identifying documentation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, such a rule is contrary to <em>Knowles, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court refused to authorize warrantless vehicle searches when the driver has \u201cmerely\u201d been cited but not arrested. <em>(Knowles, supra, </em>525 U.S. at pp. 118-119 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 488-489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Unlike the majority, I would not adopt a blanket rule permitting police to make a warrantless search of a car for identification documentation or vehicle registration anytime a driver cannot produce these documents. Instead, I would evaluate car searches by applying established law, which permits a warrantless search of a car only if it falls within one of the \u201cnarrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement\u201d specified by the United States Supreme Court. <em>(Flippo </em>v. <em>West Virginia, supra, </em>528 U.S. at p. 13 [120 S.Ct. at p. 8].) Among these exceptions is the rule permitting police officers to search a car when they have probable cause to believe it contains contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>(Maryland </em>v. <em>Dyson, supra, </em>527 U.S. at p. 466 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 2013-2014].) Probable cause is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, applying a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arvizu </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 266, 273 [122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740]; <em>United States v. Sokolow </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 1, 8 [109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585-1586, 104 L.Ed.2d 1].) This standard takes into account an officer\u2019s common sense and experience to determine whether there is \u201ca fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.\u201d <em>(Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 213, 238 [103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527].) Here, the prosecution failed to justify the searches on this or any other well-delineated exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In each case, the officer stopped the driver for a traffic infraction. Arturo D. admitted he was an unlicensed driver, but he gave the officer his name, address, and birth date. With respect to Hinger, he could not produce either his driver\u2019s license or the car\u2019s registration, but he told the officer his name and said he was in the process of buying the car. The officer then placed a radio call to police dispatch personnel to verify Hinger\u2019s identity and to ascertain whether he owned the car. In each case, had the officer been dissatisfied with the proof of identity offered, he could have arrested the driver (see Veh. Code, \u00a7 40302, subd. (a)) and, incident to such an arrest, could have searched the vehicle\u2019s interior <em>(New York </em>v. <em>Belton, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 460 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2864]). In each case, however, the officer testified at the suppression hearing that at the time he undertook the vehicle search, <em>he had no intent to arrest the driver. </em>Furthermore, in each case the prosecution sought to justify the search on the single ground that whenever a driver cannot produce statutorily required documentation, the officer has the right to search for it inside the car. The prosecution neither advanced nor developed a record to support any other theory. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 126, 137-138 [219 Cal.Rptr. 186, 707 P.2d 248] [on issues of search and seizure, prosecution is generally precluded from advancing new theory on appeal].) Under these circumstances, the prosecution failed to carry its burden of establishing probable cause or some other exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement for each search, and the suppression motions in both cases should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Who among us can ever forget the horrendous events of September 11, 2001, when our nation suffered the most destructive terrorist assault in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>history? As this opinion is being written, our nation is undergoing a painful recovery from the devastating physical and psychological effects of that day. One part of this recovery process has been an effort to devise and implement more effective methods of law enforcement to protect the security of our citizens and our institutions. Another and equally important part of this process must be a rediscovery of and rededication to the principles upon which our nation was founded and which have made it a true beacon of liberty throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">One principle, so basic to our personal liberty, is the prohibition that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution places on unreasonable searches and seizures. In determining whether a search is \u201cunreasonable,\u201d a court must adhere to the decisions of the United States Supreme Court articulating the meaning of that word in a similar case. Virtually identical to the two cases here is the high court\u2019s unanimous decision in <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Iowa, supra, </em>525 U.S. 113. There, the court held that when a police officer has stopped a motorist for a routine traffic violation, and the officer has not arrested the motorist, the officer may not rummage through the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Today\u2019s majority decision does nothing to enhance our security and does much to erode our Fourth Amendment rights. Under California law, an officer making a routine stop for a traffic violation may arrest a motorist who fails to produce proof of identity and, within the limitations of the Fourth Amendment, may search the vehicle incident to the arrest. Given this ability, there is no justification for the warrantless, nonconsensual search of a car\u2019s interior when the officer has made <em>no </em>arrest and the officer lacks probable cause to believe that the car contains contraband. In announcing a blanket rule authorizing such searches, the majority disregards the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Knowles </em>and chips away at one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by our federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Nor does <em>Webster, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at page 431, support a narrower rule, urged by the concurring and dissenting opinion, allowing a warrantless search for a car\u2019s registration documents (but not the driver\u2019s license) in \u201cthe glove compartment and visor,\u201d which the opinion describes as \u201ctraditional locations within a vehicle where drivers normally keep registration documents.\u201d (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Werdegar, J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 89.) The search for registration documents was justified in <em>Webster </em>only because all six of the car\u2019s occupants claimed not to know who owned the car, an uncommon situation, not present here, that negated the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The concurring and dissenting opinion also relies on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s five-to-four decision in <em>New York v. Class </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 106 [106 S.Ct. 960, 89 L.Ed.2d 81] <em>(Class) </em>upholding a limited warrantless vehicle search that the concurring and dissenting opinion claims is \u201cnot much different\u201d from the search at issue here. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Werdegar, J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 89.) Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In <em>Class, </em>an officer looking for the vehicle identification number (VIN) of a car that had been stopped for a traffic violation, and not finding it on the left doorjamb, moved some papers on the dashboard that covered the VIN. In upholding this search, the high court noted \u201cthe lack of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the VIN\u201d because federal law required that the VIN be displayed either on the left doorjamb (for cars built before 1969) or on a part of the dashboard visible through the windshield (for cars built later). <em>(Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 119 [106 S.Ct. at p. 968].) Here, by contrast, no federal law (or state law either) requires that registration documents be kept behind the visor or in the glove compartment, and thus California drivers have not relinquished their expectations of privacy in these locations. The high court in <em>Class </em>also stressed that the officer in that case \u201cdid not root about the interior\u201d and \u201cdid not reach into any compartments.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 118 [106 S.Ct. at p. 968].) Here, however, the concurring and dissenting opinion would authorize officers searching for registration documents to enter a car, to reach behind the visor and into the glove compartment, and to inspect any documents they might find in those locations, an invasion considerably more extensive than that approved in <em>Class.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The concurring and dissenting opinion construes Vehicle Code section 2805, subdivision (a), which states that police may \u201cinspect the title or registration of vehicles, in order to establish . . . rightful ownership,\u201d as authorizing vehicle searches for those documents behind the visor and in the glove compartment. (See conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Werdegar, J., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 88-89.) I disagree with that interpretation. By its terms, the statute only permits an officer to <em>inspect </em>the documents, not to conduct a warrantless <em>search </em>for them. Warrantless searches of a car\u2019s interior are not only unauthorized, but also unnecessary. From outside a car, an officer may see the VIN on the dashboard of any car made since 1969, and from the VIN the officer may readily determine the car\u2019s ownership and registration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
