Civ. Stats. Ann.) and (b) validity of a given statutory amendment (Sec. 1-a of Art. 1434a, Vernon\u2019s Tex. Civ. Stats. Ann.) as against our constitutional restrictions concerning subjects and captions of legislative acts (Art. Ill, Sec. 35) and local or special laws (Art. Ill, Sec. 56), Vernon\u2019s Ann. State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The source of the controversy is the proposed construction by the Guadalupe River Authority of the so-called Canyon Dam in Comal County, a flood control project to be financed in whole or part by the United States. Evidently the corresponding federal laws and regulations permit of municipalities such as the respondent City participating in the project in order to augment their own water supply by building the dam higher than it would otherwise be and furnishing the necessary funds for this purpose. This participation, however, is in effect conditioned upon permission from the petitioner Board for the taking of the additional impounded waters in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">The respondent City, one of the three largest in Texas, is faced with a serious water-supply problem by reason of a large and rapid increase in population and water consumption within and around its corporate limits, coupled with a serious fall in its potential underground water supply. While the City is located outside of the natural watershed of the Guadalupe River and could make use of the Canyon Dam waters only by means of an expensive pipe line, it has become interested in the dam project, as other cities of the state have done in other and comparable situations, to the point of making detailed studies and attempting to secure priorities for a portion of the excess waters it might make or help to make available if it should participate in the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In the latter connection, Art. 7496, Vernon\u2019s Tex. Civ. Stats. Ann., provides, generally speaking, for an application or \u201cpresentation\u201d to the Board by \u201cany person who desires to investigate the feasibility of any water appropriation or use of water\u201d in certain large quantities, upon approval and filing of which by the Board, the study may be made and a priority for the corresponding work and water appropriation established as of the filing date, subject to specified conditions as to beginning and completion of the work. The respondent City made such a presentation, but the Board refused to approve or file it, stating in effect that it would have approved and filed it as a proper and meritorious application under the statute, but for the single fact of the City being located beyond the natural watershed of the river and thus prohibited from diverting the waters by the express terms of Sec. 1-a of Art. 1434a, supra.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The respondent City thereupon instituted this suit for de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>claratory judgment that Sec. 1-a is unconstitutional. Its pleadings did not specifically allege arbitrariness upon the part of the Board nor specifically pray for ancillary relief such as mandatory injunction or mandamus. They did clearly allege the above-mentioned facts concerning the attempted filing of the respondent\u2019s presentation, including the Board\u2019s exclusive reliance on Sec. 1-a for its refusal to approve and file. Parts of the relief prayed were (1) a determination \u201cthat the plaintiff has the legal right to have the presentation - - accepted and filed - - with priority\u201d and (2) \u201cother relief, general and special.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\">The trial court rendered the declaratory judgment as prayed. Following this the petitioner Board, pending its appeal, proceeded to file the respondent\u2019s presentation but with the express reservation that such filing was conditioned upon affirmance of the trial court judgment. The Austin Court of Civil Appeals has affirmed it. 273 S.W. 2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">No point appears to be made that the case is moot or otherwise non justiciable merely by reason of the actual filing of the application, and we think the conditional character of the Board\u2019s approval would have rendered such a view untenable had it been urged. But lack of a justiciable controversy is argued, as we understand the briefs, on the theory that the respondent\u2019s failure to allege an abuse of discretion or arbitrariness concedes a discretion of the Board to treat Art. 1434a, Sec. 1-a, supra, as valid in the absence of a contrary adjudication, and therefore also the discretion to refuse approval and filing of the respondent\u2019s application. This alleged concession is said to make the suit one for a mere \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d as to the constitutionality of the statute in question. We do not so regard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The expressions \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d and \u201cjusticiable controversy\u201d as here used refer to the requirements, which undoubtedly exist as prerequisite to the declaratory judgment process, that (a) there shall be a real controversy between the parties, which (b) will be actually determined by the judicial declaration sought. See Hodges, General Survey of the Uniform Dec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>laratory Judgment Act in Texas, Vol. 8, Vernon\u2019s Tex. Civ. Stats. Ann., p. XI (1951) ; also Sec. 6, Art. 2524-1, supra; Cobb v. Harrington, 144 Texas 360, 190 S.W. 2d 709, 172 A.L.R. 837; Railroad Commission v. Houston Natural Gas Corp., (Tex. Civ. App., cited in Cobb v. Harrington) 186 S.W. 2d 117; Garwood Irr. Co. v. Lundquist (Tex. Civ. App.), 252 S.W. 2d 759; wr. of er. refused; McDonald; Texas Civil Practice, Vol. 1, Sec. 2.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\">But to admit the legal fact, if it is a fact, that the petitioner Board may properly await the judgment of a court before ignoring the prohibition of Sec. 1-a, supra, is not to admit that there is no dispute over whether the Board has the ultimate duty to cease refusing to approve and file the respondent\u2019s application and whether the respondent has the present right, which it expressly pleaded and prayed to have declared, that such approval be given and filing accepted. If it were otherwise, there would rarely be a proper case for declaratory judgment concerning the validity of a statute, because there will be very few statutes which are not <em>presumptively </em>valid. That Sec. 1-a is presumptively valid is all that the respondent has admitted, if admitting anything. The controversy is as to whether it is <em>actually </em>valid. Clearly this is a real and practical controversy, because the respondent insists on its application being approved and filed despite the statute, on which the Board relies, and asserts valuable rights of a property nature to be effective or ineffective depending upon such approval and filing. Clearly, too, the judicial declaration in suit will determine the controversy, because the Board will approve and file the City\u2019s application if the statute is declared invalid and will properly continue to refuse to do so if it is declared valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Nor is there merit to the apparently further contention that a justiciable controversy is absent because of the failure of the respondent to pray specifically for other than declaratory relief. Even assuming the actual prayer for \u201cother relief, general and special\u201d to be without significance, the argument is yet in the very teeth of Secs. 1 and 8 of Art. 2524-1, supra, and, indeed, of the main purpose of declaratory judgments, which is to permit of settling- actual controversies by appropriate judicial declaration, without necessarily invoking \u201ctraditional relief,\u201d such as injunction or other writs, damages and the like. Indeed, it has been observed that some of the \u201ctraditional remedies,\u201d such as decrees removing a cloud or cancelling an instrument, are themselves but declaratory judgments, despite that their names may suggest otherwise. See Hodges, supra, p. VII. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The lack of a prayer for traditional types of relief does not of itself even suggest absence of the essential requirements of a real controversy, determinable by the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">The real issue in the case is whether Sec. 1-a, supra<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is void because of Art. Ill, Sec. 35 of our State Constitution, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">\u201cNo bill---shall contain more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title. But if any subject shall be embraced in an act, which shall not be expressed in the title, such act shall be void only as to so much thereof, as shall not be so expressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Well prior to the existence of Sec. 1-a, the bulk of the present Art. 1434a was enacted as Senate Bill No. 103, Chapter 76, p. 202, Acts of the First Called Session, 43rd Legislature (1933). The object of the Act, expressed in its first section, was to provide for the formation of corporations by three or more citizens of the State \u201cfor the purpose of furnishing a water supply to towns, cities, and private corporations and individuals.\u201d Sec. 1 of the Act also detailed sundry provisions concerning dividends, sinking fund for replacements and the like as properly includible in the charter. Sec. 2 of the Act authorized such corporations as might be organized under the Act to contract with all federal agencies, borrow money, issue bonds and do other such things for the promotion of their corporate purposes. The remaining six sections provided for additional specific powers and duties of such corporations, more or less in elaboration of Sections 1 and 2. In no part of the Act does a word such as \u201criver,\u201d \u201cstream,\u201d \u201cwatercourse,\u201d \u201cwatershed,\u201d \u201cdam\u201d or \u201clake\u201d occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Sec. 1-a was enacted in 1941 as part, although a large part, of a purported amendment to Sections 1 and 2 of the 1933 Act above mentioned by House Bill 953, Chap. 407, Acts 47th Legislature, Regular Session. The caption of the Amendatory Act read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">\u201cAn Act amending Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 76, Senate Bill No. 103, page 202, General and Special Laws, passed at the First Called Session of the Forty-third Legislature; and declaring an emergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The body of the Act declared Sec. 1 of the earlier Act to be \u201camended so as to read as follows.\u201d Then followed \u201cSection 1,\u201d in terms identical with the original Sec. 1 except for the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>sertion of a few words giving these corporations the additional powers to supply \u201csewer service\u201d and to serve \u201cmilitary camps and bases.\u201d Then as a distinct paragraph, although without any separate enacting clause, came \u201cSection 1-a\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, which was completely new. Then followed an enacting clause re-enacting \u201cSection 2\u201d with addition of merely a few words so as expressly to permit corporate borrowings from sources in addition to federal agencies. The next provision, or emergency clause, referred only to the need of \u201cthe additional <em>powers </em>hereby conferred upon water supply corporations authorized by said Chapter 76\u201d (emphasis ours) as the emergency, thus omitting any reference to the subject matter of Sec. 1-a\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Keeping in mind the constitutional provision above quoted, we thus note two features of the amending act: (a) there is conceivably more than \u201cone subject\u201d involved in an act, of which Sec. 1-a prohibits all persons from taking water from the Guadalupe and Comal Rivers to other watersheds, and of which the remainder deals with the general subject of organization and corporate powers of water supply and sewer corporations ; and (b) the caption of the amending act does not expressly refer to Sec. 1-a or its content, unless by the words \u201camending Sections land 2 of\u201d the former law.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The petitioner Board, in upholding- Sec. 1-a, relies largely on the rule that the caption of an amending act is not necessarily deficient because it merely states that a particular prior law or particular section thereof is being amended and does not give further particulars. The State v. McCracken, 42 Texas 383; Gunter v. Texas Land and Mortgage Company, 82 Texas 496, 501-2, 17 S.W. 840, 842-3; English and Scottish-American Mortgage and Investment Company, Ltd. v. Hardy, 93 Texas 289, 297-8, 55 S.W. 169, 171. But this rule, of course, has its limits. Indeed, it might well be argued that the \u201cone subject\u201d requirement of the Constitution, although part of the same sentence containing the title or caption requirement, should operate independently of the latter, so as to invalidate an amendatory or original act containing more than one subject, even though all of the diverse subjects be covered in full detail in the caption. In any event, as hereinafter shown, the cited rule sustaining general captions of amending acts does not apply unless the actual amendment is germane to the subject matter of the original act or, as the case may be, the portion thereof which the caption of the amendatory act declares to be amended. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>while conceivably a lack of germaneness in the instant case between Sec. 1-a and the rest of the Act might invalidate the section under either the \u201cone subject\u201d or caption requirements, the more relevant decisions speak largely in terms of the latter, and therefor so shall we.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The Gunter case, supra, voided an amendatory act because the caption, while giving <em>numbers </em>of a title and sections as being amended, omitted to state to what existing body of laws or law these numbers corresponded. The opinion acknowledges the rule relied on by the petitioner Board; but it does so with the observation \u201c---although it might seem to us that a different rule would be more in harmony with the requirements of the Constitution,\u201d and shows clearly that the purposes of these requirements would be defeated by extending the rule so as, in effect, to make the body of the amendatory act itself explanatory of its own caption<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Similarly the English and Scottish-American Mortgage Co., case, supra, in referring to the rule, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201cThe reason---must be that the naming of the article to be amended directs attention to all of the provisions therein, as the subject of the amending act, and that such provisions can be ascertained by reading the article to be amended.\u201d (93 Texas 289, 298, 55 S.W. 169, 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In other words, the rule invoked by the p\u00e9titioner Board is justified only because and to the extent that the reader of the caption of the amendatory bill and the existing law or section to which the caption refers will thereby ascertain the subject of the amendatory bill without having to read the amendatory bill itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Obviously, however, if the provisions of the law or section to be amended involve a subject different from that actually dealt with in the body of the amending act, a reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>former will not disclose to the reader the true subject of the amending act but, on the contrary, will mislead him as to the latter. And so, as in the English and Scottish-American Mortgage Co., case, supra, we find that references to the rule of general amendatory captions are couched in limiting language such as \u201cany amendment <em>germane to the subject treated in the article referred to\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In Katz v. State, 122 Texas Crim. Rep. 231, 54 S.W. 2d 130, the body of the amendatory bill dealt with the occupation tax on \u201cmoney lenders,\u201d which in the original act (Art. 7047 R.C.S. 1925) was the subject matter of Sec. <em>15. </em>The caption of the amendatory bill read, \u201c---to amend Section 1U---re-lating to and imposing an occupation tax on money lenders and defiining same---.\u201d Actually Sec. 14 of Art. 7047 dealt with the tax on \u201cloan brokers,\u201d and accordingly the amendment was held void, notwithstanding that its caption reference to Sec. 14 of Art. 7047 (loan brokers) was qualified by the words \u201cmoney lenders,\u201d which was the actual subject of the amendment. The language of the court is of interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ex parte Turner, 122 Texas Crim. Rep. 357, 55 S.W. 2d 833, is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Thus the essential germaness of Sec. 1-a of Art. 1434a to the subject matter of Secs. 1 and 2 of the original act depends on whether a reader of the latter sections, concerning organization and powers of water supply corporations and nowhere mentioning rivers in general or in particular, would by his reading reasonably be forewarned of a subject such as a general prohibition against diverting waters from the Guadalupe or Comal Rivers to points beyond their respective watersheds. To state the question is, we think, to answer it, particularly when we consider that the hypothetical readers of the caption and earlier law are not merely members of the legislature but also \u201cthe people.\u201d See Gulf Ins. Co. v. James, 143 Texas 424, 431-2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>185 S.W. 2d 966, 970. As the respondent appropriately argues, the City of San Antonio, or perhaps some individual citizen or partnership not the least interested in the subject of the organization and corporate powers of water supply corporations, but very interested in the waters of the Guadalupe and Comal Rivers, might reasonably have read the caption in question and old Secs. 1 and 2 (or, for that matter, every section) of Art. 1434a and concluded that the proposed amendment would in all probability not affect their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\">We thus consider Sec. 1-a to be invalid under Sec. 35 of Art. Ill of the Constitution and accordingly find it unnecessary to consider the effect of Sec. 56 of Art. Ill, concerning local or special laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The judgments of the trial court and Court of Civil Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Opinion delivered October 26, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Rehearing overruled November 23, 1955.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">. \u201cSee. la.

The reason for the holding appears to be that the naming of the article to be amended directs attention to all of the provisions therein, as the subject of the amending act, and that such \u2022provisions can be ascertained by reading the article to be amended. However, when the Legislature restricts the title of an amendatory act by reference to the number in the code of the article amended, and announces its purpose to deal with the original bill in respect to particular matters therein, it is bound to govern itself accordingly, and keep within what it had itself declared would be the limits of its proposed action.
