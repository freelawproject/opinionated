Stern-Slegman-Prins Company, appellee, filed a notice of opposition on the basis of its prior rights in \u201cDebby Rose\u201d which it uses as a trademark for ladies\u2019 coats and suits and for which it obtained registration on November 30, 1954. Appellee states that the two marks are confusingly similar in sound, appearance, and significance. Thereupon, appellant, as a counterclaim, petitioned for cancellation of the \u201cDebby Rose\u201d registration, stating that it is damaged by said registration, that the registration was improperly granted, and that the mark, \u201cDebby Rose\u201d is used by appellee as a grade mark rather than as a true trademark. Appellee then moved to dismiss the cancellation petition on the ground that it does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Particularly, appellee points out that the petition does not contain an averment of likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers or any other facts which if proved would create a presumption of damage. In response to this motion, appellant asked for an oral hearing on the-motion and cross-moved for permission to file an amended pleading in the event that appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted. The amended pleading would include the following additional statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-11\">\u201c18A. Under the provisions of Rule 13 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and solely for the purposes of this pleading, the applicant-petitioner alleges that the parties to this proceeding are presently engaged in competitive business with each other, and both of the parties are now selling goods of the same descriptive properties in the same area or territory. Therefore, assuming only for the purposes of this pleading, and the applicant-petitioner does hereby so assume and allege, the truth of the facts set forth and alleged by the opposer-respondent in its notice of opposition, as recited in paragraphs 17 and 18 hereof, particularly the opposer-respondent\u2019s allegations that the goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties, and the two marks are confusingly similar,\u2014 it follows therefrom that there is likelihood of confusion, and under the provisions of F.R.C.P. 13, the applicant-petitioner so alleges, which already has damaged the applicant-petitioner and which will result in further damage to the applicant-petitioner and its business aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Appellee was opposed to an oral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">The board made no formal ruling on appellant\u2019s request for leave to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>its pleading, granted appellee\u2019s motion, and dismissed appellant\u2019s counterclaim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\">\u201cIn order to state a claim upon which relief may be granted in a petition to cancel, it must be alleged that the registration is inconsistent with an equal or superior right of the petitioner in the same or a similar mark. See: The Englander Company, Inc. v. Contour Chair-Lounge Co., Inc. and cases cited therein, 120 USPQ 233 (TT&amp;A Bd., 1959). Applicant has not asserted that it possesses rights in its mark which antedate or are otherwise superior to opposer\u2019s rights in its mark. It thus appears that the counterclaim does not set forth any facts which if proved would support an inference of damage to applicant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">With regard to the request for an oral hearing, the board stated in a footnote to its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">\u201c2. Applicant has requested a hearing on the motion. It is the general practice not to hold a hearing on interlocutory motions and an exception thereto appears unwarranted in the present instance. Applicant\u2019s request for such a hearing is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">In effect then, appellee has filed a demurrer to appellant\u2019s petition for cancellation and the board has dismissed said petition without an oral hearing. The relief requested of this court is that the decision of the board be reversed or, in the alternative, that the case be remanded to the board with instructions to vacate its dismissal order and set down the demurrer for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Even though the board did not explicitly grant applicant-appellant\u2019s motion to amend its counterclaim, undoubtedly the board included the amendment in its consideration of the case in that it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-11\">\u201cApplicant has counterclaimed for cancelation of opposer\u2019s pleaded registration. As grounds for cancelation it is alleged in the pleading that applicant has been using the mark \u2018Debbie Hall\u2019 since on or about January 22, 1958 for girls\u2019 coats, suits, dresses, skirts and the like; that on February 17, 1958 applicant filed an application to register \u2018Debbie Hall\u2019, and said mark was published for opposition on November 4, 1958; that opposer filed a notice of opposition thereto relying upon the registration sought to be canceled; that for the purpose of this pleading the marks \u2018Debbie Hall\u2019 and \u2018Debby Rose\u2019 as applied to the goods of the parties are likely to cause confusion in trade; that opposer was not the first to adopt and use either of the words \u2018Debby\u2019 or \u2018Rose\u2019 and/or a combination thereof for goods of the character sold by the parties herein; and that opposer\u2019s registration was improperly granted because opposer has used it merely as a grade mark, and the specimens submitted by opposer in its application for registration disclose use of \u2018Debby Rose\u2019 only as a part of a composite mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Although the amendment contains allegations which are inconsistent with some of the original allegations of the counterclaim, this procedure is sanctioned by the Trademark Rules of Practice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, we believe that appellant\u2019s motion to amend should have been granted. Therefore, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of the board\u2019s action concerning appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s counterclaim, which is all that is before this court at this time, we must determine if the allegations of the counterclaim as amended are sufficient if proven to warrant cancellation of appellee\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>We believe the necessary allegations have been made. Appellant has alleged that it has been using \u201cDebbie Hall\u201d on its goods; that \u201cDebbie Hall\u201d and \u201cDebby Rose\u201d as applied to the goods of the parties are likely to cause confusion in trade; that opposer-appellee\u2019s registration was improperly granted; that \u201cDebby Rose\u201d in reality is only part of a composite mark as used by appellee. In other words, appellant is saying that since the two marks are likely to cause confusion in the trade and since appellant has registration rights which are superior to those of appellee, because appellee has no registration rights at all (see Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Minnesota Linseed Oil Paint Co., etc., 229 F.2d 448, 43 CCPA 746), it is damaged by appellee\u2019s registration. This court stated in Price Vacuum Stores, Inc. v. Admiral Corp., 223 F.2d 269, 271, 42 CCPA 976:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-4\">\u201cIn summary, the cited portions of the foregoing cases stand for the above stated rule that a petition for cancellation of registration of a trade-mark must allege facts upon which injury to the petitioner is predicated. It is also quite obvious from the cases that, before there can be a showing of injury, there must be an allegation that there will likely be confusion in the trade as a result of the use of the marks on the respective goods of the parties, or as stated by the Examiner-in-Chief, \u2018the petitioner herein can have no proper interest in the question of respondent\u2019s right to registration in the cancellation proceedings unless the goods of the party and those specified in the registration under attack are such that their sale under the notation in controversy would be likely to cause confusion in the trade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">\u201cIt is our view that any positive allegation is sufficient which states in substance that the sale of the goods by the respective parties under the mark in question would be likely to cause confusion in the trade. It would certainly seem that a recital of this nature would be sufficient to set forth the \u201cdamage\u201d contemplated by the statute which would entitle one to bring a cancellation proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">In view of the foregoing, we believe that the motion of appellee to dismiss the counterclaim of appellant should not have been granted. Therefore the decision of the board in this connection is reversed. However, since it is not within our province to determine whether parties are entitled to oral hearings before the Patent Office tribunals, we shall not decide the correctness of the board\u2019s refusal to grant an oral hearing of this motion as requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\">.
