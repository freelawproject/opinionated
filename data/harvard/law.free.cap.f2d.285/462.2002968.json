United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-11\">MARTIN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">This is an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, acting through the Assistant Commissioner, 121 USPQ 586, affirming dismissals by the Examiner of Interferences of a notice of opposition and a petition for cancellation brought by appellant, E. L. Bruce Company. The appellee, American Termicide Company, Inc., is owner of the trademark, \u201cTermicide,\u201d registered in the United States Patent Office for wood preservative. Appellee has also applied for registration of \u201cTermicide\u201d as a service mark for exterminating services. Appellant is owner of \u201cTerminix,\u201d registered as a trademark for insecticides and as a service mark for termite control services.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">Appellant has opposed the registration of \u201cTermicide\u201d as a service mark and has petitioned for cancellation of \u201cTermicide\u201d as a trademark on the grounds that it has prior rights in \u201cTerminix\u201d which it uses as a trademark for wood preservatives, particularly against attack by termites and other insects, and as a service mark for exterminating services including termite control. Appellant claims that the two marks are used for the same goods and services, and are confusingly similar in pronunciation, spelling and suggestion. The opposition and cancellation proceedings were consolidated in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">The examiner found no dispute as to priority, and that the respective goods and services are identical in kind. The record recites registration and use by third parties of numerous marks comprising \u201cTerm\u201d and \u201cTermi\u201d for insecticides and termite control services. The examiner held that \u201cTermicide\u201d and \u201cTerminix\u201d are both highly suggestive that the goods and services of both parties are designed to eliminate, kill or control termites. The examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-18\">\u201c * * * The opposer, however, by its prior adoption and use of the trademark \u2018Terminix\u2019 may not preclude the subsequent use and registration by the applicant and others in the trade of marks for like goods and services having a similar suggestive connotation if they are otherwise substantially dissimilar. * * * And considering the nature of the term \u2018Termi\u2019 common to the marks \u2018Termicide\u2019 and \u2018Terminix\u2019 and taking into consideration that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the terminal portions \u2018Nix\u2019 and \u2018Cide\u2019 per se are distinctly different in every material particular, it is the opinion of the examiner that these marks as a whole are sufficiently distinguishable to enable their contemporaneous use for the specified goods and services without reasonable likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH9\">The Commissioner affirmed the findings and holdings of the examiner, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">\u201cThe record leads to a conclusion that, when purchasers buy termite control services, they are likely, if they rely on the mark used on the insecticide or repellent, to rely on the full mark and not on \u2018Term\u2019 or \u2018Termi\u2019 to distinguish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201c \u2018Termicide\u2019 is sufficiently unlike \u2018Terminix\u2019 to avoid likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Appellant urges that the two marks are confusingly similar because they are both suggestive of the absence of termites. It is argued that \u201cTermi\u201d means termites and that \u201cCide\u201d means \u201cdeath\u201d while \u201cNix\u201d means \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnone,\u201d and that while appellee has the right to incorporate \u201cTermi\u201d in a mark to be used in the termite control business, it should not be permitted to use \u201cTermi\u201d in \u201cTermicide\u201d since:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c # * * Termicide and Terminix, viewed in their entireties, have substantially the same meaning, significance, and suggestiveness, and create substantially the same impression, reaction and mental associations. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Since appellant agrees that the use of \u201cTermi\u201d as a part of a trademark on products or services for the extermination or prevention of termites is highly suggestive, there is only one issue before us. That issue is whether the use of \u201cNix\u201d and \u201cCide\u201d together with the common prefix creates trademarks which are sufficiently different to avert the likelihood of confusion in trade when the marks are contemporaneously used on similar products and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Appellant claims that \u201cNix\u201d was used in its trademark because it means \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnone\u201d and that since \u201cCide\u201d means kill, these two suffixes when added to \u201cTermi\u201d produce a similar connotation in the purchaser\u2019s mind. We disagree with appellant. We do not think the average purchaser would sense that significance with respect to \u201cNix,\u201d and certainly the spelling, sound, and appearance of the suffixes are entirely different.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">We doubt that the purchasing public relies on \u201cTermi\u201d to indicate the source of the products or services because of the inherent weakness of that prefix, and because of the many termite exterminators who have used it in their marks as indicated by the third party registrations and other evidence in the record. If the purchasing public relies on the marks at all to indicate source, the suffixes would be the determining factor. Consequently, considering the marks in their entireties, we are of the opinion that there is no likelihood of confusion to purchasers when appellee applies its mark to its goods and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">In view of the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
