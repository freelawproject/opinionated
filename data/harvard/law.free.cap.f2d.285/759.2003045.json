The petitioner contends that: (1) the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence; and, (2) the Board erred in holding that \u201cthe test to be applied in determining whether an individual is \u2018unable to engage in any regular employment\u2019 [the language of the Act] is not whether he is disabled for service in his usual occupation, but whether he is permanently disabled for any regular and gainful employment, within or without the Railroad industry, which is substantial and not trifling\u201d. Such a case is peculiarly a fact case; we hold that substantial evidence supports the finding. In addition, we find that the Board correctly applied the law to the facts. Squires v. Railroad Retirement Board, 5 Cir., 1947, 161 F.2d 182; Watts v. Railroad Retirement Board, 5 Cir., 1945, 150 F.2d 113. The relief prayed for in the petition for review is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
