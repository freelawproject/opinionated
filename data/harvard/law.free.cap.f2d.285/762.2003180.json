United States ex rel. Steffner v. Carmichael, 5 Cir., 183 F. 2d 19; United States ex rel. Koehler v. Corsi, 2 Cir., 60 F.2d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">Appellant attacks an order of deportation by asserting that the District Director should have reopened an earlier-' deportation proceeding and should have-granted him leave to apply for voluntary-departure nunc pro tunc. He relies on the regulation published at 8 C.F.R.. 103.5, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-19\"><em>\u201cA </em>proceeding provided for in this chapter may be reopened or the-decision made therein reconsidered for proper cause upon motion made by the party affected and granted by the officer who has jurisdiction over the proceeding or who made the decision * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-20\">There is nothing in this regulation-to authorize the special inquiry officer in this current deportation proceeding to reopen the earlier completed deportation proceeding, which was not appealed from. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
