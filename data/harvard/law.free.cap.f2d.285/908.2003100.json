We must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-27\">By \u00a7 403(e) (1) of the Renegotiation Act of 1942,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress expressly provided that the Tax Court of the United States should \u201chave exclusive jurisdiction, by order, to finally determine the amount, if any, of such excessive profits received * * * by the contractor * * *, and such determination shall not be reviewed or redetermined by any court or agency.\u201d Plainly, Congress intended to deprive the Courts of Appeals of jurisdiction to review a Tax Court determination of the amount of a contractor\u2019s excessive profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-28\">Because the Courts of Appeals have a general jurisdiction to review decisions of the Tax Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in which, alone, until 1956, there was venue of renegotiation cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reconc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>iled the two statutes by deciding that it could review the Tax Court\u2019s determination of its own jurisdiction, particularly the existence of renegotiable business, but that it had no jurisdiction to review the Tax Court\u2019s determination of the amount, if any, of excessive profits realized upon business subject to renegotiation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This reconciliation of the two statutes was approved by the Supreme Court. United States v. California Eastern Line, Inc., 348 U.S. 351, 75 S.Ct. 419, 99 L.Ed. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">There is no question here of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. The contractor had earnings in 1952 from business subject to renegotiation. The only issue is the amount of profits actually realized on that business and the extent to which those profits may be regarded as \u201cexcessive\u201d within the contemplation of the Act. The issue is presented on the basis of objection to specific findings on a number of subsidiary questions. These questions are directed to the propriety of the Tax Court\u2019s allocation and proration of certain receipts and expense items as between renegotiable and nonrenegotiable business. The contractor contends that certain expense items were improperly attributed to nonrenegotiable business, while other items of general expense were improperly prorated. He also contends that certain receipts which the Tax Court treated as equipment rentals subject to renegotiation should have been treated as payments upon conditional sales agreements because the equipment was subsequently sold under agreements which credited the purchaser with rentals previously paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Particularization of the issue does not malee it jurisdictional however. Whether specific items of receipts or of disbursements, or a greater or smaller proportion of them, should have entered into the Tax Court\u2019s computation of profits on renegotiable business, the questions are but the means by which the contractor seeks to contest the determination of the amount of its excessive profits. They are the kind of questions which routinely arise in renegotiation cases. They are the kind of questions which the Congress must have had in contemplation when it provided that the Tax Court\u2019s determination of the amount of excessive profits should not be reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Since the petition presents only non-reviewable matter, we have no jurisdiction to consider its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-19\">. 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1191(e) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b958-20\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7482(a) (1954 Code).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-29\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7482(b) (1).
