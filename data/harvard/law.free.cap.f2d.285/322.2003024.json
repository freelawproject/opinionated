All counts were alleged to be violations of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174. Defendant was convicted on all five counts by a jury verdict, and sentenced to two consecutive twenty year terms. Timely appeal was taken here. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-21\">Appellant urges: (1) the insufficiency of the evidence, particularly as to count two; (2) that the indictment fails to set forth acts or omissions with sufficient clarity to constitute a public offense, or to enable appellant to defend; and (3) that the conviction based on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices is improper; and (4) particularly so where one coconspirator is not indicted and two others are indicted but dismissed after a plea of guilty; that this constitutes unequal enforcement of the law and a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-22\">We are first asked to rule that a conviction based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice cannot stand. As this court stated as recently as June 27, 1960, when the same argument was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-23\">\u201cThus, in effect, we are asked to overrule Hass v. United States, 9 Cir., 31 F.2d 13; Westenrider v. United States, 9 Cir., 134 F.2d 772; Todorow v. United States, 9 Cir., 173 F.2d 439; Catrino v. United States, 9 Cir., 176 F.2d 884; Doherty v. United States, 9 Cir., 230 F.2d 605; Cowell v. United States, 9 Cir., 259 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>F.2d 660; and Audett v. United States, 9 Cir., 265 F.2d 837. This we decline to do.\u201d Claypole v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 768, 771, note 10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Cf. also: Ambrose v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 766, 768, note 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As we said then, and say again \u2014 \u201cThis we decline to do.\u201d Audett v. United States, 9 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We note that proper precautionary instructions were carefully given by the trial judge. As we said in the Clay-pole and Ambrose cases, supra, \u201cThe question thus attempted to be raised is not before us.\u201d As the trial court observed, defendant Marcella\u2019s own testimony corroborates the testimony of his accomplices. He admitted taking the two trips to Chicago (one via San Francisco) on the dates in question with one of the alleged conspirators. Chicago was where the large amounts of heroin involved herein were procured. Another trip to San Francisco was admitted. It is true appellant testified to a more or less innocent purpose for such trip, but the fact they were made was admitted. The meetings with the coconspirators in Los Angeles County were admitted, including the incident where the appellant admittedly pulled a gun on Duke Browning. Again, appellant urges that a different (and innocent) purpose was involved in each of these incidents. The other conspirators say not.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The truth as to each such incident was for the trier of fact to determine. The detei'mination was made adversely to the appellant, and we, looking at the evidence most favorably from the government\u2019s viewpoint as we must on an appeal such as this, can only determine if there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury on the factual dispute. We hold there clearly was. And the jury\u2019s decision on the factual question is binding on us.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In the attack on count two (chosen by appellant because that is the count to which the co-defendants pleaded guilty), counsel suggest that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201cThe only evidence is that Marie Rose Santino had some narcotics in her possession, that she sold it for a consideration to Quentiii [Duke] Browning. It was she who had it, and she pled guilty to the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">We cannot agree that this is the only evidence. We have commented above on the appellant\u2019s conduct which could be viewed as corroborative of the testimony of Marie Rose Santino. We point out also, merely by way of an example, that there was testimony appellant Marcella had possession of the narcotics, that \u201che' gave me [Marie Rose Santino) the package [of narcotics] to bring to Mr. Browning.\u201d We find no merit on the question of insufficiency of the evidence on any count.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">As to appellant\u2019s position that \u201cequal enforcement of the law required that they all be treated equally,\u201d that is simply not sound legally. All murderers do not die, nor is every speeder arrested,, or if fined, fined a similar amount. Disparity of sentences is the subject of much discussion these days, but no one has suggested that the discretion of the trial judge as to the sentences to be given in all cases should be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Appellant urges that he was \u201cin the same class\u201d as both the unindicted conspirators and the two indicted and convicted conspirators. As a law violator, that statement is true \u2014 all violated the law. But that does not mean there is no discretion in a prosecutor as to whom he will charge; whom he will indict; whom he will permit to turn state\u2019s evidence; to whom, if any, he will grant immunity. The traitor or \u201cturncoat,\u201d or \u201csquealer,\u201d or \u201cstool pigeon\u201d is universally disliked; it is regrettable that the use of such aids to law enforcement are required, yet for some reason it is seldom the noble and respectable citizen who has had a sufficient contact with the traffic in narcotics to enable him to bring his good character to the witness stand \u2014 there to testify and describe the transactions charged. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 1885, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220, relied upon by ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>pellant has no applicability to the present facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We likewise find no merit in the contention that there was no charge that the appellant knew the narcotics had been brought into the United States contrary to law. That knowledge, particularly with respect to opium derivatives, can be inferred, and is, unless the defendant explains his possession. Rodella v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 286 F.2d 306; Green v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 282 F.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
