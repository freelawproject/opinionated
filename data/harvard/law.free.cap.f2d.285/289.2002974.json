We have jurisdiction under Sections 10(e)'and (f) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-16\">The Board\u2019s order requires petitioner to cease and desist from causing or attempting to cause the employer, W. J. C. Kaufman Company, or any other employer, to discriminate against employees or applicants for employment by requiring them to obtain work permits, clearances or job referrals from petitioner as a condition of employment or from in any like or related manner restraining or coercing employees or prospective employees of Kaufman Company or any other employer in the exercise of rights under Section 7 of the Act. Additionally, petitioner is required to make restitution to a particular job applicant, one Bissonnette, for loss of wages because of unlawful discrimination against him, and to post specified notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-17\">Bissonnette, who was a member' of Local 1373 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, a local not affiliated with petitioner District Council, applied for employment on a job site where the Kaufman Company was engaged in a construction project. Harrison, a foreman who had hiring authority, told Bissonnette that he had a job for him. Harrison, although a foreman, was a member of a carpenters\u2019 local affiliated with the petitioner. The record shows that Bissonnette from past experience as a union member believed that a work permit was required. When Bissonnette expressed his understanding that he needed a work permit from petitioner before going to work, Harrison gave him until noon to obtain a permit and sent him to Rogers, the union steward on the job site. Bissonnette\u2019s testimony was, \u201cHe [Harrison] said that I should get a permit and be back here by noon and he would put me to work at noon.\u201d The union steward, who is an elected official of petitioner\u2019s local, then told Bissonnette he could get his work permit at the local union office in Mt. Clemens. The constitution of the carpenters\u2019 union and the working rules of the District Council, petitioner here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>require that a member of an unaffiliated, i. e., a \u201cforeign\u201d local obtain a work permit in order to work in petitioner\u2019s jurisdiction. Prior to this episode however, petitioner had instructed its members in union meetings not to apply these rules so as to discriminate in employment against members of non-affiliated locals. That suspension of the constitution was not known to Bissonnette when he applied or to Harrison when he acted on the job application. No evidence is shown that petitioner communicated its suspension of enforcement of these provisions to its members except at union meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Bissonnette, acting on the information of the union steward as to where permits were issued, went to the local union office in Mt. Clemens as directed. He testified that he was told they \u201ccouldn\u2019t issue no permits there. It was too near the district council,\u201d and that he \u201cwould have to go into Detroit to the District Council.\u201d Following these directions, he went to Detroit where he was told that \u201cthey weren\u2019t issuing any permits. That the Carpenters were on strike,\u201d and that \u201cthere is too many men out of work here\u201d and \u201cit would look bad if he issued me a permit * * Bissonnette then returned to the job site and reported to Harrison that he could not get a work permit and understood he could not go to work without it. Harrison, according to Bissonnette\u2019s testimony, said he \u201cwas sorry\u201d and there was \u201cnothing he could do about it.\u201d When asked whether he felt that Bissonnette needed a permit, Harrison answered, \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t say so. It wasn\u2019t necessary for me to specify that he did. * * * \u201d Harrison also testified that \u201cto the best of [his] knowledge\u201d he followed the working rules and the union constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also acknowledged that he worked \u201cin conjunction with the steward in an effort to uphold the trade rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">It was against this background the Trial Examiner found that the petitioner had violated Section 8(b) (2) of the Act through Harrison\u2019s exercise of his hiring authority in accordance with the union constitution and working rules. He found that in the context of their common understanding of the union constitution, the implication of the conversations between Harrison and Bissonnette must have been that Bissonnette was not eligible for employment without a permit. He also found that the petitioner was responsible because its working rules imposed a duty on Harrison as a foreman to uphold these rules. However, he found that so far as the proof went the Bissonnette episode was \u201can isolated and accidental application\u201d of petitioner\u2019s rules by Harrison. The Examiner seems to have accepted petitioner\u2019s claim that its members had been instructed at union meetings not to apply rules so as to cause discrimination, but he found that this did not relieve petitioner of responsibility for Harrison\u2019s conduct since \u201che was acting within the scope of his apparent authority under the Working Rules. * * \u201d The Board found that Harrison\u2019s action relating to Bissonnette \u201cfell within the contemplated scope of the authority and responsibility\u201d placed on him by petitioner and that petitioner had failed to communicate to Harrison the policy of suspending the enforcement of the constitution which modified his actual authority. In these circumstances, the Board held, Harrison \u201cthus remained cloaked with apparent authority, if not actual authority, to act on behalf * * * \u201d of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The questions presented to us are:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">(a) Was Bissonnette refused employment because he did not have a work permit ?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">(b) If so, was petitioner responsible for this discrimination?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>(e) Is the scope of the Board\u2019s order too broad in view of the findings and evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Section 8(b) (2) of the Act as amended makes it an unfair labor practice for a union \u201cto cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of subsection (a) (3)\u201d which in turn declares it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cby discrimination in regard to hire * * * to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In National Labor Relations Board v. International Bhd. of Boilermakers, 2 Cir., 232 F.2d 393, certiorari denied 1956, 352 U.S. 909, 77 S.Ct. 148, 1 L.Ed.2d 118, the court held it was a violation of Sections 8(b) (2) and (1) (A) of the Act for a union to cause four union members to be refused employment because they were not members of the particular local union which had jurisdiction over the job site. Judge Lumbard\u2019s concurring opinion, in which Judge Waterman joined sustaining the Board finding of violation of the statute, discloses the similarity of the facts to those presented in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">\u201cHagan [company foreman] told Smith and Marin that since they were Lodge 23 members and did not have Building Trades Quarterly cards they would hav\u00e9 to get the approval of District 2 headquarters. At 14th Street headquarters field representative Graber told them that the Astoria jobs were being held for District 2 members.\u201d 232 F.2d at page 396.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">See also National Labor Relations Board v. Local 542, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Engineers, 3 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">The petitioner urges that the facts do not show Bissonnette was refused employment but on the contrary that his loyalty to union principles led him to pass up the job tender of his own volition rather than violate an internal union rule. This is a strained and strange interpretation of the evidence before the Examiner and the Board. Bissonnette applied for a job and was assured a job subject only to securing a work permit which he erroneously assumed was indispensable. Harrison sent Bissonnette to the steward; the steward, Rogers, told him to go to the Mt. Clemens office of the union; the Mt. Clemens office sent him into Detroit. At each point Bissonnette was frustrated and \u201cbucked\u201d to the next by the very union officers who were looked upon by him as people who were supposed to help him get work. It is not surprising that he was pushed to say, finally, that he might as well \u201ctear up\u201d his union credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">The suggestion that the union sought only and narrowly to appeal to the loyalty and conscience of each union member to comply with work permit provisions is tenuous at best. The unsophisticated working carpenter could hardly be expected to discern this subtle distinction. No reason appears why we should not accept the Trial Examiner\u2019s evaluaton just as the Board did. The whole record abundantly supports the finding that union representatives acting for petitioner conveyed to Bissonnette the \u201cmessage\u201d that no work permit meant no work, and this was consistent with the \u201cmessage\u201d which Harrison by acts and utterances in his first, as in his final conversation, conveyed to Bissonnette. See National Labor Relations Board v. Cement Masons, 9 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">The Board held petitioner responsible for Harrison\u2019s conduct on the ground that the constitution and the working rules imposed responsibility for rules enforcement on the foreman, who was required to be a member of the union. There is nothing ambiguous or equivocal about the Board\u2019s finding on the issue of responsibility; nor does it lose any of its vitality by reason of subsequent expressions of the Board on the same general subject. Our dissenting colleague relies on the Board\u2019s statement that Harrison \u201cremained cloaked with apparent author-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ity, if not actual authority\u201d disregarding the earlier finding that Harrison\u2019s conduct \u201cfell within the contemplated scope of the authority\u201d placed on him by petitioner. Thus we do not go beyond the limits permitted by Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626, in sustaining the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">It is conceded by the union that the constitution and rules contained the provisions, which if superimposed on the hiring authority, constituted a violation of Sections 8(b) (2) and (1) (A). Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Millwrights\u2019 Local 2232, 5 Cir., 1960, 277 F.2d 217 petition for certiorari filed, 29 U.S.L. Week 3048 (U.S. July 11, 1960) (No. 229). There is no evidence of any kind that any limitation or suspension of the constitution and rules was communicated to Harrison and there is persuasive evidence from his utterances and acts that he was not aware of any limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Uncommunicated union limitations on the scope of working rules do not operate to limit a foreman\u2019s authority or the union\u2019s responsibility. National Labor Relations Board v. Cement Masons, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The case of Carpenters District Council of Milwaukee County and Vicinity of United Broth, of Carpenters and Joiners of America, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1959, 107 U.S.App. D.C. 55, 274 F.2d 564, relied on by the petitioner, does not aid its position. There the majority held that absent evidence to the contrary, the foreman was presumed to act on behalf of the employer. Here the authority exercised by the foreman was obviously on behalf of the employer since it was hiring authority, but it was exercised under the dictates of the petitioner\u2019s constitution and working rules. The foreman <em>exercised </em>this hiring authority, not according to instructions from the employer but according to commands of the union constitution. No suggestion is made that the employer had a policy of hiring only union members or that he required work permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Viewing the record as a whole there is ample evidence to support a finding that petitioner was responsible for the actual enforcement by Harrison, as foreman, of the union constitution and working rules so as to deprive Bissonnette of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">The order is attacked by petitioner on the ground that it applies not only to the Kaufman Company but to \u201cany other employer\u201d and to practices committed in \u201cany like or related manner.\u201d In light of the Examiner\u2019s finding that the Harrison-Bissonnette episode \u201cat most, is proof only of an isolated and accidental application\u201d of the constitution and working rules, the scope of the Board\u2019s order is difficult to understand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 426, 433, 61 S.Ct. 693, 698, 85 L.Ed. 930, tells us that \u201cthe authority conferred on the Board to restrain the practice which it has found * * * to have [been] committed is not an authority to restrain generally all other unlawful practices which it has neither found to have been pursued or persuasively to be related to the proven unlawful conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">However, it appears that no objection to the scope of the order was made before the Board. Exception was taken to -the recommended order \u201cinsofar as * * * based on materials previously excepted to.\u201d But these exceptions all related to findings on discrimination and agency. There were no findings as to the scope of the order; only the terms of the order describe its scope. Thus the exception taken \u201cdid not apprise the Board that petitioner intended to press the question now presented.\u201d Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1943, 318 U.S. 253, 255, 63 S.Ct. 585, 586, 87 L.Ed. 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Petitioner argues that even absent objection before the Board this court now has power to modify the order in this respect. We think not. Several circuits seem to have held the reviewing court may so act because the enforcement order is the order of <em>the court, </em>not the order of the Board. See National Labor Relations Board v. Local 111, United Bhd. of Carpenters, 1 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 823; National Labor Relations Board v. Brand-man Iron Co., 6 Cir., 1960, 281 F.2d 797. The Sixth Circuit appears to have relied upon Mr. Justice Stone\u2019s concurring opinion in National Labor Relations Board v. Cheney California Lumber Co., 1946, 327 U.S. 385, 66 S.Ct. 553, 90 L.Ed. 739. Circuit Judge Cecil dissenting in the Brand-man case relies on the majority view in the Cheney case and his premise would seem to be correct. This is also the view of the Second Circuit. National Labor Relations Board v. Combined Century Theatres, Inc., 2 Cir., 278 F.2d 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">In National Labor Relations Board v. District 50, UMW, 1958, 355 U.S. 453, 78 S.Ct. 386, 2 L.Ed.2d 401, the Supreme Court set aside the action of this Circuit which modified a Board order by changing the wording of a notice, saying that no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d were shown to bring the case within the exceptions allowed under the controlling statute defining the scope of review. See also Federal Power Commission v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 492, 497-501, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583. Petitioner neither claims nor describes any extraordinary circumstances which would appear to warrant our now modifying the scope of what might seem to be an order which goes beyond the needs of the case. We do not read Express Publishing or similar cases in the Supreme Court as do the First and Sixth Circuits. We read those cases as precluding modification of the order by us unless the party challenging the order shows that he is within the exception of the rule; appellant has not done so. The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">. \u201cQ.

I also agree that foremen who are union members are authorized to enforce the District Council\u2019s working rules.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But I do not think that the present record and the Board\u2019s findings sustain the Board\u2019s conclusion that the District Council was responsible for Harrison\u2019s conduct. Nor do I think that the equivocal \u201cfinding\u201d that Harrison was never informed of the restriction of his authority, upon which the majority primarily relies to sustain the Board, was asserted by the Board as one of its grounds for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The standards for vicarious responsibility under the Labor Management Relations Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are the common-law principles of agency. International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union v. National Labor Relations Board, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 237 F.2d 545. Consequently, unless Harrison\u2019s conduct fell within the scope of either his actual or his apparent authority to enforce the work rules of the Council, his conduct cannot be imputed to the labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">The Board\u2019s opinion expresses two grounds for its conclusions that the Council was responsible for Harrison\u2019s conduct. In the first instance, the Board relies on the Council\u2019s written work rule and upon the provision of the United Brotherhood\u2019s constitution which requires union members from other jurisdictions to secure work permits from the Council as a condition precedent to em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ployment within the Council\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. This rule, according to the Board, when coupled with the authority of foremen to enforce work rules, conferred upon Harrison the actual authority to refuse Bissonnette employment because he did not have the requisite permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The Council has contended throughout the proceedings that, although this invalid work rule is on its books, it has not been enforced, and that this nullification and abandonment was communicated to the Council\u2019s membership. The Board\u2019s opinion answers this contention by concluding that, even if Harrison lacked actual authority, he had, in the circumstances of this case, apparent authority to enforce the invalid rule. The Board found that, even if the Council had abandoned the enforcement of the rule, this abandonment was never communicated <em>to Bissonnette, </em>and, therefore, Harrison remained clothed with the apparent authority to enforce the rule vis-a-vis Bissonnette. Of course, the Board\u2019s order can be sustained only if its findings are supported by substantial evidence viewing the record as a whole and if the conclusions from them are correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Board\u2019s initial finding that Harrison, solely by virtue of the written rule requiring members of foreign locals to obtain work permits, had actual authority to refuse Bissonnette employment is not supported by the record. The trial examiner believed the Council\u2019s job steward\u2019s testimony that the invalid rule was not being enforced and the business agent\u2019s testimony that the rule had not been applied for a period of two years. In light of this uncontradicted testimony, I do not think the Board\u2019s contrary and unsupported finding that the rule requiring permits was in effect at the time of the Bissonnette episode can be considered as \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole * Labor Management Relations Act \u00a7 10(e), 61 Stat. 146 (1947), as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e); Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The Board alternatively urges that, even if Harrison were without actual authority, because of the revocation of the rule requiring permits, he had apparent authority vis-a-vis Bissonnette because Bissonnette was not informed of this revocation. For the doctrine of apparent authority to be operative, it is essential that there be a holding out by the purported principal that his agent is authorized to act on his behalf, and this holding out must be relied upon by the person dealing with the apparently authorized agent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board based its conclusion of apparent authority solely upon its finding that the restriction on Harrison\u2019s authority was never communicated to Bissonnette. But the Board did not find that Bissonnette relied upon any holding out by the Council that Harrison was authorized to require work permits of prospective employees. Admittedly, if Bissonnette had been familiar with the Council\u2019s rules as written, he would have been entitled to rely on the authorization to foremen who were union members to require work permits. Bissonnette testified, however, that he had no knowledge of the Council\u2019s rules. His understanding that a work permit was required as a condition precedent to employment was based, not upon any holding out by the Council, but upon his job experiences in other parts of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The majority opinion does not place primary reliance upon either of these grounds in affirming the Board\u2019s order. Rather, it states that the Board found that the Council failed to communicate <em>to Harrison </em>the policy of abandoning the enforcement of the invalid work rule which limited his actual authority. This, of course, could have been a proper ground for decision by the Board. Absent such communication, Harrison would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>have retained actual authority to enforce the rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But I cannot read the Board\u2019s opinion as relying on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The Board\u2019s opinion does suggest, in a parenthetical footnote reference, that the abandonment of the particular work rule and consequent restriction of authority was never communicated to Harrison, or, if it were communicated to Harrison, he had forgotten about it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even if this equivocal and imperfectly articulated statement of the Board, based upon ambiguous testimony,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> be considered a finding that the abandonment of the rule had never been communicated to Harrison, as my colleagues apparently do consider it, it seems to me to be unmistakable from the context of the Board\u2019s opinion that this \u201cfinding\u201d was not a basis for the Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cWhatever may be the restriction that was intended to be placed upon Harrison\u2019s authority and duty under the Constitution and Working Rules, <em>it is sufficient that it was never communicated to Bissonnette. </em>Harrison <em>thus </em>remained cloaked with apparent authority, if not actual authority, to act on behalf of the Respondent and the uncommunicated restriction on this authority cannot serve to relieve the Respondent of its responsibility for Harrison\u2019s conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">In light of this express ground for decision which is the Board\u2019s sole answer to the Council\u2019s contention that the invalid rule was abrogated, I do not think that we can raise what is at best an equivocal finding to the status of an alternative ground for decision. The Board\u2019s order must be judged exclusively on those grounds upon which the record shows it was based. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Even though the Council\u2019s business agent testified that the abandonment of the work rules was communicated to the members and his testimony was accepted as credible by the trial examiner, it may be that for some reason this restriction was never manifested to Harrison. Similarly, it may be that the conduct of the Council\u2019s representatives at its offices\u2014 in refusing Bissonnette a permit because a substantial number of the Council\u2019s members were out of work \u2014 constituted a holding out that Harrison had authority to enforce the invalid work rule. Bissonnette may have relied upon this during his second encounter with Harrison. The Board, however, did not make these findings, and an appellate court cannot supply them. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., supra. I think, however, that if evidence is available on either of these matters, the Board should have the opportunity to present it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>in further proceedings and to determine the question of responsibility in light of the findings which may result.
