Counts 1 and 3 charging unlawfully and knowingly receiving and facilitating the transportation and concealment of heroin hydrochloride, a narcotic drug, after it had been imported into the United States contrary to law, knowing it to have been imported contrary to law in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174; Counts 2 and 4 charging selling the heroin hydrochloride not pursuant to a written order in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705. Counts 1 and 2 concern a transaction that took place on September 10, 1959. Counts 3 and 4 involve a transaction on September 24, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the government\u2019s evidence and at the conclusion of all the evidence were overruled; and the Court sentenced defendant to serve ten years, generally, which by reason of a previous conviction for sale and possession of marihuana was the minimum sentence permitted by law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on any of the four counts, and a Ten Dollar fine to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The questions presented are whether as a matter of law defendant was entrapped or was \u201ca mere purchasing agent who purchased narcotics with money supplied by a \u2018governmental informer\u2019 at no profit to him\u201d, whether the Court erred in refusing to submit to the jury the several written requests as to appellant\u2019s theory of the case, and whether defendant was denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Clifton Ray White, alias \u201cLovejoy\u201d, a government informer, testified that on September 10, 1959, shortly before 2:00 P.M. he called defendant on the telephone; defendant asked him what he wanted; and he told defendant that he wanted to buy some \u201cstuff\u201d; defendant asked him \u201chow many pills did I want\u201d; and he told defendant he wanted six. Then the informer called Bautista, a narcotics agent and advised him of the conversation and arrangements he had made with defendant. The informer met. government agents Bautista and Ripa,. was searched, received from them $42.00' in government funds for which he signed a receipt which stated the purpose for which the funds were to be used, and was driven to the drive-in cafe where he-had arranged to meet defendant. The-informer met defendant at about 2:00' P.M., conversed with him, then walked across the street with him where he handed defendant the $42.00. Defendant stooped down into a ditch and picked up a cigarette package which he handed to informer, who brought the package back to agent Bautista. In court, White and Bautista identified the package which was shown to contain six capsules of heroin hydrochloride.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Clifton Ray White, the informer admitted that he had a prior conviction of theft from the mails, that he had been using narcotics \u201con and off\u201d since 1951; testified that he did not now use narcotics, was not under the influence of nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u25a0cotics, nor did he use them on September 10 or 24, that he had been arrested by \u25a0narcotics agents in August 1959, and was now free on $500.00 bond, that he liad agreed with narcotics agents to cooperate with them because he felt it was .his duty, that he had not been promised .anything, though he had been told that they would try to be more lenient with fiiim if he cooperated.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Agents Ripa and Bautista gave corroborating testimony on informer White\u2019s testimony. They observed White .at all times after searching him before they let him out of the car near the drive-in cafe, during his meeting with defendant and during his return with the \u2022 cigarette package to the car and Bautista .and Ripa.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">White testified that on September 24, 1959, he called defendant on the telephone r.and told defendant that he wanted to buy :Some \u201cstuff\u201d. Defendant asked informer '\u201chow much stuff did I want\u201d, and informer told defendant that \u201cI wanted to buy a paper\u201d. Defendant told White that .he \u201chad to have $60.00\u201d for this amount, .\u25a0and informer told defendant that the ;price \u201cwasn\u2019t but $50.00\u201d, whereupon defendant told informer \u201che had to have ten more for himself for his trouble.\u201d .After agreeing on a price of $60.00, ar-rangements were made for a meeting in front of the Cotton Exchange Building .\u25a0at 12:00 noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">White contacted narcotics agents Ripa .and Kelly who met White in front of the \u25a0Cotton Exchange Building. Agent Ripa .searched informer, gave him $60.00 in government funds and had him sign a receipt which stated the purpose for which the funds were to be used. A \u201ccouple or three minutes later\u201d defendant drove up to the meeting place; informer gave defendant the $60.00; defendant drove off and returned in about \u25a0twenty minutes to give White a \u201cpaper of stuff\u201d which White turned over to narcotics agents and which was identified in court by White and by Agents Ripa and Kelly and shown to contain heroin hydrochloride.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Agents Ripa and Kelly gave testimony confirming meeting, searching, providing funds to White, and observing defendant drive up in front of the Cotton Exchange Building. Kelly testified to observing White at all times as White approached defendant\u2019s car. Kelly observed defendant roll down his window, White hand something to defendant and then return to Kelly while defendant drove off; then defendant\u2019s return some thirty minutes later with White going to defendant\u2019s car, defendant handing something to White and driving away while White returned to Kelly without putting his hands in his pockets to give Kelly a cellophane package containing a powder which was identified in court by White and by agent Kelly, and shown to be heroin hydrochloride.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">On November 6, 1959, narcotics agents Ripa and Bautista arrested defendant, warned him of his constitutional rights and had a conversation with defendant in which defendant said that he had been selling heroin capsules at $7.00 a capsule, that he had been purchasing heroin from an individual he knew as Curley, that he had used heroin with Curley, and that he, the defendant, would \u201ccap it up\u201d; and sell it to four individuals whom he named.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Defendant took the stand; admitted a prior conviction in New York in 1944 on a plea of guilty of possession of marihuana, which marihuana he said belonged to a man who had roomed with him, but \u201cI was the one that got caught with it\u201d; testified that in 1953 he had been \u201cheld\u201d with his wife and had testified in a case based on heroin that had come through the mails to the apartment house in which he lived; that he knew heroin was contraband, obtained secretly and clandestinely through a contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Defendant testified that he had known White only since about July or August, that he had met Curley at about the same time in a cafe, that he had had conversations with White about the procurement of narcotics, that he obtained narcotics from Curley for White two times before the indictment transactions of September 10 and September 24, that on these prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>occasions White \u201cjust asked me to go and get it,\u201d that White contacted him <em>\u201cmostly </em>by telephone,\u201d that White just said simply that \u201che wanted to score\u201d; that defendant \u201cpresumed he (White) used and wanted it\u201d; that he called Curley because White asked him to, that when Curley asked defendant \u201cwhere you at\u201d, \u201cI <em>usually </em>tell him where I was\u201d. Defendant testified that he had had no written order for heroin and that he made no profit from these transactions, but that he \u201chad some gas put in my car every now and then,\u201d and that \u201cI got quite a lot of reimbursement for gas\u201d; that before September 10 \u201cthere have been times when I have handed (heroin) to him (White)\u201d; that he knew heroin was $7.00 a \u201ccap\u201d; that White went through him, defendant, because \u201cI had a car\u201d, though defendant\u2019s car was not used on the September 10 transaction. In his testimony concerning the telephone conversation setting up the September 24 transaction when White complained about the $60.00 price, defendant said that White <em>\u201cusually </em>said he would buy gas for me.\u201d Defendant further testified that White had said he was \u201csick\u201d and \u201cwanted to work that day and didn\u2019t want to take off, but he wanted to work.\u201d Defendant testified that he had never used heroin, but when asked on direct examination if he had told anyone that he had used it, answered: \u201cWell, I may have told someone something like that, but I don\u2019t recall just telling him I had used heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Appellant cites Sherman v. U. S., 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848; Sorrells v. U. S., 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413, and Wall v. U. S., 5 Cir., 65 F.2d 993, in support of his contention that he was entrapped by government agents as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">As this court said in Washington v. U. S., 275 F.2d 687, 689, \u201cunderSorrells, Sherman and Masciale,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the issue of entrapment is a question for the-jury, unless as a matter of law the defendant has established beyond a reasonable doubt that he was entrapped * *\u2019 In determining if there has been entrapment as a matter of law this Court has-considered not only the predisposition of the accused but has weighed also the-conduct\u2019 of the government agents. Accardi v. United States.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the testimony set forth above, including circumstances indicating that, the relationship between White and defendant was casual, defendant was willing to deal with White by telephone, the-clandestine methods employed by him in. hiding narcotics in the ditch, his previous-experiences with illicit dealings in narcotics and his own conduct in both transactions, the jury could reasonably have-concluded that defendant was a person, engaged in illicit narcotic drugs traffic, \u201cnot an innocent person in whose mind' the Government implanted a criminal design\".<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And the jury could have believed' he had a \u201cpredisposition\u201d and \u201cintention: or readiness\u201d to commit the crimes charged, that these offenses were not \u201cthe-product of the creative activity\u201d of law-enforcement officials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case there-was no such badgering or repeated requests of the defendant from persons-with whom he was closely related which, overcame a refusal or hesitancy of defendant to deal as in the Sherman case. As in Accardi we cannot say that the-government agents exceeded the proper-use of government power nor that their-conduct was \u201cabhorrent to the sense of\u2019 justice\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of this court. There was no. entrapment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">Appellant contends that he \u201cwas a-mere purchasing agent who obtained the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u25a0narcotics with money supplied by the government informer at no profit to appellant and out of a sense of pity and sympathy for the said informer who claimed that he was \u2018sick\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">This defense applies only to Counts 2 and 4 charging sales of heroin, and \u201cthe defense that\u201d (Walker) was only a purchasing agent \u201cdoes not apply\u201d to the conviction on Counts 1 and 3 of receiving, concealing and facilitating the transportation and concealment of narcotics. Washington v. U. S., 275 F.2d 687, at page 690 and Coronado v. U. S., 5 Cir., 266 F.2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"> There was ample evidence to raise an issue as to whether defendant was a mere conduit or purchasing agent, including testimony to the effect that defendant had made prior purchases and sales of narcotics, that he had knowledge of the narcotics trade, that he profited on the transactions in money or gasoline. Reasonable minds could have rejected defendant\u2019s testimony to the effect that he obtained the heroin for White because White did not have a car, since defendant did not use his car in the .'September 10 transaction, similarly they could have rejected defendant\u2019s excuse of sympathy for White because he was \u201csick\u201d, because defendant delivered the heroin to White during the noon hour as White \u201cwanted to work\u201d. The Court submitted this defense exactly as requested in \u201cDefense Request for Instructions No. 9\u201d. The District Court did not err in refusing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal on this ground. Washington v. U. S., supra. \u201cThe verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d Glasser v. U. S., 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680; United States v. Malfi, 264 F.2d 147, certiorari denied 361 U.S. 817, 80 S.Ct. 57, 4 L.Ed.2d 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">With respect to the claimed error in failure to give defendant\u2019s requested instructions Nos. 2 through 11, Rule 30 of the Fed.Rules of Crim.Proc., 18 U. S.C., provides: \u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto * * * stating <em>distinctly </em>the <em>matter </em>to which he objects and the <em>grounds </em>of his objection\u201d. In Marson v. U. S., 6 Cir., 203 F.2d 904, 912 the court states that \u201cthe purpose of Rule 30 was to give the trial court the opportunity to present the case to the jury with complete fairness to the parties and after full consideration of their claim as to their theories, the law, and the facts applicable\u201d, and declares that it is reversible error to refuse to present a requested \u201ctheory\u201d supported by evidence to which the \u201ccourt\u2019s attention is <em>particularly </em>directed * * Mims v. U. S., 9 Cir., 254 F.2d 654; Marbs v. U. S., 8 Cir., 250 F.2d 514; Northcraft v. U. S., 8 Cir., 271 F.2d 185; Estep v. U. S., 5 Cir., 223 F.2d 19. An examination of the charge below together with the refused requested instructions demonstrates that there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Defendant\u2019s requested instruction No. 9, which he says \u201cwent to the very heart of this case\u201d, was given in <em>haec verba. </em>His requested instruction No. 3 regarding sale and No. 10 regarding entrapment were not only included but more accurately stated in the Court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">The theory and effect of defendant\u2019s requested instructions Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11, to the extent not embraced in the Court\u2019s charge, is to \u201crob the statute\u201d making possession of narcotics presumptive evidence of ultimate facts of guilt under Section 174 of Title 21 U.S.C.A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cof all efficacy\u201d. Manning v. U. S., 5 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 926, 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Direct evidence of defendant\u2019s possession of the heroin raised the statutory presumption of the existence of the essential facts of his violation of Title 21, Sec. 174, i. e. (1) that the heroin was received and concealed contrary to law, (2) that the heroin was imported contrary to law, and (3) that the defendant knew of the unlawful importation. Yee Hem v. U. S., 1925, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904; Corrollo v. Dutton, 5 Cir., 1933, 63 F.2d 7; Harris v. U. S., 1959, 359 U.S. 19, 79 S.Ct. 560, 3 L.Ed.2d 597; Manning v. U. S., 5 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Defendant contends that the presumption of guilt \u201cdisappeared\u201d because (1) the government chemist testified that \u201cit is possible\u201d that heroin \u201cmay be\u201d manufactured from morphine which has been synthetized within the United States, though he said \u201cI do not know whether it has been done or not * * * but it is possible\u201d, and because (2) defendant testified that he did not know that the heroin was imported contrary to law. He insists that \u201csince the approval by the Supreme Court of the constitutionality of said presumption, scientific progress in opium alkaloid chemistry has rendered the presumption invalid because as shown by this record heroin may now be manufactured from morphine which has been synthetized within the United States, and there is not now any rational connection between possession of the heroin and importation of the opium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">A similar contention was raised and rejected in Yee Hem v. United States, supra, Caudillo v. United States, 9 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 513, 518, certiorari denied Romero v. U. S., 357 U.S. 931, 78 S.Ct. 1375, 2 L.Ed.2d 1373, cited by this court in Manning v. United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 926; and the presumption was applied in cases involving heroin in 1959 by the Supreme Court in Harris v. United! States, 359 U.S. 19, 79 S.Ct. 560, 3 L. Ed.2d 597, and by the Second Circuit in 1960 in United States v. Cox, 277 F.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">In Yee Hem v. United States, supra,, the Supreme Court stated [268 U.S. 178,. 45 S.Ct. 471]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">\u201cWe think it is not an illogical inference that opium, found in this country more than 4 years (in the present case, more than 14 years)after its importation had been prohibited, was unlawfully imported-Nor do we think the further provision, that possession of such opium in the absence of a satisfactory explanation shall create a presumption of guilt, is \u2018so unreasonable as-to be a purely arbitrary mandate.\u2019 By universal sentiment, and settled' policy as evidenced by state and local legislation for more than half a. century, opium is an illegitimate-commodity, the use of which except-as a medicinal agent, is rigidly condemned. Legitimate possession, unless for medicinal use, is so highly improbable that to say to any person who obtains the outlawed commodity, \u2018since you are bound to know that it cannot be brought into this country at all, except under regulation for medicinal use, you must,, at your peril ascertain and be prepared to show the facts and circumstances which rebut, or tend to rebut, the natural inference of unlawful importation, or your knowledge of it,\u2019 is not such an unreasonable requirement as to cause it to fall outside the constitutional power of Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">In Caudillo the Ninth Circuit said [253 F.2d 518]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">\u201cFinally, the Supreme Court has held that merely because it might be possible to legally import opium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>into this country, the presumption created by the legislature that allows the jury to draw an inference of illegal possession and knowledge of that illegality was valid. We can envision the <em>possibility </em>of opium poppies growing in this country, yet that fact will not cause us to declare \u00a7 174 unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Mr. Justice Clark\u2019s opinion in the Harris case notes that [359 U.S. 19, 79 S.Ct. 563]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201cThe continuing purpose of Congress to wipe out the narcotics traffic is shown in \u00a7 201 of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 572, 18 U.S.C. (1952 ed. Supp. V) \u00a7 1402, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1402, wholly outlawing any possession of heroin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">In Gore v. United States (1958 \u2014 involving heroin), 357 U.S. 386, 389, 390, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1283, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405, Mr. Justice Frankfurter refers to these laws \u201cas means for dealing with a social evil as deleterious as it is difficult to combat\u201d, and adds \u201cof course the various enactments by Congress extending over nearly half a century constitute a network of provisions, steadily tightened and enlarged, for grappling with a powerful, subtle and elusive enemy. If the legislation reveals anything, it reveals the determination of Congress to turn the screw of the criminal machinery \u2014 detection, prosecution and punishment \u2014 tighter and tighter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">In United States v. Feinberg, 7 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 425, 426, certiorari denied 315 U.S. 801, 62 S.Ct. 626, 86 L.Ed. 1201, where defendant testified, as he did here, that he did not know the narcotics were imported into the United States contrary to law, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">\u201cCounsel for defendant Ludwig insists that the record does not contain any evidence whatever of importation of the narcotics nor of any knowledge on the part of the defendant of such importation. He bases his argument upon the fact that Emma Ludwig testified that she did not know the drugs had been imported or where they had come from. We do not think the contention is tenable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">\u201cIn the instant case possession of the heroin was admitted by the defendant Ludwig and the proof showed that none of the exhibits bore United States Government Revenue Stamps as required for all narcotic drugs manufactured in the United States. The statute under which the indictment is found declares that when, on trial for a violation thereof, the defendant is shown to have, or to have had, possession of the narcotic drugs, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize a conviction unless defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury. By force of the statute, possession of narcotics give rise to an inference that the narcotics were imported contrary to law and a further inference that the person in possession had knowledge of such unlawful importation. True it is, a defendant on trial may overcome these inferences by satisfactory proof that in his case possession of narcotics did not involve a violation of the statute, either because the narcotics were not imported contrary to law or because he had no knowledge of unlawful importation. The explanation of possession, however, if it is to serve the defendant\u2019s purpose, must not only be believed by the jury but must also be one that shows a possession lawful under the statute. United States v. Moe Liss, 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 144; and Biegler v. United States, 7 Cir., 86 F.2d 41.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">To the same effect are United States v. Cox, 2 Cir., 1960, 277 F.2d 302 (a case involving heroin) and Velasquez v. U. S., 10 Cir., 1957, 244 F.2d 416 (involving opium).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">Even if the <em>statutory </em>presumption of violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 arising from direct evidence of defendant\u2019s possession and sale of the heroin did not exist, where, as in the instant case, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>is a \u201crational connection between the facts proved and the ultimate fact presumed\u201d and the presumption is \u201cfounded not only in probability, but in the strongest social policy\u201d, and the facts are likely to be much more provable by the defendant than by the government, the presumption of the ultimate facts of violation does not disappear or vanish \u201con the appearance of counter evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this situation the better rule is expressed in Caudillo v. United States, supra, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201cAs to Caudillo\u2019s second point (the defeat of the presumption as a matter of law), two failings exist: First, his evidence is by no means conclusive and unrebutted * * * Second, if his theory were accepted and a jury chose to disbelieve his evidence, there would be no evidence upon which they could find for the government; whereas if there were no evidence produced by a defendant, a jury could convict. In other words, he must take the position that unbelieved rebutting facts are sufficient to destroy an otherwise valid inference. McCormick in his work on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 313-317, discusses this problem at great length and indicates that the better view taken by the cases (although there is no unanimity here) is that a valid inference remains even after there is rebutting evidence, either of the facts upon which the inference is based or those sought to be proved by it. The jury is entitled to consider it, and determine if, notwithstanding the rebutting evidence, the side relying on the inference has sustained his ultimate burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">And, aside from the statutory presumption of violation of Section 174 arising from the direct evidence of defendant\u2019s possession of heroin, the additional facts and circumstances introduced in evidence in this case constitute circumstantial evidence raising logical probative inferences that the ultimate facts of violation of Section 174 exist, as well as direct evidence of sales of narcotic drugs without order form in violation of Section 4705 of Title 26 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Defendant was convicted and sentenced generally, not for <em>one </em>offense but for <em>four; </em>the maximum sentence on one count is 40 years, and the minimum sentence on one count is 10 years, so that the defendant received the lightest possible sentence. It is fundamental that the judgment and \u201csentence will not be disturbed, even though there might be error in connection with one or more counts,\u201d just so long as it is valid as to any one of the counts. Estep v. U. S., 5 Cir., 223 F.2d 19, 21; Gore v. U. S., 100 U.S. App.D.C. 315, 244 F.2d 763, affirmed 357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Defendant\u2019s request for instruction No. 8 that the jury must be satisfied \u201cto a moral certainty that defendant is. guilty and in this connection you should take into consideration the character and conduct of each witness\u201d etc. was properly refused because the Court repeatedly instructed the jury that defendant was-presumed to be innocent, that \u201cthis presumption of innocence remains with him; throughout the trial of the case and applies to the consideration of each of the-essential ingredients going to make up. the offense charged, and until you, the-jury, are satisfied beyond a reasonable-doubt from the evidence adduced by the prosecution on whom, as I said before, is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the burden of proof of the guilt of the defendant as charged\u201d, and that \u201cyou are the exclusive judges of the facts proved, of the credibility of the witnesses and of the weight to be given this testimony * * * you can accept as true or reject as false, in whole or in part, the testimony of each and every witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 138, 99 L.Ed. 150, the Supreme Court stated that: \u201cif the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, we can require no more\u201d, and quotes from the opinion of Mr. Justice Woods in Miles v. United States, 103 U.S. 304, 312, 26 L.Ed. 481, to the effect that \u201cattempts to explain the term \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 do not usually result in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury.\u201d In Dunbar v. United States, 156 U.S. 185, 199, 15 S.Ct. 325, 330, 39 L.Ed. 390, the Supreme Court approved an instruction that \u201cby a reasonable doubt you are not to understand that all doubt is to be excluded. It is impossible in the determination of these questions to be absolutely certain\u201d. With respect to the \u201cmoral certainty\u201d charge McCormick on Evidence, p. 682 states: \u201cIt is an ancient maxim that all definitions are dangerous and this one has been caustically criticised as raising more questions than its answers and as giving an instrument to adroit defense counsel with which to play upon the fanciful doubts and exaggerated scruples of susceptible jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the court should have given an instruction to the jury that the \u201cinformer\u201d White\u2019s testimony \u201cbe scrutinized with special care\u201d is without merit. Initially, the defendant did not specifically mention \u201cinformer\u201d or request such an instruction, nor did he object to the charge given on this ground. When a proper request is clearly and specifically made and is not substantially covered in the charge it may be reversible error to refuse to give the charge. This court has so held in dealing with a specific request to caution the jury as to \u201caccomplice\u201d testimony. Phelps v. U. S., 5 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 49; Freed v. U. S., 49 App.D.C. 392, 266 F. 1012, 1017. But in those cases a specific request was made, and the charge considered as a whole was inadequate. Without a specific request or objection\u2014 the situation in the instant case \u2014 there is no reversible error. Northcraft v. U. S., 8 Cir., 271 F.2d 184, 185; Marbs v. U. S., 8 Cir., 250 F.2d 514; Mims v. U. S., 9 Cir., 254 F.2d 654; Johnson v. U. S., 81 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 157 F.2d 209; Estep v. U. S., 5 Cir., 223 F.2d 19; see Obery v. U. S., 95 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 217 F.2d 860. See also Siglar v. U. S., 5 Cir., 208 F.2d 865. Even defendant\u2019s own authority, Cratty v. U. S., 82 U.S. App.D.C. 236,163 F.2d 844, 850 expressly holds that \u201cin the absence of a request for an instruction on this subject, there is no reversible error.\u201d Defendant\u2019s authorities are further distinguishable from the instant case because in those cases \u201cthere was no corroboration of the informer\u2019s testimony.\u201d Cratty v. U. S., supra. In the instant case there was not only ample corroboration, but there was also no such requested instruction nor specific objection. The defendant was given broad latitude to prove credibility by cross examination and full opportunity to argue, and the issue of credibility was submitted to the jury with clear and careful instruction on their function as the sole judges of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The trial judge instructed the jury on every essential question in the case so as to properly advise it of the issues. The instructions contain definitions and explanations of the crimes charged in simple and accurate language. The judge read the pertinent portions of the statutes charged to have been violated which define the crimes and embody all the elements thereof in clear and explicit language.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>In United States v. Malfi, 3 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 147, 151, certiorari denied 361 U.S. 817, 80 S.Ct. 57, 4 L.Ed.2d 63, it is stated \u201cwhere an instruction described an offense \u2018in proper statutory language\u2019 and the \u2018primary law\u2019 was read \u2018We must assume that the jury was one of average intelligence * * * knew very well what was meant by the simple statutory words used to describe the offense * * and the instructions neither confused nor misled them,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthere was \u2018no merit in defendant\u2019s objections\u2019 to an instruction which \u2018simply quoted the * * * statute\u2019 \u201d. To the same effect are Maynard v. U. S., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 347, 215 F.2d 336, 339 cited by this court in Thompson v. U. S., 5 Cir., 272 F.2d 919, 922, and 23 C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7 1190, pp. 732-733 and \u00a7 1194, pp. 742-743.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">As to defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied due process of law because the trial judge, during the course of his argument, told counsel not to use the slang term \u201cstool pigeon\u201d, suffice it to say that the court did not prevent counsel from making the most scathing and disparaging characterization of the informer, painting him as one whose testimony was not credible. The judge\u2019s statement only served as a repetition and emphasis of White\u2019s status as an informer. And no prejudice or harm to the defendant resulted from the trial judge\u2019s subsequently warning counsel against future use of these words as the record shows it was done \u201cat the bench conference\u201d after the jury proceeded to the back of the courtroom \u201cout of hearing of the proceedings\u201d. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in Johnson v. U. S., 333 U.S. 46, 54, 68 S.Ct. 391, 395, 92 L.Ed. 468 stated that \u201cFederal judges are not referees at prize-fights but functionaries of justice. See Herron v. Southern Pacific Co., 283 U.S. 91, 95, 51 S.Ct. 383, 384, 75 L.Ed. 857; Quercia v. U. S., 289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed. 1321.\u201d It is not only within the province of the trial judge, but it is his duty to maintain decorum during the trial. See Henderson v. U. S., 6 Cir., 204 F.2d 126, Id., 6 Cir., 218 F.2d 14, 50 A.L.R.2d 754; United States v.

Failure of the trial judge to sustain decorum has even been held to be reversible error. Shapiro v. Kilgore Cleaning and Storage Co., 108 Ohio App. 402, 156 N.E.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Appellant\u2019s motions were properly overruled, the record contains no reversible error, and the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">. Both 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705 invoke the second offender \u2014 minimum sentence provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237. (Section 174 by its own language and Section 4705 by reference thereto in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b).) Defendant\u2019s prior conviction for the sale and possession of marihuana under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4742 and \u00a7 4744 (formerly 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2591(a) and Sec. 2593 of the 1939 Code) is a \u201cprior conviction\u201d under the second offender \u2014 minimum sentence provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(c). 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237 (c), which defines a second or subsequent offense for the purpose of the mandatory second offense 10 years sentences imposed in 7237(b) and 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, states that it includes prior convictions \u201cof any offense the penalty for which was provided in subsection (a) * * * of this section\u201d; and subsection (a) of Section 7237 fixes the penalty for the violation of offenses described in \u201cpart I or part II of subchapter A of Chapter 39.\u201d Defendant\u2019s prior conviction of sale and possession of marihuana was under Title 26, Chapter 39, part II of subchapter A. Therefore, one who has previously been convicted under either 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4742 or \u00a7 4744, as has defendant, and who is now convicted under either 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 or 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705 is subject to the 10 year minimum sentence. Phelps v. U. S., 5 Cir., 252 F.2d 49, 50, states: \u201c21 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 174 makes it a crime to bring \u2018any narcotic drug\u2019 into the United States contrary to law. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a relates specifically to smuggling marihuana * * *. For a second or subsequent offense (as determined under section 7237 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code\u2019 of 1954), the offender shall be imprisoned for not less than ten or more than forty years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\">.
