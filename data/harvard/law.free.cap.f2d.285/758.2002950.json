A petition to the sentencing \u2022 court for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was denied and a petition to appeal in forma pauperis was also denied. The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the relief afforded under \u00a7 2255 was not shown to be inadequate or ineffective and was, therefore, his exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">While the petitioner here alleges -that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate and ineffective, the record shows that all the asserted grounds for relief \u25a0are plainly cognizable under \u00a7 2255 and the fact that relief was denied in his pevtition to the sentencing court does not entitle him to re-try his case in this habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-17\">Section 2255 is intended to provide the exclusive remedy for testing the validity of a judgment and sentence in the federal courts, unless the remedy afforded under that act is shown to be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d and the remedy is not inadequate or ineffective simply because the petitioner has unsuccessfully sought relief under it.
