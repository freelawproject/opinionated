On October 15, 1959, the defendant issued an order that the plaintiff should show cause why he should not be deported for \u201cindecent .assault\u201d and exposing a child to the impairment of his morals, for both of which he had been sentenced in the Superior Court of Hartford, Connecticut, and each \u25a0of which was a crime involving \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d The case was referred to a Special Inquiry Officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, before whom it appeared that the plaintiff admitted that he was born in Italy, and was .a citizen of that country, that he was \u2022married and had three children, none of whom were citizens of the United States, .and that on February 21, 1959, in Plain-field, Connecticut, he was arrested \u201cfor trouble with a boy according to what he .said but it isn\u2019t true.\u201d He conceded that he had been the subject of the \u201cinformation, conviction and sentence\u201d of the \u25a0Connecticut court; but added that the \u25a0charge was untrue. On November 30th the Special Inquiry Officer found that the plaintiff had been guilty under \u00a7 53-217 of the General Statutes of Connecticut of the crime of \u201cindecent assault,\u201d and the defendant ordered him to be deported. On January 25th the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed an appeal from this order, upon which the defendant again ordered deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">In the action at bar Judge Smith had before him the complaint, the answer and the record of the proceedings before the Immigration and Naturalization Service; and he held that the conviction was for a crime involving \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d within \u00a7 1251(a) (4) of Title 8, and not only denied a motion for preliminary injunction, but dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The record before Judge Smith does not contain a copy of the \u201cinformation\u201d filed in the Connecticut court, but the \u25a0substance of it appears in the judgment of that court which alleged that the plaintiff had been found guilty of \u201can indecent assault,\u201d and further that he did place a child under the age of sixteen years in such a situation that his morals were likely to be impaired.\u201d It was to both counts of this \u201cinformation\u201d that the plaintiff had pleaded guilty in the state court and he was sentenced under both counts, the \u201csentences to run concurrently.\u201d As it is not suggested that the \u201cinformation\u201d was for offences against separate persons the question before us is whether either count after a plea of guilty was sufficient to support the order of deportation; and that depends upon whether a conviction under either count presupposes \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d in the offender. From the two counts it appears that the subject of the \u201cindecent assault\u201d was a boy \u201cunder the age of sixteen years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The phrase of the Connecticut statute, \u201cindecent assault,\u201d covers a good many offences, and its use of the word, \u201cassault,\u201d does not mean that there must have been violence or the threat of violence. The statute itself (\u00a7 53-217 General Statutes), provides that \u201cit shall be no defense * * * under this section that the person assaulted consents to the act of violence or to the act of indecency,\u201d and in State v. Chicorelli, 129 Conn. 601, 30 A.2d 544, the Connecticut Supreme Court said that \u201cthis statute was evidently not drawn with a high regard for legal technicality in the expressions used. The word, \u2018assault,\u2019 for example, was obviously not intended to be given its technical meaning, of an offer or threat of violence to the person of another, as distinguished from the actual application of that violence * * * for it was clearly the intention to include the indecent touching of the body of another.\u201d It appears that the plaintiff was charged at least with the act of touching a boy under the age of sixteen with an indecent intent, which clearly meant a sexual intent. If so, it was at least a homosexual advance and under the law of Connecticut homosexual congress is a crime (General Statutes \u00a7 53-216), as indeed it is everywhere, so far as we know, when the advance is made to a juvenile. We have no doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>that such a crime as here charged against the appellant involves moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">It follows that, it is not necessary to reconsider what we laid down in United States ex rel. Zaffarano v. Corsi, <em>2 </em>Cir., 63 F.2d 757: i. e., that in reviewing an order of deportation we may not look beyond the indictment, the plea, the verdict and the sentence. The charge against a man of mature years of touching a boy under sixteen with sexual intent was a charge of crime involving \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d as that term is generally understood. Thus, the question does not arise whether we may look to the evidence before the court that sentenced the alien to ascertain whether the sentence brought him within the deportation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
