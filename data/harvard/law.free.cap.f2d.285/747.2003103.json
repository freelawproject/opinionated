The judgment is based upon the further finding that the designation by the defendants of its product as \u201cTapercap\u201d or \u201cPlug Cap\u201d in its catalogue, packing slips and invoices, was confusingly similar to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cTapered Caplugs\u201d; and that these aforesaid acts are \u201clikely to deceive and to confuse purchasers as to the source of defendant\u2019s closures,\u201d and therefore constitute a deceptive combination and evidence a deliberate intention to trade upon plaintiff\u2019s good will, to the defendant\u2019s unjust enrichment and the plaintiff\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The appellants do not deny these basic facts, indeed they do not deny that their products are substantially indistinguishable from and interchangeable with appellee\u2019s corresponding product. Their defense rather is in the nature of confession and avoidance, to the effect that the appellee can acquire no secondary meaning in the source of its product; and that they appropriated nothing not already in the public domain or which the law of unfair trade practices will protect. More particularly, they say that the color red which distinguishes the appellee\u2019s product, being basic and generic, is not susceptible of a protectable secondary meaning and moreover, as used in this product is at least partly functional. As to the catalogue simulation, appellants take the position that they did no more than project an industrially standardized description of that which was in the public domain in a manner to best serve the public\u2019s interest in it. They liken these closures to \u201cnails, bolts, nuts, screws, etc.,\u201d which are completely standardized and capable of but one description. And finally they point to the fact of having ceased publishing the copied catalogue and having destroyed all available copies along with the printing plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">The appellee claims no patent or copyright in the products, rather it bases its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>claim squarely upon a secondary meaning in the source of the product and a palming off of appellant\u2019s product as that of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"> It seems to be now established beyond any doubt that one cannot acquire a secondary meaning in a basic color to identify or distinguish the source of an article of trade. The underlying reason is that basic colors, as well as functional shapes and designs, are generic and necessarily belong to the public. See Norwich Pharmacal Co. v. Sterling, 2 Cir., 271 F.2d 569; 52 Am.Jur., Trademarks \u00a7 48, and authorities cited. Even though the color red, or some other basic color, when used in combination with words, letters or figures to form a distinctive nonfunctional symbol or design may be susceptible of a secondary meaning, it cannot be such when, as here, it is used in combination with the structure, shape and design of the article it identifies. Annotation 150 A.L.R. 1111; Radio Corporation of America v. Decca., D.C., 51 F.Supp. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"> But quite apart from a secondary meaning in a product or article of trade, the law has always forbidden one trader to pass off his article of trade as that of a rival trader. Restatement of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 711, 712; Nims, Law of Unfair Competition and Trademarks, Vol. 1, p. 52; International News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215, 39 S.Ct. 68, 63 L.Ed. 211. \u201cDeceit is the basis of an action of this character. The principle underlying unfair trade practice cases is that one manufacturer or vendor is palming off his merchandise as that of another * * * or that he is vending the products of another as his own * * Reynolds &amp; Reynolds v. Norick, 10 Cir., 114 F.2d 278, 281. Since these articles in suit are not protected by copyright, patent or the indicia of a secondary meaning, they belong to the public, and the defendants, or anyone else, are consequently free to make and sell them subject \u201conly the obligation to identify their products in such manner that they will not reasonably be taken for those of plaintiff.\u201d In other words, the defendants are under a duty to mark or designate their products so that \u201c * * * purchasers exercising ordinary care to discover whose products they are buying will know the truth and not become confused or mistaken.\u201d Id., 114 F.2d at page 281; see also Kellogg Company v. National Biscuit, 305 U.S. 111, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The complete absence of any identifying marks on the defendants\u2019 products, except the stock numbers which tended to identify them as coming from the appellee, coupled with the deliberate and studied copying of appellee\u2019s catalogue, including phonetically similar captions and descriptive illustrations, is entirely sufficient to justify the finding that such acts or omissions are likely to deceive and confuse purchasers as to the source of the defendants\u2019 products, and evidences a deliberate scheme to palm off their goods as those of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to a decree adapted \u201cto the general equities of the particular situation,\u201d J. C. Penney Co. v. H. D. Lee Mercantile Co., 8 Cir., 120 F.2d 949, 958, including restitution for unjust enrichment based upon an accounting of the corporate defendant\u2019s profits during the period of the unfair trade practices. Blue Bell Co. v. Frontier Refining Co., 10 Cir., 213 F.2d 354. We hold therefore that (1) the defendants are free to make and sell the same products made and sold by the plaintiff, subject only to the obligation to identify them in a manner to avoid deceptive similarity; and (2) the plaintiff is entitled to an accounting during the period of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">We leave to the trial court the province of fashioning a decree affording injunctive relief and restitution in accordance with these views.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">The judgment of the trial court is therefore vacated and the cause remanded for that purpose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\">. Tlie article in suit is technically described as a red \u201cclosure comprising in its unmounted condition a single polyethylene body having a circular end wall, an enlarging frustoeonical side wall projecting axially from the margin of said end wall and an annular flange projecting radially outwardly from the rim of said side wall.\u201d The articles were designed and used as protective coverings and plugs for threaded pipe, tubing, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
