The appeal is based on the assertion that Hong Kong, a colony of the United Kingdom, is not a \u201ccountry\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 243(a) (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a) (7), under which deportation is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-17\">The word \u201ccountry\u201d has no fixed meaning, and should be construed in accordance with the purpose of the particular legislation. Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., 285 U.S. 1, 52 S.Ct. 275, 76 L.Ed. 587. Section 243(a) (7), in authorizing deportation \u201cto any country which is willing to accept such alien into its territory,\u201d is obviously intended to avoid arbitrary restrictions on the places to which a deportable alien may be sent. In line with the general Congressional policy of facilitating the deportation of deport-able aliens, see Conf. Rep. No. 3112, Sept. 19, 1950, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S. Code Cong.Serv., pp. 3899, 3911 (1950), we think that any place possessing a government with authority to accept an alien deported from the United States can qualify as a \u201ccountry\u201d under the statute. Whatever the distribution of power between Hong Kong\u2019s local, partially autonomous government and Great Britain, Hong Kong is a \u201ccountry\u201d under the above definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
