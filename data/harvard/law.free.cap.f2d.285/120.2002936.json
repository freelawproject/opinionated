There was dispute as to the value of the property insured. The trial court, passing upon conflicting evidence, awarded appellant $7,500. This was a claim, \u201cuncertain as to amount due\u201d until the-court\u2019s decision was made. No interest was due her until the uncertain amount, was determined. Appellee was also liable-in the undisputed sum of $150 for loss, of rental of the premises destroyed by-fire. This figure was certain in amount at all times, and undisputed after proof of loss was made. Appellant is entitled; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to interest at the legal rate of $150 from .April 5, 1957 (sixty days after filing proof of loss), until payment. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. Each \u2022side is to bear its costs on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
