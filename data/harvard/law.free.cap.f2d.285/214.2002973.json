The presumption would be against prejudice if suit had been brought during the legal period of limitations. No allegations were made in the libel in an effort to illuminate the issue, but the court held a hearing, at which there was no showing sufficient to excuse or justify the delay, or to negative prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">For the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s opinion, 190 F.Supp. 137, the order of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
