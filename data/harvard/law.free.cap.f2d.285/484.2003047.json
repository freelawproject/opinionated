Anderson v. Corporation Comm., Okl., 327 P.2d 699. An appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States was dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. Anderson v. Corporation Comm., 358 U.S. 642, 79 S.Ct. 536, 3 L.Ed.2d 567. The complaint sets forth the entire proceedings before the Commission; alleges that the plaintiff Anderson was the owner of a portion of the unit; and, although admitting that the offer was made after the time fixed in the order, alleges that Anderson had offered to pay his proportionate share of the cost of drilling and completing the well. It was asserted in the complaint that the Commission unlawfully assumed judicial powers not granted by law and was without authority to divest an owner of an interest in a drilling unit of that interest. The complaint sought a judgment declaring that Anderson was the owner of an undivided interest in the unit and entitled to receive his share of the oil and gas produced therefrom. There were no material issues of fact, and the matter was submitted to the trial court on the several motions of the parties for summary judgment. This is an appeal from an order dismissing the action after consideration of those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">In 1953 the Corporation Commission established 80-acre drilling and spacing units for the Bromide Sand Section of the Simpson formation in McClain County, Oklahoma. Anderson owned 36.9% of the minerals under one 40-acre tract which constituted one-half of the drilling unit, and the defendant Ellison owned 25.2% of the leasehold in the adjoining 40 acres which constituted the other half of the unit. In 1955 Ellison applied to the Commission for an order pooling and fixing the rights and interests of all parties holding interests in the unit. The application alleged that all the owners except Anderson agreed upon a plan of development. After a hearing, the Commission designated Ellison as the operator of the unit, and authorized him to drill a well at an estimated cost of $300,000. The spacing order provided that the well should be located on the acreage in which Ellison owned an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Although Anderson, in his response to Ellison\u2019s application stated that he did not desire to participate in the costs of drilling the well, the Commission\u2019s order permitted him to participat\u00e9 and retain a working interest by electing to pay his proportionate share of the drilling and completion costs. In the alternative, the order provided that Anderson could elect to accept a bonus for a lease of his undivided interest, and the Commission found that $800 per acre was the reasonable bonus value of the leasehold interests in the unit. The order also provided that if Anderson did not make an election within 30 days, it would be presumed that he had elected to accept the $800 per acre bonus for the interest owned by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">Anderson took an appeal to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, but no attempt was made to supersede the Commission\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the appeal was pending, Ellison proceeded to drill the authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>well and completed it as a producer. Thereafter the Commission denied Anderson\u2019s request to fix the amount of his proportionate share of the cost of the well, which he then offered to pay. Anderson contends that the present action, instead of being a collateral attack upon the Commission\u2019s order, is brought for the purpose of obtaining a decree declaring that the order does not divest him of his interest in the unit and that he is still the owner thereof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The well was drilled on the half of the unit in which Anderson had no interest. Without the spacing statute and the Commission\u2019s pooling order he would have no right to share in the oil and gas produced from the well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Davis, 194 Okl. 84, 147 P.2d 135; Amis v. Bryan Petroleum Corp., 185 Okl. 206, 90 P.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Title 52 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 87.1 provides that \u201cAll orders requiring such pooling shall be made after notice and hearing, and shall be upon such terms and conditions as are just and reasonable and will afford to the owner of such tract in the unit the opportunity to recover or receive without unnecessary expense his just and fair share of the oil and gas. * * * \u201d The statute also states, \u201cSuch pooling order of the Commission shall make definite provisions for the payment of costs of the development and operation, which shall be limited to the actual expenditures required for such purpose not in excess of what are reasonable, including a reasonable charge for supervision. In the event of any dispute relative to such costs, the Commission shall determine the proper costs after due notice to interested parties and a hearing thereon. * * * \u201d The constitutionality of the statute as an exercise of the state\u2019s police power is no longer open to question. Hunter Co. v. McHugh, 320 U.S. 222, 64 S.Ct. 19, 88 L.Ed. 5; Wakefield v. State, Okl., 306 P.2d 305; Patterson v. Stanolind Oil &amp; Gas Co., 182 Okl. 155, 77 P.2d 83, appeal dismissed 305 U.S. 376, 59 S.Ct. 259, 83 L.Ed. 231. The Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s syllabus<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to its decision upholding the Commission\u2019s order in this case is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">\u201c1. By the provisions of 52 O.S. 1951, sec. 87.1, the Corporation Commission is authorized to fix the proportionate part of the cost of drilling and completing an oil and gas well to be paid by an owner of an undivided part interest in the leasehold estate in a drilling unit and order such owner to elect to pay the same or to accept a fixed sum per acre as a bonus for a lease and to further order that, if the election is not made within a fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>time, it be presumed that he has elected to take the bonus for a lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">\u201c2. Section 87.1 of Tit. 52 O.S. 1951, is not in conflict with the State or Federal Constitutions guaranteeing that private property shall not be taken for private use nor without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u201c3. A statute authorizing the Corporation Commission to regulate production of oil and gas so as to prevent waste and to secure equitable apportionment among owners of the leasehold interest of the oil and gas underlying their land, and to fairly distribute among them, the costs of production and of the apportionment is a proper exercise of the police power and does not violate the provisions of the State or Federal Constitutions.\u201d Anderson v. Corporation Comm., supra, 327 P.2d at page 700.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Although Anderson advances a theory that there remains to be decided the question of whether the Commission\u2019s order had the effect of divesting him of his previously vested interest in the unit and transferring the same to Ellison, we think the Oklahoma Supreme Court settled this and other questions as to his rights, and that this action is an attempt to relitigate the same issues. In unmistakable language, the result of the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s decision is that, except for his royalty interest, Anderson lost his right to receive a percentage of the production. He is limited to a recovery of the lease bonus fixed by the Commission,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and further action is unnecessary. Nothing remains to be done to comply with the order except the payment of the bonus to Anderson, and it has been tendered. The effect of the order was not stayed pending the appeal in the absence of complianee with the statutory provisions. The order of the Commission, without a supersedeas bond, may not be disregarded pending an appeal. 52 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 113; Amis v. Bryan Petroleum Corp., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\">. In his brief, Anderson states: \u201cThe comprehensive legal issue is whether or not a certain Order of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission had the authoritative effect of divesting Appellant of his previously vested interest in the \u2018unit\u2019 and of transferring that valuable property right to the Appellee Ellison as claimed by the latter and his grantees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\">. In discussing the relationship of the owners of unit interests, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma said:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\u201cThe limitation of co-tenancy rights and privileges of some of the mineral owners is no greater burden on them than is tbe limitation of the rights and privileges of capture of the operating mineral owners. In the case at bar, Anderson, had no more justification for complaint of being required to elect whether to pay his portion of the costs or accept the fixed bonus for a lease, than Ellison had to complain of being required to share with him the object of his capture \u2014 the production from the well. Both were prerequisites to other rights and privileges granted by the same order under authority of the same statute.\u201d Anderson v. Corporation Comm., Okl., 327 P.2d 699, 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-14\">.
