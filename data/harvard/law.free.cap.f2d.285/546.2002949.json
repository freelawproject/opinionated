Plaintiffs are music publishers, and each of them is the owner of the copyright of a popular song, Reeve\u2019s song being entitled \u201cI\u2019m In Love Again,\u201d and Robbins\u2019 \u201cToo Young To Go Steady.\u201d Each plaintiff has permitted persons other than the defendants to reproduce its song on phonograph records. Consequently, the defendants might have acquired a compulsory license to reproduce the songs by complying with the provisions of sections 1(e) and 101(e) of the Act, 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1(e), 101(e) but neither defendant made any attempt to do so. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint charged the defendants with infringement and sought damages and an injunction. Each plaintiff moved under F.R.Civ.P. Rule 56, 28 U.S.C.A., for summary judgment, and Judge Abruzzo granted the motions in an opinion, D.C., 190 F.Supp. 272. He gave judgment in favor of each plaintiff \u201con the issue of liability,\u201d referred the cause to a special master to \u201cascertain the royalties and any further sum by way of damages to which each of plaintiffs may be entitled, and report to this Court thereon,\u201d and enjoined the defendants, \u201cuntil the further order of this Court, from manufacturing, or participating or being concerned in the manufacture of any parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically said copyrighted musical compositions of plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-17\">Although neither party has raised any question as to appellate jurisdiction, the court is constrained to do so. It is clear under the authorities that the reference to a master to ascertain damages and report back renders the judgment interlocutory, and that only the propriety of the temporary injunction can be considered by us on this appeal. Sheldon v. Moredall Realty Corp., 2 Cir., 95 F.2d 48; Zwack v. Kraus Bros., 2 Cir., 237 F.2d 255, 262, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">The defendants are affiliated corporations to whoimwe shall refer respectively as Crest and Shelley. They conducted their operations at the same address in Huntington Station, N. Y. Crest produced the \u201cmaster stamper\u201d which Shel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ley used to \u201cpress\u201d a number of records which included the plaintiffs\u2019 songs. Each defendant contends that it was acting as a subcontractor for Solitaire Recording Co., Ltd., a Canadian corporation, which was not a party to plaintiffs\u2019 action, and that neither manufactured the infringing records within the meaning of \u00a7 101(e) which, <em>inter alia, </em>empowers the court to grant an injunction against copyright infringement by the \u201cunauthorized manufacture, use, or sale of interchangeable parts, such as disks, rolls, bands, or cylinders for use in mechanical music-producing machines adapted to reproduce the copyrighted music.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The defendants contend that their position is supported by G. Ricordi &amp; Co. v. Columbia Gramophone Co., D.C.N.Y., 270 F. 822, 826 and Edward B. Marks Music Co. v. Foullon, D.C.N.Y., 79 F.Supp. 664, affirmed, 2 Cir., 171 F.2d 905. We do not agree. Ricordi lists nine steps in the making of a phonograph record. It was found that the defendant took the first eight of these nine steps and the court ruled that such a defendant, who takes steps \u201cessential\u201d to manufacture, is a manufacturer \u201cwithin the intent and meaning of the copyright statute.\u201d This is not a holding, as the defendants seem to believe, that all the first eight steps must be taken to constitute a defendant a manufacturer. Shelley relies upon the Marks case as establishing that a defendant who performs only the ninth step, as Shelley did here, is not a manufacturer; but there the court, in dismissing as to Bard, was dealing with the meaning of \u201cmanufacturer\u201d for purposes of the statutory royalty imposed upon authorized \u201cmanufacturers\u201d by \u00a7 1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Under \u00a7 101(e), on the other hand, \u201cmanufacture\u201d is an act of infringement, and \u201ccourts have long recognized that infringement of a copyright is a tort, and all persons concerned therein are jointly and severally liable as such joint tort-feasors.\u201d Ted Browne Music Co. v. Fowler, 2 Cir., 290 F. 751, 754. We think it plain that here, whether or not the separate act performed by each defendant constitutes \u201cmanufacture,\u201d the two defendants, acting in concert, \u201cmanufactured\u201d the infringing discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Therefore, that part of Judge Abruzzo\u2019s order which enjoins the defendants from continuing their conduct in regard' to these two songs is affirmed, although appeal from other parts of his order must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
