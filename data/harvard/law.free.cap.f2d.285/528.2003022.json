He says that the court emphasized -the elements of the offense, particularly by defining the element of asportation. The District Judge was required to do so, and his definition of asportation was extremely pertinent in light of the emphasis by the defense upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the fact that the property had not been removed from the Navy Yard.</p>\n<p id=\"ApN\">There is no contention that the charge was in any way incorrect.
