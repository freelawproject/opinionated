The plaintiff thereupon filed a motion in the district court in which it recited that the defendant was without discoverable assets, but was employed by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority on a monthly salary, wherefore plaintiff requested an order compelling defendant to pay $70 a month until its judgment was paid and satisfied.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion, 181 F. Supp. 366 and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">The plaintiff\u2019s brief is largely directed to a claim that the court abused its discretion. The court did not consider this a matter of discretion, nor do we. Garnishment of future wages by order against any employer is unknown in Puerto Rico. This is because unearned' wages are not property. Diego Ag\u00fceros- &amp; Co. v. Heres, 1936, 50 P.R.R. 510; Rodriguez v. Fontes, 1937, 51 P.R.R. 648. Hence it may well be, as plaintiff contends, that its only effectual remedy against defendant would be a continuing court order directed against the defendant under which she would be in contempt for failure to pay. However, the-United States District Court is not a collection agency. It is true that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a), 28 U.S.C. provides that the court, \u201cin proceedings- * * * in aid of a judgment and * * * on and in aid of execution shall be in accordance with the practice and procedure of the state in which the district court is held,\u201d and that under Puerto Rico Rule 51.4, (Rules of Civil Procedure for the General Court of Justice, 1958) \u201cthe court may make any order which it considers just and necessary for the execution of a judgment.\u201d But it is clear from an examination of this and its companion local rules, as well as the predecessor statutory provisions, T. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 1211-1218, that the contemplated orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>relate solely to execution and levy, and not to the more general issue of satisfaction of judgments. In other words, the concern of the court thereunder is with attachable property and how it may \"be come by, and does not include in personam orders such as this, either to the \u25a0defendant or anyone else, with respect to property not yet in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Judgment will be entered affirming the \u25a0order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-13\"> This figure was computed as one-quarter of defendant\u2019s salary, as three-quarters of all earnings for personal services are exempt from execution under the Laws of Puerto Rico, T. 32, \u00a7 1130.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
