The motion was denied by Judge MacMahon in a memorandum order. of June 28, 1960 because the defendants had failed to specify the names and addresses of the witnesses whose convenience might be served by the transfer. Judge MacMahon stated in his memorandum order that the motion was denied \u201cwithout leave to renew,\u201d and in a supplemental long form order of July 13, 1960 that the denial was \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">The United States Lines now moves in this court for a writ of mandamus or prohibition ordering Judge MacMahon to strike from his orders the language which prevents a renewal of its motion to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-19\">The writ is granted with directions to strike from the memorandum of June 28, 1960 the words \u201cwithout leave to renew,\u201d and to strike from the district court\u2019s order of July 13, 1960 the words \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d The district court is not precluded from hearing and considering any subsequent motion, if made, for transfer on the facts then presented. Cf. Sypert v. Miner, 7 Cir., 266 F.2d 196, certiorari denied, 1959, 361 U.S. 832, 80 S.Ct. 82, 4 L.Ed.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-20\">It may well be that facts will be developed in the course of pre-trial procedures which would furnish grounds for further consideration of a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
