Thereafter, the Tax Court, in an effort to carry out our mandate, made a redetermination of the petitioners\u2019 liability and entered decision accordingly. That decision was entered May 20, 1960 and the present petition for review was not filed in the Tax Court until June 29, 1960, more than 30 days later. However, on June 9, 1960, petitioners had filed a petition for a writ of <em>procedendo </em>in this court, in an effort to compel the Tax Court to change its determination in a way certainly not commanded by this court. We found the procedure inappropriate in the circumstances and, on June 22, 1960, dismissed the petition. The present petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Section 7481(3) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7481(3) (B), provides that the Tax Court\u2019s decision as reached and entered on and pursuant to remand from a court of appeals \u201cshall become final on the expiration of 30 days from the time such decision of the Tax Court was rendered, unless within such 30 days either the Secretary or his delegate or the taxpayer has instituted proceedings to have such decision corrected so that it will accord with the mandate, in which event the decision of the Tax Court shall become final when so corrected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Under this subsection only the initiation of a proper reviewing procedure within 30 days can prevent the decision from becoming final. See Crews v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 1941, 120 F.2d 749. This court has already held that the petition for <em>procedendo </em>was not appropriate. Nothing else was done within the thirty day period. Accordingly, the present petition was filed too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">We have considered petitioners\u2019 argument that the mandate of this court effectuating a partial reversal of the Tax Court on first appeal in substance directed a rehearing in the Tax Court, and that a petition to review a Tax Court decision rendered on rehearing is timely under Section 7481(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, if filed within 90 days. However, we are not persuaded that t\u00ediis court\u2019s action, as reported at 269 F.2d 911, was in substance a direction to grant a rehearing in the Tax Court. Accordingly, Section 7481(4) is, in our view, inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">The present proceeding will be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
