S. C.,</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">Temporarily Assigned. The Division of Tax Appeals entered a judgment imposing liability on appellant to pay taxes under the New Jersey Unincorporated Business Tax Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:11B-1 <em>et seq. </em>(sometimes hereafter referred to as \u201cthe act\u201d), for its taxable years ending August 31, 1967 and 1968, respectively. The Division held that appellant was taxable as a \u201cbusiness\u201d as that term is used in the act. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Appellant was organized on August 1, 1952 by agreement as a New Jersey partnership for the purpose of acquiring and holding title to a 33-story office building, the National Newark Building at 744 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey. At is inception appellant consisted of 20 individuals, each of whom contributed $110,000 to the partnership capital. Under the agreement, any two partners may execute a lease of the property; partnership interests may be sold and transferred; and the partnership is to continue on the death of any partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">On September 2, 1952 appellant entered into an agreement with another New Jersey partnership, 744 Broad Street Bealty Associates (Broad Street), leasing the entire National Newark Building to Broad Street for a term of 25 years, with an option to renew for another 25 years, at an annual rent of $736,000 payable in equal monthly installments of $61,333.64. On October 1, 1962 appellant purchased an adjacent parcel of land used as an open-air parking lot, and simultaneously leased it to Broad Street at an annual rental of $11,500 for a period coterminous with the lease of the National Newark Building. Both leases will be referred to hereafter as \u201cthe lease.\u201d The lease permits the lessee to terminate the tenancy at any time on 60 days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The lease is a \u201cnet lease.\u201d Appellant receives the rental free from all taxes, charges or expenses of any kind. Broad Street, the lessee, is required to operate and manage the property, collect all rents, pay all taxes, charges, operating and maintenance expenses, insurance premiums, and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of repairs, improvements and replacements. Broad Street is permitted to assign the lease and sublet. Accordingly, at no time has appellant ever operated or managed either the building or the parking lot or rendered any services to any tenant or subtenant. Broad Street has taken possession and has sublet the premises to various tenants. Appellant\u2019s activities have consisted solely of maintaining its existence as a partnership and filing such documents as are required of it by law, accepting the net rent and depositing it in its bank account, making the required payments to the mortgagee, and distributing to the partners the net proceeds. It has no employees. Its required accounting, legal and other partnership supervisory acts are performed by its attorneys at a stated fee of $12,000 a year, plus, apparently, disbursements for accounting fees. At the time of the instant controversy appellant\u2019s partners had increased from 20 to 54. At August 31, 1968 the partnership assets were about $5,500,000 and the partners\u2019 capital account was about $1,000,000. For the tax year ended August 31, 1968, it had gross income of $659,888.99, net income of $153,338.36 and an expenditure of $15,499.93 for \u201clegal and accounting fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The Unincorporated Business Tax Act was enacted in 1966 and imposes</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">* * * Upon every individual or other unincorporated entity engaged in an unincorporated business an annual excise tax, measured by the gross receipts of such unincorporated business, and allocated to the State as hereinafter provided at the rate of % of <em>1%; * * *. [N. J. B. A. </em>54 \u00a111B-3]</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:llB-2(e) reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cUnincorporated business\u201d shall mean and include any trade, business, profession or occupation conducted or practiced for profit in whole or in part within this State by any individual or other unincorporated entity not subject to the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945) (P. <em>L. </em>1945, c. 162) or the Financial Business Tax Daw (1946) (P. <em>L. </em>1946, c. 174), except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ii. An individual or other unincorporated entity, except a dealer holding property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his or its trade or business, shall not be deemed engaged in an unincorporated business solely by reason of the purchase, sale or exchange of property for his or its own account, but this subparagraph shall not apply if the unincorporated entity is taxable as a corporation for Federal Income Tax purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether the Legislature intended the kind of real property activities engaged in by appellant to render it an \u201cunincorporated business\u201d as that term is used in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54-.11B-1 <em>et seq. </em>It is taxable under that act only if it is a business.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The Division of Tax Appeals found appellant\u2019s operation was an \u201cunincorporated business\u201d and thus subject to the tax. In so deciding the judge appeared to place weight on two factors: (1) the replacement tax program, <em>L. </em>1966, <em>cc. </em>133 to 138, of which the Unincorporated Business Tax Act is a part, was intended by the Legislature to impose a business tax on all sectors of the business community (see <em>Foosaner v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>57 (1971)); (2) <em>N. J. S. A. </em>42:1-6(1) defines a partnership as \u201can association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners <em>a business for profit\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). We find neither rationale persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The mere fact that the Legislature may have intended the entire business community of the State to share in some way in the payment of business taxes does not aid in the determination of whether, in the first instance, it contemplated that a particular activity be considered a \u201cbusiness\u201d under the act. There can be no doubt that some activities conducted for profit were not intended to be subject to this tax. If this were not so, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:11B-2(e) would have defined \u201cunincorporated business\u201d as meaning and including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201cany [activity] conducted or practiced for profit * * *,\u201d rather than as a \u201ctrade, business, profession or occupation\u201d so conducted. The reliance on the legislative definition of partnership found in the Partnership Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>42:1-1 <em>et seq., </em>as a business for profit\u201d was misplaced. The tax statute applies to a business, irrespective of whether it is operated in an individual or partnership capacity. Additionally, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:11B-1 <em>et seq. </em>and the Partnership Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>42:1-1 <em>et seq., </em>are not <em>in pari materia, </em>nor are they statutes on cognate subjects. See <em>State v. Brown, </em>22 <em>N. J. </em>405, 415 (1956); <em>Aviation Services v. Hanover Tp. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>275, 285 (1956). Further, a corporation is organized for the purpose of doing business, and, as hereinafter discussed, corporations have been held under certain circumstances not to be engaged in business. And subparagraph (ii) of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:11B-2(e) specifically provides that, except for a dealer, an individual or other unincorporated entity \u201cshall not be deemed engaged in an unincorporated business solely by reason of the purchase, sale or exchange of property for his or <em>its </em>own account\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Appellant conceives of itself merely as a passive investor rather than a business. On the limited record before us, we conclude that it is correct and thus is not subject to the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Prior to the enactment in 1966 of the Unincorporated Business Tax Act there existed a judicially well-established principle in tax law that distinguished between the ownership of property and the passive receipt of income therefrom, on the one hand, and activities connected with such ownership that constituted a business. Generally, it was held that one who actively participates, directly or indirectly \u2014 <em>e. g., </em>through an agent \u2014 in the management of property he owns is in business, while one who allocates such management to others and himself performs only such acts as are appropriate to safeguard his ownership, including distribution of income received from the property, is not. The latter is considered an investor who passively receives income. The determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tion of the issue, of course, depends upon the facts of the particular case. <em>Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., </em>242 <em>U. S. </em>503, 516, 37 <em>S. Ct. </em>201, 61 <em>L. Ed. </em>460 (1917); <em>Whipple v. Commissioner, </em>373 <em>U. S. </em>193, 197, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1168, 1171, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 288 (1963); <em>Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. </em>107, 31 <em>S. Ct. </em>342, 55 <em>L. Ed. </em>389 (1911); <em>Zonne v. Minneapolis Syndicate, </em>220 <em>U. S. </em>187, 31 <em>S. Ct. </em>361, 55 <em>L. Ed. </em>428 (1911). <em>Flint, supra, </em>early defined \u201cbusiness\u201d as that \u201c \u2018which occupies the time, attention and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or profit,\u2019 \u201d 220 <em>U. S. </em>at 171, 31 S. Ct. at 357. The emphasis is on an active role in the production of profit. See concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>District of Columbia v. Brady, </em>109 U. S. App. D. C. 324, 288 <em>F. </em>2d 108, 120 (D. C. Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Thus, the federal capital stock tax<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposed a tax on corporations engaged in business. A line of cases decided thereunder holds that the enjoyment of the passive benefits, of ownership of real property does not constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d for tax purposes. In the cases that found the corporation not engaged in business and thus not subject to the capital stock tax, the taxpayer did not operate or manage the leased premises. Bather, the situations involved either net leases or circumstances akin thereto. See, <em>e. g., United States v. Emery, </em>237 <em>U. S. </em>28, 35 <em>S. Ct. </em>499, 59 <em>L. Ed. </em>825 (1915); <em>McCoach v. Minehill Ry., </em>228 <em>U. S. </em>295, 33 <em>S. Ct. </em>419, 57 <em>L. Ed. </em>842 (1913); <em>Zonne v. Minneapolis Syndicate, supra; Kingkade Hotel Co. v. Jones, </em>30 <em>F. Supp. </em>508 (W. D. Okl. 1939), app. dism., 108 <em>F. </em>2d 1015 (10 Cir. 1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The State argues that the persuasiveness of the above cases is tempered by subsequent Federal court rulings involving the same statute. <em>We </em>disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In <em>Edwards v. Chile Copper Co., </em>270 <em>U. S. </em>452, 46 <em>S. Ct. </em>345, 70 <em>L. Ed. </em>678 (1926), plaintiff corporation was or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ganized for the purpose of supplying funds to a second corporation which owned mines but needed money to operate them. Plaintiff held the capital stock of the other corporation, issued bonds secured by the pledge of the stock, and furnished the proceeds from time to time to that corporation. Thus, plaintiff owned and voted the stock of the mining corporation and elected its directors. It is true, as the State points out, that the court, in finding plaintiff liable for the tax, placed reliance on the fact that it was realizing profit from the sole activity that it was organized to pursue. 270 <em>U. S. </em>at 455, 46 S. Ct. at 346. However, we also, note the observations of the court that plaintiff was more than a mere conduit of funds. It was actually the brain of the other corporation and not only owned but governed it. 270 <em>U. S. </em>at 456, 46 S. Ct. at 346. Thus, an important factor leading to the result in <em>Chile Copper </em>was the control over mining operations, albeit indirect, exercised by plaintiff. In contrast, in the net lease situation presently before us Broad Street\u2019s operation of the business of renting space in the office building appears to be independent of any control on appellant\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Other eases decided under the federal capital stock tax statute and referred to by the State for the proposition that the mere ownership of property and collection of the fruits thereof constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d are similarly distinguishable. Eor example, in <em>Lamar Hotel Corp. v. </em>Fly, 134 <em>F. </em>2d 225 (5 Cir. 1943), the taxpayer was organized expressly for the purpose of taking over a hotel business, acquired the hotel, and was held to be \u201cdoing business\u201d under the statute despite the fact that it had employed another corporation to manage the hotel. However, this was clearly not a net lease situation. The taxpayer had entered into a management contract with the second corporation and the latter served as its agent in operating the business. The facts showed that the taxpayer actively participated through that corporation in the conduct of the hotel business. Eor similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>reasons we reject the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Harmar Coal Co. v. Heiner, </em>34 <em>F. </em>2d 725 (3 Cir. 1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">There are also cases interpreting various sections of the Interna] \u00a1Revenue Code that recognize the distinction between investment and business and tend to support the view that appellant\u2019s activity is properly characterized as an investment. <em>I. B. C. </em>(1954) \u00a7 1221(2) denies to real property used in a taxpayer\u2019s trade or business the status of \u201ccapital asset.\u201d Compare <em>Union National Bank of Troy v. United States, </em>195 <em>F. Supp. </em>382 (N. D. N. Y. 1961), involving a true net lease, with <em>Fackler v. Commissioner, </em>133 <em>F. </em>2d 509 (6 Cir. 1943). In finding that the property was used in a trade or business and not a capital asset, <em>Fackler </em>stressed that the taxpayer, through agents, was actively engaged in the business of managing and renting property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">It is a fair inference from the evidence that petitioner acquired the leasehold with the primary intention of operating the building upon it for profit and that he was not holding the property merely as an investment and solely for the purpose of collecting rents without rendering personal service to tenants. * * * The management of the property necessarily involved alterations and repairs commensurate with the number of tenants who occupied the building. It was also necessary to furnish elevator service, heat, light and water which required regular and continuous activity and the employment of labor, the buying of material and many other things which come within the definition of business. [133 <em>F. </em>2d at 511-512]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">See <em>Cleveland Trust Co. v. Commissioner, </em>115 <em>F. </em>2d 481 (6 <em>Cir. </em>1940), <em>cert. </em>den. 312 <em>U. S. </em>704, 61 <em>S. Ct. </em>809, 85 <em>L. Ed. </em>1137 (1941), where the court said that the \u201cmere receipt of income from leased property and its distribution * * <em>* </em>amounts to no more than receiving the ordinary fruits that arise from the ownership of property and does not constitute doing business.\u201d 115 <em>F. </em>2d at 483. See also, <em>Higgins v. Commissioner, </em>312 <em>U. S. </em>212, 61 <em>S. Ct. </em>475, 85 <em>L. Ed. </em>783 (1941); <em>Pinchot v. Commissioner, </em>113 <em>F. </em>2d 718 (2 Cir. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The District of Columbia has a tax on incorporated business under a statute that is similar to that under review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cases decided thereunder support the view that a property owner receiving rents pursuant to a net lease is not carrying on a business unless he participates himself or through agents in the management of the property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">Of course neither the ownership <em>per se </em>nor even the leasing of owned property necessarily constitutes the carrying on of the business of renting real property. The focal point in the inquiry is whether [the taxpayer] operated the leased properties. Operation of [the] property is a business. <em>[District of Columbia v. Brady, </em>109 U. S. App. D. C. 324, 288 <em>F. </em>2d 108, 117 (D. C. Cir. 1960)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the latter case the court determined that the evidence was inconclusive as to whether the taxpayer\u2019s real estate agents \u201c(a) effectively insulated him from the active participation in the management or (b) were simply his agents in the operation,\u201d and remanded the matter for findings on this issue (at 117). See also, <em>District of Columbia v. Pick</em>ford, 86 U. S. App. D. C. 17, 179 <em>F. </em>2d 271 (D. C. Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">An unincorporated business tax. statute of New York containing a definition of \u201cunincorporated business\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> comparable to our act has been given a like interpretive gloss by the New York Court of Appeals. In <em>People ex rel. Nauss v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Graves, 283 <em>N. Y. </em>383, 28 <em>N. E. </em>2d 881 (Ct. App. 1940), appellants were owners in common of investment real property acquired by inheritance. Deferring to many of the federal cases we have cited, the court said that when \u201cused in tax statutes * * * \u2018business\u2019 or \u2018doing business\u2019 connotes something more than the ownership of property and the receipt of income derived from property,\u201d and alluded to \u201cthe principle which distinguishes between a passive and an active owner or investor.\u201d The court found that management had been delegated to rental agents, with appellants making disbursements, executing leases negotiated by the agent, passing on major alterations and consulting weekly with the agent. These activities, it held, did not constitute the conduct of a business, and thus appellants were not taxable. C<em>f. People ex rel. Voelkel v. Browne, </em>268 <em>App. Div. </em>596, 52 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 822 (App. Div. 1944), aff\u2019d o. b. 294 <em>N. Y. </em>834, 62 <em>N. E. </em>2d 390 (Ct. App. 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Our Legislature, in the Corporation Business Tax Act of 1945, has recognized the distinction in a revenue law between a business and merely owning property. That act enlarged the prior franchise tax law coverage by imposing a corporate business tax not only on a corporation \u201cfor the privilege of exercising its franchise in this State or for the privilege of doing business or maintaining an office in this State,\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32A--8, but also for \u201cemploying or <em>owning </em>capital or <em>properly\u201d </em>in this State. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:10A-2 (emphasis added). See <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. </em>Director, <em>Div. of Taxation, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>411, 483 <em>et seq. </em>(1967), app. dism. 390 <em>U. S. </em>745, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>1443, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 276 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Both appellant and the State seek support for their respective positions in <em>In re </em>Maneely, 21 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>229, 32 <em>A. </em>2d 852 (Bd. Tax App., 1943), aff\u2019d o. b. 22 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>170, 37 <em>A. </em>2d 196 (Sup. Ct. 1944). That case held that a foreign corporation that had ceased conducting its pipe business in this State but retained ownership of real property here, leased it to others and managed and kept it in repair, was \u201cdoing business\u201d or exercising its franchise for franchise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tax purposes. Part of the property had been so leased even while it operated the pipe business, and it continued to receive substantial gross rent from that property, as well as other property, even after abandoning its pipe enterprise. The State relies on the size of the rentals as having induced the result. We are not persuaded that this was an important factor in the case. Appellant correctly contends that the determination was based in part on the privilege of exercising the corporate franchise here and that the case also involved rental from owner-managed real estate which it concedes constitutes doing business. We thus consider <em>Maneely </em>significant only to the extent that it supports the view that management of investment real property is a business.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The threshold inquiry is whether the Legislature intended that, at least with respect to real property gross receipts, the Director and, on review, the courts, be faced with the task of resolving, on a case to case basis, when the taxpayer is or is not a business. The judicial precedents we have examined that apply the general principle do not lead to readily predictable results.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In our view the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Graves, supra, </em>went quite far in categorizing as a passive investment under its unincorporated business tax statute a situation where the owner executed leases negotiated by its agent, consulted weekly with it and passed on major alterations. Nevertheless, subsequently in an opinion affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the New York Appellate Division went further and held that executors who owned, managed and leased the decedent\u2019s real property were not engaged in a business under the same act. <em>People ex rel. Voelkel v. Browne, supra. </em>The Appellate Division dissenting judge noted that the court was departing from the principle of <em>Graves. </em>The hazy line between business and passive investment under an unincorporated business tax statute is also illustrated by that part of the decision in <em>District of Columbia v. Brady, supra, </em>dealing with whether the taxpayer-physician was also engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>in the business of lending money. The court divided 5 to 4 on the question. The four dissenting judges in a persuasive opinion held that he was in that business, using as the \u201cunderlying guides * * * whether the person does or does not hold himself out to others for the supply of goods or services and whether the activities are or are not extensive, continuous and regular * * * [T]his taxpayer was not simply investing money which he had but rather was receiving requests for loans and then supplying the funds. [This accords with] * * * [t]he Veil settled\u2019 definition of business as that which occupies the time, attention and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or profit.\u201d 288 <em>F. </em>2d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We have reviewed the sparse legislative history of the New Jersey act, both before and after its adoption in 1966. Although there is data which may support the view that its interpretation should not be complicated by hypertechnieal distinctions, we find it to be too inconclusive to justify a determination that the historical dichotomy between business and passive investment should be by-passed, at least as to real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Thus, in discussing the replacement tax program of which the act was to be a part (see <em>Foosaner, supra, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>at 60), the 1965 report of the Governor\u2019s Committee on Local Property Taxation stated that any \u201crealistic tax program must be capable of ready administration with a nrmiTmrm of cost and confusion for taxpayer and tax administrator alike.\u201d But we also note the Committee\u2019s comment that the unincorporated business tax is only one part of the program and \u201cdoes not represent a major revenue source\u201d thereunder. Again, although it further concluded that a net income approach under the proposed act would be \u201centirely too cumbersome considering the low rates and yields involved,\u201d the concern is limited to whether a net or gross income tax should be imposed. Moreover, the Committee had considered revenue statutes in neighboring states, including New York, before making its proposals. When the report was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and the act was adopted, New York\u2019s unincorporated business tax statute expressly provided that an \u201cowner of real property, a lessee or a fiduciary shall not be deemed engaged in an unincorporated business solely by reason of holding, leasing or managing real property.\u201d Unincorporated Business Income Tax, Art. 23 <em>(L. </em>1960, <em>c. </em>564), New York Tax Law, \u00a7 703(e) <em>(McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. </em>60, 1966). Indeed, when <em>Graves </em>and <em>Browne </em>were decided in 1940 and 1944, respectively, the then New York statute (see fn. 4, supra) already had been amended for the years after 1935, the tax year dealt with in these cases, to provide for this exclusion from the tax. Nevertheless, the New Jersey act substantially adopted the judicially construed language of the New York statute without the express exclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In testimony before the Joint Taxation Committees of the Senate and Assembly on March 27, 1968, a representative of the State Association of Eeal Estate Boards complained of the tax authority\u2019s considering a lessor under a net lease, as well as any owner receiving rents, as an unincorporated business. She also pointed to the \u201cmorass\u201d of administrative interpretation required by the act. <em>Joint Committee on Taxation, Public Hearing of March </em>27, 1968, at 7-4-77. In view of what we have said, we do not consider the subsequent inaction by the Legislature as acquiescence in the Director\u2019s construction of the statute with respect to the kind of net lease here involved. <em>See Kingsley v. Hawthorne Fabrics, Inc., </em>41 <em>N. J. </em>521 (1964); <em>Eagle Truck Transport, Inc. v. Board of Review, etc., </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>280, 291 (1959); <em>Mechanics Finance Co. v. Austin, </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>577, 584 (1952); <em>Arrow Builders Supply Corp. v. Hudson Terrace Apts., Inc., </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>418, 427 (1954), pet. for reh. den. 16 <em>N. J. </em>47 (1954). <em>Cf. Automatic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Merchandising Council of New Jersey v. Glaser, </em>Director, Division of Taxation, 127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>413 (App. Div. 1974).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Oil balance, we conclude that the search for legislative intent must be limited to the statutory language alone. So viewed, the term \u201cbusiness\u201d carries with it the judicial definition, already discussed, given it in other tax statutes, including other unincorporated business tax legislation. See <em>Lullo v. Intern. Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>409, 424 (1970) ; <em>In re Lichtenstein, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>553, 587 (1968); <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Weehawken, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>336, 343 (1965). If the Legislature desires to include all real property income as a business, it should so provide plainly and unequivocally. Meanwhile, however, there is no requirement that, in interpreting the New Jersey act, the Director slavishly follow the results reached in other jurisdictions even on similar fact patterns. See <em>Higgins v. Commissioner, supra, </em>312 U. S. at 217, 61 S. Ct. 475; <em>District of Columbia v. Brady, supra </em>288 <em>F. </em>2d at 114. With respect to real property, absent more concrete legislative direction, he has the authority, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:11B-20(a), to give such reasonable construction of the act as is appropriate to carry out its goal, as long as a sensible distinction is maintained between a business and a passive investment. See <em>State v. Hatch, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>179, 186 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Turning to the evidence presented before the Division, we conclude that the limited activities of the appellant under this net lease, heretofore discussed, do not constitute a business under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We do not agree with the State that the size of appellant\u2019s assets, income or expenditures is of significance in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>termining whether it is a business under the act. Had the Legislature intended any of these factors as a determinant of whether one were a business subject to the tax, it would have so provided. Instead, it merely limited taxability to businesses whose gross receipts were over $5,000 a year. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:11B-3. See <em>Higgins v. Commissioner, supra </em>312 U. S. at 218, 61 S. Ct. 475; <em>District of Columbia v. Brady, supra </em>288 <em>F. </em>2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We also conclude that the State\u2019s reliance on <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:llB-4(e) is misplaced. That section deals solely with the allocation formula to be used in determining taxable gross receipts of taxpayers maintaining a place of \u201cbusiness\u201d outside the State. It provides that for that purpose gross receipts will include \u201crentals from property situated * * * within the State.\u201d It does not aid the resolution of the issue before us. The taxpayer, in order to fall within this provision, must still be a business under the act rather than one who passively receives income. <em>Cf. Household Finance Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>353, 360 (1962), app. dism. 371 <em>U. S. </em>13, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>41, 9 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 49 (1962). We note that this provision is the same as that used in the allocation formula for corporate taxpayers maintaining a regular place of business outside of the State contained in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:10A-6(B) (5), a part of the earlier enacted Corporation Business Tax Act. It will be recalled that the latter specifically imposes a tax where the taxpayer corporation owns property in the State. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:10A-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The State contends that (1) the lease provision permitting the lessee to terminate it on 60 days\u2019 notice and (2) the purchase and lease, ten years after the initial lease, of the parcel adjoining the building for parking purposes, in some fashion make appellant a business. Hot so. The termination clause, although on the surface unusual, does not convert the lessee into a managing agent; and the purchase of an adjoining lot for parking under the same net lease arrangement as the building in no way modifies appellant\u2019s investor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>However, these factors may take on some significance in a different factual context. Appellant admits that it and Broad Street have some common ownership. In addition, we note that Harry B. Helmsley, a partner in taxpayer, signed the lease on behalf of the lessee. We need not decide whether this fact alone or with other evidence might establish a degree of participation by partners of appellant in the lessee\u2019s operations sufficient to warrant a finding that appellant is more than a recipient of passive income and is indeed a business. The State did not pursue this issue, and on the record below we are unable to determine it. Our conclusion in this case does not preclude its factual development for taxable years after 1968. <em>Cf. Kingkade, supra, </em>30 <em>F. Supp. </em>508.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The judgment of the Division of Tax Appeals is reversed. Since appellant has paid taxes for the tax years in question, it is entitled to a refund.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">We do not determino whether this somewhat unclear exemption from the act is involved in the issue before us. We do not read it as exempting all receipts from real property merely because the latter involves a \u201cpurchase\u201d for the taxpayer\u2019s account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00a737 of the Corporation Excise Tax of 1909 (Act of Aug. 5, 1909, 36 <em>Stat. </em>112).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u00a747-1574 <em>D.

J. A. C. </em>18 :11-2.3 (c). It only questions the legality of the part of the regulation that considers rentals under a net lease as gross income under the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-6\"> Appellant lias raised the spectre of double taxation should it be held to be subject to the act. We need not deal with the question in view of our determination. See, however, <em>U. S. Steel Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>533, 548 (1962), involving the Corporation Business Tax Act, which indicates that that kind of problem, if it exists, may be met appropriately by legislative action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
