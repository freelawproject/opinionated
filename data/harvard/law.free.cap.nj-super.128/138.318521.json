By an opinion reported at 121 <em>N. J. Super. </em>595 (Cty. Ct. 1972), County Court Judge Gelman held that the subject matter of the ordinance was preempted by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>36 :1-2 and was therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">On the merits we would affirm substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Gelman in his cited opinion. We wish to state, however, that we conclude that the judgment or acquittal in the County Court is not appealable. <em>State v. </em>Fiore, 69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>122 (App. Div. 1961), certif. den. 36 <em>N. J. </em>142 (1961). Appellant argues that <em>B. </em>3:10-3 and the \u201cTentative Draft Comment\u201d thereon supports its right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>appeal. We conclude that if it were the intent to reverse the holding in <em>Fiore </em>and related cases, the rules would have been amended to explicitly say so. They have not been so amended. The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
