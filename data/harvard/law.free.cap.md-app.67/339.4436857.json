Murphy, Jr., of first-degree murder and related charges, involving several victims. Upon this appeal, he raises the following two contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">1) That Judge Murphy erroneously refused to admit in evidence written reports of a police officer\u2019s interviews with a State\u2019s witness; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">2) That Judge Murphy erroneously permitted a physician to testify as an expert witness on the potential effect of medication upon a State\u2019s witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The first contention presents a twinkling gem of an evidentiary problem containing hearsay, hearsay exceptions, and non-hearsay. Its flaw is that it blurs into a single face what should be two distinct facets. It has failed to appreciate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\u201cIf B asserts that A asserted <em>x, </em>the admissibility of <em>x </em>will depend upon qualifying not only A\u2019s assertion but B\u2019s assertion as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">A key State\u2019s witness was Debbie Rae McNally Waligora, one of the assault victims and herself a drug user. The defense sought to impeach her testimonial credibility by showing that she had on prior occasions given statements inconsistent with her trial testimony. Those statements had been given to Baltimore County Police Officer Robert R. Ash, who had interviewed Ms. Waligora at the hospital, where she was recovering from gunshot wounds, on June 3, June 4, and June 5, 1981. Officer Ash, who had conducted the interviews at the request of another officer, filed written reports of the interviews. The defense sought to introduce those reports. Judge Murphy rejected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">The appellant claimed that Ms. Waligora\u2019s testimony in the State\u2019s case-in-chief was materially different from the statements she had made in her interviews with Officer Ash. He contends, therefore, that those statements were admissible for impeachment purposes as prior inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>statements. The appellant, of course, is absolutely right as to the admissibility of those statements if, indeed, such statements were ever made. Their admissibility is one matter; their very existence, quite another.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Hearsay may be defined as an out-of-court assertion offered in court for the truth of the matter asserted, resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court assert-er. The statements made by Ms. Waligora in her hospital room were out-of-court assertions. They were offered by the appellant in court, however, not for the truth of the matter asserted. They were offered, rather, simply for the fact that they had been made. Their value did not rest upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter, Ms. Waligora; on the contrary, their putative value was in trying to demonstrate her non-credibility. For the purpose for which they were offered, therefore, the assertions made by Ms. Waligora were non-hearsay. Their truth was immaterial. The propriety under Maryland law of impeaching a witness by showing a prior inconsistent statement is well established. <em>Smith v. State, </em>273 Md. 152, 328 A.2d 274 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The appellant, however, has confused the admissibility of Ms. Waligora\u2019s out-of-court assertions with the admissibility of Officer Ash\u2019s out-of-court assertions. The two have nothing in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Ms. Waligora\u2019s out-of-court assertions narrated events at the crime scene; Officer Ash\u2019s out-of-court assertions narrated the statements made by Ms. Waligora in her hospital room. Ms. Waligora\u2019s assertions were made to Officer Ash; Officer Ash\u2019s assertions were made to a piece of paper. The value of Ms. Waligora\u2019s assertions did not rest upon her credibility; the value of Officer Ash\u2019s assertions did rest upon his. Ms. Waligora\u2019s assertions were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted; Officer Ash\u2019s were. Ms. Waligora\u2019s assertions, for the purpose for which they were offered, were non-hearsay; Officer Ash\u2019s, for the purpose for which they were offered, were hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The admissibility of Ms. Waligora\u2019s out-of-court assertions, if made, is clear. That is not the issue. The question is what competent evidence was offered to prove that the out-of-court assertions were ever made by Ms. Waligora? The most reliable evidence as to the making of such assertions was obviously the testimony of Officer Ash himself. As a witness to the assertions, he should ideally have testified. He would thereby have been subjected to the classic trustworthiness-conditioning devices of having his demeanor and manner of testifying observed by the jurors, of being placed under oath, and of being subjected to cross-examination. Officer Ash was available to testify and there was no reason, therefore, to dispense with the trustworthiness-conditioning devices. As a matter of fact, Officer Ash did testify and did relate the out-of-court assertions made to him by Ms. Waligora in her hospital room. What the appellant sought, by offering Officer Ash\u2019s earlier hearsay in addition to his trial testimony, was \u201cto gild the lily.\u201d By way of gilding or otherwise, however, Officer Ash\u2019s out-of-court assertions, made in the course of his written report, simply did not qualify under any of the recognized exceptions to the Hearsay Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The substance of a criminal investigation set forth in a police report, as opposed to \u201caspects of the accident [scene] observable by the investigating officer,\u201d does not come in under the business records exception, codified in Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-101(b). <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Kuhl, </em>296 Md. 446, 454, 463 A.2d 822 (1983); <em>Cain v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 227, 233, 492 A.2d 652 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The reports, which may have been referred to by Officer Ash during his testimony, were used, if at all, to refresh his recollection. It was the appellant who called Officer Ash to the stand; the appellant did not seek to scrutinize the notes which might have been used by Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Ash to refresh his recollection. The appellant does not urge admissibility on that ground. A decision on admissibility in that context, moreover, rests solely in the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 318, 315 A.2d 788 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It is equally clear that the out-of-court assertions made by Officer Ash in the course of making out his reports could not have been received as non-hearsay for impeachment purposes. With respect to the asserter (Officer Ash), they were not prior inconsistent statements at all; they were rather totally consistent with his trial testimony. To establish consistency or inconsistency, Officer Ash\u2019s prior statements (his police reports) must be compared with Officer Ash\u2019s testimony, not with Ms. Waligora\u2019s testimony. The appellant, moreover, was hardly in a position to impeach his own witness. Even if they had been received for such a limited impeachment purpose, the out-of-court assertions would not have been admissible as substantive evidence and would, therefore, have been utterly useless to impeach Ms. Waligora.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Judge Murphy was correct in ruling the police reports inadmissible as a violation of the Hearsay Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The appellant\u2019s second contention is also without merit. Dr. Roger Schneider was on duty in the emergency room and treated Ms. Waligora when she was brought into the hospital at 4:30 a.m. on July 3, 1981. He prescribed certain medication for her, both upon her arrival and through her stay as an in-patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Over defense objection, Dr. Schneider was permitted to testify as to the potential effect such medication might have upon a patient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201cQ. [By the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Do you have an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to what, if any, side effects the two drugs [Demerol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and Visataril] being given together in those dosages at those times would have on Mrs. McNally [Waligora]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7V\">A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">Q. Could you give us that please, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">A. There are multiple potential side effects to these drugs. One is nausea and vomiting. The second is respiratory depression. Third is increased sleepiness or drowsiness. And fourth is a lack of complete ability to respond coherently to questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The appellant\u2019s objection, of course, was to that part of the doctor\u2019s response referring to a \u201clack of complete ability to respond coherently to questions.\u201d Judge Murphy, in overruling the appellant\u2019s objection, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be permitted to say that she was coherent or incoherent. He\u2019s only going to be permitted to say the probable effect of the drugs that the record shows she was administered at the particular time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The admissibility of expert testimony is largely within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Waltermeyer v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 69, 480 A.2d 831 (1984). The opinion of the expert here was relevent. It was of such a nature as to aid the trier of fact. <em>Cider Barrel Mobile Home Court v. Eader, </em>287 Md. 571, 414 A.2d 1246 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The appellant raised the issue of Ms. Waligora\u2019s responses made to the police during the course of her hospital stay. From the fact that those responses, made while under medication, were not fully compatible with her later trial testimony, the appellant would have had the jury believe that she was a demonstrated liar. That the State was permitted to offer a plausible alternative explanation clearly helped to keep the jury from being led astray. That is the ever-present goal of the trial judge as he exercises his discretion in furtherance of the search for truth. We see no abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
