Anderson<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (appellant). Appellant, who had earlier recovered from appellees in a Worker\u2019s Compensation case for injuries sustained on December 10, 1981, filed a \u201cthird party\u201d tort action against appellees pursuant to Section 58 of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging that they were negligent in maintaining a defective and dangerous trash compactor on their property. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that they were appellant\u2019s employer and that appellant\u2019s tort claim was barred by the exclusive remedy doctrine expressed in Section 15 of the Act. On May 7, 1985, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Judge DeLawrence Beard) granted appellees\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>On appeal to this court, appellant correctly notes that if there is a genuine dispute of material fact, summary judgment may not properly be granted. Rule 2-501(e). Accordingly, he asks</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">Whether the trial court improperly granted appellees\u2019 motion when there was a genuine dispute of material fact regarding the identity of appellant\u2019s employer which should have been submitted to a jury for determination?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A61\">The underlying facts are not complicated. On December 10, 1981, Cyril Anderson\u2019s right hand was amputated in an industrial accident at the Barbazon Plaza Apartments, where he was employed as a custodian. The apartment building was managed by Smithy-Braedon Property Company (\u201cSmithy\u201d). Appellant filed a Worker\u2019s Compensation claim, naming Smithy as his employer, because he had been hired, supervised and paid by Smithy. Smithy filed a First Report of Injury with the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission, naming IBI Associates (\u201cIBI\u201d) as employer. IBI was listed as employer in the First Award of Compensation and all subsequent orders issued by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In this appeal, appellant asserts that the exact identity of the apartment building owners (the \u201cOwners\u201d) was not ascertainable from the record before the trial court. This is the \u201cfactual dispute\u201d that, appellant would have us hold, should have precluded the trial court from considering appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. First, counsel for appellees clarified for the trial court any confusion over the exact identity of the Owners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, and more importantly, the exact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>identity of the Owners was not a <em>material </em>fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Rule 2-501(e) precludes granting a motion for summary judgment only where the dispute concerns a material fact, <em>see King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985), the only question we must answer is whether appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">There is no dispute that, for the injuries he sustained on December 10, 1981, appellant filed for and was awarded worker\u2019s compensation under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. Clearly, he was entitled to do so as \u00a7 15 of the Act provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">Every employer subject to the provisions of this article, shall pay or provide as required herein compensation according to the schedules of this article for the disability or death of his employee resulting from an accidental personal injury sustained by the employee arising out of and in the course of his employment without regard to fault as a cause of such injury____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV4\">Section 15 further provides, however, that \u201c[t]he liability prescribed by the past preceding paragraph <em>shall be exclusive.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Having elected and recovered worker\u2019s compensation from his employer, appellant may not later sue that same employer in tort. <em>Gray v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>253 Md. 421, 252 A.2d 810 (1969). <em>See Haynie v. National Gypsum Corp., </em>62 Md.App. 528, 490 A.2d 724 (1985); <em>Athas v. Hill, </em>54 Md.App. 293, 458 A.2d 859 (1983), <em>aff'd, </em>300 Md. 133, 476 A.2d 710 (1984). <em>See also State v. Bennett Building Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 168, 140 A. 52 (1928) (\u201cIf an employer is within the [Worker\u2019s Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>tion] Act to bear its liabilities, he must remain to be accorded its <em>immunities____\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Even if an injured worker has recovered under the Act, he may still sue a person <em>other than his employer </em>in a third-party tort action. Art. 101, \u00a7 58 (quoted in pertinent part at n. 4, supra). This is what appellant did in the case <em>sub judice. </em>To succeed in this action, therefore, appellant was required to show the Owners<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were not his employer. In their motion, appellees contended that the Owners were the <em>statutory </em>employer of appellant, relying on \u00a7 62 of the Act. We agree and shall explain our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In <em>Honaker v. W.C. and A.N. Miller Development Company, </em>278 Md. 453, 365 A.2d 287 (1976) <em>(Honaker I), </em>the Court of Appeals was asked to consider whether the relationship of statutory employee/statutory employer, as contemplated by \u00a7 62, existed between an injured worker and the defendant in that case. Writing for the court, Judge Orth stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">It is manifest on the face of \u00a7 62 of Art. 101, that in order to invoke its provisions there must be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">(1) a principal contractor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">(2) who has contracted to perform work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">(3) which is a part of his trade, business or occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">(4) who has contracted with any other party as a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 459-60, 365 A.2d 287 (footnote omitted). Focusing on the first, second and fourth elements, Judge Orth explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APb\">As the statute speaks in terms of principal contractor and subcontractor, it clearly requires two contracts, one between the principal contractor and a third party whereby it is agreed that the principal contractor will execute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>certain work for the third party, and another between the principal contractor and a person as subcontractor whereby the subcontractor agrees to do the whole or part of such work for the principal contractor. The definition of subcontractor and subcontract denotes the existence of two contracts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 460, 365 A.2d 287. It was further explained that the contract between the principal contractor and the subcontractor must result from the original contract between the principal contractor and the third party. <em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 365 A.2d 287 (citing <em>State v. Bennett Building Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 140 A. 52 (1928)). As there was no evidence that the contract with the alleged subcontractor resulted from a third party contract, the <em>Honaker I </em>court reversed the trial court\u2019s holding that the defendant in that case was a statutory employer and thus immune from tort liability. <em>Id. </em>[278 Md.] at 463, 365 A.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On remand, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and an appeal to this court ensued. We reversed. <em>See Miller Development Co. v. Honaker, </em>40 Md.App. 185, 388 A.2d 562 (1978) <em>(Honaker II), aff'd, </em>285 Md. 216, 401 A.2d 1013 (1979). First, in view of additional evidence that was added to the record on remand, it was clear that the subcontract had arisen out of an existing contract between the defendant and a third party. 40 Md.App. at 190, 388 A.2d 562. The three elements discussed in <em>Honaker I </em>were thus satisfied. The majority of the discussion in <em>Honaker II, </em>however, focused on the third element: whether the work subcontracted was part of the principal contractor\u2019s business. Concluding that Maryland had adopted the \u201cessential or integral part\u201d test,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we noted that the \u201crelevant inquiry under that test is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>subcontracted work is an \u2018essential or integral part of the principal contractor\u2019s business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 388 A.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Reviewing the undisputed facts in the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is clear that the four elements of Art. 101, \u00a7 62, as explained in <em>Honaker I </em>and <em>Honaker II, </em>are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In his amended complaint, appellant alleges that the Owners operated the apartment building where he was injured. He alleges further that Smithy, by written agreement, managed the apartment building for the Owners. These allegations alone satisfy the fourth element, assuming the first three are also shown. <em>See Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 463, 365 A.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The first two elements are demonstrated by the clear language of the apartment building lease introduced into evidence by appellant. In pertinent part, the lease states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_T\">This lease, made ... by and between H.G. Smithy Property Company, a corporation <em>(as agents for the owner of the real estate described </em>below), hereinafter designated the \u201cLandlord\u201d and [a third party], hereinafter designated as the \u201ctenant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">(Emphasis added). The italicized language identifies the Owners as the Landlord who has entered into a contract\u2014 the lease agreement\u2014with a third party\u2014for our purposes each and every tenant in the apartment building. The lease, among other things, states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKS\">The Landlord will deliver the premises and all common areas in a clean, safe and sanitary condition____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">This language demonstrates without question that the Owners, as the Landlord of the apartment building, contracted with its tenants to maintain that building in a sanitary condition, and that <em>a fortiori </em>custodial maintenance is part of their trade, business or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The third element is likewise shown by undisputed evidence. Appellant, by affidavit, stated that he was hired by Smithy to perform custodial (janitorial) work at the apartment building. Inexorably, there is but one conclusion that can be drawn: that the Owners\u2019 obligation to maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>sanitary conditions had been assigned, by a subcontract, to Smithy. The custodial work that appellant was hired to perform was an \u201cessential or integral part\u201d of the Owners\u2019 business.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">As each of the four <em>Honaker </em>elements were undisputably present in the record before the trial court, the only legal conclusion it could reach was that the Owners were appellant\u2019s statutory employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-12\">. Although we have uncovered cases from other jurisdictions holding landlords to be statutory employers of maintenance men hired by independent contractors, <em>see Evans v. Naihaus, </em>326 So.2d 601, 604 n. 2 (La.App.1976) (ordinary repair and maintenance is an essential part of rental business); <em>Sursum Corda, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>1 Ben.Rev.Bd.Serv. 60, 63 (1974) (owner of apartment complex liable for disability benefits to maintenance man); <em>Viselli v. Missouri Theatre Bldg.

Although the Commission listed IBI as the employer\u2014premised on their presumed ownership of the premises, appellees indicated that IBI was not the Owner. At the hearing on the motion, appellees\u2019 counsel explained that the apartment building was owned initially by Barbazon Plaza, Inc., a corporation. Prior to the subject accident, however, the corporation was dissolved and ownership was transferred to Barbazon Plaza Associates, a partnership. In discovery, appellees stated that the partners in Barbazon Plaza Associates were Mr. and Mrs. Bimblich, Leon Lopatin, Sue Heyman and Barbara Gold-stein.
