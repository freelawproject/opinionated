Whitfill, of 1) possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; 2) possession of marijuana; and 3) possession of LSD. Upon this appeal, he raises five contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">1) That the judge, having earlier issued the search warrant, should have recused himself from ruling on the suppression motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">2) That the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not demonstrate probable cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">3) That the evidence was not legally sufficient to sustain the convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">4) That a mistrial should have been declared when a question from a juror demonstrated prejudice on the part of that juror; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">5) That the judge prejudiced the jury when he redefined a question asked by the jury and volunteered an answer that went beyond the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">\n<em>Competence of Warrant-Issuing Judge to Hear Suppression Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">The appellant\u2019s first claim is that Judge Whitfill was guilty of an abuse of discretion when he refused to recuse himself from ruling on the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress physical evidence. It was Judge Whitfill who issued the search and seizure warrant on June 5, 1984. It was Judge Whitfill who presided over the suppression hearing, challenging that warrant, on October 10, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">The unilluminating, single-paragraph challenge to the failure of Judge Whitfill to recuse himself is devoid of any citation to case authority or legal treatise whatsoever. There is simply the bald assertion that \"it would be virtually impossible to be objective where he was sitting on an appeal of his own decision that the warrant was valid on its face.\u201d Notwithstanding the skimpiness of the challenge, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>is an important issue that could recur and is, therefore, worthy of more than summary resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Precisely the same challenge was before the Court in <em>Peaper and Lowe v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 201, 208, 286 A.2d 176 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 987, 93 S.Ct. 342, 34 L.Ed.2d 253, where both appellants contended \u201cthat they were denied due process of law because the trial judge who reviewed the validity of the search warrant was the very judge who had issued that warrant in the first instance.\u201d Our literal holding in that case was that the point had not been preserved for appellate review under Maryland Rule 1085. By way of deliberate and well-considered <em>dicta, </em>however, we indicated that we would have found the contention without merit if it had been properly before us. We stated unequivocally, at 14 Md.App. 209, 286 A.2d 176:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYl\">\u201c[AJbsent a showing of bias or prejudice, the mere fact that a judge issued the warrant would not preclude him from sitting either at a suppression hearing dealing with that warrant or at the trial upon the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We looked, by way of analogy, to the landmark decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>260 Md. 227, 271 A.2d 641 (1970). Although involving the impact of knowledge of a confession upon the capacity of a judge to be a neutral fact finder, the analysis of the Court, in holding that a judge was not thereby disqualified, was one that \u201cgoes to the very marrow of the role, function, and capacity of the judge in our legal system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We went on to consider the persuasive authority from sister jurisdictions, summarizing that authority at 14 Md.App. 209-210, 286 A.2d 176:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cAlthough only implicit in the Maryland case law, the issue has been resolved directly and explicitly that a judge is not disqualified from later participation in a case, even where the suppression of physical evidence is the key issue, by virtue of the fact that he issued the search and seizure warrant. <em>Waupoose v. State, </em>[46 Wis.2d 257], 174 N.W.2d 503, 504 (Wisc.1970); <em>Arnold v. Commonwealth, </em>421 S.W.2d 366, 366-367 (Ky.1967); <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>rel. French v. Hendricks Superior Court, </em>[252 Ind. 213], 247 N.E.2d 519, 525 (Indiana 1969); <em>State v. Smith, </em>[113 N.J.Super. 120], 273 A.2d 68, 78 (N.J.1971); <em>State v. Toce, </em>[6 Conn.Cir. 192], 269 A.2d 421, 422-423 (Conn.1969); <em>Irwin v. State, </em>441 S.W.2d 203, 208-209 (Texas 1969).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Indeed, the same principle manifests itself in a wide variety of applications. Whenever a judge is called upon to reconsider an earlier ruling and most of the time when a judge is asked to render a judgment n.o.v. or to grant a motion for a new trial, the judge is being called upon to review and possibly to reverse an earlier decision made by that judge. It has never been held that there was any conflict of interest or other impropriety in such situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We can find no dissenting voice from the broad consensus that a judge, in issuing a search warrant, is not thereby disqualified from presiding over the suppression hearing which will review that warrant. In <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>586 S.W.2d 465 (1979), the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that a statute that authorizes a judge to hear a challenge to the warrant which he earlier issued is not unconstitutional. In <em>United States v. Cansdale, </em>7 M.J. 143 (C.M.A.1979), the United States Court of Military Appeals surveyed both the state and federal case law and concluded, at 145, that \u201cmany cases approve the concept that a trial judge is not disqualified merely because he must rule upon the validity of a search conducted pursuant to a warrant issued by him.\u201d It found no case holding to the contrary. In <em>State v. Smith, </em>113 N.J.Super. 120, 273 A.2d 68 (1971), the New Jersey Appellate Division not only approved the procedure but explained the different natures of the two judicial determinations, at 273 A.2d 78:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cThe action in issuing the warrant is <em>ex parte </em>and merely appraises the <em>prima facie </em>showing of probable cause. The motion proceeding is adversarial, and the judge adjudicates all questions of law and fact posed on the challenge of the validity of the warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>See also State v. Cooper, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 163, 370 N.E.2d 725 (1977), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, Cooper v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3137, 57 L.Ed.2d 1157 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">What is required for a judge to be compelled to recuse himself is the presence of bias. An excellent analysis of bias, as a term of art within the contemplation of recusal requirements, is found in <em>United States v. Garramone, </em>374 F.Supp. 256, 258 (E.D.Pa.1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cThe facts do not establish any personal bias or prejudice on the part of this Court____The affidavit must establish a bias or prejudice of an extra-judicial origin, a bias that has been acquired outside the four walls of the courtroom. Adverse judicial rulings or prior judicial exposure to the parties or questions are not sufficient to establish personal bias or prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-9\"><em>See also State v. Toce, </em>6 Conn.Cir.Ct. 192, 269 A.2d 421, 422 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">As but a slight variation on the same theme, a number of state court decisions have held that a judge, by virtue of having issued the search warrant in the case, is not thereby disqualified from presiding over the trial upon the merits. <em>State v. Brown, </em>20 N.C.App. 413, 201 S.E.2d 527 (1974); <em>State v. Knoblock, </em>44 Wis.2d 130, 170 N.W.2d 781 (1969); <em>State ex. rel. French v. Hendricks Superior Court, </em>252 Ind. 213, 247 N.E.2d 519 (1969); <em>Sanders v. State, </em>649 S.W.2d 59 (Tex.App. 1st Dist.1982), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>658 S.W.2d 572, 580 (Tex.Crim.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">The only qualification on this eligibility of the warrant-issuing judge to sit at later stages of the same case is the rare situation dealt with in <em>Coslow v. State, </em>490 P.2d 1116 (Okla.Crim.App.1971). Where the warrant-issuing judge is going to be called as a witness in a subsequent proceeding, his status as a witness dictates that another judge should be assigned to hear the case. Judge Whitfill was not called as a witness in the case now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">We hold that the fact that a judge has issued a warrant does not disqualify that judge from presiding over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>a subsequent suppression hearing involving the validity of that warrant. Under the circumstances, Judge Whitfill obviously committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\n<em>Probable Cause for the Search Warrant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The appellant next complains that Judge Whitfill erroneously failed to suppress all of the physical evidence. The search and seizure in question was executed pursuant to a warrant that had been issued by Judge Whitfill on June 5, 1984. Even if the warrant had been technically lacking in probable cause, the reliance of the executing officers upon the presumptive validity of the warrant would have exempted the search from the sanctions of the Exclusionary Rule. <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984); <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The warrant was not, however, deficient. Under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d approach for reviewing warrants now mandated by <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), the reviewing judge does not (at the suppression hearing level or at the appellate level) make a <em>de novo </em>determination of probable cause but simply determines whether there was a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for the warrant-issuing magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause existed. <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>substituted this looser approach for the earlier and more rigorous \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969). The warrant application before us, however, would have passed muster even under the more rigorous standard. <em>A fortiori, </em>it is good under the less demanding standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">A word about <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>is appropriate. As valuable case law, they are not dead. They have simply been reduced from \u201cconstitutionally binding\u201d stature to \u201chelpful guidelines\u201d stature. <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>determined that it was inappropriate, on the probable cause issue, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>insist that the rigorous standards mandated by <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>and their progeny be rigidly applied. The flexibility of the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d approach was more desirable in assessing these <em>ex parte </em>decisions that are but part of the preliminary, investigative process. The analytic framework provided by <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli, </em>however, continues to be of service in helping judges to understand what they should look for as they review a warrant application in the first instance. As was discussed in R. Gilbert &amp; C. Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law: Practice and Procedure </em>(1985 Supp.), at 40-41:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cThe Supreme Court made it very clear, however, that \u2018an informant\u2019s \u201cveracity,\u201d \u201creliability,\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d are all highly relevant in determining the value of his report.\u2019 The thrust of the change wrought by the <em>Gates </em>decision was to avoid treating \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 as \u2018entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\u2019 In place of \u2018rigid compartmentalization of the inquiries,\u2019 the Court directed that these questions \u2018be understood simply as closely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the commonsense, practical question whether there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that contraband or evidence is located in a particular place.\u2019 As an aid, therefore, in understanding the nature and purpose of the magistrate\u2019s inquiry, <em>[Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>] should continue to provide that \u2018useful illumination\u2019 referred to by the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cveracity prong\u201d dealt with the issue of what it was in a warrant application that might persuade the warrant-issuing judge that a police officer\u2019s secondary source was worthy of belief. A big distinction in that regard was whether the secondary source (sometimes called the informant) was from the criminal milieu, and therefore inherently suspect, or was a citizen-informant, whose very status militated toward a finding of trustworthiness. In this case, two of Corporal Bane\u2019s sources were described as \u201cconcerned citizen-informants\u201d who \u201cwished to remain anony<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>mous.\u201d Corporal Bane elaborated further on the status of these two sources as citizen-informants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cThe two concerned citizen-informants are both members of the West Riding Community, United States and Maryland citizens, hold full-time jobs, are on the Harford County Voters\u2019 Register and do not have any criminal record. Neither of the concerned informants is receiving any compensation or remuneration for this information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">We spoke of the inherent credibility of the citizen-informant, as contrasted with the more suspect police \u201cstool pigeon,\u201d in <em>King and Mobley v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 546, 554-555, 298 A.2d 446 450 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cIt was made clear in <em>Dawson v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 18, 33-34, 284 A.2d 861, that the strictures of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 [84 S.Ct. 1509], and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 [89 S.Ct. 584], \u2018are aimed primarily at unnamed police \u201cinformers\u201d rather than at that broad class of secondary sources who are the victims of crime, the disinterested witnesses of crime, other disinterested civilian sources of information or other law enforcement officers. The members of this broad class are generally, but not universally, named. They are not from the criminal milieu.\u2019 <em>Dawson, </em>[14 Md.App.] p. 33 [284 A.2d 861].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In terms of what <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>dubbed the \u201cveracity prong,\u201d the two citizen-informants posed no problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Of minimal significance but throwing some light on the general behavioral pattern of the appellant, the two citizen-informants revealed that they had been at a party at the appellant\u2019s residence \u201cthree or four years ago\u201d when the appellant openly stated that \u201cif anyone wanted to smoke pot,\u201d the marijuana was upstairs. This information, of course, was the product of direct observation. More significantly, one of the citizen-informants had been in more recent conversation \u201cwith a number of neighborhood teenagers.\u201d The teenagers reported that the appellant \u201cwas selling marijuana and possibly cocaine.\u201d The two citizen-informants, moreover, described the appellant\u2019s automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>and the two Bel Air restaurants and taverns frequented by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Corporal Bane directly undertook undercover surveillances at both of the described restaurants. At the Georgetown North, he observed the appellant and another white male involved in conduct which, based upon his experience and expertise, appeared to be \u201csetting up and carrying out of a drug deal.\u201d At Rafferty\u2019s Pub, Corporal Bane, posing as a knowledgeable customer, heard from a white female in the bar that the appellant \u201cthrew some good parties.\u201d The white female elaborated by saying that there was \u201cplenty of \u2018stuff\u2019 set out all over the place at these parties.\u201d She went on to define \u201cstuff\u201d by holding one finger over her right nostril as though she were snorting cocaine. With no idea that she was talking to a policeman, this unnamed female had no apparent motive to fabricate and passed on the information under circumstances reasonably assuring reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Most significant was the undercover work of Trooper First Class Michael Heise. On five occasions spread throughout the month of May, 1984, Trooper Heise made attempts to purchase cocaine from a Martin Lee Via and his wife, Donna Jean Via. Of great 'significance were the discreetly observed actions of the Vias as those actions corroborated statements made by both of the Vias to Trooper Heise. In terms of the veracity of those statements, we are dealing with a situation indistinguishable from that before us in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 560, 298 A.2d 458 (1973). Two sellers of narcotics were dealing with an obviously trusted \u201cpurchaser\u201d of narcotics. There was no reason whatsoever for them to fabricate to him about their source of supply. Their behavior in attempting to come up with the drugs, out of the presence of Trooper Heise but covertly observed by a police surveillance team, corroborated fully their statements to Trooper Heise about the source of supply. With respect to their veracity under these circumstances, we feel as we did in <em>Thompson v. State, supra, </em>at 16 Md.App. 567-568, 298 A.2d 458:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201cThough from the criminal milieu, to be sure, he was not, wittingly at least, working with the police. He was not in the position of \u2018the common informant ... hidden behind a cloak of anonymity\u2019 who more often than not \u2018is paid or provides information in exchange for immunity from prosecution for his own misdeeds.\u2019 <em>People v. Glaubman, </em>[175 Colo. 41], 485 P.2d 711, 716-717 (Colorado, 1971). This street seller was, so far as he knew, engaged in a purely commercial venture for his own profit. He was dealing with a regular and presumably valued customer. Being unable initially to satisfy his customer\u2019s demand, it was to his every advantage to assure the prompt return of that customer as soon as fresh merchandise was available for sale. He simply had no purpose in misleading his own clientele. The circumstances in which the seller passed on the information to a customer and confidant are replete, we think, with reasonable assurances of trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">On five separate occasions throughout the month of May, Trooper Heise attempted to purchase cocaine from either Martin or Donna Via. On most of those occasions, the Vias left Heise\u2019s presence in order to go and get the cocaine from their \u201csupplier,\u201d referred to as \u201cSteve.\u201d Unknown to the Vias, there were discreet surveillances conducted on their movements. They were observed to make no less than six trips to the home of the appellant. The five attempted purchases of cocaine resulted in cocaine actually being supplied twice, indications on two other occasions that the supplier was either \u201ctapped out\u201d or out of town, and an alternative purchase suggested on the fifth occasion\u2014Heise was told that the source was out of cocaine but would be happy to supply \u201cacid.\u201d On the occasion of the final attempted purchase, Heise himself was permitted to accompany the Vias to the outside of the appellant\u2019s home, from which vantage point he could observe certain pedestrian and vehicular traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Notwithstanding the appellant\u2019s protest that several of these attempted purchases of cocaine were fruitless and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>therefore, innocuous, the representations of the Vias, strongly corroborated by their actions, were just as probative in establishing the appellant and his home as \u201cthe source\u201d as would have been the case if all of the attempted purchases had been consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The warrant application in this case amply demonstrated probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The appellant\u2019s contention with respect to the legal insufficiency of the evidence is absurd. The thrust of the contention is that the largest single package of cocaine was found in the jacket pocket of Norman Thomas and not in the direct possession of the appellant. The contention conveniently ignores numerous other items of contraband throughout the appellant\u2019s house, just as it conveniently ignores the evidence that Norman Thomas was the appellant\u2019s \u201cconnection\u201d and was in the appellant\u2019s house for purposes of making a major delivery of cocaine to the appellant. In terms of the law of possession, moreover, the appellant also conveniently ignores the well-established principle of <em>Folk v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 511-512, 275 A.2d 184 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u201cIt is well-settled that the proscribed possession of marihuana or of narcotic drugs under the Maryland law need not be sole possession. \u2018[Tjhere may be joint possession and joint control in several persons. And the duration of the possession and the quantity possessed are not material, nor is it necessary to prove ownership in the sense of title.\u2019 <em>Jason v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 102, 111 [262 A.2d 774 (1970)]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">Nor is it necessary, in order to be found in joint possession of a contraband drug, that the appellant have a \u2018full partnership\u2019 in the contraband.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">In <em>Folk, </em>we went on to discuss, at 11 Md.App. 518, 275 A.2d 184, the circumstances which could help to demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>a party, not in direct physical possession, could nonetheless be found guilty of joint possession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201cThe common thread running through all of these cases affirming joint possession is 1) proximity between the defendant and the contraband, 2) the fact that the contraband was within the view or otherwise within the knowledge of the defendant, 3) ownership or some possessory right in the premises or the automobile in which the contraband is found, or 4) the presence of circumstances from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the defendant was participating with others in the mutual use and enjoyment of the contraband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Measured against those criteria, the evidence of guilt in this case is overwhelming. The search, executed pursuant to a warrant a few minutes after midnight on the morning of June 9, 1984, was of the home of the appellant. For purposes of assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we will, of course, assume that the search was constitutional. At the outset, we note that when the police rapped upon the door and announced their identities as officers, the appellant attempted to bar the door, and the police had to push it open by overcoming his resistance. That, by way of initial coloration, is circumstantial evidence of consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">From the appellant himself was seized $733 in cash and a small glass vial containing cocaine residue. The Zip-Loc bag seized from the jacket of Norman Thomas contained 116.2 grams of cocaine of a 77% purity level. This batch of cocaine was estimated to have a value of approximately $11,000 in that condition. Corporal Michael Callahan testified further that cocaine of that purity could be cut again and would thereby take on a street value of at least $23,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Other batches of cocaine, cocaine residue, paraphernalia for both using and packaging cocaine, marijuana and LSD, were found throughout the appellant\u2019s house. Recoveries of evidence were made from the dining room, from the kitchen, from the appellant\u2019s master bedroom, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>appellant\u2019s nightstand, from the appellant\u2019s wall safe, and from the den. The physical evidence alone abundantly supported the verdicts. But the physical evidence was far from the entire State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Testifying for the State pursuant to a plea bargain was Barbara Lee Stone, a social friend of the appellant, who was present at the time of the search. Ms. Stone testified that over the course of two days the appellant bragged about his \u201cNew York connection.\u201d When, in the course of a dinner conversation, she asked him where he got his money, he replied that he \u201cmade a lot of money selling cocaine.\u201d She then asked him where Lynn, his former live-in girlfriend, had gotten her money; the appellant replied that he paid Lynn \u201c$500 a week because she got him a connection in New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Earlier on the day of the search, Barbara Stone heard the appellant\u2019s end of a conversation in which he made arrangements for the cocaine delivery to his home that night. Numerous references were made directly to Barbara Stone and to two other social friends in her presence about \u201cthe connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Corporal Callahan questioned the appellant the next morning. The appellant acknowledged knowing there was marijuana in the house and further stated that there had been LSD in his freezer \u201csince Christ was a kid.\u201d He denied knowledge of the cocaine, however. When Corporal Callahan then told the appellant that the police knew he was expecting a delivery of cocaine from New York that night and theorized that perhaps the appellant had not yet physically seen it, the appellant replied, \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d better say anything else.\u201d The appellant paused and went on, \u201cYou got it, you know what went on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The appellant did not take the stand to testify in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">It is to state the self-evident to hold that the State established a legally sufficient, <em>prima facie </em>case of guilt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 450, 459, 247 A.2d 731 (1968); <em>Metz v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 15, 23, 262 A.2d 331 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>The Attributes of a Good Juror</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On the second day of the trial, Judge Whitfill somehow received a note from one of the jurors indicating that that juror was curious to know the appellant\u2019s place of employment and his source of income. The appellant moved that a mistrial be declared or, in the alternative, that the juror be excused. Judge Whitfill denied the motion in both of its manifestations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In support of his contention that the juror was demonstrably incompetent to serve, the appellant offers neither case law nor argument. He makes only the bald assertion that the question \u201cdemonstrated prejudice because the juror was already thinking in terms of appellant\u2019s making a living from the distribution of drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Quite to the contrary, we think the juror in question was demonstrably a model juror. Though the jury collectively is routinely admonished not to undertake discussion or analysis of the case until the entire case is submitted to them for final deliberation, this by no means implies that individual jurors should not get their minds in gear at a much earlier stage. Neither law nor logic suggests that individual jurors should not begin to think, to assess credibility, to pose questions to themselves, to frame hypotheses, to theorize, and to begin the process of appraising the evidence on a tentative basis, provided always that the process be kept open for continuing reappraisal. The question here was a bright and insightful question, of a type that any curious and dedicated juror should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>asking. It raised a natural inquiry as to which members of this Court would have been interested in knowing the answer, had we been on the jury. The law neither demands nor expects that jurors, well into the trial process, should have minds that are total blanks. That would be a sign of imbecility. Interest, alertness, and curiosity are indeed the attributes of the model juror. '</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\n<em>Reinstruction in Response to Jury Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">During the course of its deliberations, the jury passed a question out to the judge. The judge received it in the presence of and with the full knowledge of counsel. Although the question was inartfully phrased, it apparently sought the significance of the appellant\u2019s knowledge that \u201cthe man from New York\u201d was at the appellant\u2019s house and was a distributor and whether that, in turn, indicated that the appellant was a distributor. The judge pointed out that the issue before the jury was not whether the appellant was, on the facts of this case, a distributor, but whether he possessed drugs with intent to distribute. He distinguished quite properly between possession intended for private consumption and possession with intent to distribute. The foreman indicated that the jury was satisfied with the answer, and the jury resumed its deliberations. The appellant did not object until after the jury had retired to the jury room. Even then, as on this appeal, the objection was not that the court\u2019s response was incorrect but that the judge had not cleared it with counsel in advance. Maryland Rule 4-326(c) only requires the court to notify counsel that there has been a communication; it does not require the judge to submit a draft of his reply to counsel for their approval. We see no remote error. Indeed, the instruction must have been helpful, for the jury returned with its verdicts approximately two minutes after having received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">. Evidence with respect to the appellant\u2019s source of income did come out later in the trial. A defense witness, on the one hand, testified that the appellant supported himself by selling burglar alarm systems. Ms. Stone, on the other hand, testified that the appellant, by his own admission, made \"a lot of money selling cocaine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
