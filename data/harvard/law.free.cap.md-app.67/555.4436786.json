Osborne. We shall declare his effort at an end; we believe that the Comptroller is barred by the four-year statute of limitations set forth in Md.Code Ann. art. 81, \u00a7 342(a) from maintaining any action against Mr. Osborne to collect the taxes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Tax cases are seldom easy. This one has a long and somewhat tortured history and involves meshing a number of statutes. We shall start with the statutes, all of which are part of the Retail Sales Tax Act\u2014Md.Code Ann. art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 324-371.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Section 325 imposes what is essentially a 5% tax on the retail sale of tangible personal property and on the dispensing of certain services. The vendor is required to collect the tax from the vendee and to remit it, on a monthly basis, to the Comptroller. Sections 335 and 337 require the vendor to file a return on the 21st of each month showing the taxable sales made during the next preceding month and to remit, with the return, the tax due on those sales. Section 339 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cThe taxes for the period for which a return is required to be filed by \u00a7 335 of this subtitle shall be due by the vendor and payable to the Comptroller on the date limited for the filing of the return for such period, without regard to whether a return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly shows the amount of receipts and the taxes due thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Although the tax is to be paid, in the first instance, by the vendee, the vendor \u201cand any officer of any corporate vendor\u201d are personally liable for the taxes required to be collected, whether or not the vendor actually collects the tax. \u00a7\u00a7 328, 331(a). To protect the State\u2019s interest in the event of a \u201cbulk sale\u201d by the vendor, \u00a7 353 requires a person who buys, in bulk, the merchandise or fixtures of a vendor to notify the Comptroller of the sale at least ten days before taking possession. If the purchaser fails to give that notice, he \u201cshall be personally liable for the payment to the State of any taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the State from the vendor.\u201d \u00a7 356.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the Comptroller\u2019s parlance, a purchaser against whom liability is asserted under \u00a7 356 is known as a \u201csuccessor to vendor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Collection procedures are dealt with in a number of sections. For our purposes, \u00a7\u00a7 324(q), 345(a), 351-52, and 342 are most relevant. Section 324(q) defines \u201ctaxpayer\u201d\u2014 the term used in the other sections\u2014as \u201cany person required by this subtitle to make returns to the Comptroller or to pay or pay over to the Comptroller the tax imposed by this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The Comptroller has general authority under \u00a7 358 to conduct audits and investigations. Section 345(a) provides that if the Comptroller finds that a taxpayer \u201chas filed an incorrect return and paid less than the amount of the tax due under this subtitle,\u201d he shall \u201clevy a deficiency assessment iagainst the taxpayer, which shall be prima facie correct.\u201d Within 30 days after the mailing of a notice of such an assessment, the taxpayer may apply to the Comptroller for a \u201crevision of the tax assessed.\u201d \u00a7 351(a); <em>see also </em>COMAR 03.06.01.80.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If a timely application is not filed, however, \u201cthe assessment shall become final____\u201d \u00a7 351(a). The Comptroller is required by \u00a7 351(a)(3) to act \u201cpromptly\u201d upon an application for revision and to notify the taxpayer of his decision. If still dissatisfied, the taxpayer, within 30 days after the mailing of such notice, may request (and upon request is entitled to) a formal hearing before the Comptroller (actually, a hearing examiner employed by and representing the Comptroller). The decision of the hearing examiner following a formal hearing \u201cconstitutes a final determination of the Comptroller in the case.\u201d COMAR 03.06.01.80C.(7). From that final decision, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court (\u00a7 352), and ultimately to the circuit court and to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Section 342(a) provides that the tax \u201cshall become, from the time due and payable, a personal debt of the person liable to pay the same to the State of Maryland.\u201d It states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>further that \u201c[a]n action may be brought at any time within four (4) years from the time the tax shall be due and payable by the Comptroller in the name of the State to recover [the amounts due]____\u201d Subsection (b) provides that these amounts shall be a lien on the property of \u201cany person liable to pay the same to the State\u201d from and after the time that the Comptroller files a notice of the lien with the circuit court where the property is located. The lien, which the clerk is directed to index on the judgment docket, \u201cshall have the full force and effect of a lien of judgment.\u201d <em>See Farmers &amp; Merchants National Bank of Hagerstown v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 507 A.2d 172, 180-181 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">With this background, we turn to the facts of this case, which concern retail sales taxes allegedly due for the period August 1, 1975\u2014August 31, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The vendor during that period was Harford Excavating Company (Harford Company) which, as we said, was a sole proprietorship owned and operated by appellant Osborne. Effective September 1, 1977, Osborne incorporated Harford Excavating, Inc. (Harford, Inc.), of which he became president and a 96% stockholder, and dissolved Harford Company. Two other individuals\u2014Messrs. Clarendon and Anzalone\u2014also became officers of Harford, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">On July 12, 1978, following an audit, the Comptroller determined that $16,796 in taxes was due for the period noted. Believing that Harford, Inc. was a \u201csuccessor to vendor\u201d and was therefore liable under \u00a7 356, he notified the corporation that an assessment in that amount had \u201cbeen recorded against your account____\u201d The notice informed Harford, Inc. of its right to seek a revision and warned that if a timely application was not filed, the assessment would become final \u201cand a lien will be filed immediately____\u201d Harford, Inc. apparently applied for a revision, but, after an informal conference, the Comptroller confirmed the assessment. No further action was taken by the corporation and so, on November 27, 1978, the assessment against it became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The finality of the assessment did not produce the money, in part, perhaps because at some point Harford, Inc. went into bankruptcy. On January 5, 1979, the Comptroller wrote to Osborne, with copies to Clarendon and Anzalone, warning that unless he contacted the Comptroller by January 15, a lien would be placed against the corporation \u201cand all officers of the corporation will be assessed individually.\u201d Osborne did not respond; Clarendon, however, as vice-president of Harford, Inc., wrote to the Comptroller denying liability for the assessment. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cMessrs. Clarendon and Anzalone joined Harford Excavating, Inc. on the date of incorporation, September 1, 1977 and had no prior knowledge or were in any way connected with the actions of Harford Excavating Co. prior to that time. Harford Excavating Co. was a sole proprietorship operated by Winton B. Osborne and any settlement due the state of Maryland should be borne by him. We ask that the state makes <em>[sic] </em>a definite distinction between the two companies and that Messrs. Clarendon and Anzalone are not held individually responsible for the acts of Harford Excavating Co. for the aforestated reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Comptroller decided not to make the distinction requested by Mr. Clarendon, at least as to Osborne. Instead of proceeding against Osborne as the sole proprietor of the entity that actually (or allegedly) owed the tax, he elected to pursue him exclusively in his double-derivative status as an officer of the \u201csuccessor to vendor.\u201d On January 17, 1979, the Comptroller notified \u201cWinton B. Osborn\u2014Officer Harford Excavating, Inc.\u201d that an assessment of $17,293 for the period August 1, 1975 through August 31, 1977 had been recorded against his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Osborne finally reacted. He filed a timely request for revision, and, when that was denied, he sought a formal hearing, challenging both the assessment itself and the lack of timely notice to him. His argument as to the notice was that, since liability was being asserted against him as an officer, he was entitled to notice at the same time as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>corporation, i.e., July, 1978. Following a hearing, the Comptroller\u2019s hearing examiner determined that (1) Osborne was precluded from contesting the underlying assessment against Harford, Inc., as that had become final in November, 1978, and (2) he was not entitled to notice of the assessment until the assessment against the corporation became final and personal liability was asserted against him as an officer. Dissatisfied with those conclusions, Osborne appealed to the Tax Court which, on May 21, 1981, remanded the matter to the Comptroller. The Tax Court agreed that the notice of January 17, 1979, was sufficient but concluded that, under due process principles, Osborne had to be given an opportunity to contest the merits of the assessment. The Comptroller disagreed; he appealed, first to the Circuit Court for Harford County and then to this Court. In an unreported Opinion <em>(Comptroller v. Osborne, </em>S.T.1982, No. 777, Opinion filed January 21, 1983), we affirmed, concluding that \u201c[d]ue process considerations require that the Comptroller permit a corporate officer whom he intends to hold liable for corporate tax under section 331(a) to attack the merits of the assessment against the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Eventually, the case returned to the Comptroller whose hearing examiner, on December 20, 1983, decided that Osborne was correct in his attack on the underlying assessment against Harford, Inc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That corporation, he concluded, was <em>not </em>a \u201csuccessor to vendor,\u201d and thus no liability against it would accrue under \u00a7 356. That, of course, also disposed of any claim against Osborne as an officer of Harford, Inc. The collapse of that theory of liability did not dissuade the Comptroller from his pursuit of Mr. Osborne, however; the hearing examiner declared Osborne directly liable for the tax as the sole proprietor of the entity that initially should have paid it, an alternative theory that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>always been available to the Comptroller but was not really pressed until after the remand from this Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reaching that result, the hearing examiner rejected Osborne\u2019s renewed complaint about the notice and his argument that the action was barred by the \u00a7 342(a) statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Osborne then became the appellant, first to the Tax Court, then to the Circuit Court for Harford County, which concluded that the action was not barred by the statute of limitations and that Osborne was estopped from relitigating the issue of notice, and now to us, where he asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad1\">\u201cIs the Comptroller\u2019s 'action' barred by the Statute of Limitations contained in Article 81, Section 342? Is Osborne estopped from litigating the issue of Notice? Did the Comptroller give proper notice to Osborne of the alleged assessment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The controversy as to \u00a7 342(a) concerns the word \u201caction.\u201d The section, as noted, provides that an \u201caction\u201d to recover the tax may be brought at any time within four years from the time the tax is due and payable. The tax is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>due and payable with the monthly return\u2014the 21st of the next succeeding month. As the assessment against Osborne is now based on his direct liability as the sole proprietor of the vendor/taxpayer, and not in any extended or derivative capacity, the four-year clock began to tick against him as each monthly return came due during the 25-month period at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Osborne construes the word \u201caction,\u201d as used in \u00a7 342(a) as denoting a proceeding in court, or at least the filing of a lien pursuant to \u00a7 342(b), and not any administrative proceedings short of that. This, he argues, is the normal meaning given to the word in the context of statutes of limitations and is consistent with the definition in Md.Rule l-202(a). The Comptroller takes the view that judicial action is not required, that the filing of an assessment under \u00a7 345(a) constitutes the necessary \u201caction,\u201d and that the assessment filed against him, as an officer, on January 17, 1979, sufficed to comply with the statute. He tells us that he has been construing the statute that way for 39 years and urges that it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to adopt Osborne\u2019s theory, for that would force him to file suit even before a controversy over the assessment is settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\u201cAssessment\u201d and \u201caction\u201d are not terms that have constant, immutable definitions. They take their meaning from the context of their use. When dealing with <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes, for example, an \u201cassessment\u201d is normally the value assigned to the property upon which the tax is levied, and does not, of itself, measure the actual tax due. <em>See Grosvenor v. Supervisor of Assess., </em>271 Md. 232, 236-37, 315 A.2d 758 (1974), and cases cited therein. As used in the retail sales tax law, however, the term has a different meaning. It does not purport to measure the sales upon which the tax will be based, but represents and expresses the Comptroller\u2019s determination of the actual amount of tax due and payable by a taxpayer, the amount that the Comptroller intends, by whatever means are available to him, to collect from the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>What are those means of collection? One, of course, is mentioned in \u00a7 342(b). Once the Comptroller makes a final \u201cassessment,\u201d he may file a lien against the taxpayer\u2019s property, proceed then to have the property sold, and recover the taxes from the proceeds of sale. Another method is set forth in \u00a7 206(a), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cAny tax may be collected from the person liable under this article to pay the same by action of assumpsit instituted at any time after said tax shall become due and payable, within the period of limitations prescribed by this article, and such suit may be maintained notwithstanding the existence of other remedies by way of sale of real estate, or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\"><em>See also </em>\u00a7 208, authorizing the assumpsit action to be commenced by an attachment on original process, but <em>compare City of Baltimore v. Comptroller, </em>292 Md. 293, 439 A.2d 1095 (1982). Note as well \u00a7 369 providing criminal penalties for certain willful violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Fairly read, we think that the \u201caction\u201d referred to in \u00a7 342(a)\u2014the one that must be brought within four years\u2014 can include either the assumpsit action provided for in \u00a7 206 \u00f3r the filing of a lien under \u00a7 342(b). Both of those proceedings are peculiarly directed at actually \u201crecovering] the amount of any taxes, penalties and interest due under the provisions of this subtitle,\u201d which is the sole focus of \u00a7 342(a), and both are routinely brought \u201cin the name of the State,\u201d as required by the statute. We do not, however, regard the mere \u201cfiling,\u201d \u201clevying,\u201d or \u201crecording\u201d of an assessment as the equivalent of an \u201caction\u201d to \u201crecover\u201d the taxes, notwithstanding that the Comptroller has long adopted that approach. Although a long-standing construction of a statute by executive or administrative officials charged with implementing it is \u201ca strong, persuasive influence in determining the judicial construction ... \u2018[n]o custom, however venerable, can nullify the plain meaning and purpose of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Balto. Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades v. Barnes, </em>290 Md. 9, 14-15, 427 A.2d 979 (1981), quoting in part from <em>Rogan v. Baltimore &amp; O.R.R., </em>188 Md. 44, 58, 52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>A.2d 261 (1947). Given the contextual meaning of \u201cassessment\u201d in the Retail Sales Tax Act, we see nothing in the law reasonably supporting the Comptroller\u2019s view that the recording of an assessment constitutes an \u201caction\u201d under \u00a7 342(a). The assessment, as we said, is merely the Comptroller\u2019s ascertainment of what is due, and, while that is certainly a prerequisite to the recovery of the tax, the assessment is not, itself, directed at recovery or collection. Nor, unlike actions under \u00a7 206 or liens filed under \u00a7 342(b), is it \u201cin the same name of the State,\u201d as required by \u00a7 342(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">It goes without saying, of course, that, if an action to recover the tax under \u00a7 206 or \u00a7 342(b) must be filed within four years, the predicate assessment upon which such an action necessarily rests, must also be filed within the four-year period. <em>See Mechlin v. Comptroller, </em>48 Md.App. 242, 426 A.2d 1387 (1981). This proceeding, now before us, concerns only the timeliness of the assessment, and, while any answer to that question may largely be moot if, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>seems clearly to be the case, the Comptroller is absolutely barred from maintaining an \u201caction\u201d to recover the tax, we shall nevertheless provide the answer. We think that the assessment itself was not filed within the four-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As we observed in n. 5, <em>ante, </em>in the earlier proceeding, when the Comptroller was pursuing Osborne as an officer of Harford, Inc., the Circuit Court stated that Osborne was liable both as the sole proprietor of the vendor and as an officer of the \u201csuccessor to vendor,\u201d and we adopted that statement. In the context of that proceeding, the first part of the statement, noting Osborne\u2019s direct liability, may have been unnecessary <em>dicta, </em>but it was not inaccurate. Osborne, indeed, was primarily liable for the tax as the sole proprietor of the vendor. Enforcement of that liability, however, is another matter; it is subject to the procedural requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 351, 352, and 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The distinction between direct liability as a vendor and derivative liability as an officer of a \u201csuccessor to vendor\u201d is real and significant, especially in light of the Comptroller\u2019s original view that Osborne was estopped from contesting the validity of the underlying assessment. The only issue regarded as genuine by the Comptroller in the first proceeding\u2014that triggered by the January, 1979 notice of assessment\u2014was whether Osborne was, in fact, an officer of Harford, Inc. That view necessarily negates any notion that Osborne was being proceeded against in any other capacity. Obviously, if the assessment was intended to be based on Osborne\u2019s direct liability as a sole proprietor, even in part, he had to be given the opportunity to raise any defense he might have, including whether any tax was due by the sole proprietorship. On this record, therefore, it is clear to us that, whatever Osborne\u2019s statutory liability as the sole proprietor may have been, the January, 1979 assessment did not rest upon, or even seek to invoke, that liability. It was limited solely to Osborne\u2019s vicarious liability as an officer of Harford, Inc., which, as we have seen, the Comptroller later found to be non-existent.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The fact is that no assessment has ever been filed against Osborne as a sole proprietor. When the Comptroller, in December, 1983, concluded that Harford, Inc. was not a \u201csuccessor to vendor,\u201d the January, 1979 assessment vanished, and there was no other assessment in existence to take its place. By then, of course, the statute of limitations had run. The Comptroller, unfortunately, galloped down the wrong path; by the time he came to a dead end, the right path was statutorily blocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\">. For convenience, we shali generaliy regard the term \"tax\" or \"taxes\u2019 as including appropriate interest and penalties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">. The purpose of the notice is to permit the State to assert its lien for unpaid taxes against the consideration payable to the vendor. Section 355 provides, in relevant part, that the consideration payable by the purchaser \u201cshall be subject to a first priority, right and lien\u201d for taxes due from the vendor, and forbids the transfer of such consideration to the vendor \"to the extent of the amount of the State\u2019s claim for unpaid taxes____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\">. There does not appear to be any direct statutory obligation to send a notice to the taxpayer, nor do the Comptroller\u2019s regulations contain any such obligation. It is certainly implicit from \u00a7 351(a), however, that such a notice must be sent and that the assessment is not effective until the notice is sent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\">. We don't know why it took so long for the case to be decided on remand. As noted, our Opinion was filed January 21, 1983, and there is no record of a petition for <em>certiorari </em>in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\">. At oral argument, the Comptroller suggested that Mr. Osborne\u2019s direct personal liability as the sole proprietor had always been at issue, but the record simply does not bear that out. The January 17, 1979 notice is addressed to Osborne specifically as an officer of Harford, Inc. In initially rejecting his application for revision, the Comptroller (through his hearing officer) concluded that \u201cMr. Osborne\u2019s personal liability in this matter does not rest on the taxability of any particular transaction <em>but upon his status as an officer of the corporation.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) In the first Tax Court proceeding, counsel for the Comptroller framed \u201d[t]he only issue before the Court today\u201d as \"whether Mr. Osborne <em>as an acknowledged officer, </em>president of Harford Excavating, Inc., is responsible for that assessment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It was the Circuit Court that first observed that Osborne \"is liable on two counts, first as the sole proprietor who ran up the tax bill and later as an officer of the Corporation.\u201d Yet, despite that statement, in his appeal to us the Comptroller never argued such direct personal liability. The question presented and argued in his brief was whether \u201cOsborne, <em>as Officer of Harford Excavating, Inc., </em>[is] personally liable for unpaid sales and use taxes <em>owed by that corporation </em>pursuant to Section 331(a) of Article 81.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Unfortunately, in our <em>per curiam </em>Opinion, we quoted the statement of the Circuit Court with respect to Osborne\u2019s direct liability-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b593-5\">. We do not regard this view as \"absurd\u201d or as necessarily creating administrative hardships. In the first place, we see no reason why it should take any appreciable length of time to resolve controversies concerning who owes what amount of sales taxes. There are strict time limits on the invocation of review procedures, and it is rare indeed that these cases go beyond the circuit court. The delay in this case strikes us as an extraordinary one, nearly all of which was due to the Comptroller\u2019s initial attempt to pursue Osborne solely in his double-derivative capacity as an officer of a \"successor to vendor\u201d rather than as the person directly responsible. Moreover, we see no reason why, in the unusual case, the Comptroller cannot protect himself by filing either a lien or a lawsuit pending judicial review of the assessment. The lien, it would seem from \u00a7 342(b), can be filed \u201cfrom and after the time when notice has been given that such tax has become due and payable as provided herein\u201d; that means any time after the Comptroller issues <em>his </em>final decision as to the assessment pursuant to \u00a7 351. That such a procedure may, in some instances, work to the disadvantage of the taxpayer would be unfortunate, but the law, we think, is clear. Compare 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6501 and 6502, providing a two-stage statute of limitations for Federal income and excise taxes\u2014generally, three years to assess and six years after assessment to levy or begin a proceeding to collect the tax. <em>See also </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6502-l(a)(2), permitting agreements to extend the six-year period for collection actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
