The evidence adduced in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County disclosed that appellant forged the indorsement on the back of an otherwise valid check and then cashed it. Relying on <em>Green v. </em>State, 32 Md.App. 567, 363 A.2d 530 (1976), the trial court granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the forgery count. The court refused, however, to dismiss the uttering charge and found Harris guilty of uttering a false bill of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In <em>Green, </em>this Court held that because Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 44 separately listed indorsement of a bill of exchange as a subject of forgery, \u201ca person may not be convicted of forging a check when the proof shows that he forged only an indorsement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 363 A.2d at 534. Because art. 27, \u00a7 44 also separately lists indorsement of a bill of exchange as a subject of uttering, we find that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Green </em>supports appellant\u2019s claim that there is a fatal variance between the crime established at trial and the crime for which he stands convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
