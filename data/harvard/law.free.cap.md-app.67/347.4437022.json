Consecutive sentences of three years\u2019 imprisonment were imposed. Appellant raises the following questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">1. Did the court below err in failing to determine whether appellant was competent to stand trial, and, thereafter, in failing to determine whether appellant was competent to waive his right to counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">2. Did the court below err in refusing appellant\u2019s request to retract his waiver of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">3. Did the court below err in proceeding with the trial in appellant\u2019s absence, where appellant was representing himself and no counsel was appointed to represent appellant\u2019s interests during the period of time appellant was absent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">4. Did the court below err in failing to conduct a hearing in response to appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, relying instead upon the ruling of a judge in a previous trial that had ended in a mistrial because of the court\u2019s determination that appellant was incompetent to stand trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">5. Did the court below err in giving an improper <em>\u201cAllen </em>charge\u201d to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">6. Did the court below err in imposing double punishment for one offense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">Our answer to each of the questions presented is no, for reasons we shall explain. Since the issues raised by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>appeal are fairly numerous and complex, we will first set out the facts in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Appellant was arrested on January 2, 1983, and a privately retained attorney entered his appearance on appellant\u2019s behalf. Appellant elected a jury trial and waived his right to be tried within 180 days pursuant to Maryland Rule 746.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial scheduled for January 5, 1984, was postponed so that appellant could be examined by the court\u2019s medical staff to determine his competency to stand trial. He was examined on February 3, 1984, and found to be competent. The trial was postponed again on July 20, 1984, at appellant\u2019s request, to give him more time to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The trial began before Judge Wahl on October 2, 1984. Appellant was represented by privately retained counsel. When the prosecutor called the second charge, unlawful possession of a handgun by one previously convicted of a crime of violence, appellant objected. The court told him not to interrupt the proceedings and speak through his attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">THE COURT: ... While you are sitting in this case you won\u2019t say anything. You are not going to express yourself out loud, you are not going to have any outbursts. You have nothing to say to the court, that is not to say you can\u2019t whisper to your attorney, but I don\u2019t want any outburst. If you do insist on speaking out loud or making outbursts you will find yourself held in contempt of court and you will be back in jail. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">DEFENDANT JOHNSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">THE COURT: This is not your opportunity to talk, it\u2019s your attorney who will do the talking, you may whisper to him as I told you. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>DEFENDANT JOHNSON: Yes, I understand what you said. I am not familiar with that. And when I am not familiar with it in any court I speak up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">THE COURT: Do you want to not have an attorney and proceed in proper person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">DEFENDANT JOHNSON: Preferably a postponement. THE COURT: I ask you to let your attorney speak for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">MR. LEVINSON [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: I want the record to show that the Defendant has been in court on numerous occasions and the Defendant has been advised of his right to counsel and he had counsel and has fired [sic] and in proceeding he has either a counsel or been advised of his right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">THE COURT: Sir, I am asking you for the last time are you going to let your attorney speak for you and remain quiet yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">DEFENDANT JOHNSON: I will remain quiet, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Following this exchange, the court heard a number of pre-trial motions, including a motion to suppress the handgun found on appellant\u2019s person at the time of his arrest; which was denied. A jury was empaneled and sworn, and the State began to present its case. Appellant repeatedly interrupted the proceedings and, after several unsuccessful attempts to quieten him, he was removed from the courtroom. He was removed from the courtroom the following day, after several more interruptions, and sent to the medical staff of the circuit court for an evaluation. The medical staff made a preliminary finding that appellant was incompetent to stand trial. Based on that report and his attorney\u2019s proffer that he was incompetent, Judge Wahl granted appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and ordered him sent to Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital for evaluation. Appellant was also allowed to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The results of the examination at Perkins are not in the record. The record does, however, reflect that on December 17, 1984, the trial was postponed again at appellant\u2019s request. On that date the appearance of his privately retained counsel was stricken and the Public Defender entered his appearance on behalf of appellant. The trial was postponed in January of 1985 to give the defense more time to prepare, and was postponed a sixth time in February of 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The trial finally began on March 19, 1985, before Judge Marvin Steinberg. After the judge had ruled on a number of pre-trial motions, appellant began to interrupt. The judge told him to speak through his attorney. He replied, \u201cI will talk through him but I\u2019m saying, Your Honor, I don\u2019t trust no lawyers, number one.\u201d He was asked if he wanted to proceed with counsel. He answered, \u201cPm saying, if he is going to cooperate with me and we do it together, yes.\u201d The judge granted a brief recess so that appellant could confer with his attorney. After the recess, Mr. Turner, his attorney, told the court: \u201cYour Honor, all I can report to you, as an officer of the court, is that Mr. Johnson says \u2018you can go ahead and do what you want, but I am going to interrupt if it\u2019s not going right.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The proceedings continued. Defense counsel moved for a severance of the charges, which was denied. Appellant apparently became dissatisfied with his attorney\u2019s efforts on his behalf:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Judge, Your Honor, I request a postponement, please. I\u2019m not staying here. All that lying. I\u2019m not going for it ... I\u2019m not going for that ... I object to all of it, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">MR. TURNER: May we approach the Bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">THE DEFENDANT: I will handle my case myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqS\">THE CLERK: [sic] I would like to see counsel at the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to represent me. He\u2019s not competent. I object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Following a lengthy waiver inquiry, the judge found that appellant had waived his right to counsel. Mr. Turner\u2019s appearance was stricken, but he was told to remain in the courtroom to advise appellant, if appellant so desired. All remaining motions were disposed of with appellant representing himself. Jury selection began. At that point appellant requested, and was refused, permission to withdraw his waiver of counsel. A jury was empaneled and sworn, and opening statements were made. After the jury was dismissed for the evening, appellant renewed his objection to being tried for the charge of unlawful possession of a handgun by one previously convicted of a crime of violence. That charge had been brought by way of a criminal information. Appellant believed that he could not be charged by way of a criminal information unless he consented to being charged in that manner. He also argued that the evidence supporting that charge, that he had previously been convicted of crime of violence, would be prejudicial to the other charge and should not be introduced. He stated repeatedly that he completely disagreed with the court\u2019s views on these issues. He was asked if he had any requests for the next day, and he responded: \u201cI would rather not come in here, if you are going to do that. I keep telling you that. I\u2019m not sitting here no way with a criminal information. I have a right. This is my constitutionality, and you always rule in favor for [the prosecutor].\u201d The judge told appellant to sit down or he would be removed from the courtroom. Appellant declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">You can take me out where I came from. I told you I don\u2019t like this lying and double-dealing. This has nothing to do with the handgun, nothing, and I can\u2019t get an impartial trial if you keep bringing that shit up. Guilty or not. He don\u2019t know nothing about that. No, I won\u2019t go along with that. No. Hell no. I\u2019m tired. No, I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m not submitting to anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">After a discussion about the next day\u2019s witnesses, appellant once more objected to the charge of illegal possession of a handgun by one previously convicted of a crime of violence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>saying, \u201c[t]his has to be reflected on the record, because I told you I am not consenting to that. The only charge I am consenting to is the illegal possession of a handgun.\u201d Court was adjourned, and Mr. Turner was told to return the next day to advise appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The next morning appellant declared that he was disqualifying himself as his attorney, and his mother was going to hire an attorney for him. The court would not permit him to withdraw his waiver of counsel and hire another attorney. Appellant then stated that he refused to participate in the trial at all, and insisted that he be allowed to leave the courtroom. The prosecutor suggested that appellant be forced to stay in the courtroom. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADE\">THE COURT: Mr. Levenson, I think that the Court cannot force Mr. Johnson to have a lawyer, and I think the Court cannot force Mr. Johnson to leave or stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">Mr. Johnson appears to the Court to be acting in a perfectly rational way. He appears to know full-well the nature of these proceedings. He has discussed motions with this Court. He has given the Court reasons. He has expressed a desire that he wants to leave the courtroom. He does not have to be present during the trial, I think, if he wants to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">Is that your request, that you leave the trial, Mr. Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Before appellant left, the court reiterated that Mr. Turner would remain in the courtroom to advise the court. Appellant was told he could return at any time. He refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">After the State concluded its case, appellant was brought back into the courtroom. Mr. Turner advised him of the status of the case and asked if appellant wanted to do anything. He responded, \u201cI object to this whole procedure. I don\u2019t want nothing to do with it.\u201d He told the court that he objected on the grounds (1) that he was not competent enough to represent himself; and (2) that the State did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>allow him enough time to prepare his case; and (3) that he was trying to obtain counsel. He then said that he was under the influence of drugs. The court stated: \u201cLet the record show that it is the observation of the Court that Mr. Johnson appears to be normal in all respects and understands full-well what is happening and is able to communicate his thoughts and concerns quite coherently to the Court.\u201d Appellant was then, at his request, excused from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Mr. Turner suggested to the court that a motion for judgment of acquittal be made on behalf of appellant. The court made such a motion and denied it. The State made a closing argument. Rather than summarize the State\u2019s case, suffice it to say that appellant does not question the sufficiency of the evidence. After deliberating for half an hour, the jury found appellant guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s competence to stand trial and his competence to waive his right to counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We note at the outset that the test for determining competency to stand trial, as set out in Md.Health\u2014General Code Ann. \u00a7 12-101(d) (1985 Cum.Supp.), is whether the accused is able to understand the nature or object of the proceeding or is able to assist in his defense. <em>See Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 372 A.2d 1069 (1977). One accused of criminal conduct is presumed to be competent to stand trial. <em>Hill v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 105, 369 A.2d 98 (1977). However, \u00a7 12-103(a) of the Health\u2014General Article mandates that: \u201c[i]f, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s duty to determine the competency of an accused to stand trial is triggered in one of three ways: (1) upon an allegation by the accused himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>that he is incompetent; (2) upon an allegation by defense counsel that the accused is incompetent; or (3) upon the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>decision that the accused appears to be incompetent. <em>Smith v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 670, 677, 491 A.2d 587, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 96, 497 A.2d 819 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Although a judicial determination of the accused\u2019s competency to stand trial is mandatory in any of those three situations, where the accused has been found competent and thereafter alleges that he is incompetent, the court is not required to hold an additional hearing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to competency. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 372, 377, 500 A.2d 676 (1985). Appellant argues that where, as here, an accused has been adjudicated incompetent to stand trial, a presumption arises that he is incompetent for purposes of all subsequent proceedings. Thus, he asserts, an additional evidentiary hearing on the record was mandatory before further proceedings could be held. We need not decide whether appellant\u2019s argument is correct, however, because, contrary to his recitation of the facts, he had never been judicially determined to be incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> Appellant\u2019s competence to stand trial was not raised before or during the trial. When questioned by the court, appellant stated that he was not mentally ill. He argues now that it would be somewhat circular to hold that one who is incompetent to stand trial must be competent enough to understand that he is incompetent to stand trial. This may be so. Nonetheless, we note that while appellant was still represented by counsel, his attorney told the court that he thought appellant was competent to stand trial. In addition, the trial judge conducted a lengthy and detailed examination of appellant. The judge\u2019s questions concerned not only appellant\u2019s understanding of the charges and of his rights, but also inquired into appellant\u2019s age, family history, educational background, work history, medical history and psychological history. Appellant answered all of the judge\u2019s questions in a rational, coherent manner. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>displayed a marked degree of sophistication about the law. While his legal skills were not those of a lawyer, he did appear to have gained some practical understanding of the law, perhaps through his prior confrontations with it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In sum, there is every indication in the record that appellant met the standard of competency to stand trial. To be sure, the results of his evaluation at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital is not contained in the record. We infer, however, from the fact that he had been returned for trial, that he had been found competent by the staff of that institution. Moreover, that issue was not raised and decided by the lower court and has not been preserved for our review. Rule 1085. We hold, therefore, that the trial judge did not err in failing to conduct <em>sua sponte </em>an evidentiary hearing to determine appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Nevertheless, appellant contends that a finding of competency to stand trial does not automatically lead to a conclusion that an accused is also competent to waive his right to counsel. <em>See Mann v. State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County, </em>298 Md. 160, 169, 468 A.2d 124 (1988). Thus, he argues that the trial court erred in failing to determine his competency to waive his right to counsel. We do not agree that the trial judge failed to make this determination, nor do we find that his determination was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2527, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the Supreme Court held that an accused in a criminal prosecution has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so. The Court recognized that the <em>pro se </em>defendant relinquishes many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel, and stated that \u201c[f]or this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must \u2018knowingly and intelligently\u2019 forgo those relinquished benefits.\u201d 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541 (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464-65, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 146 A.L.R. 357 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Rule 4-215 implements the constitutional mandates for waiver of counsel. <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 130, 406 A.2d 98 (1979). That rule provides that before a defendant may discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered and proceed <em>pro se, </em>the trial judge must first determine that the waiver is knowing and voluntary. As part of this inquiry the court must inform the defendant of the right to counsel and of the importance of the assistance of counsel, and advise him of the nature of the charges in the charging document and the possible penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In this case the record reveals a remarkably patient and thorough compliance with this rule. The waiver inquiry began as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">MR. TURNER [defense counsel]: Your Honor, I don\u2019t know what my status was in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">THE COURT: Your status right now is that you represent Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to represent me, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">THE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">THE DEFENDANT: And I have valid reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, please be seated. We have disposed of, I think, three preliminary motions, and about at that time, I think Mr. Johnson indicated to the Court that he wanted to discharge his counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Is that correct, gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">MR. TURNER: That is my recollection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Mr. Johnson, is it your desire to discharge your counsel now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">THE COURT: And you want to proceed on your own?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">THE COURT: Without a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Appellant was then placed under oath, after carefully noting: \u201cFor the record, your Honor, I don\u2019t swear, I affirm.\u201d He was questioned extensively about his background. The court informed him of the charges and the possible penalties, and appellant stated that he understood.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">The transcript continues as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-15\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-16\">Do you know what a lawyer does for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-18\">When you obtain counsel, he is supposed to assist you. It\u2019s his duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-19\">THE COURT: You have had lawyers before; have you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-20\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, some of the best in Baltimore, Maryland, some of the best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-21\">THE COURT: Do you understand that a lawyer is specially trained and educated to assist you in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-22\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-23\">THE COURT: Do you understand that an attorney would probably be of extreme importance in determining whether or not you might have a defense to any of these charges or whether or not there are any factors which would tend to mitigate or lessen the sentence even if you were guilty? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-24\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>THE COURT: Do you understand that if you had an attorney, he could help you in preparing for trial; he could represent you here and continue to do so, as Mr. Turner has been doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">THE DEFENDANT: Judge, Your Honor, insofar as Mr. Turner, like I explained to you earlier, I was trying to clarify a matter of importance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">THE COURT: We are not talking about Mr. Turner. I just want to make sure you understand what you are giving up when you give up a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">THE DEFENDANT: I understand. I\u2019m saying if he is not going to help me, I don\u2019t need him. I don\u2019t need him to help me to go to jail. I could do that on my own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">THE COURT: Do you understand if you had a lawyer, he would help you to cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">THE COURT: Do you understand that if you had a lawyer, he would help you in determining what witnesses should be called in your behalf? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">THE COURT: Do you understand that an attorney could assist you in your decision as to whether or not you should take the stand in your own behalf and testify in your own behalf? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">THE COURT: Do you understand that if you had a lawyer, he could make and would probably make legal argument in your behalf? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">THE COURT: And that also the attorney would present the facts as favorably as possible to your side of the case before the Court or before the jury. A lawyer would help you do that. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>THE COURT: Do you understand that even if you change your plea to a guilty plea, that a lawyer would be helpful in assisting you in developing information that would affect the sentence or other disposition of your case? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">THE COURT: Now, you know that Mr. Turner is with the Public Defender\u2019s Office, and even if you could not afford a lawyer, you could continue having the Public Defender\u2019s Office represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">THE COURT: Do you understand that when we proceed to the trial of these charges, that you have certain rights? One of them is to call witnesses in your own behalf.

LEVENSON: I would concur with that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">THE COURT: All right. Then the Court finds this defendant has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, and we will proceed with the defendant representing himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">I do ask you, Mr. Turner, if you would, to simply remain as a observer at the trial table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">MR. TURNER: At the trial table, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">THE COURT: No, I\u2019m sorry. Just in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">MR. TURNER: And I would ask that our appearance be stricken from this case, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, Mr. Turner has asked that his appearance be struck. Do you have any objection to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">THE DEFENDANT: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">After this exchange, the court granted permission for defense counsel\u2019s appearance to be stricken, but required him to remain in the courtroom near appellant, to advise him if necessary. Counsel remained for that purpose. We, quite frankly, fail to see how this inquiry, which appellant characterizes as \u201csimply routine\u201d, could have been more thorough; nor do we feel that the judge was wrong when he found that appellant had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\"><em>The trial judge\u2019s refusal to re-appoint defense counsel </em>After the appearance of defense counsel was stricken, the charges were again read to the appellant. He elected a jury trial on the charge of unlawfully carrying a handgun and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>moved for a severance on the charge of unlawful possession of a handgun by one previously convicted of a crime of violence. He argued that the evidence pertaining to the latter charge would be prejudicial to the former, and introduced an exhibit in support of the motion. He also renewed his motion to suppress the handgun, moved for dismissal of the charges on speedy trial grounds, and objected to being charged by way of criminal information. After the motions were denied, he renewed his election of a jury trial and wrote out voir dire questions for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The judge called in a jury panel and introduced the parties. He told the prospective jurors that appellant would represent himself. The judge then asked appellant and the State to select a jury, whereupon appellant stated, \u201cHe can take it at this point.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">But what I\u2019m saying, like I said, I don\u2019t know the rules in its entirety insofar as dealing with a jury and the questions and so forth and so on, and being as though I am the defendant, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the Court and myself and to the State to, you know, cross-examine. I can pass the information on to Mr. Turner with reference to what occurred that night. Up until, you know, this point, I would rather for him to go ahead and take it over, but on the motions, I would rather present it myself, like I said. I am still not in agreement, though.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Mr. Turner was called to the bench. He stated that, if ordered to do so, he would represent appellant. He was, however, very concerned about post-conviction problems because his appearance had been stricken. He also reminded the court that appellant had stated on the record that he thought Turner was incompetent and incapable of representing him. The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQK\">THE COURT: Do you have any doubts at all now about Mr. Turner\u2019s competency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, Your Honor, the damage is done. When he brought that other stuff\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3M\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, I think we will proceed with your representing yourself. The Court found that you knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to have a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">THE DEFENDANT: But I\u2019m saying, Your Honor, I am not knowledgeable about jury proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">THE COURT: You\u2019ll have to do the best you can. You have decided to proceed without a lawyer. Please return to the trial table. We will proceed with this case, and you will continue to represent yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">THE DEFENDANT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Turner, in accordance with our previous discussions, will you make yourself available\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">MR. TURNER: Certainly, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">THE COURT: \u2014to the defendant, sitting on the first bench there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">MR. TURNER: Very well, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, as we have discussed previously, Mr. Turner is sitting in as an observer, and you are free to ask him any questions, if you want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Following this exchange, jury selection was completed. Appellant participated fully. He provided the names and addresses of the witnesses he intended to call, kept track of the jurors who responded to certain questions, and questioned some of the jurors. He also made an opening statement to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Appellant now argues that the court\u2019s refusal to allow him to retract his waiver of counsel was an abuse of discretion. He acknowledges that an accused may not vacillate forever on the issue of whether he wants counsel, and that at some point a court is justified in insisting that the accused abide by his decision to represent himself. But in this case, appellant argues, he was clearly not trying to manipulate the system. Our review of the record leads us to conclude otherwise. Simply because the judge could have ordered Mr. Turner to re-enter his appearance immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ately, does not make it an abuse of discretion for him not to have done so. Appellant\u2019s statements concerning Mr. Turner can best be characterized as mistrustful and contemptuous. He had, shortly before, declared that Mr. Turner was incompetent to defend him. Furthermore, after the court told appellant to continue his own defense, he proceeded in a rational, competent, coherent manner. It is interesting to note that none of appellant\u2019s outbursts took place in front of the jury\u2014they were all reserved for the judge and for counsel. Under these circumstances we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to re-appoint Mr. Turner to represent appellant. <em>See, e.g., Glenn v. United States, </em>303 F.2d 536, 540-41, <em>cert. denied sub. nom., Belvin v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 922, 83 S.Ct. 737, 9 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963); <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em>396 Mass. 790, 383 N.E.2d 835, 839 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\n<em>The court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel for appellant during his voluntary absence from the trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWO\">On the second morning of the trial Mr. Turner sought permission from the court to have another assistant Public Defender appointed as stand-by counsel. Appellant made the following response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">At this point, I disqualify myself, and I feel as though I am not competent enough to proceed as my attorney. So I called my mother last night. She is going to get me an attorney, and so I am declining that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">I would like to say this, Your Honor, in reference to the latter charge, this is why I am in accordance with the Maryland Rules of Procedure, that I didn\u2019t have time enough to adequately prepare my case and my defense on the latter charge. It hit me as an element of surprise; so therefore I feel that the motion for postponement should be granted to preserve my right to obtain counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfF\">The trial judge denied both the motion to disqualify appellant from representing himself and the motion for a post<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ponement. Appellant now argues that the denial of these motions was an abuse of discretion. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Since jeopardy had already attached, the motion for a postponement was, in effect, a request for a continuance. The granting of a continuance rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the failure to grant a continuance is prejudicial to the defendant. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>288 Md. 191, 416 A.2d 278 (1980); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 162, 467 A.2d 522 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The facts of a particular case determine whether the denial of a continuance to obtain counsel is a violation of due process. <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964). A defendant\u2019s freedom to choose his own counsel may not be used to subvert the orderly procedure of the courts or the fair administration of justice. <em>United States v. Casey, </em>480 F.2d 151, 152 (5th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1045, 94 S.Ct. 550, 38 L.Ed.2d 336. Last minute substitutions of counsel which require a continuance are particularly disfavored once the trial has begun and jeopardy has attached. <em>See, e.g., Pickens v. State, </em>96 Wis.2d 549, 292 N.W.2d 601 (1980) (trial court did not err in refusing to honor defendant\u2019s attempted waiver of counsel on second day of rape trial); <em>German v. State, </em>268 Ind. 67, 373 N.E.2d 880 (1978) (no error in refusing to allow retraction of waiver of counsel on first morning of trial, after jury was empaneled).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We were faced with a similar situation in <em>Mitchell v. State, supra. </em>In <em>Mitchell, </em>after the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, the defendant asked that his attorney be discharged and the Public Defender be appointed to represent him. After finding the defendant\u2019s reasons for wanting to discharge his attorney to be non-meritorious, the trial court gave him the option of continuing with his original attorneys or proceeding <em>pro se. </em>After a full waiver inquiry, the defendant elected to represent himself, and then argued on appeal that his decision to do so was coerced. In rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that argument this court stated: \u201cWe recognize that every defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel must remain inviolate. At the same time, we cannot allow the judicial system to brought to a grinding halt by a perversion of those rights through eleventh hour attempts to abort criminal trials.\u201d 56 Md.App. at 177, 467 A.2d 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We believe that the case <em>sub judice </em>involves just such an attempt. The case had been postponed six times and ended in a mistrial once. Appellant had a history of firing attorneys. His response to unfavorable rulings was a consistent refrain of \u201cMy lawyer is no good; I want a postponement.\u201d Appellant\u2019s claim that the charge of unlawful possession of a handgun by one previously convicted of a crime of violence came as a complete surprise to him is patently absurd. The trial judge was not confronted with a defendant who was incompetent to stand trial. He was confronted with a defendant who was unwilling to stand trial. We believe that he responded appropriately when he denied the motion for a continuance to obtain substitute counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Shortly after the judge denied his motion for a continuance to obtain substitute counsel, appellant insisted on leaving the courtroom. He said repeatedly that he was not going to participate in the trial and stood up to walk out.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The judge, after questioning him to determine whether he was \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waiving his right to be present, was of the opinion that he could not force appellant to stay in the courtroom. He granted permission for appellant to leave, but insisted that stand-by counsel remain to assist and advise the court regarding appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Appellant now argues that the trial court\u2019s acceptance of his waiver of his right to counsel, his assertion of his right to self-representation, and his waiver of his right to be present at trial, denied him a fair trial. He characterizes the trial court\u2019s attitude as \u201centirely too cavalier.\u201d We do not see it that way. The record reflects a series of remarkably patient and careful attempts to accomodate appellant, which began long before his second trial. Now, on appeal, his attorneys argue essentially that he had no right to make these independent, voluntary decisions because they were foolish. We know of no law that requires that a defendant be wise in order to stand trial; he is only required to be competent. We know of no law that requires a defendant be wise in order to waive important rights; it is only required that he understand the possible consequences. Appellant met both of these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We think appellant\u2019s situation is not unlike those where the <em>pro se </em>defendant simply chooses to remain silent, and in that manner refuses to participate at all. <em>See, e.g., Bishop v. State, </em>95 Nev. 511, 597 P.2d 273 (1979); <em>People v. Teron, </em>23 Cal.3d 103, 151 Cal.Rptr. 633, 588 P.2d 773 (1979). Nor is it very different from a situation where a <em>pro se </em>defendant declines to plead guilty, but actively works to bring about his own conviction by systematically bringing out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>unfavorable evidence. <em>See, e.g., Goode v. Wainwright, </em>704 F.2d 593 (11th Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>464 U.S. 78, 104 S.Ct. 378, 78 L.Ed.2d 187, <em>reh. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1017, 79 L.Ed.2d 247. In none of these situations have the courts imposed a duty on the defendant to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The trial court appointed stand-by counsel and insisted he remain throughout the trial. Appellant argues that the court should have gone further and created an attorney-client relationship by appointing counsel to be appellant\u2019s attorney during his absence. While we might have been more comfortable if the trial judge had appointed an attorney to represent appellant, any attorney-client relationship created under those circumstances would have been a sham. Appellant made it clear that he was not going to participate in the trial unless the court acted favorably on his motions. Under those circumstances, it would have been an empty gesture for the court to have appointed an attorney to act as counsel for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">It is clear from the record that appellant was competent to assist in his defense. He was simply unwilling to do so. It is also clear from the record that appellant knew exactly what he was doing when he chose to waive counsel, elected to represent himself and then elected to leave the courtroom. And, as we have already observed, this case had already been postponed six times and ended in a mistrial once.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Under these circumstances, we find that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he declined to appoint counsel for appellant during his voluntary absence from the courtroom and chose instead to rely on stand-by counsel. <em>C.f., State v. Wiggins, </em>158 N.J.Super. 27, 385 A.2d 318 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">\n<em>The. motion to suppress evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADz\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress a handgun found on his person during his arrest. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>motion had been previously denied by Judge Wahl, Judge Steinberg would not rehear it. Appellant contends that this was reversible error. He argues that Judge Wahl\u2019s grant of a mistrial during his first trial on the charges nullified all proceedings, including her denial of the motion to suppress. In <em>Logue v. State, </em>282 Md. 625, 386 A.2d 780 (1978), the Court of Appeals rejected a similar argument. In that case, prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress evidence seized as a result of a warrantless search. The motion was denied, and following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted. He moved for a new trial which was granted. At his retrial he argued that he was entitled, as a matter of right, to a rehearing on his motion to suppress. In rejecting that contention, the Court differentiated between the various phases of prosecution from arrest to sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC3\">The fallacy in his argument is that he perceives all phases of his prosecution from arrest to sentence as part of his trial. With this proposition we disagree. The trial of an accused is that phase of the proceeding where evidence is submitted to the fact finder in open court to determine the guilt or innocence of a defendant; a new trial or trial <em>de novo </em>is granted the defendant to afford him an opportunity to re-examine an issue of fact with a view to correcting errors which have occurred in the course of the preceding trial. It is the function of the trial judge to determine what evidence shall be considered by the jury and in doing so he makes this determination outside the presence of the jury. Thus a motion attacking the charging document, a motion to suppress identification testimony, a motion to suppress evidence unlawfully seized are all matters conducted by the trial judge outside the presence of the jury for the protection of the defendant to assure him a fair trial. When such motion has been fully heard and considered and there is no new evidence which was unavailable at the first hearing, the trial judge may exercise his discretion and bind himself by the prior ruling whether the proceeding is the original trial or a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 628, 386 A.2d 780. <em>See </em>Rule 4-252(g)(2). We view this language as dispositive. Appellant does not argue that he had any new evidence to present to Judge Steinberg which was unavailable at the suppression hearing before Judge Wahl. We hold that, under these circumstances, Judge Steinberg did not abuse his discretion by declining to rehear the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><em>The claim of an improper \u201cAllen charge </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADI\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in giving an improper <em>\u201cAllen </em>charge\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the jury. At the trial, before the jury retired and within the context of lengthy and thorough jury instructions, the court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">When you do reach a verdict, that verdict must be unanimous. All twelve of you must agree. There are many cases in which absolute certainty cannot be expected, and although the verdict must be the verdict of each individual juror, as a result of his or her own convictions and not merely acquiescence to the conclusions of what other people say. Each of you should examine the question submitted with candor and with a proper regard and deference to the opinions of your fellow jurors. In other words, you should listen to each other and not just give up, throw in the sponge, to get a verdict. You should listen and keep an open mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">It is your duty to decide this case, if you can, conscientiously do so, and you should listen with a disposition to being convinced to each other\u2019s arguments. Simply keep an open mind and listen to each other. If your views are contrary to those of the vast majority, you should consider whether your views, which make no impression on the minds of others, are correct, or consider whether it\u2019s the other way around. You must conscientiously come to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>decision. You should attempt to influence each other and be influenced by each other and keep an open mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">As this instruction was not objected to, it has not been preserved for our review. Rule 1085. Appellant argues that he can hardly be faulted for failing to object to this instruction since it was given when he was \u201cunrepresented.\u201d He is wrong. As we have already observed, his decision to represent himself was knowing and voluntary and he chose not to put on a defense. Nor do we view this instruction as that type of plain error which we may, on our own motion, take cognizance of and correct. <em>See Vernon v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 157, 163, 277 A.2d 635 (1971); Rule 4-325(e). Appellant contends that the instruction given by the court was akin to the traditional <em>\u201cAllen </em>charge\u201d, which the Court of Appeals has held to be improper in this State. <em>See Burnette v. State, </em>280 Md. 88, 371 A.2d 663 (1977); <em>Goodmuth v. State, </em>302 Md. 613, 490 A.2d 682 (1985). Our reading of the instruction given convinces us that it sufficiently communicated the substance of the instruction recommended by the American Bar Association and approved by the Court of Appeals in <em>Burnette v. State, supra. </em>Thus, the instruction, if erroneous at all, was not plainly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>The sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Finally, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in imposing double punishment for one offense. He says that this is so because identical conduct on his part led to both of his convictions. Therefore, he argues, the two offenses should have been treated as one for purposes of sentencing. This argument is essentially a rewording of the \u201cactual evidence\u201d test for determining whether two offenses merge for purposes of <em>sentencing\u2014i.e., </em>whether the evidence actually produced at trial as to both offenses is substantially the same. This test has been specifically rejected in favor of the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 19, 23, 79 S.Ct. 560, 564, 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>L.Ed.2d 597 (1959); <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>289 F.2d 909 (2d Cir.1961); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 353 A.2d 240 (1975). Thus, the test to be used for determining whether two offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes is whether each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>284 Md. 416, 397 A.2d 596 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In order to secure a conviction for a violation of Md.Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(b), the State must prove that the defendant (1) unlawfully, (2) wore, carried or transported, (3) on or about his person (4) a handgun. A violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 445(c) requires proof of (1) simple possession, (2) of a pistol or revolver, (3) by a person who has previously been convicted of a crime of violence. Thus, the identical conduct\u2014having a gun\u2014could constitute one, both, or neither of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Article 27, \u00a7 36B was originally enacted by Ch. 13, Acts of 1972. The Act, according to the declaration of policy enacted with it, is intended to reduce the alarming increase in violent crimes involving handguns by getting handguns off the streets, without regard to any previously demonstrated propensity for violence on the part of the handgun owner. Art. 27, \u00a7 445(c), on the other hand, is a much older statute. It is derived from former Md.Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 531D (1939, 1947 cum supp.) and was originally enacted by Ch. 622, Acts of 1941. It is intended to prevent those who have already demonstrated a propensity for violence, as evidenced by a conviction of a crime of violence, from possessing handguns. Although each statute stems from a general intention to reduce violent crimes, this general intention does not cause the offenses to merge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge did not commit error when he sentenced appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\">. This rule in its present form is Rule 4-271.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. The record is replete with evidence that appellant understood far more than simply the nature of these proceedings, as is best illustrated by the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, do you understand that the maximum sentence that could be imposed on you, and I would like the State\u2019s Attorney to correct me if I am wrong, would be a total of six years in jail and $3,500 in fines?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">MR. LEVENSON: That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">THE DEFENDANT: That is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">THE COURT: Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">THE DEFENDANT: This is incorrect, though.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, I am telling you that is the maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">THE DEFENDANT: I can\u2019t receive six years. I can\u2019t receive six years. This is my first handgun violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">THE COURT: You are not on trial now, Mr. Johnson. I just want to make sure you understand the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">THE DEFENDANT: I understand it very well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. The transcript reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">THE DEFENDANT: But Your Honor, I don\u2019t have any defense. I don\u2019t have any defense. I am declining.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">THE COURT: Well, you will defend yourself as best you can. You have elected to defend yourself, and the Court will give you very wide latitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Before the jury comes in, I do want to caution you about one thing. There is a history to this case, which you know and I know, and which we can\u2019t close our eyes to.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">THE DEFENDANT: But Your Honor, those delays were not my fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">THE COURT: Listen to me for a second, Mr. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">For whatever reason, certain events happened before, and as a result of those events, you were removed forcibly from the courtroom, and I hope that that does not happen again, and while the Court will give you very wide leeway in what you want to say, motions you want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>to make, whatever you want to say to the Court, you will be granted no leeway as far as objectionable behavior is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"Ap5\">THE DEFENDANT: I said I'm declining.</p>\n<p id=\"Asa\">THE COURT: Fine.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">And I want the sheriff to be adequately prepared to take whatever steps are necessary very, very quickly in the event that any such steps become necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">Now, Mr. Johnson, is there anything else you would like to say before we bring the jury in?</p>\n<p id=\"AB5\">THE DEFENDANT: I just told you, Your Honor, I\u2019m declining. I am not going to proceed. I am declining.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">THE COURT: You are not going to proceed. Very well, You may defend yourself in any way you see fit, and I suppose that includes silence on your part.</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">THE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, that is not a defense. I am just not participating.</p>\n<p id=\"AY-\">THE COURT: You are getting up as though you want to leave the courtroom. You have the right to leave the courtroom if that is what you want to do.</p>\n<p id=\"An-\">THE DEFENDANT: I would rather leave the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"Afh\">THE COURT: You want to leave the courtroom, Mr. Johnson?</p>\n<p id=\"AN2\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"Akv\">THE COURT: Sit down for one minute.</p>\n<p id=\"AXm\">Mr. Levenson, you are shaking your head.</p>\n<p id=\"A8L\">Do you have any objection?</p>\n<p id=\"A3k\">MR. LEVENSON: I think he should be required to stay here. If he wants to present a defense, fine, as long as he doesn\u2019t act up.</p>\n<p id=\"A2t\">THE COURT: Against his will?</p>\n<p id=\"Agm\">MR. LEVENSON: I think, it seems to me, you are in a difficult situation. He doesn\u2019t have a lawyer, and he wants to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"Ais\">THE COURT: Mr. Levenson, I think that the Court cannot force Mr. Johnson to have a lawyer, and I think the Court cannot force Mr. Johnson to leave or stay.</p>\n<p id=\"A42\">Mr. Johnson appears to the Court to be acting in a perfectly rational way. He appears to know full-well the nature of these proceedings. He has discussed motions with the Court. He has given the Court reasons. He has expressed a desire that \u25a0 he wants to leave the courtroom. He does not have to be present during the trial, I think, if he wants to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"A2O\">Is that your request, that you leave the trial, Mr. Johnson?</p>\n<p id=\"Azg\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae4\">THE COURT: Very well, Permission is granted, and the sheriff will now excise [sic] Mr. Johnson from the courtroom. Thank you sir.</p>\n<p id=\"AFP\">If you change your mind, let the sheriff know and you can come back whenever you want.</p>\n<p id=\"Aol\">MR. TURNER: For the record, Your Honor, may I be excused?</p>\n<p id=\"AS-\">THE COURT: Not yet.</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\">MR. LEVENSON: Do you want to qualify him, Judge, to make sure it's voluntary?</p>\n<p id=\"AG0\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, it is perfectly clear to the Court what you are doing is voluntary; isn\u2019t that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: Like I said, I am not qualified. I am incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">THE COURT: But no one is forcing you to leave?</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">THE DEFENDANT: I prefer to leave to obtain counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">THE COURT: It is voluntary. You have made that obvious three times. I don\u2019t want to cause you unnecessary grief. If you want to leave, you may do so. You can come back whenever you want.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m not coming back.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\">. <em>Allen v.
