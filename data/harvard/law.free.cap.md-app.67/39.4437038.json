Against this superficially humorous backdrop, we must decide whether this seemingly innocuous business practice constitutes unlawful discrimination within the meaning of a county ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Our focus will be directed to the Montgomery County Code, Human Relations Law, \u00a7 27-9. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">It shall be unlawful for any owner, lessee, operator, manager, agent or employee of any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement within the county:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">(a) To make any distinction with respect to any person based on race, color, sex, marital status, religious creed, ancestry, national origin, handicap, or sexual orientation in connection with admission to, service or sales in, or price, quality or use of any facility or service of any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement in the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We shall look at whether the evidence presented to the Human Relations Commission of Montgomery County was sufficient for it to determine that the practice had a discriminatory effect. We shall then examine whether the business promotion was allowable under the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">This matter began when the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission (Commission) received a complaint filed by Mr. Richard J. Peppin claiming that the Woodside Delicatessen (Woodside) was engaging in a practice of discrimination. The foundation of Mr. Peppin\u2019s allegation was that his bill for dinner at Woodside reflected that only his lady companion had been credited with a 50% discount on the price of her meal. Upon inquiry, Mr. Peppin learned that on Thursday nights the restaurant provided this discount on dinners to female customers only.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">In response to Mr. Peppin\u2019s complaint, the Commission advised the owner of Woodside, Mr. Gus Haris, that there were \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d the practice of \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d at the restaurant was a sex-based price discount in violation of \u00a7 27-9 of the Montgomery County Ordinance. The Commission then invited Mr. Haris \u201cto join in a collective effort towards a just conciliation of this matter.\u201d Mr. Haris thereupon abolished \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>and immediately instituted \u201cSkirt and Gown Night.\u201d That promotion entitled any Thursday night patron who wore either a skirt or gown to receive a 50% discount on the price of his or her meal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Skirt and Gown Night at Woodside immediately became the focus of media attention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Initially, 28 men appeared on the appointed evening. The premises, however, were graced by the presence of only 10 men wearing either skirts or gowns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Six weeks later, however, none of the male patrons on Skirt and Gown Night wore either a skirt or a gown.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The Commission\u2019s Public Accommodation Panel (Panel) held a hearing to determine whether Ladies\u2019 Night or Skirt and Gown Night, or both, violated the Montgomery County Code. The Panel unanimously found that Ladies\u2019 Night was indeed a violation. In a split decision, the Panel determined that Skirt and Gown Night was also a violation and that it was \u201ca discriminatory subterfuge, merely an extension of Ladies\u2019 Night.\u201d The Panel consequently ordered Mr. Haris to cease and desist that promotion at Woodside.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">On appeal, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Cave, J.) affirmed the decision of the Panel as to Ladies\u2019 Night but reversed as to Skirt and Gown Night. The trial judge found the new discount policy to be facially neutral and non-discriminatory because Skirt and Gown Night did not \u201cimpact or burden men in any significant manner.\u201d The court based its holding on the fact that \u201cmen wear pants because they exercise a fashion preference to do so.\u201d This preference, the court noted, \u201cis not an immutable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>characteristic of the male gender.\u201d Judge Cave determined that the Panel was clearly erroneous in its finding \u201cthat skirts are female attire and that men were thus unfairly burdened by being asked to wear them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Mr. Peppin asks us to reverse that part of the lower court\u2019s decision concerning Skirt and Gown Night.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In addressing this court on appeal, Mr. Peppin explains his concern that we not look upon the preferential practice engaged in at Woodside as too trivial for our review. We believe the matter involves an intrinsically substantive issue which, left unanswered, could serve to encourage far more serious methods of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\"><em>Sufficiency of Evidence to Determine Whether Business Promotion </em>Was <em>Discriminatory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The scope of judicial review of the actions of administrative agencies is well settled in Maryland. When a circuit court reviews an agency decision, its task is restricted to determining \u201cwhether reasoning minds could reasonably reach that conclusion by direct proof or by permissible inference from the facts and the record before the agency.\u201d <em>State Commission on Human Relations v. Washington County Community Action Council, Inc., </em>59 Md.App. 451, 455, 476 A.2d 222 (1984). As a starting point, the agency\u2019s decision is considered to be prima facie correct and carries with it a presumption of validity. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as this court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">Whichever of the recognized tests the court uses\u2014substantiality of the evidence on the record as a whole, clearly erroneous, fairly debatable or against the weight or preponderance of the evidence on the entire record\u2014its appraisal or evaluation must be of the agency\u2019s fact-finding results and not an independent original estimate of or decision on the evidence. The required process is difficult to precisely articulate but it is plain that it requires restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions under any of the tests, all of which are similar____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><em>Commissioner, Baltimore City Police Department v. Cason, </em>34 Md.App. 487, 499-500, 368 A.2d 1076 (1977), quoting from <em>Insurance Commissioner v. National Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309-10, 236 A.2d 282 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We are faced with two opposing views in the matter <em>sub judice. </em>The Commission, acting through the Panel, determined that Woodside\u2019s Skirt and Gown Night was a discriminatory practice because the business promotion operated to make a distinction in rates and price on the basis of sex. The circuit court, on the other hand, held that the promotion was facially neutral and did not have discriminatory impact because its volitional clothing requirement \u201cdid not burden men in any significant manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Our task remains clear. In reaching a determination, we must, as the circuit court should have done, afford deference to the findings of the administrative agency acting within its statutorily prescribed expertise. As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Bassler, </em>289 Md. 501, 509, 425 A.2d 1003 (1981), \u201c[i]t is a fundamental principle of administrative law that a reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">As we stated in <em>Commissioner, Baltimore City Police Dept. v. Cason, </em>34 Md.App. at 502-3, 368 A.2d 1076, quoting from <em>Public Service Commission of Maryland v. Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">We do not, therefore, in considering the legality and reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s decision in this case, afford prima facie correctness to the decree of the court below; nor do we determine merely whether the court abused its discretion in reviewing the Commission\u2019s order\u2014 We do not directly review the reasonableness of the determinations made by the lower court, but instead consider whether there was substantial evidence before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the Commission on the record considered as a whole to support its conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Thus, in reviewing the conclusions of an agency in order to determine whether the record as a whole reflects substantial evidence of support, our mission is essentially that of repeating the task of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The evidence supporting the agency\u2019s determination consisted of testimony showing that the overwhelming majority of discount recipients to be female during the initial stage of the offering; that after several weeks when the novelty of the promotion faded, those patrons receiving discounts were all female; that men did not wear skirts and gowns in a restaurant catering to the general trade in Montgomery County; that skirts and gowns are widely recognized as apparel worn by women; that no such garb is found in a typical masculine wardrobe; and that to impose such requirement on men in order to receive a price discount for a meal would be unreasonable, inconvenient, and require additional expense. The Panel concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhR\">even though occasionally a man might decide to attend a future \u2018Skirt and Gown Night\u2019 wearing a skirt or gown either to harvest the discount or simply for amusement, it is likely that it would be almost exclusively females who would benefit from the promotion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The circuit court, while acknowledging the findings of the Panel, did not accept the Panel\u2019s factual conclusion that discrimination flowed from the knowledge that men do not wear skirts and gowns as often as women. Instead, the circuit judge declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">Men wear pants because they exercise a fashion preference to do so. Some men wear robes, gowns, kilts, or other apparel. It is not within the purview of this court nor the panel to make a pronouncement on the appropriateness of fashion to gender; to do so unnecessarily promotes sexual stereotyping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Although we believe the judge\u2019s findings to be contradicted by American cultural realities, we need not focus on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>circuit court\u2019s determination; our review is that of the agency\u2019s conclusion based upon facts presented at the hearing. The record is replete with evidence that Skirt and Gown Night was intended to\u2014and did\u2014have the same effect and serve the same function as Ladies\u2019 Night, <em>i.e. </em>it provided price discounts to women and, in fact, operated as a mere extension of Ladies\u2019 Night.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We hold that the evidence before the Panel was sufficient to support its decision that Woodside\u2019s practice of requiring persons to wear a skirt or gown in order to receive a half-price discount on food placed a significant burden upon men and, therefore, had a discriminatory effect. Although it is conceivable that some men may fantasize their appearance of frolicking about in a skirt or gown, those items normally remain in the closets\u2014of their wives.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Whether Business Promotion Allowable Under Ordinance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The remaining issue for us to review is whether the agency\u2019s Public Accommodations Panel erred in its conclusion that the particular business promotion sponsored by Woodside was a practice of discrimination proscribed by the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In his brief, the appellant points to several United States Supreme Court and Federal Circuit decisions based on the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other federal statutes. While these cases may be persuasive, they do not control here. Cases brought under those laws provide for a balancing test. <em>See Griggs v. Duke Power, </em>401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971) and <em>Dothard v. Rawlinson, </em>433 U.S. 321, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977) (\u201cbusiness necessity\u201d); <em>cf. Koire v. Metro Car Wash, </em>40 Cal.3d 24, 707 P.2d 195, 219 Cal.Rptr. 133 (1985) (holding that Ladies\u2019 Night was discriminatory and rejecting respondents\u2019 claims that the practice, in attracting female customers, was a business necessity or a promotion in harmony with public policy). The Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Court of Appeals has held, however, that the Equal Rights Amendment of the Maryland Constitution prescribes an \u201cabsolute standard\u201d and not a balancing test. Therefore, once discrimination is proved, a court cannot consider arguments attempting to \u201cbalance\u201d the discriminatory practice against other concerns. <em>Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. 508, 374 A.2d 900 (1977); <em>see Burning Tree Country Club v. Bainum, </em>305 Md. 53, 501 A.2d 817 (1985); <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. 516, 425 A.2d 1011 (1981); <em>Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 414 A.2d 929 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">It is clear that the Montgomery County Council had the authority to enact such legislation. Its authority flows from the power delegated to it by the Maryland General Assembly. <em>See </em>Maryland Code Article 25A, \u00a7 5 et seq. The Maryland Court of Appeals has held this grant to be a broad one, encompassing more than those powers specifically enumerated in the statutory grant. Quoting with approval from <em>McQuillan, </em>Municipal Corporations (3rd ed.) \u00a7 24-44, it noted that \u201ccourts uniformly regard the clause as ample authority for a reasonable exercise in good faith, of broad and varied municipal activity to protect the health, morals, peace and good order of a community....\u201d <em>Montgomery Citizens League v. Greenhalgh, </em>253 Md. 151, 162, 252 A.2d 242 (1969); <em>cf. District of Columbia v. Thompson Company, </em>346 U.S. 100, 73 S.Ct. 1007, 97 L.Ed. 1480 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">As in all cases of statutory construction, we must discern and effectuate the actual intent of the legislative body that enacted the law. <em>Montgomery County v. Fulks, </em>65 Md.App. 227, 500 A.2d 302 (1985); <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980). That intent is normally to be sought from the language of the provision itself. <em>Pineland Co. v. Miles, </em>228 Md. 584, 180 A.2d 870 (1962). If that language \u201cis plain and free of ambiguity and has a definite and sensible meaning, such is conclusively presumed to be the meaning of the legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Preissman, </em>22 Md.App. 454, 459, 323 A.2d 637 <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 747 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The pertinent language of the ordinance prohibits an owner or operator of any place of public accommodation within Montgomery County \u201cto make <em>any distinction </em>with respect to any person based on race, color, <em>sex </em>... in connection with admission to, service, or sales in, or <em>price, </em>... of any facility or service of <em>any place of public accommodation </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We believe the ordinance is unambiguous. Thus, while allowed to do so under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, we are not allowed under the Montgomery County Ordinance or the Maryland Constitution to engage in a balancing test. We hold, therefore, that the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission, based upon the findings by the Panel on Public Accommodations, properly concluded that Skirt and Gown Night amounted to unlawful sex-based discrimination within the meaning of \u00a7 27-9 of the Montgomery County Human Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN CONFORMITY WITH THIS OPINION. APPELLEE TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">. Reporters quickly seized upon this news opportunity and stimulated public interest with detailed accounts of the situation, including Haris\u2019s battle with the authorities and how he planned to \"skirt the issue.\u201d Mr. Haris predicted that Woodside patrons would continue to be \"mostly the same people, with the occasional man.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\">.
