This appeal is based on alleged misconduct of the district attorney in alluding to appellant\u2019s six prior felonies in cross-examination and argument, and in further assailing the credibility of appellant in argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">Appellant contends that the district attorney was guilty of misconduct in cross-examining him on his conviction of prior felonies, how many, their specific nature, and when these felonies occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\"> While the details and circumstances of felonies may not be shown <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>188 Cal.App.2d 156, 170 [10 Cal.Rptr. 326]), the district attorney may properly elicit evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, including the number, dates and the specific felonies. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Craig, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>196 Cal. 19, 28 [235 P. 721]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Renteria, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 214, 218 [5 Cal.Rptr. 119]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>200 Cal.App.2d 119, 124 [19 Cal.Rptr. 67]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Klavon, </em>202 Cal.App.2d 765, 770 [21 Cal.Rptr. 99]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2051.) The cross-examination was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The remaining contention of appellant based upon an alleged lack of good faith of the district attorney in referring in argument to the jury to defendant\u2019s prior convictions, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Griffin, P.
