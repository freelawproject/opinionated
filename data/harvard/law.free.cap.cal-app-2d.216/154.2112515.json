The first notice of appeal (filed October 9, 1961) discloses that plaintiff appeals \u201cfrom the Judgment made and entered in said action, and from the Order denying plaintiffs [sic] Motion for New Trial in said action, and from the Order striking from the files the Declaration of plaintiff of bias and prejudice held by judge [sic] Benjamin Landis against plaintiff in said action. \u2019 \u2019 The second notice of appeal (filed January 17, 1962) discloses that plaintiff appeals \u201cfrom the Order made and entered in said action on December 1, 1961, denying motion of said plaintiff for preparation of transcripts on appeal in said action in forma pauperis and at public expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Before consideration of the appeal from the judgment we will dispose of plaintiff\u2019s various appeals from the various orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\"><em>First, the purported appeal from the order denying his motion for a new trial-. </em>\u201cAn order denying a motion for a new trial has not been appealable since the 1915 amendment to Code of Civil Procedure, section 963.\u201d <em>(Leventhal </em>v. <em>Ollie Morris Equip. Corp., </em>184 Cal.App.2d 553, 558 [7 Cal.Rptr. 911].)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\"><em>Second, the purported appeal from the order denying </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>the motion for the preparation of the transcripts on appeal at public </em>expense: A litigant in a civil action is not entitled to a transcript on appeal at public expense. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 69953, 70051; Cal.Rules of Court, rules 4(c) and 5(c)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>; <em>Legg </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 723, 724-725 [320 P.2d 227]; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>106 Cal.App.2d 686, 688 [235 P.2d 632]; <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>104 Cal.App. 789 [194 P. 1122]; <em>Rucher </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>104 Cal.App. 683, 685-686 [286 P.732].)  Furthermore, no appeal lies from this order. It is not the type of \u201cspecial order made after final judgment\u201d contemplated by Code of Civil Procedure, section 963, subdivision 2, in that it does not affect the judgment in some manner or bear some relation to it either by way of enforcing it or staying its execution. (See <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>184 Cal.App.2d 248 [7 Cal.Rptr. 280].)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><em>Third, the appeal from the order striking plaintiff\u2019s declaration of bias and prejudice from the </em>files: The chronology of significant events is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">A minute order dated June 9, 1961, reflects that the within action was transferred from department 1 of the superior court (i.e. master calendar department) to department 20 (i.e. Judge Landis\u2019 department). This minute order provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201c. . . Counsel confer with the Court in chambers. In open Court, Plaintiff\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is argued and submitted, pursuant to the Court\u2019s memorandum signed and filed this date, a copy of which is mailed to all parties.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] Trial is continued to June 12, 1961, at 9 :30 a.m.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Minute order dated June 12, 1961, reflects that the trial resumed and that both parties made opening statements; witnesses were examined and exhibits introduced into evidence. The minute order then sets forth that \u201cTrial is continued to June 13, 1961, at 9:30 a.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Minute order dated June 13, 1961, indicates that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>resumed, witnesses testified and additional exhibits were introduced into evidence. It then provides that \u201cTrial is continued to June 14,1961, at 9:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The minute order dated June 14, 1961, is similar to the previous minute orders. It then sets forth that \u201cTrial is continued to June 15, 1961, at 9 :30 a.m. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The minute order dated June 15, 1961, is similar to the previous minute orders. In addition, however, it discloses that <em>\u201cPlaintiff and defendants waive their rights to a jury trial </em>herein.\u2019\u2019 (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Minute orders dated June 19, 20, 22, 23, 26 and 27 are similar to previous minute orders. The minute order dated June 28, 1961, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201cTrial resumes, continued from June 27, 1961, with all counsel present as before. . . . Plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend his second amended complaint to conform to the proof is argued and granted. Plaintiff rests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 motion to amend their answer to conform to the proof, is granted. Both sides rest. The cause is argued by both sides and submitted. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The minute order dated July 3, 1961, provides as follows: \u201cCause, heretofore submitted on June 28, 1961, the Court now renders its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">Judgment is for the defendants. Each side to bear their own costs of suit incurred herein. Counsel for the defendants is ordered to prepare findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment in accordance with the Memorandum of Decision signed and filed this date. Both sides notified by mail this date. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum opinion and a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>memorandum were filed July 3,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">On July 19, 1961, plaintiff filed an application for extension of time to and including July 31, 1961, to serve and file his objections to defendants\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Plaintiff\u2019s application was approved and so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">On July 28, 1961, plaintiff filed a similar application seeking an additional extension of time to and including August 11, 1961. This application was likewise approved and so ordered by Judge Landis.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">Plaintiff filed his objections to defendants\u2019 proposed findings and conclusions of law and a request for special findings on August 11,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">Defendants\u2019 findings of fact and conclusions of law were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>filed on August 14, 1961. Judgment was filed and entered the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">On August 23, 1961, plaintiff filed a notice of- intention to move for a new trial. At the same time he also filed a \u201cdeclaration of plaintiff of bias and prejudice held by Judge Benjamin Landis against plaintiff (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 170).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">A minute order dated August 28, 1961, discloses that the declaration was ordered stricken on the court's own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">As reflected by the chronology of events herein set forth the trial was an extensive one and not one word of protest against the trial judge was uttered by plaintiff before or during the trial. In fact, on June 15, 1961, plaintiff expressly waived any right to proceed in trial with a jury and elected to continue the case as a trial by the judge without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>55 Cal.2d 27 [9 Cal.Rptr. 793, 357 P.2d 1049], is relevant to the question of the trial court striking plaintiff\u2019s declaration. It is stated at page 35 thereof as follows in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201c. . . section 170 requires the affidavit of bias and prejudice to set forth \u2018the fact or facts constituting the ground of the disqualification of such [the trial] judge.\u2019 <em>A statement that contains nothing but conclusions and sets forth no facts constituting a ground of disqualification may be ignored or stricken from the files by the trial judge. (Keating </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>45 Cal.2d 440, 443 [289 P.2d 209]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>135 Cal.App.2d 558, 585 [288 P.2d 57]; <em>Ephraim </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>42 Cal.App.2d 578, 579 [109 P.2d 378].)  Where the statement is insufficient the judge can so determine, whereupon the procedure provided by section 170 is not applicable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>114 Cal.App.2d 412, 439 [250 P.2d 743].)  [3] \u2018Where no facts are set forth in the statement there is no issue of fact to be determined. It is only where an appropriate issue of fact is presented by the statement that a judge is prevented from passing on the question of his own disqualification under section 170. \u2019 <em>(Mackie </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>154 Cal.App.2d 395, 399 [316 P.2d 366].) <em>Defendant\u2019s affidavit charging Judge Phone with prejudice stated no facts but only conclusions, and it was properly ignored.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In addition to the fact that plaintiff\u2019s declaration was insufficient there is a principle to the effect that a party should not be allowed to gamble on a favorable decision and thereafter raise an objection that the trial judge was biased and prejudiced in the event the litigant is disappointed in the result. (See <em>Rohr </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>65 Cal.App.2d 208 [150 P.2d 5].) Such an attempt to play fast and loose with the administration of justice will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Having disposed of plaintiff\u2019s purported appeals from the various orders, we now turn to the appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The first problem presented is to ascertain the vehicle by which plaintiff attempts to present this appeal. The chronology of significant events is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\"><em>August 14, </em>1961\u2014Judgment filed and entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\"><em>October </em>3,1961\u2014-Plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\"><em>October 9, </em>1961\u2014Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal (from the judgment, order denying his motion for new trial and from order striking the declaration of bias and prejudice) filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\"><em>October 18, </em>1961\u2014Plaintiff filed notice that he <em>\u201cintends </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>to and will proceed on the appeal heretofore herein filed by a Clerks </em>[sic] <em>&lt;md Reporters </em>[sic] <em>Transcript on appeal.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\"><em>November 20, </em>1961\u2014After having received several extensions of time within which to file a request for preparation of a clerk\u2019s and reporter\u2019s transcript, plaintiff filed his notice to prepare clerk\u2019s transcript and designation of exhibits for transmission to the reviewing court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\"><em>November 24, </em>1961\u2014Plaintiff filed notice of motion for order directing the official reporter and court clerk to prepare a reporter\u2019s transcript and clerk\u2019s transcript at public expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\"><em>November 29, </em>1961\u2014Minute order provides in part that \u201cMotion to prepare transcripts at public expense is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\"><em>December </em>19,1961\u2014Plaintiff filed a notice of motion for an order <em>nunc pro tunc </em>correcting the minute order dated November 29,1961.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\"><em>December 27, </em>1961\u2014Minute order discloses that the minute order dated November 29, 1961, \u201cis hereby corrected nunc pro tune as of that date by adding thereto the following: <em>1 </em>The Court finds that the plaintiff is not financially able to pay the estimated cost of a full reporter\u2019s transcript [i.e. $4,000] and a full clerk\u2019s transcript [i.e. $2,000], Plaintiff has not shown to the satisfaction of the Court that such a large and expensive record is necessary for a fair appellate review, nor has he demonstrated what portions of the record are in fact necessary. The Court further is of the opinion that it has no authority to order the preparation of transcripts on appeal at public expense in this kind of civil case. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\"><em>January 17, </em>1962\u2014Plaintiff filed notice of appeal from the order \u201cdenying motion of said plaintiff for preparation of transcripts on appeal in said action in forma pauperis and at public expense.\u201d <em>On the same day he also filed a notice of intention to proceed on this appeal </em>(i.e. from order denying transcripts at public expense) <em>by \u201ca Narrative Settled Statement on Appeal in lieu of a clerks </em>[sic] <em>and Reporters </em>[sic] <em>Transcript.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The California Eules of Court provide for several methods of presenting a record on appeal. (Cal. Eules of Court, rules 4, 5, 6 and 7.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Plaintiff has not presented his appeal from the judgment by use of a reporter\u2019s transcript or a clerk\u2019s transcript. (Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Rules of Court, rules 4 and 5.) As has heretofore been set forth, plaintiff is not entitled to have said transcripts at public expense. Nor has plaintiff utilized the method prescribed in California Rules of Court, rule 6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Plaintiff indicated during oral argument that he was proceeding on a narrative settled statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> California Rules of Court, rule 7, sets forth the procedure for presenting an appeal on a settled statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Although plaintiff indicates that he is proceeding on the narrative settled statement, the settled statement before this court is not directed to the appeal from the jugment. It does not comply with the rules (footnote 5) insofar as presenting an appeal from this judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The net effect of the situation is that plaintiff has failed to avail himself of any of the several alternative methods of presenting a proper record on appeal. This court would be justified in dismissing the appeal from the judgment on the court\u2019s own motion (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>; see <em>Eggert </em>v. <em>Pacific States Sav. &amp; Loan Co., </em>20 Cal.2d 199, 201 [124 P.2d 815]). However, we choose to dispose of the appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The gist of plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment is that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>is insufficient evidence to support the findings of fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It would serve no useful purpose to set forth the 43 findings of fact relating to plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action or the 12 findings of fact relating to plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Plaintiff having failed to incorporate in the settled statement a condensed statement of all or such portions of the oral proceedings as he deems material to the determination of the points on appeal, he is in no position to attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this respect, what was stated in <em>O\u2019Callaghan </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>202 Cal.App.2d 364, 368 [20 Cal.Rptr. 708], is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201c. . . [4] Having elected to supply this court with no settled statement or other record indicating what transpired at the hearing, appellant is bound by the presumption that there was adequate evidentiary support for the trial court\u2019s finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 5, 1963, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 10, 1963.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\"> Formerly Buies on Appeal, rules 4(e) and 5(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> The memorandum of the trial court filed June 9, 1961, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u201cThe court under the law must try equitable actions without a jury; or, stated in another way, a party is not entitled to a jury on equitable causes of action.
