The jury verdict was in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, Hampton Plywood Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a corporation, the owner of timber rights on the tract of land on which the accident took place, Kenneth B. McGuire,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a logger engaged in the removal of felled logs from said land, Richard Cathey,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a tractor operator, and Lawrence Head,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a log loader. The judgment against Cathey and Head was pursuant to a directed verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All the defendants were alleged to have been negligent in the loading of said log. Hampton and McGuire both moved for a new trial, which motions were denied, and they both appeal. Cathey and Head have not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">A number of questions have been raised by appellants on this appeal. In view of our determination that the judgment against McGuire was erroneous because of failure to comply with section 594 of the Code of Civil Procedure and rule 8.12 of the Superior Court (now Cal. Rules of Court, rule 220(b)),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>thus requiring a remand of the cause for a retrial as to appellants, it is unnecessary to determine questions not related to the failure to give such notice. Our determination is compelled by the events associated with the proceedings prior to trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\n<em>The Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The complaint in this action was filed on September 16, 1958, the law firm of Hilger &amp; Thomas appearing for plaintiff. On June 18, 1959, and August 5, 1959, answers to the complaint were filed by defendants McGuire and Cathey, respectively. In said answers Charles V. Moore, Esq., appeared as the attorney of record for the said defendants. On October 26, 1959, defendant Hampton filed its answer, wherein the law firm of Worthington, Fields <em>&amp; </em>Worthington was designated as the attorneys of record for said defendant. Said answer recited that Hampton was the successor to Siskiyou Hardwood Company,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> sued in the complaint as Siskiyou Plywood Company. Notice of the taking of the deposition of Cathey was thereafter given by said attorneys for plaintiff to the above named attorneys, respectively, for Hampton, McGuire and Cathey. On July 13, 1960, a request to enter the default of defendant Head was filed. The \u2018 \u2018 Memorandum to Set,\u201d filed on July 13, 1960, by plaintiff, and served on the attorneys therein named, listed several <em>new </em>attorneys as being attorneys for certain of the parties. These attorneys had not theretofore appeared either by way of substitution, change or notice of association, nor had they appeared on any of the pleadings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In said memorandum, Charles V. Moore, was designated as the attorney for Cathey and McGuire.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>On October 31, 1960, Hilger &amp; Thomas, as attorneys for plaintiff, noticed the taking of the deposition of defendant McGuire. This notice was served on attorneys Hill &amp; Dalton, Charles V. Moore, and Worthington, Fields &amp; Worthington. This deposition was ultimately taken on January 11, 1961, at which time the law firm of Woodman, Leddy &amp; Sautter, represented by Edward Sautter, appeared therein as the attorneys for McGuire. No written notice of change or substitution of this law firm for Attorney Moore was filed, entered, or made as required by section 284 of the Code of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> nor was notice thereof given as required by section 285 of said code.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Notice of the pretrial conference, set for June 1, 1961 was thereafter given by the clerk of the court by mail on May 5, 1961, to all of the attorneys who were named in the memorandum to set, <em>excepting Attorney Moore. </em>No such notice was given to the Woodman, Leddy &amp; Sautter firm. Pretrial statements were filed only by Hilger &amp; Thomas, as attorneys for plaintiff, and by Worthington, Fields &amp; Worthington, as attorneys for Hampton. The pretrial conference order was made on June 15, 1961, and filed on June 26, 1961. The said order recites that the pretrial conference was held on June 1, 1961; that Hilger &amp; Thomas and Speer &amp; Creasey appeared as counsel for plaintiff and that the following counsel appeared \u201cfor defendant\u2014:\u201d Hill &amp; Dalton, Worthington, Fields &amp; Worthington, A. V. Prothero, and Bronson, Bronson &amp; McKinnon. The order does not indicate that either Attorney Moore or any of the members or representatives of the Woodman, Leddy <em>&amp; </em>Sautter firm were present. Said order states that \u201cThe matter is set for trial August 15, 1961, 9:30 A.M., Department One.\u201d The order does not contain a waiver of notice of time and place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The record discloses that on July 14, 1961, there was filed in the proceedings a document entitled \u201cNotice of Hearing,\u201d which reads as follows: \u201cTrial by jury re-set for August 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>1961 Dept. 1 at 1:30 P.M. This notice was mailed on July 14, 1961 addressed as below: <footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> Fred J. Moore, Jr., County Clerk By D. H. Martell, Deputy Clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On July 24, 1961, the law firm of Woodman, Leddy &amp; Sautter filed a notice of motion for an order allowing them to withdraw as attorneys for McGuire and to substitute McGuire, in propria persona, in their place and stead. Said motion was supported by the affidavit of Edward P. Sautter, stating that the said law firm \u201chas represented the Defendant Kenneth B. McGuire, individually and doing business as McGuire Logging Company, during certain aspects of the above entitled action and now finds it desirous of withdrawing as attorney for said Defendant Kenneth B. McGuire. ...\u201d Said notice specified that the motion would be made on August 7, 1961. Attached to said notice and affidavit was an affidavit of mailing showing service by mail on July 20, 1961, upon Hilger &amp; Thomas, Speer &amp; Creasey, Charles V. Moore, Worthington, Fields &amp; Worthington, Hill &amp; Dalton, Bronson, Bronson &amp; McKinnon, A. V. Prothero, and upon McGuire. An affidavit subscribed and sworn to on August 4, 1961, by one John W. Francis, purporting to be a member of the Sheriff\u2019s Office of Teton County, State of Wyoming (filed on August 15, 1961), states that he personally served McGuire with the \u201cNotice of Motion For Withdrawal of Attorneys\u201d and the affidavit of Edward P. Sautter on July 25,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">On July 27, 1961, attorney Charles V. Moore, filed a notice of motion to be relieved \u201cas attorney of record\u201d in said matter. Said notice likewise specified that the motion would be made on August 7, 1961. Said notice was supported by the affidavit of said Charles V. Moore. The said affidavit stated that Moore had originally filed the answer in said action and became attorney of record for McGuire; that he (Moore) thereafter became associated with the law firm of Hill &amp; Dalton and a conflict of interest arose;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that McGuire was informed of said conflict and that McGuire thereupon procured the services of the law firm of Woodman, Leddy &amp; Sautter; that the latter firm appeared for McGuire at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>pretrial conference; and that through inadvertence a formal substitution of attorneys was never executed. Attached to said motion and affidavit was an affidavit of service by mail on July 27, 1961, upon McGuire at an address in California and at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and upon the following attorneys : Hilger &amp; Thomas, Hill &amp; Dalton, Woodman, Leddy &amp; Sautter, and Worthington, Fields &amp; Worthington.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">On August 7, 1961, the trial court heard both motions for withdrawal of attorneys and making its order relieving Attorney Moore as attorney of record for McGuire on the same day; and on August 11, 1961, made its order allowing Edward P. Sautter and the law firm of Woodman, Leddy &amp; Sautter to withdraw as attorneys for McGuire, and directing that McGuire \u201cbe represented as of record in pro per. ...\u201d No notice of such order was given by Attorney Moore to McGuire or to any of the other parties to the litigation or their attorneys. The Woodman firm gave a \u201cNotice of Substitution of Attorneys by Order of Court\u201d by mail on August 11, 1961, to McGuire and to the attorneys to whom it had given notice of motion for withdrawal. Thereafter, and on the 14th and 15th of August 1961, telegrams were sent by McGuire from Jackson, Wyoming, to Honorable William G. Watson, Jr.,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> requesting a continuance of the trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The cause came on for trial on August 16, 1961, at 1:30 p.m. The minutes of the court for said day disclose that the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>ing counsel were present: Frederick W. Hilger, representing plaintiff; Leonard Worthington of Worthington, Fields &amp; Worthington, and John Dalton of Hill &amp; Dalton, representing Hampton. The minutes do not disclose the presence of Attorney Moore, but the reporter\u2019s transcript reveals that the trial court noted his presence as attorney for defendant Cathey. The said minutes bear the following notation: \u201cDefendant McGuire was not present and was not represented by counsel.\u201d The said minutes and reporter\u2019s transcript also reveal that a discussion took place between the court and counsel present prior to the commencement of the trial with reference to McGuire\u2019s request for a continuance. During said discussion Judge Watson made known the contents of the two telegrams he had received from McGuire, and also informed counsel that he had been contacted by a Mr. Burns, who represented that he was an attorney in Jackson, Wyoming, and that he was calling for McGuire. Counsel for plaintiff and for defendant Hampton both objected to a continuance, whereupon the court ruled that since no formal motion for continuance was before the court the motion for a continuance would be denied and the trial would proceed. Excepting for the reference by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that McGuire \u201cadmits in the telegram that he got notice\u201d on August 10th, nothing was said as to ivhether McGuire or his attorneys had received any notice of the time and place of trial. The said discussion also discloses that the trial court expressed concern as to the propriety of its order permitting the withdrawal of the Woodman firm.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Judge Watson, while talcing the position that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>telegrams did not constitute a formal appearance, also expressed the opinion that if McGuire could substantiate certain of the matters contained in the telegrams it might be error to proceed with the trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The cause thereupon proceeded to trial before a jury during the course of which McGuire\u2019s deposition was read to the jury. At the conclusion of the trial the jury was instructed, among other things, that Hampton was sued on the theory that it was a principal and that McGuire was its agent or employee, and that a question had been raised as to whether McGuire was an agent or an independent contractor. In this connection the trial court proceeded to define the respective relationships. A jury verdict was returned in favor of plaintiff for $50,000 against McGuire, Hampton, Cathey and Head, and judgment was thereafter entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The record also reveals that a paper entitled \u201cAffidavit in Support of a Motion for a Continuance\u201d was purportedly filed on August 15, 1961. This is apparently the affidavit referred to in McGuire\u2019s telegram of August 14th. A perusal of the said affidavit sworn to by McGuire indicates that it was notarized on August 18, 1961. A letter of transmittal<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> from Hufsmith &amp; Burns, attorneys at law, Jackson, Wyoming, addressed to Judge Watson, referring to the affidavit indicated in McGuire\u2019s telegram and enclosing the same therewith, bears the date of August 18, 1961, the last day of the trial and the day on which the jury returned its verdict. These circumstances when coupled with the fact that no reference to this affidavit was made by the trial court in its discussion with counsel on the first day of the trial on August 16th or in the court\u2019s minutes of said day, would indicate that said affidavit was received subsequent to August 18th, and that the file stamp date of August 15th is in error. Accordingly, it is apparent that the contents of this affidavit were not considered by the court below when it denied the motion for continuance on August 16th. The said affidavit reiterates substantially the same matters contained in the telegrams, states that McGuire presently resides in Jackson, Wyoming, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>contains the following statement: \u201c6. That on August 10,1961, deponent received notice of the order for withdrawal of counsel, together with the first notice of the impending trial of August 16th, 1961. Said notice was received by Certified Mail. Deponent had no notice of the trial date before August 10,1961.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>Did McGuire Save Notice of Trial?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Section 594, subdivision 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure, which applies to superior and municipal courts, provides that a verdict upon an issue of fact may not be entered against a party, in his absence, unless he has had five days\u2019 notice of time and place of trial, and proof of service thereof is made. It is established law that compliance with this code section is mandatory <em>(Payer </em>v. <em>Mercury Boat Co., </em>195 Cal.App.2d 659, 660 [16 Cal.Rptr. <em>123]; Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>145 Cal.App.2d 231, 233 [302 P.2d 355]; <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Tomasini, </em>97 Cal.App.2d 115, 122-123 [217 P.2d 488]); and failure to give the required notice of time and place of trial is jurisdictional. <em>(Simon </em>v. <em>Tomasini, supra, </em>p. 123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Subdivision 1 of section 594 does not prescribe the kind of notice required. The term \u201cnotice\u201d imports that the information given thereby comes from an authentic source and is directed to someone who is to act or refrain from acting in consequence of the information contained in the notice. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>108 Cal. 166, 171 [41 P. 287].) It means the statutory instrumentality of knowledge; the formal process emanating from the source, and served in the manner prescribed by the statute. <em>(In re Central Irrigation District, </em>117 Cal. 382, 391 [49 P. 354]; <em>MacGowan </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>142 Cal. 593, 595 [76 P. 503].)  Accordingly, \u201cknowledge\u201d is not synonymous or the equivalent of \u201cnotice.\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>supra; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Pacific Transfer Co., </em>131 Cal. 582, 588-589 [63 P. 915].)  The distinction between notice and knowledge is well stated in <em>Merrill-. </em>\u201cNotice in one sense means the legal instrumentality by which knowledge is conveyed, or by which one is charged with knowledge. One having knowledge that he is a defendant in a suit is not bound to appear until there has been brought home to him the legal instrumentality of knowledge, a proper notice. But, upon the other hand, where the code speaks of actual and constructive notice, it means no more than that under the indicated circumstances a man is legally chargeable with knowledge.\u201d (P.589.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>While notice is generally imparted through the instrumentality of a writing, subdivision 1 of section 594 does not require that the notice be written. Accordingly, it may be oral. (See <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 206, 212 [181 P.2d 424]; and <em>Payer </em>v. <em>Mercury Boat Co., supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 659, 661.)  In superior courts, however, the notice of trial required by section 594, subdivision 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure has been implemented by a court rule which requires that the clerk give at least five days\u2019 notice by mail of the time and place of trial in each case to all parties appearing therein, except where such time and place is fixed at a pretrial conference. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 220(b); formerly rule 8.12(b) of the Rules for the Superior Courts.)  Section 594 has application only when the court proceeds in the absence of a party. <em>(Sheldon </em>v. <em>Landwehr, </em>159 Cal. 778, 782 [116 P. 44]; <em>Estate of </em>Wempe, 185 Cal. 557, 563 [197 P.949].)  The five-day requirement therein provided may, however, be shortened by waiver or consent of the parties. <em>(Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 787, 793 [4 Cal.Rptr. 689]; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Verdier, </em>54 Cal.App. 465, 468 [202 P. 154].)  Thus, the requirement does not apply where both parties are present at the trial or are represented at the time the case is called for trial, or participate therein. <em>(Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, supra; Sheldon </em>v. <em>Landwehr, supra; Estate of Wempe, supra; Horstmyer </em>v. <em>Trial Board of Sacramento, </em>21 Cal.App.2d 533, 538 [69 P.2d 1021].)  Nor does it apply where the attorney for the party agrees to the time fixed by the court for the date of trial <em>(Estate of Wempe, supra); </em>or where the adverse party or his attorney has <em>actual </em>notice or knowledge for the required time that the case is in fact set for trial on a certain date. <em>(Canty </em>v. <em>Pierce &amp; Anderson, </em>173 Cal. 205, 208 [159 P. 582]; <em>Estate of Wempe, supra; Kalmus </em>v. <em>Kalmus, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 405, 418 [230 P.2d 57]; <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>Walton, supra, </em>p. 212; <em>Etchepare </em>v. <em>Ehmke, </em>137 Cal.App.2d 508, 510 [290 P.2d 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">While subdivision 1 of section 594 does not describe the kind of proof necessary to satisfy the court that the absent party has had five days\u2019 notice of trial (see <em>Olivia </em>v. <em>Suglio, </em>139 Cal.App.2d 7, 8 [293 P.2d 63]), it has been held that proof by sworn testimony or by affidavit is necessary to meet the proof required by the code section. (See <em>Payer </em>v. <em>Mercury Boat Co., supra, </em>p. 661; and see <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Lake County, </em>113 Cal.App. 291, 295-296 [298 P. 123]; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>88 Cal.App.2d 638, 641 [199 P.2d 379].) In <em>Payer </em>the reviewing court held that a statement by the secretary of the superior court that she had given the appellant\u2019s attorney telephoned notice of the trial date six days before fell short of the required proof.  Rule 8.12, however, calls for written notice because notice by mail obviously entails the physical act of depositing the notice in the mail facilities. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1012, 1013, providing for service by mail.) Such notice, when timely given, would, of course, satisfy the requirements of section 594, subdivision 1.  It should be noted, however, that this requirement upon the clerk to give such notice by mail does not exist where the time and place of trial is fixed at the pretrial conference. This exception is based upon the rationale that attendance at a pretrial conference where the time and place of trial is fixed imparts actual notice of the trial date to counsel or the parties present.  Where a party is not present or is not represented by counsel at such conference the mandatory giving of the formal notice required by section 594, subdivision 1, must be complied with.  In our opinion this formality is satisfied by service of the pretrial conference order specifying such time and place of trial, provided that such service is made five days before the date fixed for trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We should also point out here that the purpose of the notice is merely to protect parties against trials, judgments or dismissals in their excusable absence. (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, \u00a7 30, pp. 1757, 1758; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Landwehr, supra, </em>159 Cal. 778, 782; <em>Horstmyer </em>v. <em>Trial Board of Sacramento, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.2d 533, 538.) In <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Lake County, supra, </em>113 Cal.App. 291, it was held that the notice of time and place of trial and the affidavit of the service of said notice filed among the papers of the cause are not papers of which a court takes judicial notice until they have been properly introduced in evidence. The court there stated: \u201c [A]nd if they are sufficient in form and substance to prove the fact of notice being given, then and in that ease the court is warranted in acting thereon, but not until such proof is made. The filing of an affidavit among the papers of a cause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>no more proves any fact in controversy than would the filing of a deposition which is not introduced in evidence be proof of the matters to which the witness has deposed.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (P. 296.) (See <em>Starkweather </em>v. <em>Minarets Min. Co., </em>5 Cal.App.2d 501, 504 [43 P.2d 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In the case at bench we do not have the proof required by section 594, subdivision 1. No notice of time and place of trial or any affidavit of the service thereof was introduced in evidence; nor was any testimonial evidence received with respect thereto. In fact the record discloses that the subject of such notice or its service was not mentioned at all. It is apparent from the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal that the only written notice of time and place of trial purportedly given was the notice of hearing given by the clerk on July 14, 1961. There is no affidavit of service of such notice attached thereto or filed among the papers of the cause, but merely a notation thereon by the clerk of the persons to whom such notice was purportedly mailed. Moreover, neither McGuire nor his attorney of record, Moore, nor the attorneys who were actually representing him, i.e., the Woodman firm, are mentioned or designated on said notice as persons to whom the notice was mailed. It is clear, therefore, that the said notice was not given in compliance with either section 594, subdivision 1, or with rule 8.12 of the Superior Court Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We next consider the question as to whether there was oral notice of time and place of trial, and if so whether such notice was proper. As we have pointed out above, oral notification of the time and place fixed for trial at the pretrial conference when communicated to counsel or the parties present would be in compliance with section 594, subdivision 1. In the present case the pretrial order fixed the time and place of trial for August 15, 1961, at 9:30 a.m. in department one of the court below. Not only was there a failure to introduce this notice in evidence, but a perusal of the same indicates there is no affidavit of service of the same. Moreover, even if we were to consider it as part of the record, it shows on its face that neither McGuire, nor Moore, nor any member of the Woodman firm was present at the pretrial conference. We are not unmindful of the statement of Mr. Hilger, counsel for plaintiff, made to the court on the first day of the trial that Mr. Sautter had attended the pretrial conference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>However, Mr. Hilger was not sworn and this statement, particularly in view of the recitals in the pretrial order, falls short of the proof necessary to establish the fact of Mr. Sautter\u2019s presence.  Moreover, the occurrences at the pretrial conference and the provision in the pretrial order as to the time and place of trial were rendered ineffective and a nullity, when the clerk purported to give notice that the date of trial had been reset to August 16, 1961, at 1:30 p.m. in department one. The clerk, being an officer of the court, was presumably acting under the trial court\u2019s order and direction. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, subd. 15.)  The setting of a new trial date was not done at the pretrial conference nor in the presence of the parties or their attorneys, nor does it appear, with their consent. This procedure therefore called for the application of rule 8.12 (now rule 220) which required the clerk of the court to give five days\u2019 notice of the time and place of trial by mail because the date of trial was not fixed at the pretrial conference. It is apparent that the clerk proceeded to comply with this rule when he mailed the written notice of hearing on July 14, 1961. However, as we have pointed out above, this notice, even if a proper subject of consideration, was not mailed to all of the parties appearing in the cause as provided in the rule because it was not mailed to McGuire or his attorneys, nor is it supported by any affidavit or proof of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Finally, we are called upon to consider whether the required notice has been waived by McGuire or his attorneys. There was no showing made to the trial court that Attorney Moore or any of the attorneys in the Woodman firm had knowledge of the actual date for trial for the required period so as to amount to actual notice of such date. All that the record discloses is that Moore was present on the date the cause came to trial. His presence, of course, did not constitute presence on the part of McGuire so as to amount to a waiver of notice because on that day he was not McGuire\u2019s counsel, having been formally relieved as McGuire\u2019s counsel of record five days previously. As to McGuire himself there was no proof that he had actual notice of the trial date. The only circumstance tending to indicate knowledge of the trial date consisted of the two telegrams which the trial court had before it when it was considering McGuire\u2019s request for a continuance on the first day of the trial. The first telegram stated that McGuire \u201chad no knowledge of trial date until Aug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>10\u201d; and the second contained the statement: \u201c. . . very first notice of trial date received only August 10.\u201d While a formal notice of trial served on August 10 would have sufficed as a notice of time and place of trial for a cause set for trial on August 16, the telegrams do not indicate the nature of the notice or from whom received. Furthermore, they do not indicate whether the reference was to the formal notice prescribed by section 594, subdivision 1, or to knowledge acquired other than by such notice. At best these telegrams merely indicate that McGuire had knowledge of <em>some </em>trial date, but they do not indicate <em>what </em>trial date.  Mere knowledge of a probable date of trial is not sufficient. <em>(Payer </em>v. <em>Mercury Boat Co., supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 659, 661; <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Lake County, supra, </em>113 Cal.App. 291.)  No request was made, moreover, that these telegrams be received in evidence. To the contrary, at the urging of counsel for plaintiff and for Hampton, who were resisting a continuance, the court declined to consider them in connection with McGuire\u2019s request for a continuance because of their informality.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\n<em>Does a Reversal of the Judgment Against McGuire Vacate the Judgment Against Hampton?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">This question must be answered in the affirmative. Hampton was held liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>The record not only discloses that the cause was tried on the theory that liability of McGuire was primary and that of Hampton secondary, but the trial court specifically instructed the jury that Hampton was sued on the theory that it was a principal for whom McGuire was acting as an agent or employee within the scope of his authority, and that if they found that McGuire was not liable then Hampton could not be held liable. That this theory was the basis of plaintiff\u2019s action is further demonstrated by the trial court\u2019s ruling denying Hampton\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict wherein the court states as follows: \u201cThe only way in which defendant Hampton Plywood could be held liable for the injuries suffered would be as the employer of defendant McGuire. . . . The evidence of employment is based principally upon the deposition of defendant McGuire. His testimony was such that, if the jury chose to believe it, (and it came in without objection) they could find that McGuire was the employee of Hampton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">It is established law that if the rights and liabilities of codefendants are interdependent or those of one are entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>dependent on the other, the judgment should be treated as an entirety, and, if vacated as to the one upon whom the other\u2019s rights depend, it must also be vacated as to the latter. <em>(Hoffmann </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 655, 661 [54 P.2d 477]; <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>59 Cal.App. 46, 48-49 [209 P. 1012]; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>154 Cal. 420, 423 [97 P. 875, 129 Am.St.Rep. 171]; <em>Will </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>18 Cal.2d 468, 472 [116 P.2d 44]; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>24 Cal.2d 686, 689-690 [151 P.2d 122]; <em>Winkler </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. etc. Medical Group, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 738, 746 [297 P.2d 728].) The basis of this rule is that where the liability of the principal is entirely dependent upon that of the agent, an exoneration of the agent must exonerate the principal, since the only wrong that could be found to have been done by the principal was through the agent. <em>(Bishop </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra; Bradley </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, supra; </em>see <em>Adams Mfg. &amp; Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Coast Centerless Grinding Co., </em>184 Cal.App.2d 649, 655-656 [7 Cal.Rptr. 761]; <em>Hendriksen </em>v. <em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Assn., </em>173 Cal.App.2d 764, 769-770 [344 P.2d 77].)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In the <em>Bishop </em>case judgment was entered against the principal and his agent for damages in an action based upon the false representations of the agent in which the principal did not participate, but for which the principal was held liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>The agent moved for a new trial and the motion was granted on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence. The principal did not join in the motion. Execution was sought against the property of the principal, but was refused on the ground that the order granting a new trial to the agent had the effect of vacating the judgment as to the principal, since the liability of the principal was dependent upon that of the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In <em>Hoffmann </em>a judgment for damages was rendered against the owner and the driver of a truck, the owner\u2019s liability being based on the negligence of the driver who was the owner\u2019s employee. The plaintiff was not satisfied with the amount of the judgment. He moved for a new trial. The motion was granted as to the driver. The driver appealed from the order granting a new trial, and the employer appealed from the judgment. The appellate court held that the order granting the new trial as to the employee left the question of his negligence an open one, and that the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>against the employer could not stand if on a retrial the question of negligence were resolved in favor of the employee. The judgment against the employer was reversed on the theory that his liability depended on the liability of the employee, and that the judgment as to the employer should not stand pending the final determination of the liability of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In <em>Gardner, </em>a personal injury ease, the defendants were a corporate employer and its employee. The employee was granted a new trial on the ground of excessive damages. The employer thereafter moved for a new trial which was denied. The reviewing court held that it was improper to deny the employer\u2019s motion on the ground that if the damages were excessive as to the employee, they were likewise excessive as to his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The <em>Bradley </em>case dealt with a situation where the jury found in favor of one defendant and against the other. The defendant against whom the verdict was rendered appealed. The appellate court held that the appellant could only be held for negligence on the theory that the other defendant was its agent and reversed the judgment in favor of the agent and against the appellant and remanded the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In <em>Will </em>it was held that a verdict exonerating the engineer and fireman in a cause of action against the railroad on account of the negligent operation of a train absolved the company insofar as any negligence in the operation of the train was concerned because such liability is based upon the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In <em>Winkler, </em>a malpractice action was brought against a doctor and his employees. The reviewing court reversed a judgment against the employer for erroneous instructions and then reversed the judgment in favor of the employees, stating that the employer\u2019s liability could rest only <em>on respondeat superior, </em>and since it could not be determined on what basis the jury returned a verdict in favor of the employees, while returning one against the employer, the judgment in favor of the employees would have to be reversed for a new trial on the issues framed by the pleadings as to the employees\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The judgment against appellants is reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial. The appeals from certain orders of the trial court have become moot by our reversal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>judgment, and the appeals from said orders are therefore dismissed. Appellants are to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Bray, P.
