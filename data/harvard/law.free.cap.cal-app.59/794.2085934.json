App. 512 [200 Pac. 819], except that said cause was tried before a jury, while the present action was tried by the court without a jury. The former case was reversed for an erroneous instruction to the jury, hut as to the question of the negligence of the defendant and the absence of contributory negligence as a matter of law the decision in that case was in favor of the plaintiffs. The reasoning and conclusions of this court as to these questions are applicable to the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>at bar, and a petition for rehearing in that case having been denied by the supreme court, we deem it conclusive of the instant case. For the reasons therein stated the judgment herein is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on December 1, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">All the Justices present concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
