J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aha\">As the result of an election held on the third day of May, 1921, the defendants were declared elected members of the city council of the city of Sacramento. They entered upon the discharge of their duties as such and have continuously thereafter acted as such city council. This suit was instituted to oust them from office on the ground that the charter provisions under which they were elected are unconstitutional. The defendants\u2019 demurrer to the complaint was sustained and, the plaintiff declining to amend, judgment was entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The Sacramento charter provides for the election of the '! city council \u201cby the proportional representation system\u201d known as the Hare system of voting. The only question , presented by this appeal is whether such proportional repre- 1 sentation system is constitutional. Section 273 of the charter provides: \u201cThe full name of all regularly nominated candidates shall be printed on the official ballots in the alphabetical order of the surnames. The ballots shall be marked according to the following instructions, which shall be printed at the top of each ballot under the heading of \u2018Directions to Voters.\u2019 Put the figure 1 opposite the name of your first choice. If you want to express also second, third, and other choices, do so by putting the figure 2 opposite the name of your second choice, the figure 3 opposite the name of your third choice, and so on. In this way you may express as many choices as you please. The more choices you express, the surer you are to make your ballot count for one of the candidates you favor. This ballot will not be counted for your second choice, unless it is found that it cannot help your first; it will not be counted for your third choice unless it is found that it cannot help either your first or your second, etc. A ballot is spoiled if the figure 1 is put opposite more than one name.\u201d The complicated system of counting the votes and ascertaining the result of the election under the Hare system, as provided by the charter, is substantially set forth in detail in <em>Wattles </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>211 Mich. 514 [179 N. W. 335], and need not be here repeated. For the purposes of this opinion it is sufficient to say that, though nine members of the city conn- , eil were to be elected at large, no ballot could be or was counted for more than one candidate, whether counted as the elector\u2019s first, second, or additional choice. In the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>guage of counsel for appellant, \u201cwhen once counted it becomes dead.\u201d Candidates are elected, not by a majority or a plurality, but by a \u201cquota or constituency\u201d of votes. Section 274 of the charter directs the separation of the ballots into \u201cvalid\u201d and \u201cinvalid\u201d lots and provides: \u201c(d) I The whole number of valid ballots shall then be divided by I a number greater by 1 than the number of seats to be filled. The next whole number larger than the resulting quotient is the quota or constituency that suffices to elect a member, (e) All candidates the number of whose votes on the first count equal or exceed the quota shall then be declared elected. . (f) All votes obtained by any candidate in excess of the quota shall be termed his surplus.\u201d Elaborate provision is made for the count of second choice votes appearing on \u201ctransferable ballots,\u201d viz., surplus ballots, if any, and ballots containing first choice votes for \u201cthe candidate lowest on the poll,\u201d who is declared defeated. Third and additional choice votes are then successively counted by a similar process, where necessary to determine the result of the election, each candidate being declared elected when the number of his votes equals the quota. The count ends \u201cwhen candidates to the number of seats to be filled have received a quota, ... or when the number of continuing candidates is reduced to the number of seats still to be filled,\u201d such continuing candidates then being declared elected whether they have received the full quota or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Appellant contends that the charter provisions in question are in conflict with section 1, article II, of the state constitution, which provides that every qualified elector \u201cshall be entitled to vote at all elections which are now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\u201d No one would contend that a law would be valid which deprived a qualified elector of the right to vote at an election. \u201cIn this country, the right to vote is recognized as one of the highest privileges of the citizen. It is so recognized not only by the citizen, but by the law; and any attempted infringement by legislative power upon that right as granted by the constitution is idle legislation,\u201d <em>(Spier </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>120 Cal. 370, 375 [41 L. R. A. 196, 52 Pac. 659].) The constitutional right to vote would be a barren privilege if the legislature could limit its exercise to one office or one proposition to be voted on. The right to vote \u201cat all elections\u201d includes the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to vote for a candidate for every office to be filled and on every proposition submitted.  The election of nine members of the city council is the election of persons to nine offices as fully as if the offices were distinct in name and in the duties to be discharged, and it is as far beyond the legislative power to limit the elector to the right of voting for one candidate therefor as it would be in the election of state or county officers. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Constantine, </em>42 Ohio St. 437 [51 Am. Rep. 833], the statute under consideration authorized the election of four commissioners and provided that \u201cno elector shall at any election vote for more than two persons for such commissioners, and any ballot containing the names of more than two persons for said office shall not be counted for any of the names thereon, and the four persons receiving the highest number of votes shall be declared elected.\u201d The constitution provided that \u201cthe election and appointment of all officers . . . not otherwise provided for by this constitution . . . shall be made in such manner as may be directed by law,\u201d and that every qualified elector \u201cshall be entitled to vote at all elections.\u201d In holding the statute unconstitutional, the court said: \u201cBy this article we have no doubt that each elector is entitled to vote for each officer whose election is submitted to the electors, as well as on each question that is submitted.\u201d In the similar case of <em>McArdle </em>v. <em>Mayor etc. of Jersey City, </em>66 N. J. L. 590, 88 Am. St. Rep. 496 [49 Atl. 1013], it is said: \u201cOn its face, this act is plainly an infringement of that constitutional provision which secures to qualified voters the elective franchise.\u201d Like conclusions were reached in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bedell, </em>68 N. <em>J. </em>L. 451 [53 Atl. 198], and <em>In re Opinion of Judges, </em>21 R. I. 579 [41 Atl. 1009]. In apparent conflict with the foregoing authorities is the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>171 Pa. 505, 33 L. R. A. 141 [33 Atl. 67]. The statute there held constitutional directed the election of seven judges of the superior court and provided that \u201cno elector may vote . . . for more than six candidates upon one ballot for the said office.\u201d The constitution provided that every elector \u201cshall be entitled to vote at all elections.\u201d The act was upheld, by a divided court, on the ground that similar statutes in that state had been in force and undisputed for many years. In the majority opinion it is said that the construction therein given the constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>tional provision \u201cwas acquiesced in by the bar, the courts, and the legislature for a period of thirty-five years. . . . In view of this long-continued interpretation of our constitution, we do not think it necessary to discuss the authorities cited from other states.\u201d In view of the grounds on which the decision was based, the case cannot be considered authority where such grounds do not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The statutes considered in the foregoing eases provided for minority representation by limiting the elector\u2019s right to vote. In furtherance of the same object, some states have provided for cumulative voting by allowing the elector to cast as many votes for one candidate as there are persons to be elected, or to distribute the same among the candidates as he may see fit. The constitution of Illinois so provides and, of course, the provision is upheld by the courts of that state. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Deneen, </em>247 Ill. 289 [93 N. E. 437].) The constitution of this state provides for cumulative voting in the election of directors of corporations. (Const., art. XII, sec. 12.) In the absence of constitutional authorization, statutes permitting cumulative voting in public elections have been held invalid. <em>(Maynard </em>v. <em>Board of Canvassers, </em>84 Mich. 228 [11 L, R. A. 332, 47 N. W. 756]; concurring opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>21 N. D. 426 [131 N. W. 231].) In <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Board of Canvassers, </em>the court said: \u201cNo reason can be given why, under our constitution, one elector should be entitled to vote twice or seven times for any particular person to represent him in the legislature when any other elector who desires to exercise the right which the constitution gives him to vote for every person allowed by law to represent him in the legislature is permitted to vote but once. ... It is no answer to say that he, too, may forego the right of an elector to vote for the number of representatives which the law permits in cities entitled to more than one representative; for to do so he is compelled to relinquish a constitutional right, and his right as an elector is in this respect abridged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u2022 Preferential systems of voting have been upheld, where the 'elector is permitted to vote his first choice for as many candidates as there are offices to be filled, in the following cases: <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Lansdon, </em>18 Idaho, 483 [110 Pac. 280], where the statute provided that electors must \u201cvote for both first and second choice if there are more than twice as many candi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>dates as there are positions\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>50 Wash. 508 [97 Pac. 728], where the elector could cast as many first-choice votes as there were positions to be filled; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Hicken, 125 </em>Minn. 407 [L. R. A. 1915B, 401, 147 N. W. 815], where the statute provided that \u201cno vote shall be counted on the election of commissioners unless the voters mark as many first choices as there are commissioners to be elected\u201d; and <em>Orpen </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>87 N. J. L. 69 [93 Atl. 853], where the statute provided for the election of five commissioners at large and required every elector to express a first choice for each office to be filled under penalty of having his ballot declared void. In <em>State </em>v. <em>City of Portland, </em>65 Or. 273 [133 Pac. 62], the city charter provided for the election of commissioners at large and that \u201cwhen the number of candidates is more than three times the number of offices to be filled, each voter shall have the right to vote for as many first choice candidates as there are offices to be filled, and as many second choice candidates as there are offices to be filled, and as many third choice candidates as there are offices to be filled.\u201d The system was upheld under a constitutional provision as follows: \u201cProvisions may be made by law for the voter\u2019s direct or indirect expression of his first, second or additional choices among the candidates for any office.\u201d A statute similar to the foregoing charter provisions of the city of Portland was held unconstitutional in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>130 Minn. 492 [Ann. Cas. 1917C, 474, L. R. A. 1916B, 931, 153 N. W. 953], The court said: \u201cThe preferential system directly diminishes the right of an elector to give an effective vote for the candidate of his choice. If he votes for him once, his power to help him is exhausted. If he votes for other candidates he may harm his choice, but cannot help him. ... A qualified voter has the constitutional right to record one vote for the candidate of his choice, and have it counted. This right is not infringed by giving the same right to another qualified voter opposed to him. It is infringed if such other voter is permitted to vote for three opposing candidates.\u201d In <em>Wattles </em>v. <em>Upjohn, 211 </em>Mich. 514 [179 N. W. 335], the Hare system of voting, substantially as' provided in the Sacramento charter, is declared unconstitutional. The court said: \u201cThe Hare system limits his (the voter\u2019s) power to express his preference \u2018in this manner\u2019 to but one candidate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>of the seven, only permitting him to express a second choice for one other, and so on by numerically dwindling and weakening choices until the elector has expressed thus \u2018as many choices as you (he) please.\u2019 As said in the Maynard case, \u2018It is not in the power of the legislature (nor a city adopting a charter under the Home Buie Act) to give his preference or choice, without conflicting with these provisions of the constitution, more than a single expression of opinion or choice\u2019; and he has the right to express that single choice as to each of the officers to be elected in his district. While each voter can under the Hare system vote for all candidates to express sequential choices as provided, it is evident that his vote is primarily and positively effective for only one candidate.\u201d At the oral argument, counsel for respondents filed a typewritten copy of the decision of the court of appeals of the eighth district of Ohio, rendered May 6, 1922, in the case of <em>Reutener </em>v. <em>City of Cleveland, </em>upholding the Hare system as embodied in the Cleveland charter. The constitution of Ohio provides that all qualified electors shall be \u201centitled to vote at all elections.\u201d Section 3 of article XVIII of the constitution provides: \u201cMunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government.\u201d Section 7 provides: \u201cAny municipality may frame and adopt a charter for its government and may, subject to the provisions of section 3 of this article, exercise thereunder all powers of local self-government. \u2019 \u2019 The court said: \u201cA code city may become a charter city only by determining its desire so to do by electing a commission to frame a charter under the method provided by section 8, article XVIII, of the constitution, and by ratifying at an election the plans submitted to it by such commission. When it has so adopted a charter such city has become a self-governing municipality and is henceforth constitutionally qualified to make such changes as experience suggests and in such manner as is provided by section 9 of article XVIII. ... If this fifth article of the constitution stood alone and was the sole measure of constitutional power in the case at bar the Constantine case might be deemed authoritative. The fifth article of the constitution, however, is not operative when it comes in conflict with article XVIII.\u201d The decision thus seems to be based upon the proposition that the chartered cities of Ohio are given the right of local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>self-government in the broadest sense. The foregoing authorities uniformly sustain the declaration found in section 212 of McCrary on Elections, fourth edition, \u201cthat minority representation and cumulative voting can be provided for only by constitutional provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Respondents contend that chartered cities have been granted plenary authority to adopt the Hare system of voting by section 6 of article XI of the constitution, which empowers them \u201cto make and enforce all laws and regulations in respect to municipal affairs, subject only to the restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters\u201d; section 8 providing that such cities \u201cmay make and enforce all laws and regulations in respect to municipal affairs, subject only to the restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters\u201d; and section 8%, which provides: \u201cIt shall be competent in any charter framed in accordance with the provisions of this section, or section eight of this article, for any city or consolidated city and county, and plenary authority is hereby granted, subject only to the restrictions of this article, to provide therein or by amendment thereto, the manner in which, the method by which, the times at which, and the terms for which the several county and municipal officers and employees whose compensation is paid by such city or city and county, excepting judges of the superior court, shall be elected or appointed, and for their recall and removal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It seems plain that sections 6 and 8 are inapplicable. They relate to the powers of chartered cities, <em>through their councils or Toy initiative </em>measures, to adopt \u201claws and regulations in respect to municipal affairs.\u201d The power of municipalities to adopt or amend charter provisions is not subject to \u201cthe restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters\u201d any more than the power of the legislature to enact a law is limited by prior legislative acts, or than the power of the people to change the constitution is restricted by existing constitutional provisions.  Municipal authority to adopt the voting system in question must be found, if at all, in the provisions of section 8%. Since the authority conferred by section 8% is made \u201csubject only to the restrictions of this article\u201d (article XI), it is pertinent to inquire what those restrictions are. Section 8 of article XI provides that a municipality \u201ccontaining a popu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>lation of more than three thousand five hundred inhabitants . . . may frame a charter for its own government, consistent with and subject to this constitution.\u201d This restriction applies to and qualifies every power conferred upon the chartered city. Notwithstanding such restriction, however, if the municipality is given express authority by the constitution to do a particular thing contrary to some general provision thereof, \u201cthe more specific provision controls the general.\u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Election Commrs., </em>126 Cal. 404, 411 [58 Pac. 932, 935].)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The right of. qualified citizens to vote at all elections is the fundamental right upon which our government is founded. To justify a court in holding that the people of the state have surrendered or abridged that right, their intent to do so must appear with great certainty and clearness. In construing the constitutional provision under consideration, the forceful language of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>2 Cranch, 358 [2 L. Ed. 304, see, also, Rose\u2019s U. S. Notes], is particularly applicable: \u201cWhere rights are infringed, where fundamental principles are overthrown, where the general system of the laws is departed from, the legislative intention must be expressed with irresistible clearness to induce a court of justice to suppose a design to effect such objects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The determination of the issue in this case must depend; upon the construction of the provision of section 8%, em-1 powering cities to provide in their charters for \u201cthe man- i ner in which\u201d and \u201cthe method by which\u201d their officers ' shall be elected. In <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commrs., </em>97 Mich. 188 [21 L. R. A. 662, 56 N. W. 567], the court said: \u201cThe authority to direct the time and manner in which judicial officers shall be elected and the other officers elected or appointed does not involve the power to determine who shall constitute the electorate. The word \u2018manner,\u2019 it is true, is one of large signification, but it is clear that it cannot exceed the subject to which it belongs. It relates to the word \u2018elected.\u2019 The constitution had already provided for electors, and, when it provides that an officer shall be elected, it certainly contemplates an election by the electorate which it has constituted. No other election is known to the constitution, and, when it provides that the legislature may direct the manner in which an officer shall be elected, it simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>empowers the legislature to provide the details for the holding of such election. \u2019 \u2019 In <em>People </em>v. <em>English, </em>139 Ill. 622 [15 L. R. A. 131, 29 N. E. 678], in construing a section of the constitution providing that \u201cthere may he a county superintendent of schools in each county whose qualifications, powers, duties, compensation, and time and manner of election and term of office, shall be prescribed by law,\u201d the court said that the word \u201cmanner\u201d as used in the constitutional provision \u201cindicates merely that the legislature may provide by law the usual, ordinary, or necessary details required for the holding of the election\u201d and not that it may determine the qualifications of voters. The term \u201cmanner of election\u201d has been given the same interpretation by other courts. <em>(Board of Election Commrs. </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>187 Ind. 107 [117 N. E. 565]; <em>Livesley </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>47 Or. 248 [114 Am. St. Rep. 920, 83 Pac. 142]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guden, </em>75 N. Y. Supp. 347; <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, 2 </em>Stew. (Ala.) 231.) The word \u201cmanner\u201d is more comprehensive than \u201cmethod.\u201d Webster says: \u201cManner is literally the <em>handling </em>of a thing, and has a wider sense, embracing both <em>method </em>and <em>mode.\u201d </em>The addition of the word \u201cmethod\u201d by the amendment of 1914 cannot be held to have broadened the meaning of the word \u201cmanner\u201d as used in section <em>8y2. </em>If the power given municipalities to provide for the manner of electing j officers does not authorize them to prescribe the qualifications of voters, it cannot be held that it empowers them to, deny electors the right to vote. Certainly, by the adoption of section 8%, the people have not \u201cexpressed with irresistible clearness\u201d an intention to infringe and overthrow the fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution to every qualified elector of voting at all elections. Many authorities are cited to show that the election of municipal officers is a municipal affair, but none of them go to the extent of holding that the municipality can prescribe the qualifications of voters or abridge the constitutional right of qualified electors to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Counsel for respondents say: \u201cAn examination of \u2018Debates and Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of 1879,\u2019 is interesting in showing the intention of the framers thereof,\u201d and then proceed to set forth in their brief parts of such proceedings, showing an intent to give municipalities a large measure of local self-government. It is equally in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>teresting to examine the arguments for and against the adoption of the initiative amendment of 1914 to section 8%, containing the provisions on which respondents rely, and mailed to all the voters of the state, as required by law, shortly prior to the election of that year. The arguments were entirely silent as to the possibility of adopting a preferential -or proportional representation system of voting under the provisions of the amendment, and it is fair to assume that the voters did not have such possibility in mind. At the same election there was submitted proposed Assembly Constitutional Amendment 19, amending section 13 of article XX, in which the following appeared: \u201cProvision may be made in such charters (of cities, counties or cities and counties), and by general laws in the case of other counties and municipalities, for either or both nomination for and election to office at a primary election of all or any portion of the candidates voted for at such primary election and for a preferential system of voting at any county, city and county, or municipal primary or other election. Provision for a preferential system of voting at any other primary election may also be made by general laws.\u201d Arguments in favor of the adoption of the proposed amendment were devoted exclusively to the merits of the preferential system but, notwithstanding the fact that no counter argument was made, the people defeated the proposed amendment by a large majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">It would have been competent to provide in the charter for the division of the city into nine districts and the election of one member of the council from each district. Had that been done, no elector would have had a right to vote for more than one candidate to represent him. The Haro system cannot, however, be upheld on the theory that, in legal effect, it divides the electorate vote into as many districts or constituencies as there are offices to be filled, \u201cbased on common opinion instead of arbitrary geographical lines,\u201d and that \u201cevery man\u2019s ballot is counted for one man who is his representative among the candidates on the legislative body, \u2019 \u2019 which would be all he could do were the city divided into nine districts, and \u201cthat therefore it cannot be said his right of elective franchise has been abridged.\u201d In <em>Wattles </em>v. <em>Upjohn, supra, </em>from which the foregoing quotations are made, the court said: \u201cCounsel very interestingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>discusses the advantages of that theoretical method of distributing constituencies by boundary lines of opinion, belief t\u201e or policy, but, however alluring in theory, such intangible, ji! undefined theoretical demarcation by similar thought or views ', is not a legal substitute for what is in law recognized to be a voting constituency or geographically defined representa-; tion district, as the right of franchise has become established under our constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Counsel for respondents argue that \u201cthe right of defendants to hold office is justified also under the power of appointment.\u201d It seems so clear that the selection of the defendants was, and was intended to be, by election and not by appointment that it is deemed sufficient to quote the language of the court in <em>McArdle </em>v. <em>Mayor etc. of Jersey City, supra, </em>as follows: \u20181 The argument of the counsel for the defendants in error that this is not an election, but an appointment by the legislature of persons to perform the duties of excise commissioners, who shall be selected in the manner pointed out by the act, if sound (which it is not), would enable the legislature to tamper with the elective franchise at its will, and the constitutional provision which was designed to secure to the qualified voters of the state the elective franchise would be made a nullity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">It must be held that the proportional representation sys- ;! tern of voting provided for in the charter is violative of the 1 elector\u2019s constitutional right to vote at all elections. The power of the people of the state, by constitutional amendment, to authorize municipalities to adopt the Hare system of voting is not doubted, but it is clear that they have not done so. In reaching this conclusion, full consideration has been given to the principle that all laws are presumed to be constitutional and that they are to be declared invalid only when they clearly appear to be so. The court has also\u2019 given consideration to the practical effect of holding the proportional representation system of voting unconstitutional.  Having been elected and acting under color of legal authority, the defendants were and are <em>de facto </em>officers whose official acts, within the scope of their authority as defined by the charter, are and will continue to be valid until they are legally deposed from office. It is fairly inferable from the allegations of the complaint that the members of the former city commission voluntarily surrendered their offices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>at the time the new charter went into effect. If they did so and thereafter, for a period of three consecutive months, ceased to discharge the duties of their offices, the same became vacant. (Pol. Code, sec. 996; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hartwell, </em>67 Cal. 11 [6 Pac. 873]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>118 Cal. 393 [46 Pac. 740, 50 Pac. 668]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rea, </em>2 Cal.
