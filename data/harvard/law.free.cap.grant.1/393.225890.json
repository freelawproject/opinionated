The submission provided that the arbitrators \u201cshall make a statement of the matters and amounts between the parties on the principle of partnership.\u201d The arbitrators did not make the statement contemplated by the submission, but W. A. Williams, one of the arbitrators, made a statement as the arbitration proceeded. The closing entry wras made on the day the award was made. He stated that he did not recollect whether other accounts were before them than those contained in the statement, that there might have been others, and that whatever the arbitrators deemed material, they put down. He kept the statement in his own possession, so that the parties to the award could have access to it. The court did not deem the statement such a statement as was required by the terms of the submission, and rejected it, and this is the error complained of.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-10\"><em>Wetmore, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-11\">It is a settled rule in the construction of awards, that it is to be favorable, and no intendment shall be indulged to overturn it, but every reasonable intendment shall be allowed to uphold it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Story on Contracts, sec. 985; <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Peebles, </em>13 S. &amp; R. 322; <em>Bingham\u2019s Trustees </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>7 Harris, 423. A submission is to be construed liberally. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>9 Barr, 257; <em>M\u2018Manus </em>v. <em>M\u2018Culloch, </em>6 Watts, 359; <em>Bay\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Faw, </em>7 Cranch, 171; <em>Burchell </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>17 How. 344: <em>Merrick's Estate, </em>5 W. &amp; S. 9.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJS\">January 10, 1857,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\">The memorandum kept by W. A. Williams cannot be claimed as a compliance with the requisitions of the submission, and therefore the award is vicious.

There is no such statement accompanying the award, and nothing intended as a performance of this part of the submission. The one desired to be introduced on the trial, in satisfaction of the requirement, is in no way annexed to the award or made part of it, and we have no authority to annex it. As we understand it, the arbitrators did not intend it as part of the award. It seems to us to be merely the memoranda and calculations of the arbitrators, by which they were enabled to arrive at the result given in their award, \u2014 notes of the evidence, and of their progress, \u2014 and not the record of their conclusions; and we think it was rightly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
