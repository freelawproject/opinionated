These pieces had been coupled together, for the purpose of forming a river-raft. This river-raft was nearly completed, there being but one piece back in the Brokenstraw creek, which plaintiff was endeavoring to get out, when the facts occurred out of which this suit arose. This eddy is a safe and convenient place for lumber to be coupled and prepared for running down the Allegheny river; and the water being sluggish, rafts lie there in safety during the floods, and while their owners are preparing to run them down the river. Mead had run a number of. pieces down the creek to the river, and selected a place on the shore, and began to couple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>bis pieces. He coupled one \u201cstring,\u201d and fastened it to a tree on the shore by a cable. On the outside of this, he began to couple a second string, when Dalrymple came down the creek with his pieces, and landed them on the outside of Mead\u2019s partially-formed raft. He stretched his cable across Mead\u2019s raft, and fastened to the same tree with Mead\u2019s. In this way Dalrymple coupled all his pieces. In the meanwhile, Mead\u2019s other pieces had been temporarily fastened to other rafts, to await the departure of Dalrymple\u2019s. Mead requested Dalrymple to drop his raft, and give him a chance to couple on the rest of his pieces. Dalrymple paused a moment, and. then said, \u201c ray hands have gone on, and would not like to come back now.\u201d Mead' then said, \u201c may I do it ?\u201d and Dalrymple replied, \u201c yes, if you think you can safely.\u201d On the next morning, (being Friday,) Mead dropped Dalrymple\u2019s raft below, and fastened it with the cable to a large tree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-6\">On Saturday night the water arose, and early on Sunday morning plaintiff\u2019s raft broke loose and went off. This suit was brought to recover damages sustained by plaintiff, by defendant\u2019s interference with his raft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-7\">On the trial, the court were requested by the plaintiff to charge the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-8\">1. That the stream is a public highway, common to all. The first occupant of any particular locality has an exclusive right until he chooses to vacate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-9\">2. The defendant had no right to interfere with plaintiff\u2019s property, and did so at his peril, if without consent. If the consent was accompanied with the condition of equal safety, it gave him no other rights than he would have had without consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-10\">3. If a loss occurs, which must be borne by one of two equally innocent parties, the loss falls on him whose act occasioned it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-11\">4. If the defendant moved the raft of plaintiff for his own convenience, and not at the request of plaintiff, he was bound or liable for any consequences that resulted from that act disastrous to the plaintiff, without regard to the question of negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-12\">5. If the jury believe that the plaintiff did not intend, in the permission he gave, to increase the risk of his raft, the defendant was liable for all increased risk, in consequence of said removal; and if the jury believe the loss of said raft was in consequence of the removal, the defendant is liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-13\">6. If in the consent that- was asked and given, it was the understanding of the parties that the plaintiff\u2019s raft should be dropped to a point immediately below that of the defendant, where it would have been equally safe; and if the defendant did not employ the necessary means or force to stop the raft at that point, and it went to a place of greater insecurity, and was lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>in consequence, tbe defendant is liable to make good tbe loss to the plaintiff. ' ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">The court were requested by defendant to charge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">1. That if the jury believe that portions of Mead\u2019s raft were fastened to the shore at the place called the Plum Trees, for the purpose of coupling with other lumber of defendant, and plaintiff run and fastened his raft on the outside in such a manner that defendant could not couple his lumber, then defendant had a right to remove plaintiff\u2019s raft, using reasonable care and Caution in doing so, and securing the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">2. That if Dalrymple gave permission to Mead to drop the raft from the place where it was tied at the Plum Trees, there can be no recovery, unless in dropping or securing it below, the defendant was guilty of negligence or the want of reasonable care and caution in fastening it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-9\">3. That if Dalrymple might hav\u00bf insured his raft by the exercise of ordinary care and attention to it, after the same was dropped, he cannot recover, whether defendant was or was not wanting in proper care in securing or fastening it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-10\">The court, Galbraith, P., charged the jury as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Both parties were engaged in rafting lumber in the Allegheny river, in the spring of 1852, and running rafts out of the Broken-straw creek, into the eddy in the river below, coupling them and forming them into large rafts for running down the river. After the plaintiff had made up his raft, the defendant removed it a short distance down the river, and fastened it to some trees there, so as to make up his raft in the place before occupied by plaintiff. Shortly afterwards the river rose suddenly, and broke the plaintiff\u2019s raft from it fastenings, which went off down the river, and portions of it were lost. This suit is brought to reoover damages against the defendant, for the injury sustained by his removing the raft of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-11\">\u201c The Allegheny river is admitted on all hands to be a great highway, peculiarly adapted and used extensively in the business of conveying lumber of all kinds to market, in the towns and cities below. Its eddies, pools, bars, inlets and fastening-places, all belong to it; as such, like any other public and common highway, it is common to all, open and free for the use of every one while using it consistently, with the same right to be enjoyed by every one else. No one has a right to the exclusive use of any part of it, further than is necessary to carry on his business in using it as a highway. At a steamboat landing or railroad depot, or other place of great resort in a large city, one often sees conveyances and carriages of all descriptions huddled together. But to one not accustomed to scenes of that description, it would seem almost impossible that they could all get disentangled without smashing half the carriages there, or killing or breaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the bones of half the passengers who would venture into them. Yet in a short time the active highway will be seen clear and open, and no one hurt or injured. This is all effected on the principle of mutual accommodation, and each adhering to the great law of all common highways as before stated, that no one has the exclusive right of occupancy further than is reasonably necessary in the use of it as a common highway, united with another great principle of practical life, <em>for each one to attend to his own business. </em>Occasional inconveniences must necessarily be submitted to. A man has a right to use his wagon heavily loaded, and necessarily passing slowly on a narrow road, while another with a light vehicle desires to pass him at a rapid gait, and the-latter must put up with the inoonvenience just as long as it is reasonably necessary for the former to occupy the road; but whenever the necessity has ceased to exist, the former must yield for his accommodation. So if the heavy wagon should break down, and the light vehicle could not otherwise pass, and it remained in the way unreasonably, the owner of the light carriage would have a right to put the broken-down wagon out of the way altogether, but would have no right in doing so to do any injury to it more than was necessary to enable him to have the use of the road. These are some of the elementary principles that regulate the occupancy of all common public highways. The jury will investigate the whole of the evidence carefully, and ascertain what the facts were. .It is alleged that the defendant, without any authority from the plaintiff, unnecessarily removed his raft from the place where he had rightfully fastened it, and exposed it to the rapid flood that suddenly came on afterwards; that it was taken off down the river and large portions of it entirely lost, and that what he recovered was done at great expense, time and trouble, and claims to recover damages from the defendant for the injury thus sustained. On the part of defendant, it is contended, that he first occupied the fastening-place at the Plum Trees; that it was only by his permission and accommodation that the plaintiff occupied it at all, and that he retained it no longer than was necessary to finish up and prepare his river-raft ; that by plaintiff\u2019s permission he removed it out of the way and fastened it carefully at another place suitable for the occasion, and that in doing so he employed all the care and skill that the occasion required. The court are requested to charge on sundry points put by the counsel respectively, which we will answer, and leave the jury to determine the facts upon the evidence applied to the principles here stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-6\">\u201c To the 1st and 2d points of the plaintiff, we give an affirmative answer, with this explanation to the 1st \u2014 instead of the words \u2018until he chose to vacate,\u2019 substitute \u2018until he has had the reasonable and necessary use of it.\u2019 To the 2d point also, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that the defendant had no right to interfere with plaintiff\u2019s property, until he had the reasonable use of it for the purpose for which he had occupied it in making up and preparing his raft, and it became necessary for the defendant, in the exercise of the same right, to make up his raft at the same place. The 3d point is answered in the affirmative; the 4th is also answered in the affirmative, with the same explanation as the 1st and 2d; and the 5th also. The 6th is also answered in the affirmative, with the same explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">\u201c The two first points of the defendant are answered in the affirmative. The right solution of the 3d point depends upon the fact whether the plaintiff had the right to occupy that portion of the eddy where the-fastening was, longer than he had occupied it. Both had a right in common to make up their rafts in that eddy. It was a suitable place for those who owned small rafts, adapted to the Brokenstraw creek, to put their platforms together and form their rafts suitable to the river business. No one had a right to the exclusion of another longer than was reasonably necessary for that purpose, so as to prevent, or put to great inconvenience, others from doing the same thing, in the pursuit of their lawful business. When landed at a place of merely repairing rafts, it might not be necessary to continue a raft in one eddy or landing-place as long as at a city, where the object was not so much to prepare and put the rafts together, as to obtain purchasers and negotiate sales, and make arrangements as to the disposition of their lumber. The jury will take into consideration all the circumstances, the. object and purposes of the use of the eddy and landing or fastening-places, there; whether the plaintiff or the defendant had the first occupancy; whether the plaintiff had used or occupied unreasonably, taking into consideration the object of landing there, connected with the state of the navigation at the time in the river; whether the defendant had the permission of the plaintiff to remove the raft, so as to enable him to make up his own; and, if so, whether he abused that permission, or exposed the property of the plaintiff unnecessarily to risk and loss; or whether, in securing it, he employed reasonable care, diligence and attention to it under the circumstances. If the jury should find for the plaintiff, the value of the lumber will be the general measure of damages, together with the trouble and expense of plaintiff in pursuing the raft; and if there was wantonness or gross carelessness on the part of defendant, they might go beyond the actual loss, just .as they may think right. If the disaster was occasioned by the plaintiff\u2019s own fault, on the principles mentioned, or was' the result of mutual carelessness or negligence of both, it was then an accident, and the condition of the defendant the best, and the verdict should bo in his favor.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Apd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>January 10, 1856,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-3\">The errors complained of, were the answers to plaintiff\u2019s 1st, 2d, 4th, 5th,-and 6th points, and to defendant\u2019s points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-4\"><em>Wetmore </em>and <em>Johnson &amp; Brown, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As4\">referred to Act of 21st March, 1798, 3 Smith\u2019s Laws, 320; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 575; <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>4 Har. 463; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Champlain Transportation Co., </em>1 Denio, 91; <em>New Haven Steam Boat Co. </em>v. <em>Vanderbuilt, </em>16 Conn. 420; <em>Cadbury </em>v. <em>Nolen, </em>5 Barr, 320; <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>9 Har. 296.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-5\">-, for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANv\">referred to <em>Pittsburgh City </em>v. <em>Grier, </em>10 H. 68; <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>4 Har. 466; <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>9 Barr, 150; <em>Hice </em>v. <em>Kugler, </em>6 Wh. 338; <em>Souter </em>v. <em>Bagmore, </em>7 Barr, 420; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>8 Har. 171.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered</p>\n<author id=\"AvV\">by Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apr\">\u2014 We think that the general law of navigable rivers, relating to the rights of people passing along them with their rafts, and occupying their eddies and landings, was properly explained by the court to the jury.
