Jeffrey appealed to the Common Pleas. By consent of attorneys, in open court, the matter was referred to arbitrators, on whose report, judgment to be entered by the prothonotary. The words, \u201cwithout exception or appeal,\u201d were in the submission, as first written, but afterwards erased therefrom. The arbitrators awarded fof plaintiff, and Jeffrey appealed therefrom. On motion, and after rule to show cause granted, the court set aside the appeal, and entered judgment on the award, for the following reasons, given by the court, M\u2018Olure, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-11\">\u201c This reference was not under the compulsory arbitration law, where the right of appeal is reserved in all cases; nor is the award, under a voluntary submission at common law; but it is made under the act of assembly, entitled, \u2018 Of Voluntary Arbitrations.\u2019 Brightly, 42. The reference was under sec. 3, by consent to a rule of court for referring. In the reference, the words, \u2018without exception or appeal,\u2019 were expunged by con sent of counsel. The award has the effect of a special verdict. Section 3. The act provides that the losing party may except, for certain enumerated causes, and for none other. Here, no exceptions have arisen, and none were made. The act confers no power of appeal, nor can any striking out of words, or altering the ordinary phraseology of a submission confer it. You may waive your right of exception, but you cannot create a legal right to appeal. We are governed in all things by the statutes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-12\">The decision of the court was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A6U\"><em>Pollock, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-14\"><em>Negley, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU_\">cited <em>Kimmel </em>v. <em>Shank, </em>1 S. &amp; R. 24.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b434-6\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">\u2014 -This is a voluntary submission made in open court, with an agreement that judgment shall be entered by the prothonotary on the award. The terms of the submission seem, therefore, to exclude the right of appeal. But this was not necessary ; for no appeal is given by law in such a case. On a voluntary submission, an award made in pursuance of it, and without fraud is always final, unless the parties provide for an appeal, or for some other mode-of re-hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">But it is supposed that the contrary intention^ appears here, because the words \u201cwithout exception or appeal,\u201d were originally in the submission as written, and were erased at the time the submission was agreed to, and made a rule of court. We cannot possibly attribute so much importance to an erasure. Usually that which is erased is not to be read, but this wrnuld be to make it the means of announcing a most important part of the agreement. An erasure of one agreement cannot be-equivalent to the expression of a contrary agreement. The erasure left the parties without agreement on the subject, and then the rules of law must stand as their guide in relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">And besides, it would be most dangerous to establish a rule that any unexpressed intention is to be inferred from an erasure. We have enough to do to construe what is written in plain words, without requiring us to interpret erasures. There ought to be no such thing in' a record, but if they be at all allowed, we must simply leave the erased writing unread.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
