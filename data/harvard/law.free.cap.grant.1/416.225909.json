D., 1856, praying for a preliminary injunction to restrain the Kittanning Bridge Company from obstructing Water and Market streets, in the Borough of Kittanning, and also to restrain said company from obstructing an ancient public road or highway, leading from the mouth of Market street in said borough, down the bank of the Allegheny river, and across the same, connecting at each side, what is known as the Indiana and Butler turnpike. In substance, the bill sets forth, \u2014 that the town of Kittanning was laid out above fifty years ago, by commissioners appointed by the governor of the State, by virtue of legislative enactment, and with the consent of John and James Armstrong, the then owners of the lands upon which the town was located. That Water street in said town was laid out 90 feet wide, and Market street 80 feet wide, and that upon return of the plan of said town, to the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, by said commissioners, the same was approved by the governor and original proprietors, (the Armstrongs,) and the streets, lanes, and alleys of said town, as marked on said plan, dedicated to the public use. Upon the faith of this dedication, lots were sold out and the town settled. Also, that said road leading to the town of Butler, across said river, had been laid out, and used by the public as a common highway, for upwards of thirty years. The bill further shows that a number of persons styling themselves \u201c The Kittanning Bridge Company,\u201d had entirely obstructed and stopped said road, and had to a great extent obstructed <em>Water and Marlcet </em>streets, by placing thereon large embankments of earth and stones, &amp;c., and by erecting upon said Water street, and road, a large brick building or house, -which house stands about 67 feet from the eastern abutment of said bridge, and is entirely upon Water street, thus hindering and entirely obstructing the passage of the people over and along said road and street. The court, upon partial hearing of the bill, refused the preliminary injunction, reserving their opinion upon the merits of the controversy, until the case came on for final hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">On the 15th November, 1856, John W.

R., </em>12 Harris, 160. Where the damages are estimable only by \u201c conjecture, and not by any accurate standard,\u201d they are within the meaning of the words \u201c <em>irreparable </em>damage,\u201d and present a proper case for an injunction. 3 Railway Cases, 106, 345; 3 Id. 186; 1 Sim. &amp; S. 607; 3 Atk. 21; 6 Johns. Ch. 501; 16 Rik. 525; 3 Wh. 513; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rush, </em>2 H. 186. When rights purely public are invaded, no question of damages is ever raised. <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Cohoes Company, </em>6 Paige, 133; <em>Downing </em>v. <em>M'Fadden, </em>18 State Reports, 334. When railway companies, or individuals, exceed their statutory powers, in dealing with other people\u2019s property, no question of damage is raised when an injunction is applied for; but simply one of the invasion of a right,\u201d per Lowrie, J., in <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh and Connellsville R. R., </em>1 Rail. Cases, 135. And it is said, in <em>Bonaparte </em>v. <em>Camden and Amboy R. R. Co., </em>Bald. 205, \u201cit is no objection to an injunction that the defendant acts under the authority of an act of the legislature of the State, if he exceeds his authority, or abuses his power, or if the law is unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-9\">If the assent of the attorney-general be necessary, he has been admitted to become a party to the bill, and the time is not material, as the bill itself may be amended any time before final hearing. 12 H. 159. It is said by Mr. Rrightly, in his Treatise upon Equity, page 246, that \u201ca court of equity will interfere in cases of nuisance, not only on the information of the attorney-general, but also upon the application of private parties.\u201d And it seems to be the settled law of this State, that courts of equity will interfere to prevent the invasion of public lights, as the obstruction of streets and highways, in every in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>stance, upon the application of any citizen, and without the intervention of the attorney-general or his deputy; and, indeed, the remedial powers of courts of equity, as exercised in modern practice, have been found so convenient and salutary as almost to obviate the ancient remedies of assize of nuisance and action on the case. And the tendency of the law seems to be to encourage equitable procedure by leaving it free to the humblest citizen, untrammelled by forms. It is distinctly ruled by Judge King, in <em>Com. Moyamensing </em>v. <em>Long, </em>1 Par. 148, that the assent of the attorney-general is not necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-6\">Having spoken of the remedy, we now come to the case in hand, and we rest the case of the complainants upon four propositions, any and all of which are sufficient to entitle us to a final injunction. First: The legislature has not the power to vacate a public street, or any part thereof, in the borough of Kit-tanning. Second: If such power be conceded, they have not done so in express terms, and it cannot be done by implication. Third: Conceding, for the sake of the argument, the power and its exercise, by express terms, or otherwise, the legislature could only have intended to vacate so much of the public street and road as might be absolutely necessary to the enjoyment of the franchises of the bridge company. Hence, we say, the corporation has erected its toll house at a greater distance from the bridge than was necessary, and, as a consequence, has invaded the public street further than was necessary. Fourth: The bridge .company had no right to obstruct the landing or road to and across the river; at least not until it had provided a substitute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-7\">The dedication of the streets entered into and formed part of the contract with each purchaser of a lot in the town of Kittanning, which contract the legislature has no power to impair.

Shoenherger, 2 <em>W. </em>23; <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>4 S. &amp; R. 354; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>16 S. &amp; R. 390; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh and Connellsville R.

The court say \u201cthe plaintiffs cannot, upon any principle of law, be recognized as parties competent in court to represent the interests of the citizens of Georgetown, as persons in whose behalf they sue; nor is the difficulty obviated by associating, with them the citizens of Georgetown.\u201d <em>Rung v. Shoenbezger, </em>2 W. 23; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>M'</em>Donald, 16 S. &amp; R. 397; Bright. Eq. 402; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bunell, </em>2 Barr, 34. \u201c The grant of the right to build the bridge, carries with it the right to build the abutments and toll-house.\u201d Coke, Litt. 56, a. \u201c The abutment to a bridge, is part of the bridge.\u201d 15 Verm. 438. \u201cAnd the term bridge, includes not only the superstructure, but the abutments also, so finished that travellers may pass safely thereon.\u201d <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders </em>v. <em>Strader, </em>3 Harrison, 108. \u201cWhere the law authorizes the erection of abridge, it authorizes the taking of land for the abutments where compensation is provided for.\u201d <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Sharpsburg Bridge Company, ante, </em>414; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>9 Pick. 109; <em>Ridge Turnpike </em>v. <em>Stoever, </em>2 W. &amp; S. 348; Ib. 378. The right of eminent domain to the land occupied by the defendants, was in the Commonwealth; and, by the act of incorporation, the right to use and occupy it with a bridge became vested in the Kittanning Bridge Company, and the old road and street were to that extent vacated. That an act vacating a public road or street is constitutional, is well settled. <em>Carver </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>12 Harris, 211; <em>Philadelphia and Trenton R. R.
