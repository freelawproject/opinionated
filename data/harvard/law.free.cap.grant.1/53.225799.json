The general rule is that, an infant can bind himself or his estate only for necessaries, and the plaintiff can escape from this rule only by showing a case which ought to be treated as an exception to it; which he has not done. Necessity has certainly demanded many exceptions to this rule, but here it demands none; for this minor had a guardian acting for him, and the law has provided the very mode in which the end might have been reached. Orphans\u2019 Court Act, 1832, sec. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">If we were to apply in a general way, the rule that, in some special cases, requires an infant to. refund the consideration if he avoids the contract, we shall convert the exception into the rule, and place the rule among its exceptions. Here he would have to pay the debt in order to get leave to plead infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The rule that sometimes binds an infant when the contract is beneficial to him, is of the same character. It is a means of testing the validity of certain necessary exceptions. It is not itself a general rule, but a means of limiting certain exceptional rules, and preventing them from injuring the minor. It is never applied to cases of money lent.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
