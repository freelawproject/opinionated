At the time of his decease, he was seised in fee simple of certain real estate situate in Ligonier Township, Westmoreland county, upon which proceedings in partition in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Westmoreland county were had, and part of the land was taken at the appraisement, and the residue of the land after the usual rules on the heirs to appear and accept the same at the valuation, was on the 22d day of May, A. D. 1849, directed by said court to be sold, and a certain Killian Ambrose, the co-obligor of the defendant, was appointed trustee to make sale of the same, to give bond and security in $800, and Joseph Moorhead, the defendant in this suit, was approved as security, which bond was duly executed and filed. The terms of sale were one-third on confirmation, one-third in six months, and the remaining one-third in twelve months, to be secured by bond and mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-12\">The money arising from the sale was all paid to Killian Ambrose, the trustee; and an auditor having been appointed by the court, to make distribution among the heirs of said decedent, directed $227, being the one-half of the proceeds of sale after de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ducting costs, &amp;c., to be invested, the interest of which to be paid annually to Mary Nelson, the plaintiff, during her natural life, and at her decease the said principal sum to be paid to the heirs of said decedent. After the lapse of a few years, the present suit was brought by the widow, Mary Nelson, on the bond, to recover the annual interest that had accrued on the $227, set apart by the auditor aforesaid.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APy\">November 5, 1855,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Akv\">On the trial of the cause in the court below, Joseph Moorhead, the plaintiff in error, who was only the security in the bond, contended and alleged that he ought not to be held responsible for this money, on the ground that he was only liable for the faithful application of the proceeds of sale, which the law allowed to go into the hands of the trustee, and that the Orphans\u2019 Court should have directed the one-half of the purchase-money to be, and remain a lien on the land in the hands of the purchaser, the interest of which to be paid to the widow annually during her life, and at her decease, the principal sum to the heirs, and that the bond covered but one-half of the proceeds of sale presently payable to the heirs, as the court could nOt by any decree authorize the widow\u2019s share to be paid to the trustee, or discharge the land in 'the hands' of the purchaser from any liability to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAv\">The court, Burrell, P.

In ordering the sale, the court directed' that the whole price should be paid within a certain period, and it was paid, and the trustee invested it, and now, when the widow sues for her annual portion of it, the surety sets up for defence that the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction to order a sale, so as to discharge the land of the widow\u2019s portion; he did indeed become surety, that the trustee should faithfully execute the decree-, but the court had no authority to make the decree. If possible, let us suppose it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Can such a question he raised in such a proceeding as this ? The Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1832, expressly forbids it, declaring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>in one place that that court has jurisdiction of this sort of cases, and in another that its proceedings and decrees, in all matters within its jurisdiction, shall not be reversed or avoided collaterally in any other court. Here the parties make no objection to the proceedings, and it is vain for a stranger to <em>expect </em>us to disregard them in order to relieve him from a contract which he admits that he made.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
