The plaintiff, Shoofstall, derived title through one Rachel- Mason, by a devise of the premises to him by will, dated May 18, 1842. The title of said Rachel Mason was, by deed, from Isaac Powell, with <em>habendum </em>and tenendum, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-12\">. \u201c To have and to hold the same, to the proper use, benefit and behoof of her, the said Rachel Mason, during her natural life; and also for the use and benefit of her husband, George Mason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>during his natural life; and should the said Rachel have any heirs of her body, then, and in that case, the said heirs shall inherit the same, in fee simple, forever, after the lifetime of their said father and mother. And in ease the said Rachel will have no heirs, or dying intestate, then, and in that case, the above described piece or part of the whole tract hereby intended to be granted, together with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging, after the lifetime of her, the said Rachel, and her husband, George Mason, shall revert back to the said Isaac Powell, his heirs and assigns forever, as fully and completely as if this indenture had not been written.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9\">October 11, 1852,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">The defendant, Thomas E.

She died without heirs of her body, but devised the land to the plaintiff in error; and the question is, whether the words \u201c dying intestate\u201d gave her the power by implication to devise the land. No formal set of words is requisite to create or reserve a power. It may be created by deed or will, and it is sufficient that the intention be clearly declared. Th\u00e9 creation, execution, and destruction of powers all depend 'on the substantial intention of the parties, and they are construed equitably- and liberally in furtherance of that intention. Doug. 293; 3 East, 441; 11 Johns. 169; 4 Kent, 318. In the case of a will, it seems now to be a settled rule of property, in relation7 to land, that if a devise be made to one in fee, and \u201cif he die without issue,\u201d or \u201cfor want of issue,\u201d or \u201cwithout leaving issue,\u201d then over to another in fee, the estate of the first taker is in tail. 9 W. 450<em>; </em>7 W. &amp; S. 98; 5 Barr, 463. In these cases the estate tail is created solely by the implication arising from the words \u201c dying without issue.\u201d The direction given to the estate in case of a \u201c failure of issue\u201d Sustains the implication that the issue shall inherit as heirs in tail. In like manner the reservation to the grantor in case the grantee should \u201c <em>die intestate,\u201d </em>sustains the implication of a power to devise. The word \u201c or,\u201d to effectuate the intention, must be construed to mean \u201cand,\u201d and in this case the clear construction of the reservation is that it was to take effect only upon the grantee\u2019s \u201cdying intestate and without issue.\u201d As she did not die intestate, to permit the grantor to recover would be contrary to the plain terms of his own deed. The judgment on the special verdict ought, therefore, to have been entered in favor of the plaintiff below.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">This view of the case renders it scarcely necessary to add that the decision of the court on the question of evidence was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment ordered to be entered on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
