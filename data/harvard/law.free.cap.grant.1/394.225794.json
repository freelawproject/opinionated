This was in 1851. The plaintiff, Guffey, sent his son, in the fall of-that year, up to Greensburgh, to see Borland, and tell him that he had heard that he was about to buy, or had bought, Fullwood out, and that he wanted him to save his debt of one or two hundred dollars. The son called on Borland and- told his errand, and the latter told him he had not bought out Fullwood, but he intended to do so, and if he did, he would save his father\u2019s debt, and that he should tell his father not to take out an attachment against Fullwood, as he contemplated, and he would save his money. The witness said he went home and told his father Borland\u2019s proposal, and that he agreed to it; but it was not shown that any notice of his .agreement was given to Borland, who afterwards went on and bought out Fullwood\u2019s furniture, and paid for it in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">Guffey then shed Borland upon this alleged assumpsit. On the trial, defendant requested the court to charge the jury \u201c that there is no evidence in the cause to show that there was any notice given to the defendant of the acceptance of his proposal by the plaintiff-; and that, therefore, the plaintiff cannot recover, and their verdict must be for the defendant;\u201d to which the court, Buffington, P., gave the following answer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">\u201cThis is a suit brought to compel defendant to answer for the debts of John Fullwood. That debt, it is not controverted, was honestly due to the plaintiff. If the evidence is believed, Full-wood had sufficient property to pay the debt, which he was about to sell to the defendant, Borland; and, if the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s son, William Guffey, is believed, the plaintiff was about to issue process to make the money out of that property. At this period, the plaintiff deputed his son to make some arrangement with the defendant about the debt, and it resulted in the agreement of the defendant to pay this debt, if the plaintiff would not seize this property for that purpose. That agreement was acceded to by the son and agent, and on being communicated to the plaintiff, he was satisfied, and ratified it; and if the plaintiff carried' out this agreement by not issuing -legal process, and interfering with the defendant\u2019s purchase, the court are of opinion that the contract was a valid one. The point is, therefore, answered adversely, and against the request of defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d Verdict for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">The answer of the court is the error assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAqg\">-, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHA\">referred to <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Leibengood, </em>4 Barr, 307; <em>Beiben </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>4 Barr, 200; <em>Johnston </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0x\">\u2014 This is an action to compel one man to be answerable for the debt of another. The promise and the consideration for it, must therefore be clearly established. Alexander Guffey sent his son William to James Borland with a message, that \u201c if Borland would buy Eullwood\u2019s property, he would save Guffey $100 or $200 that Eullwood owed him; that if Borland would not do it, Guffey would take out an attachment on Eullwood to recover his money.\u201d If Guffey\u2019s son had been authorized to make an agreement for his father, and if the son had agreed not to take out an attachment, and Borland, on that consideration, had agreed to pay the debt, the parties would have been bound. But it does not appear that the son was authorized to make any agreement of the kind, or that any agreement whatever was entered into between Borland and William Guffey. On the contrary, Boi'Iand, instead of assenting to the consideration for assuming the debt, as proposed by the message of A. Guffey, sent a new message to Guffey requiring other terms. Guffey proposed not to take out an attachment, but Borland required not only that Guffey should not take out an attachment, but that he should \u201cnot <em>do anything more in the </em>case, and that he should <em>Iceep quiet, and let no person know anything about it.\" </em>This was communicated <em>to Guffey by his son, and </em>the <em>son says that his </em>father was satisfied with it; but it does not appear that Borland was notified in any manner of Guffey\u2019s assent to the terms proposed. There was therefore no contract between the parties. It was essential, under the circumstances of the case, that Borland should have been informed of Guffey\u2019s assent to the new terms proposed. The court fell into error in answering the defendant\u2019s point in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
