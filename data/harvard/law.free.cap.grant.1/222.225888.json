Smith, 7 Barr, 383; 19 S. &amp; R. 382; <em>Cathing </em>v. <em>Scoulding, </em>6 T.

This relates to the defendant\u2019s set-off. The plaintiff claimed for several years\u2019 rent, and could of course recover for all rent falling due within six years before suit brought. True, this allows the plaintiff to recover for an occupation commencing nearly seven years before; and this is right, if there was an agreement for a rent payable annually; and this we must presume, from the defective state of our paper-book. The plaintiff\u2019s action commences with the issuing of the writ, and'the defendant\u2019s from the entry of his plea of set-off, and the statutory limitation is computed from these dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b219-11\">Lewis, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEKO\">\u2014 The answer to the second point was erroneous as an abstract principle, but the claim of the plaintiff was for rent, all of which became due within six years, and the error was therefore immaterial. With this explanation, I concur in the judgment of affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
