L. Henry and J. D. M'Entire, two of the commissioners, with James A. M\u2018Fadden and Joseph Bolliet, to erect such buildings. This contract was in writing, signed and sealed by M\u2018Fadden and Bolliet, and signed by the two commissioners, and sealed with a scrawled seal. The commissioners, as directors of the poor, had no seal. There were endorsements of payments on the contract, to the amount of f&gt;2787.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-14\">This action of covenant was instituted by plaintiffs on the 26th day of July, 1853, to recover damages for non-performance by defendants, the covenantors, according to the terms and stipulations of the contract or agreement. The plaintiffs declared upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the contract, as one entered into between the plaintiffs and defendants, and averred that by it \u201c the said defendants did covenant and agree, to and with said plaintiffs, to build,\u201d &amp;c.; and preceding the averment of the breach of the covenants by defendants, used this language: \u201c And although the said plaintiffs have well and truly performed- and fulfilled all and singular the covenants and agreements in the said articles of agreement mentioned on their part and behalf to be done and performed;\u201d and in a second count averred like general performance on part of plaintiffs; and also made profert of the articles of agreement thus, \u201c which said articles of agreement, <em>sealed with the seals of the said </em>defendants, the said plaintiffs now bring here into court, the date whereof is,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">To this declaration, the defendants pleaded \u201cnon-performance of covenants on part of plaintiffs, and covenants performed <em>absque hoe, </em>and <em>non est factum.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">On the trial, the plaintiffs proved the execution of the articles of. agreement by defendants, and offered to read it in evidence to the jury; to which the defendants objected, on the ground that it did not -appear to have been sealed and executed by the plaintiffs ; was not their deed, and did not. sustain the action, because it was not the deed set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 declaration. This objection was sustained by the court, (Galbraith, P.,) and the evidence rejected; which rejection of evidence is the error complained of.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-8\"><em>Church </em>and <em>Derickson, </em>for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANP\">contended, that the plaintiffs, if not covenantors, were covenantees, and, as such, could maintain this action of covenant, although they only could be sued in assumpsit; and referred to <em>De Bolle </em>v. <em>Pa.

When the covenants are independent, it is sufficient that the party bound seals. These principles are established by numerous author.ties. In <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Bel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>laws, 5 S. &amp; R. 427, the agreement was sealed by Hugh Bellows and Henry L. Clark, who were described in the body of the instrument, as James Hays by his agent, Henry L. Clark, of the one part, and Hugh Bellows of the other part. The court in that case decided, that covenant did not lie by Hays against Bellows, because the covenants being mutual, the remedy must be mutual also. The court say: \u201c An imperfect specialty contract may be so ratified by parol as to give an action of assumpsit, but here mutuality of remedy upon the same instrument is the essential matter. Relative covenants are void whenever the matter to which they relate, and on which they depend, cannot by the deed take effect.\u201d The mutual remedies, therefore, must be of the same kind; and if James A. M'Eadden and Joseph Bolliet could not have maintained covenant upon the agreement against the plaintiffs, neither can the corporation against them. The same principle respecting relative and dependant covenants, is ruled in <em>Wade &amp; </em>Merwin, 11 Pickering, 280.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aun\">October 22, 1855.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The opinion was delivered</p>\n<author id=\"b228-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AED\">\u2014 This is the defendants\u2019 covenant, and that is all that it is alleged to be. It is not void because of its defective execution, as a covenant, by the plaintiffs. They may sue on it in covenant, though possibly a suit upon it against them might need to be in assumpsit. This is sufficiently shown in <em>School Directors </em>v. M'Bride, 22 State R. 215. It is properly alleged to be a covenant by defendants with the plaintiffs. This is all that we are asked to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial awarded, and record remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
