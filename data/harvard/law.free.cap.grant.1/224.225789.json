The conspiracy does not merge, though the overt act be consummated. <em>Com. </em>v. <em>M'Gowan, </em>2 Parsons, 241; 1 Whart. Dig., 6th ed. 502, sec. 471; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Com., </em>3 S. &amp; R. 220; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Eberle, </em>3 S. &amp; R. 9; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Demain, </em>6 Pa. L. J. 29; <em>Twichell </em>v. <em>Com., </em>9 Barr, 211; Wharton\u2019s Prec. Indict. 334, and cases there cited; Ib. 343, note <em>(h).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-13\">This indictment does not set forth an overt act, except on the part of one of the conspirators; and certainly the other defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ant, who perchance took no part in the particular overt act described, ought not to escape from the consequences of his illegal conspiracy, on account of the subsequent act of his fellow conspirator.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ao1\">October 22, 1855,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">The second count' does not allege an overt act of \u201cuttering and passing counterfeit money,\u201d but -of obtaining goods under false pretences, in pursuance of the conspiracy alleged in the former part of the count. Such indictments have been uniformly sustained. Whar. Prec. Ind. 334-336; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrett </em>&amp; <em>Ward, </em>1 Johns. R. 66; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>1 Mass. R. 473.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">The courts ought not to quash an indictment, and permit offenders to escape, except in a very clear case. Roscoe\u2019s Criminal Evidence, 3d Amer. from 3d Lond. ed. 233; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Cleaver et al., </em>4 Yeates, 69.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-9\"><em>Thompson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered</p>\n<author id=\"Aat\">by Lewis, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADUX\">\u2014 The indictment was quashed, because in the opinion of the Court of Quarter Sessions, the offence of conspiracy was merged in the consummation of the overt'act set forth.. This may be the law in a case where the act accomplished is a felony. Even in that case, however, there is reason to believe that the averments of the conspiracy may be disregarded as surplusage, and the defendant put upon trial for the consummated crime set forth. <em>King </em>v. <em>R., </em>7 A. &amp; E. 806. But the passing of a counterfeit note of the bank of another State, is not a felony in- this; it is only a misdemeanor; and in such cases it is the constant practice, in indictments for conspiracy, to set forth the overt acts. When they do not amount to a crime of a higher grade than conspiracy, there is no technical merger. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bberle, </em>3 S. &amp; R. 9; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 S. &amp; R. 220; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>5 Barr, 60; Wharton\u2019s Prec. Indict. 334; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Mathus, </em>4 Wendell, 265. The case last cited grew out of an occurrence which agitated the whole country, and attracted the attention of the enlightened world. The questions of law were well considered by a distinguished jurist, whose great ability commands the most unqualified respect of all well informed men. In that case the point now under consideration was decided in conformity to the rule already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">Judgment reversed, and record remitted for further proceedings on the indictment according to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
