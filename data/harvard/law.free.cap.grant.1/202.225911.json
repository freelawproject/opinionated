The court, Church, P., rejected the evidence, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ground that \u201c short pleading cannot be allowed for this kind of defence.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0h\">October 22, 1855.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">Defendant then asked leave to amend his pleading, by pleading bankruptcy at length, which the court refused.

Among them, we find <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>4 S. &amp; R. 238; <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Miller, I</em>b. 279; <em>Payran </em>v. <em>M'Williams, </em>9 W. &amp; S. 154. The court say, in this case, <em>\u201c </em>having pleaded in bar, it was in the discretion of the court to refuse him leave to withdraw his plea, and demur; and consequently not a subject of inquiry on a writ of error.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Irwine, </em>14 S. &amp; R. 176; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Foster, 4 </em>Barr, 119; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>2 Jones, 302; <em>Ridgley </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>3 W. &amp; S. 118.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The opinion was delivered</p>\n<author id=\"b199-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AqA\">\u2014 Where there is no rule of court to the contrary, a short plea is good, even of bankruptcy, unless the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tiff gives notice that a plea at length is required.'' At all events, it cannot be treated as a nullity, and the^ evidence to prove it excluded as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The principle illustrated in <em>Richards </em>v. Nixon, 20 Stat.
