This is assigned for error. But under the authority of several adjudicated cases, particularly <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>5 Wharton, 26, and <em>Garrard </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>2 Jones, 186, the instruction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>There is nothingjn the remaining assignments of error.
