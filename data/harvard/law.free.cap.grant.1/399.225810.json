Defendants, as executors, sold the personal property of their testator at public vendue, at which time and place they gave notice that \u201cany person or persons buying property at this sale, to the amount of five dollars and upwards, shall have a credit of twelve months, by giving their judgment notes with <em>approved </em>security,\u201d &amp;c. ' '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-14\">Paul purchased, at the sale, a horse and two stacks of hay. He was unable to give the security at the time of the sale, and asked of the administrators to permit him to take the note home with him, to get the requisite security, promising them if they would agree to do so, he would pay for. the keeping of the property, and return the note on the next Thursday, with Jesse Bussey as security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-15\">The administrators, believing they had made the very best sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>they could, and desiring to accommodate Paul, agreed to wait, if Paul would give Bussey as security. But instead of giving Bussey, he returned the note with George Paul, his father, as security. His litigious character and alleged insolvency, induced defendant to refuse to receive the note and deliver the property. In answer to defendant\u2019s point, the court, Gilmore, P., charged the jury, that \u201c where the security offered had a doubtful character for solvency, or ability, <em>whether this character was true or false, this would justify the defendant in refusing him, as security.\u201d </em>And, also, that, \u201c although from the evidence of Brice, Howard, and Esquire Stewart, no objection was made by Kennedy to the security, only because he considered him a lawing character, <em>this would not preclude him now from setting up any other </em>objection, <em>such as would show he was not approved security.\u201d</em></summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aqq\">November 24, 1856,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-6\"><em>Downey </em>and <em>Lazear, </em>for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-7\">Referred to <em>Guier </em>v. <em>Page, </em>4 S.

We think not. The only mode of ascertaining a man\u2019s ability that is readily practicable for such purposes, is by inquiring into his reputation for ability, and if that is against him, it is enough. Specific as was the objection to the surety, it meant that he was insufficient, and this left on the purchaser the duty of seeing to his sufficiency. If other circumstances had shown that the objection was a mere sham, intended as a cover for a refusal to carry out the contract, the case would have been different. 17 Wend. 337. A refusal to carry out the contract would dispense with the necessity of a tender on the part of him who sues for its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Judgment affirmed, and record remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
