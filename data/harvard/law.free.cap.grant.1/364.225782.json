M\u2018Cahan, his executors. The Messrs. Shryock alone discharged the duties of exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>cutors until 1855, when they settled their account and were discharged. M\u20180ahan then assumed the duties of executor. The appellant who is the widow of the testator, and entitled under the will to the annual interest of $10,000, petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court for a citation to M\u00a3Cahan, to require him to give security, and on default thereof to be discharged from office; and showed as a reason therefor that in November,.1855, he was indebted on his own account to Alexander White, in a sum exceeding $2000. At the same time Judge White was indebted to the estate of M'Kennan, deceased, in a large amount, and M\u00a3Cahan paid his debt to Alexander White, by a draft on Judge White for the amount, and Judge White thereupon was discharged from his liability to the estate of M\u00a3Kennan. In his partial account M\u00a3Gahan charges himself with $3000 received from Judge White.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9m\">January 10, 1857,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">These facts-were undisputed by the executor, either by answer or proof; but relying exclusively on the fact that he was the owner of property, greater in value than the amount thus wasted or misapplied, the court refused to require him to give security, and from that order this appeal is taken by Julia Ann M\u00a3Kennan, widow of the testator.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-7\"><em>Blair </em>and <em>Todd, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9g\">argued that the facts showed a wasting and mismanagement on the part of the executor, and that he was clearly brought within the provisions of the Act of 29th March, 1832, Bright.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIg\">\u2014 The executor has- applied over two thousand dollars of the assets to the payment of his own liabilities. This is such a mismanagement of the estate as entitles the parties interested to demand security under the Act of 29th March, 1832. See 2 Williams on Executors, 800, 801, 1529; 5 Randolph\u2019s Rep. 195. The -solvency of an executor is no answer to an act of mismanagement. There is no hardship in requiring security whenever under the circumstances described, the court have the power to do so. If the executor be unwilling to give it, he can resign the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>The decree </em>of the Orphans\u2019 Court is reversed, and the record remitted, with directions to require security according to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
