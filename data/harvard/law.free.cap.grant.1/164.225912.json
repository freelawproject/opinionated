Clover, were at one time partners in the mercantile business, in the borough of Brookville, Jefferson county, Pennsylvania, and the partnership was carried on under the name and firm of Evans &amp; Clover. This partnership was dissolved by the defendant buying out. the intestate, Charles Evans, and undertaking to pay the partnership debts. The defendant agreed to pay Evans for his interest, $3264.99, for which said sum, Clover gave three judgment notes, each for the sum of $1088.33; two of which notes were entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>in tbe Common Pleas of Clarion county, and one in the Common-Pleas of Jefferson county. These three several judgment notes were executed and delivered on the 29th day of August, 1843; and on the same day an agreement in writing was entered into between Charles Evans and Levi Gr. Clover, in which it is recited that the three bonds above mentioned, of $1088.33 each, have been given, and it is agreed that they shall be entered, two in tho Common Pleas of Clarion county, and one in the Common Pleas of Jefferson county; and that if at any time Clover may have an opportunity so sell any of his real estate in Clarion or Jefferson counties, on which said judgments may be a lien, that Evans is to release all such portions of said real estate as Clover may sell, from the lien of the judgments aforesaid, providing the said Clover pays over or appropriates the purchase-moneys arising from said sales, on the claims against the firm of Evans &amp; Clover, or on the aforesaid judgments in favor of Charles Evans; and by the said agreement it was further agreed, on the part of Clover, that he, Clover, bound and obligated himself to pay and discharge all debts and demands that may be owing and due by the firm of Evans &amp; Clover, doing business and merchandising in Brookville, Jefferson county, Pennsylvania; and on the same day and at the same time, Charles Evans executed and delivered a bond to Clover in the sum of four thousand dollars; which said bond recited that the said Clover had by a certain instrument of writing, bearing even date with said bond, assigned and transferred unto said Evans all debts, dues, and demands, to which the said Clover may be entitled, or may be found due him on a settlement with the commissioners of Clarion county, for his (Clover\u2019s) share of moneys arising from the sale of the town lots in the town of Clarion, and all moneys that may be due to said Clover, agreeably to the terms of a contract between Clover and Edward Derby, of the one part, and the commissioners of Clarion county aforesaid, of the other part, for the erection of the court house in said county of Clarion; that is, the balance that may be due the said Clover, on a final settlement between the said Clover and Edward Derby, his co-partner in the building of the said court house. In consideration whereof, the said Evans, by the said bond, obligates himself to collect and apply the said balances as may be due, in payments of certain judgments or claims due Simon Mudge and others, named in said bond, creditors of the firm of Evans &amp; Clover, doing business as co-partners in Brookville, Jefferson county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">After the plaintiff had given in evidence, on his part, the original judgment, and rested, the defendant gave in evidence the bond and agreement above referred to, and then went on to show, by record and other evidence, the amount of money that Evans had received from the county of Clarion, raider the assignment of Clover, and that he, Evans, had not applied all the money he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>had received to the payment of the judgments and claims specified in the bond; and in addition, that some part of the claims had been paid through Clover, by the sale of some of \u201chis real estate and otherwise, for the purpose of showing that Evans held in his own hands funds placed there by Olover, sufficient to pay the judgment on which the said <em>scire facias </em>issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">After defendant closed his defence, the plaintiff gave in evidence the record of the other judgment, <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Olover, </em>and <em>fi. fa. </em>issued thereon, No. 59, May term, 1846: on which inquisition was held and property condemned, for the purpose'of showing, that under a rule to show cause why the inquisition should not be set aside and the judgment opened, which had been granted on the application of the defendant, the same matters were alleged as a defence to the judgment, which are now relied upon as defence here, as appeared by the affidavit of defendant made to obtain a rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">The plaintiff then gave in evidence the payments made by Evans, on the judgments and claims mentioned in the bond, and then offered in evidence the record of a judgment, <em>William Barber &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Evans Clover, </em>No. 104, September term, 1843, and others of same character, to show that Evans paid debts belonging to the firm, which Clover was bound to pay.

Clover bought out Evans, gave him three judgment notes for $1088.33 each, and agreed to pay the partnership debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">At the same time, Clover assigned to Evans certain debts due to himself individually, and Evans bound himself to collect them and apply the money in satisfaction of certain specified debts of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">The judgment notes were entered on record and this was a <em>scire facias </em>to revive one of the judgments. The plea was payment. The assignments of error are four in number, which will be con- . sidered in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-18\">1. The defendant gave evidence that Evans had received money on the claim put in his hands by Clover, and had not applied it to the debts he had bound himself to pay with it. The propriety of admitting this evidence cannot he doubted. Clover had a right to appoint the application of his own funds, and when Evans undertook to collect and apply them for Clover, he had no right to keep the money, nor to divert it from its destination. If he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>did either of these things he made himself accountable for it, and it was a fair subject of set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">JBy way of rebutting this fact, the plaintiff offered to prove, that the attorney of one of the creditors, whom Evans was to pay with Clover\u2019s money, had received from Evans a draft on a house in Pittsburgh, for two hundred dollars, to be credited when paid, but no evidence was offered to show that the credit was actually given, or that the draft was ever paid. This was not payment, nor was it performance of the duty Evans had undertaken, and the court were right in rejecting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">2. But if Evans, still liable to partnership creditors, was compelled to pay debts which by the terms of .the dissolution Clover had assumed and agreed to pay, why would not such a fact be an answer to Clover\u2019s set-off? These claims back and forth, all grew out of, and were connected with the same transaction, the dissolution of the firm. By the terms of the dissolution, Clover assumed the debts of the firm, and received a consideration therefor. As between him and Evans they became his debts. For a specific portion of them he furnished funds to Evans, which as we have said, Evans was bound to apply as appointed; but Clover was equally bound to pay the rest of the debts. If then Clover neglecting to perform his agreement, suffered debts which he had bound himself to Evans to pay, to be collected out of Evans, what was it but appropriating the funds he had put into Evans\u2019s hands in a different manner from that first indicated, but still to his own use ? And if Clover had the benefit of these funds in that manner, he is not entitled to set them off against this judgment, for that would be to give him the benefit of them twice. We are of opinion, therefore, the court erred in rejecting the evidence offered to show that Evans paid debts of the firm of Clover and Evans, which Clover was bound to pay. It was not set-off against set-off. It was an answer to the defendant\u2019s evidence in support of his plea of payment. It was showing that in equity and good conscience he had not paid this judgment; that the funds he had entrusted to the plaintiff had gone to his own use by his negligence in not performing his agreement, and therefore that he was not entitled to plead them as payment of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">How far this evidence would have reached, whether to the extent of all the moneys received by Evans to Clover\u2019s use, we have no means of determining. What we decide is, that it was rebutt-' ing evidence, competent for the plaintiff to give, and that it ought to have been admitted. If on the next trial it is not shown that Evans paid partnership debts assumed by Clover, to the full amount of Clover\u2019s funds in his hands, the balance whatever it is, will be applicable to this judgment, unless indeed, it be shown to have been applied to the specific debts which Evans was to pay out of these funds.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b165-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Note by the Reporter. \u2014 Por reasons which need not be explained, parts of this opinion were written by Mr. Justice Black, the residue by the judge who read it.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">3. It appears that Clover had previously to this trial, applied to the court to open one of the other judgments against him, and his motion was founded on an affidavit of the same facts which he used here as a defence. The motion was refused. The plaintiff asked the court to charge, that the refusal to open the judgment in the other case was conclusive upon the parties in this. Had the motion been made in <em>this </em>judgment, no such effect could have been attributed to the denial of it, much less when made in another. The matter alleged arose subsequent to the judgment, and was proper as defence to a <em>scire </em>facias, and this, most likely, was the reason the motion to open was not entertained. But the refusal of that motion.is not a judgment, sentence or decree, and concludes nothing. It would have been error if the court had affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s point.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">4. Before the cause went to the jury, the plaintiff asked leave .to discontinue the suit, which the court refused. It is quite clear that a plaintiff may take a <em>nonsuit </em>on the trial whenever he thinks proper. At common law he might do so at any time before the verdict was actually recorded, and the only restriction of the right \u25a0 by our statute, is that which requires it to be exercised before the jury announce their readiness to deliver the verdict. But a <em>discontinuance </em>is not a nonsuit, though the difference in their legal effect is slight. A greater distinction exists in the mode of applying them, the one being subject to the discretion of the plaintiff, the other of the court. The plaintiff has a right to suffer a nonsuit before or at the trial, and to deny it to him would be error, but a discontinuance may be allowed or refused according to the discretion of the court, which is not assignable for error. We cannot doubt it was a discontinuance and not a nonsuit, the counsel asked in this case, and the court had a right to refuse it. The only error apparent in the record having been pointed out, the judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
