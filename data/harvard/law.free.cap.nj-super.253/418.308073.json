The Act has been repealed and replaced by the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1990, L.1991, <em>c. </em>261, \u00a7 20, effective November 15, 1991. Defendant-appellant Richard Roe (Richard) contends that the Family Court judge committed the following errors by ruling that: (1) he committed an act of domestic violence; (2) testimony of prior acts between the parties were relevant; (3) he admitted threatening to kill his wife, Donna Roe (Donna); (4) Donna did not have to produce her diary; and (5) his actions warranted his permanent removal from the marital home. There has been no motion to accelerate the appellate hearing in this matter. <em>See R. </em>1:2-5; <em>R. </em>2:9-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On January 22, 1991 plaintiff Donna filed a complaint under the Act, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-13. She alleged that her husband, Richard, had committed an act of domestic violence against her on January 14, 1991. A temporary order was entered on January 22, 1991, restraining Richard from returning to the marital home, prohibiting any contact with Donna, granting Donna temporary custody of the couple\u2019s two minor children, and prohibiting Richard\u2019s visitation with the children pending a final hearing. Richard appeared <em>pro se </em>before Judge Chaiet on January 23, 1991 and requested an immediate hearing. A hearing was scheduled for January 24, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">On January 24, 1991 Donna appeared with counsel and Richard again appeared <em>pro se. </em>At that time a consent order was entered between the parties in which Richard agreed to remain outside the marital home, pay $100 a week in support, and pay roof and gasoline expenses. A visitation schedule was set and the parties, and their daughter, age 6, were directed to attend counseling. Judge Chaiet ordered the matter re-listed in 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The matter was not heard until March 25, 1991. Donna and Richard both testified at this hearing. After considering the testimony of both parties, Judge Bassler issued a final order under the Act. The order forbade Richard from \u201creturning to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the scene of the domestic violence;\u201d from having any contact with Donna or her relatives, except for making visitation arrangements; and granting custody of the children to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">A consent order was filed on April 23, 1991 and addressed visitation arrangements. The order also provided that Richard pay $100 a week unallocated support, the mortgage on the marital residence, taxes, reasonable utilities, homeowner\u2019s insurance, and a gasoline credit card. On May 9, 1991 Richard filed this appeal from the adjudication of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">These are the facts developed at the hearing and relied upon for the issuance of the March 25, 1991 order. Donna and Richard Roe were married on May 15, 1983. Their daughter was born September 15, 1983; their son was born on October 10, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">In the complaint against Richard filed on January 22, 1991, Donna alleged that Richard committed an act of domestic violence on January 14, 1991. According to Donna, Richard threatened to kill her, or to have someone kill her, during a heated discussion in their home. At the March 25 hearing she testified that she and Richard had been having marital problems for some time. On the night of January 14, Richard brought home a \u201csoft porn\u201d movie and convinced her to watch it with him. Donna felt \u201cdistanced\u201d from her husband, in part because of the movie and his admission to her that he was going to a \u201cgo-go\u201d bar the next day with a friend. At about 1:30 a.m. they went to their bedroom and had a \u201cheated discussion.\u201d Donna testified that Richard \u201cbecame very nasty\u201d because she \u201cdid not want to be with him\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">He said that\u2019s it. I\u2019m putting you on notice. I\u2019m not going to be your patsy anymore. I\u2019m, not carrying\u2014you\u2019re carrying your own freight. Richard goes in day care and you go to work____ He said I\u2019m putting you on notice that we\u2019re separated so if you, if you hear about me seeing anyone, you know in advance and I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going to get whatever I can, wherever I want it, whenever I want it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">And I said, well, Dick, you know, we\u2019ll always be connected because of the kids. And with that he said, not if I kill you. Or I won\u2019t kill you, I\u2019ll have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>someone do it. And he wasn\u2019t laughing. It was a, it was a\u2014it was something of a heated argument. I mean, not\u2014he was laying down and saying all this. But he wasn\u2019t laughing. He wasn\u2019t joking. He didn\u2019t say I\u2019m only kidding. He didn\u2019t say anything and I proceeded to just\u2014I just went to sleep. I was really afraid and as I thought about what he had said, because I\u2019ve been in a marriage that\u2019s been abusive from day one, both physically and mentally and verbally, I took him very seriously. And that\u2019s why I filed a complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Donna testified that she feared for her life and believed that Richard had the capability to carry his threat out. Donna said that during their marriage Richard had displayed constant emotional outbursts, used foul language in front of the children, and often threatened to withhold money for food and household bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Donna testified to specific examples of abuse over the eight years of their marriage. On one occasion, when their daughter was 18 months of age, Richard grabbed Donna by the throat, pinned her on the couch, and threatened her for arguing with him. Donna testified that when she was nursing their daughter, she \u201cdid something he didn\u2019t like\u201d and he pulled her by the hair. She said that once he hit her on the head with a hardcover book. Donna also described an \u201cemotional outburst\u201d in which Richard, in frustration because he could not find a pair of jeans, threw a basket of folded laundry down the stairs in front of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Donna filed a domestic violence complaint in October 1985 which she later withdrew. She filed the complaint because of a \u201cseries of ... problems\u201d and \u201call the physical abuse that he doled out\u201d made her realize their marriage was not going to work. She stated that after the complaint was filed the abuse stopped for a while and then changed from physical abuse to verbal abuse and \u201cmental cruelty.\u201d She withdrew a final restraining order on October 4, 1985 because it was early in the marriage and she wanted to \u201ctry and work things out.\u201d Donna also testified to an alleged act of violence which she said occurred after the filing of the present domestic violence complaint. According to Donna, on March 16, 1991, Richard appeared at her parents\u2019 house with the children during one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>his visitation days. The baby was asleep and Richard wanted to leave him with Donna. The couple argued and Donna testified that Richard came up the steps and pushed her out of the open door. Donna pushed back, but he pushed harder and \u201cpushed his way into the house.\u201d Richard then went up the stairs, had a drink of water and used the bathroom, while Donna yelled at him to leave the house. The couple apparently talked outside for a while before Richard left with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">On cross-examination, Donna said that she had filed a divorce complaint February 19, 1991. She admitted that the death threat of January 14, 1991 and the earlier \u201chair pulling\u201d incident were not among the enumerated allegations of cruelty in the complaint, however. Counsel also brought out the fact that Donna had remained in the home after the January 14th incident for eight days before filing her complaint: during that time the couple continued to talk, go out to eat, and rent movies. Donna never called the police after Richard allegedly threatened her; she slept in the same bed that night and, indeed, for the entire week before the complaint was filed. She explained why she waited so long before filing her complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">A: Because I\u2014he had threatened me all throughout the marriage and that\u2019s\u2014 and I pondered it. For eight days I pondered it thinking if he was serious and his behavior the rest of that week led me to believe that, yes, this man\u2019s serious. He told me three times during that week that we were separated and that was it. I said, yeah, I thought maybe, maybe he\u2019s just not\u2014maybe he\u2019s having a problem. But he continued that behavior the whole week and that\u2019s when I decided that\u2019s it. I, you know, I think he\u2019s serious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">A: But it was very clear to me, because he also had bizarre behavior all through the year. It wasn\u2019t just what happened that night. It was lot of things that had led up to me believing that he was serious about what he\u2019d said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Richard then testified to his version of these events. He is a family law practitioner, admitted to the Bar in 1981; he acknowledged familiarity with domestic violence concepts and the Act. He testified that on January 14, 1991 he had rented the movie \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and he and his wife watched it on the pullout bed in the family room. They discussed the movie for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>about 15-20 minutes before going upstairs to their bedroom. Once upstairs, Richard testified they began to engage in sexual relations until Donna called a stop. He claimed she said \u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019ve been with or where you\u2019ve been anymore or who you\u2019ve been with anymore. So just stay away from me and she pushed me away.\u201d He denied that he threatened his wife or said he was going to have her killed. He admitted saying that he was \u201cfed up\u201d and wanted to \u201copen\u201d his marriage and that Donna should get a job, but claimed these statements were made \u201cin the heat of the argument.\u201d Then Donna rolled over and went to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Richard testified that the following week was normal. He rented movies almost every night and often Donna would watch them with him. They went out to eat and took the children to the local children\u2019s theater. According to Richard, Donna suggested that they hire a babysitter on Sunday night and go to a movie but he declined. Richard testified that they engaged in sexual relations on Friday, January 18 and Saturday, January 19, but did not \u201cengage in intercourse.\u201d He said he was shocked to learn that Donna had filed a domestic violence complaint on January 22 claiming that he had threatened to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">After the temporary restraining order was entered, Richard and Donna negotiated a visitation schedule. The children remained with Donna in the marital home and he was allowed supervised visitation every Saturday. Donna was always present and often talked with Richard during his visitation. Donna eventually allowed unsupervised visitation. Richard denied that he pushed his way into Donna\u2019s parents\u2019 home on March 16, 1991. He also denied that he ever threw laundry, pulled her hair, punched her or intentionally hit her with a book. Richard testified that they both use foul language, and he often \u201cblows off steam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>After hearing the testimony of the parties and arguments of counsel, Judge Bassler determined by a preponderance of the evidence that Donna proved that an act of domestic violence had occurred. Richard was permanently restrained from returning to the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1981, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-1 to 2C:25-16 (and its 1990 successor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-17 to 2C:25-33, effective November 15,1991), were enacted by the Legislature to protect victims of domestic violence and to provide uniformity in prosecuting and adjudicating such claims. Domestic violence was defined under the old Act at the pertinent time in January 1991 as \u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following [ten] acts between cohabitants: (1) Assault ... <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1 [through] ... (10) Harassment ... <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-3b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each act of violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-3b was defined by direct reference to the applicable Code of Criminal Justice section. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-13a provided that \u201cthe standard for proving the allegations in the [domestic violence] complaint shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Interestingly, terroristic threats or threats to kill, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3(a) and (b), were not included within the ten enumerated criminal acts of domestic violence listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-3, enacted in 1981, but are now included at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19 of the recently-enacted Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1990, effective November 15, 1991; L.1991, c. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Richard contends that since the underlying acts defining domestic violence under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-3b are criminal in nature, the burden of proving such acts must be by the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d He urges that a two-step analysis is required under the Act. The judge must first determine whether any criminal act which may constitute domestic violence occurred using the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard. If an underlying act of domestic violence is proven, the judge should then determine whether an order pursuant to the Act should be entered using a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard. This contention is both inherently contradictory and in direct conflict with the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">This court was presented with an opportunity to determine the applicable standard of review in domestic violence cases in <em>E.K. v. G.K., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 575 A.2d 883 (App.Div.1990). In <em>E.K., </em>the husband brought an action under the Act for a restraining order compelling his wife to cease harassing him by disciplining their child in a manner which he disapproved. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Although faced with the issue of whether a criminal standard of proof should be applied in an action under the Act, we declined to decide the issue because the record did not establish purposeful harassment by <em>any </em>standard. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 575 <em>A.</em>2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The legislative findings in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C.-25-2 recited the intent of the Legislature to assure victims of domestic violence maximum protection from abuse available under the law. The Act was adopted to correct the disparate application of criminal statutes to similar crimes of domestic violence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-2. Complaints of domestic violence are civil filings in the Family Part of the Chancery Division but a criminal complaint for the same act is not precluded. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-12a. In his comment to the New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, John Cannel states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">Although it is part of the Criminal Code, very little of Chapter 25 concerns substantive criminal law. The Chapter defines no new crimes. Instead it provides for particular procedures and predominantly civil remedies in cases where those crimes listed at 2C:24-8 and 2C:25-3b are alleged and the person charged and the victim stand in the relationships defined at 2C:24-8 and 2C:25-3a. [J. Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>Comment <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-1, at 437 (1991)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Since a domestic violence complaint is pursued as a civil action and civil remedies obtain, the preponderance standard of proof better serves the purpose of the Act in protecting victims of domestic violence. Allegations of domestic violence will frequently be difficult to prove due to the private nature of the offense. There are usually few, if any, eyewitnesses to marital discord or domestic violence, thus enhancing credibility disputes. A criminal standard of proof may be all but impossible for most victims to prove and would undermine the social purposes of the Act. Since criminal sanctions are not imposed, no constitutional problem is presented by the preponderance of evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Richard next urges that the record was insufficient to permit finding that an act of domestic violence was committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>under any standard of proof. We disagree. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that an act of \u201charassment,\u201d within the scope of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4a, took place. That section provides in pertinent part \u201ca person commits a[n] ... offense if, with purpose to harass another, he: (a) Makes, or causes to be made, a communication ... anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language or <em>any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Richard does not challenge the constitutionality of the harassment statute on vagueness or overbreadth grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The evidence was sufficient to support the charge that a violation of the harassment statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33~4a, took place, specifically a communication of a threat to kill plaintiff by defendant or another in a \u201cmanner likely to cause annoyance or alarm\u201d under the findings by the judge based on the evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">While there are some questions in the plaintiffs testimony, that is why did she wait the eight days or so before filing the complaint if in fact she really felt her life was at risk, these are questions of course which need to be thought through. But as I read the harassment statute, it is not whether she is in mortal fear of her life, it\u2019s whether the plaintiff made a statement which meets the criteria in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4. I find perfectly credible the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that she was in fact threatened by the defendant. I\u2019ll have some one kill you. The fact that she went to sleep after that, it seems to me, does not mitigate against the statement itself. And in fact, if you listen carefully or you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>in court listened very carefully to the testimony of the defendant on the witness stand, although initially he appeared to deny that this kind of statement ever was made, it became quite apparent that he acknowledged that in fact such a statement had been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The judge found that Donna testified \u201ccredibly\u201d about \u201cproblems during the entire year\u201d and \u201cthat there were constant emotional outbursts by defendant.\u201d He found an \u201catmosphere of hostility in this household culminating in the threat.\u201d He thought that Donna and the children had the right to live \u201cnot subject to that kind of threat.\u201d He concluded that \u201cthough such threats may be made in the middle of heated exchanges it is still something that she is entitled to be free from.\u201d The judge found that the previous history \u201cwhich happened in 1984 or 1985\u201d could not support in itself a restraining order \u201cbut certainly its a factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The judge made these further specific findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">I believe the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. Despite the fact that the complaint was withdrawn in the past, there has been a history in this family of domestic violence. The allegations in the prior complaint were that the plaintiff was assaulted by her husband and is in fear, that he assaulted the plaintiff several times by punching her, pulling her hair, hitting her with household objects, that on September 15th, the 25th, of 1985, he pushed and shoved her, continually harassed the plaintiff by threatening to take their baby away from her. Whether or not that is so, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any testimony on that. This is about taking the baby away. But there was certainly testimony about pulling her hair while she was nursing. I believe that. There was testimony that a book was thrown at her. I believe that and there was testimony involving a laundry basket and contrary to the defendant\u2019s denial, I believe the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">I believe that that statute does not require prior findings or the statute would have said that. The statute says a previous history of domestic violence is a factor to take into consideration. And what they mean by that is that consideration is not relevant on a finding of where the domestic violence occurred recently. It has to do in fashioning the kind of order that the Court is required to fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The judge then alluded to one of the statutory criteria\u2014\u201cthe best interests of the victim and the child.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-13a(4). He found \u201cthat it\u2019s certainly in the best interest of the victim and the child to have a cooling off period, to have a period of time in which the children and the plaintiff are able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>live in the home free of the kind of threats and the kind of physical abuse that has happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We are satisfied that the specific threat to kill in the context of the prior events described by Donna and believed by Judge Bassler was sufficient to sustain the charge by a preponderance of the evidence. Our task is not to reweigh the evidence but to determine if sufficient evidence exists. <em>See Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>Cf. E.K v. G.K., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 575 A.2d 883 (App.Div.1990); <em>Grant v. Wright, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 536 A.2d 319 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>562, 546 A.2d 493 (1988) (both cases where the evidence was insufficient to sustain a domestic violence complaint based on harassment charges); see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-13a, now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29a (factors considered for domestic violence finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">We conclude from our analysis of the judge\u2019s opinion that he did not base his decision on his finding as to the post-filing March 16<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, 1991 alleged assault incident. After reciting his oral decision in favor of Donna, the judge said that the March 16 incident \u201ccertainly constitutes an assault, which is an additional ground for entering a restraining order.\u201d We construe this finding as surplusage in terms of the decisional result and not essential to support the judgment. Error in this regard, if any, was thus harmless. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The judge did not err in permitting testimony of prior acts of the defendant which had never been the subject of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>adjudication of domestic violence. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Donna testified as to prior incidents of physical and mental abuse which she allegedly had suffered during the prior five years. The judge allowed the testimony since the history of domestic violence between the parties is an evidentiary consideration under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-13a(1): \u201cThe court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors: (1) The previous history of domestic violence between the cohabitants including threats, harassment and physical abuse;____\u201d The Act specifically requires the judge to consider \u201cthe previous history.\u201d The Act does not limit the judge to prior adjudications of domestic violence alone. <em>Cf. Evid.R. 55 </em>(other crimes or civil wrongs usually excluded as evidence); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-12 (prior criminal convictions admitted <em>only </em>to affect credibility). If the Legislature had intended to limit admissibility only to prior adjudications of domestic violence, as opposed to \u201cthe previous history,\u201d we are certain the statute would have clearly said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Next, defendant claims the judge erred in finding that he \u201cadmitted\u201d making the death threat. The judge stated in his decision that he found Donna\u2019s testimony more credible than Richard\u2019s. In regard to the alleged threat to Donna, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">if you listen carefully or you in court listened very carefully to the testimony of the defendant on the witness stand, although initially he appeared to deny that this kind of statement was ever made, it became quite apparent that he acknowledged that in fact such a statement had been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The judge found that this alleged \u201cadmission\u201d occurred when Richard summarized a conversation he had with Donna after she filed her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">On appeal, the fact-finding of the judge may not be disturbed if supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 323 <em>A.</em>2d 495. The judge heard the testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>observed Richard\u2019s demeanor at trial. In our view he was entitled to make this inference of an admission from his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Donna was advised by her attorney in June 1990 to keep a diary about specific events occurring between herself and Richard. This diary was subpoenaed by defense counsel prior to the hearing but was never produced. Donna\u2019s counsel claimed the attorney\u2019s work-product and the attorney-client privilege and resisted disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">At the hearing, Donna\u2019s counsel told the judge that he had directed Donna to keep a diary of specific events when she consulted him about her marital problems. He stated that the diary was a direct result of advice given pursuant to an attorney-client relationship, and fell within the privilege, <em>Evid.R. </em>26. According to counsel, the diary was currently used by him to formulate ideas for Donna\u2019s divorce case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The judge decided the diary was work-product prepared at the request of counsel and that any privilege or protection had not been waived. We find no abuse of discretion in this evidentiary ruling. There was no showing that Richard could not obtain pertinent information to defend the domestic violence charge from a \u201cless intrusive source\u201d, <em>In re Kozlov, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>232, 243-244, 398 A.2d 882 (1979), or was in any way prejudiced in preparing for this hearing by the preclusive ruling. See <em>In the Matter of the Probate of the Last Will and Testament of John Pretino, </em>150 <em>Misc.</em>2d 371, 567 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1009 (Surrogate Ct.1991) (diary protected from disclosure in probate matter by attorney-client privilege and litigation preparation doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Finally, we reject Richard\u2019s contention that his actions did not warrant removal from the home. He is correct in his assertion that a finding of domestic violence did not mandate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>order restraining him from access to the marital home. Nevertheless, such an order is permissible under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-13b, which provides that the court <em>may </em>issue an order granting \u201cany or all\u201d of seven types of relief. This determination was properly left to the discretion of the judge. As Richard noted in his brief, an order of exclusive possession may be modified at any time by petition of either party. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-13b(2), now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29(b)(2). Such relief, if sought, may not be precluded by our ruling today.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\">N.J.S.A.2C:25-3b listed the following ten acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"pAJC\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">(1) Assault.....................................

The Commentary notes that this particular provision <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4a or \u00a7 250.4(3)) presents a difficult overbreadth issue.
