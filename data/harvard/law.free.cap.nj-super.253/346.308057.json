Haines in his letter opinion of March 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We briefly recite the facts relevant to an understanding of the critical issues arising from the trial and motion for new trial. On January 9, 1987 at about 9:00 p.m. Bruce Forrester and Carl Middleton, both employees of Consumer Electronics in Maple Shade, travelled in separate cars to the Blas\u00f3n office of the First Fidelity Bank in Moorestown to make a night deposit of the day\u2019s proceeds. Forrester was carrying the deposit bag that day. As he was about to make the deposit Forrester noticed someone standing \u201cin front of [his car] door.\u201d The man demanded the money and pointed a gun at Forrester\u2019s head from a distance of about 10\" to a foot. Forrester handed over the deposit bag which contained about $1,300.00 in cash and checks. Thereafter Forrester\u2019s car began to roll backward because Forrester had neglected to put the car in park while waiting for Middleton. The assailant moved in front of the car and fired the gun. Forrester then saw the assailant, later identified as Robinson, \u201cstumbl[e] around\u201d while facing Forrester and looking at the gun. Then the assailant fled \u201cthrough the field and towards [an] office complex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Middleton, who was in his car behind the Forrester vehicle, \u201cobserved a man sitting on a curb near the bank drop\u201d as they pulled up. Middleton saw the man approach Forrester\u2019s car and \u201cput a gun to his head\u201d. Middleton heard the man demand the money and saw Forrester hand the bank bag over to him. Middleton then observed the man walk 10-15 feet to the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of Forrester\u2019s car, turn, fire a shot and flee toward the adjacent field.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">When responding police officers arrived at the scene, Sergeant Naylor discovered a .25 calibre automatic shell casing underneath the drive-in roof. Forrester and Middleton provided the police with formal statements. Middleton also assisted a police artist prepare a composite sketch of the robber the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">At approximately 10:30 p.m. the evening of the robbery, Paul Vallee, the manager of a Domino\u2019s Pizza store located near the First Fidelity Bank, observed a man enter the store and allowed him to make two telephone calls. Following the first call, a cab arrived and then departed without the man. Vallee thereafter allowed him to make another call. Subsequently a \u201csilver or blue Trans Am or Firebird arrived with two occupants\u201d to pick the man up. One of the occupants of the car was a female. Vallee could not identify the man in a photo array two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">At trial Forrester testified that Gorman had worked for Consumer Electronics from November 12,1986 to December 24, 1986. He further stated that Gorman was familiar with the bank drop routine because he had participated as a \u201ctagalong\u201d in making bank deposits while employed at Consumer Electronics.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">On February 8, 1987 Detective John Bratton of the Moorestown Township Police Department received a call from a detective in Mantua Township who advised Bratton that he had a witness in custody with information related to the robbery. Bratton and Lieutenant Howard Mann travelled to the Mantua Police Department and met Detective Gramlam of Mantua and Denise Bugyi. Bugyi subsequently provided Bratton with information regarding the crime, pled guilty and testified for the State at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Denise Bugyi testified that she met Gorman on Christmas eve, 1986, through her ex-boyfriend, Fred Rouse, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>defendant Gorman\u2019s nephew. According to Ms. Bugyi, on January 9, 1987 about 7:30 p.m. she received a phone call from Gorman who asked her to drive \u201chim and Jules to Consumer Electronics where he used to work [t]o rob the bank bag.\u201d She picked up Gorman in her blue 1985 Trans Am and was then directed by Gorman to \u201cJules\u2019 house,\u201d a room at the Ambler Motel in Brooklawn. The three then drove to a parking lot \u201cacross the street\u201d from Consumer Electronics where they waited for Consumer Electronics employees to leave the store. As the employees left the store, Bugyi drove to the bank where Robinson, who had received a \u201csmall handgun\u201d from defendant Gorman, was \u201cdropped off\u201d. Bugyi and Gorman drove to a nearby \u201calley way\u201d where Robinson was told to meet them. Gorman subsequently \u201cgot out of the car and walked to the back of the alley\u201d to see what was happening at the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">According to Bugyi, about two minutes later Gorman ran back to the car and advised Bugyi that \u201che heard the gun go off.\u201d He further said that the gun was not supposed to go off because it was \u201cbroke or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">As Robinson did not return to the location where they were to meet, she and Gorman drove around looking for him. Eventually Bugyi and Gorman drove back to Robinson\u2019s motel and asked his girlfriend if Robinson had returned. They then drove to Gorman\u2019s house where they received information that Robinson had called and was waiting for them at the Domino\u2019s Pizza. Bugyi and Gorman then drove to the pizzeria where they picked up Robinson between 10:30-11:00. Ms. Bugyi noted that Robinson appeared \u201cupset and nervous because the gun had gone off\u201d. Both defendants were surprised the gun had fired and defendant Robinson remarked, \u201c[m]an I could have shot that guy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Bugyi further testified that Robinson told Gorman and her that after the robbery he dropped the gun in the woods and subsequently set the bank bag \u201cdown somewhere.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if anything was in it. Gorman unsuccessfully searched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>for the bag while Robinson, fearing identification, remained in the car. Subsequently Bugyi dropped Robinson off and then took Gorman home where no party was ongoing. A few days later Bugyi and Gorman with \u201cArlene\u201d again searched for the bank bag which they could not find.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Ms. Bugyi testified that sometime later she received a call from Rouse, her boyfriend and father of her child, who was then at the Mantua police station. He asked Bugyi to come to the station and \u201ctell them about the armed robbery.\u201d According to Bugyi, someone was trying \u201cto pin him\u201d with the January 9 robbery while a suspect in an unrelated matter. She went to Mantua to advise the police that \u201cFred Rouse didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">On her cross examination, Bugyi admitted that she pled guilty to the indictment for the January 9,1987 transaction and to other unrelated offenses in exchange for an indeterminate sentence as a result of which she \u201ccould do no more than five years\u201d instead of a 60 year exposure. She hoped to obtain a lesser sentence if she did well as a witness at trial. Her sentence had been adjourned pending the results of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Bugyi\u2019s pretrial statement concerning the robbery enabled the police to show Middleton a photographic lineup containing defendant Robinson\u2019s picture. Middleton selected the picture from a photo array of about eight photos presented to him. Middleton testified at trial that his selection of defendant Robinson\u2019s photograph was based on \u201cprobability,\u201d and that he assumed that the suspect\u2019s picture would be among them. Neither Middleton nor Forrester was able to identify Robinson at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">On February 13, 1987 the police located the bank bag in the bushes near the bank. They never recovered the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Gorman produced an alibi witness who testified that on January 9, 1987 she threw a birthday party for her boyfriend, Rouse, and that defendant Gorman spent the entire evening of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>January 9, 1987 at the party and may have been out of her presence only <em>\u00bd </em>hour. She also testified that she also had a child by Rouse and that she \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d Denise Bugyi.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We reject Gorman\u2019s contention with respect to the aggravated assault that the State failed to prove that he acted \u201cknowingly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to ... human life\u201d, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(4), because he gave co-defendant Robinson a gun which defendant Gorman believed to be \u201c \u2018broke\u2019 or inoperable\u201d. As an accomplice in the armed robbery, independent of the fact he gave Robinson the \u201cfirearm,\u201d <em>(see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1f) with which it was accomplished, Gorman was responsible for Robinson\u2019s conduct with it. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6; <em>State v. Schmidt, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>576, 517 A.2d 1226 (App.Div.1986), <em>rev\u2019d other grounds, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>258, 540 A.2d 1256 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Gorman argues that the prosecutor made \u201cprejudicial\u201d and \u201cinflammatory\u201d remarks in her summation and that this error was compounded by the failure of the trial judge to give the jury the proper curative instructions. Gorman objects to the prosecutor\u2019s statement during summation that \u201c[a] shot was fired in the direction of Carl Middleton and Bruce Forrester\u201d. Later the prosecutor stated \u201c[a] shot was fired in the direction of both of them\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">It is true that there was no evidence that the gun was pointed towards Middleton or fired at him. However, the third count of the indictment was dismissed before summations, and when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>defendant objected to the latter statement, the judge stated before the jury that \u201c[t]he pointing of the gun at Carl Middleton is out of the case. Therefore there can\u2019t be any argument about that\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Furthermore, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury contained instructions that it had to rely on its own findings based on its recollection of the evidence and carefully pointed out the nature of the charges and that the jury had to find that the aggravated assault was caused by pointing the gun at Forrester.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In essence, \u201cwe cannot say the prosecutor\u2019s comments were so inflammatory as to deny defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Tirone, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>222, 229, 314 A.2d 601 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Robinson argues that his conviction must be reversed because of the judge\u2019s instructions and lack of instructions concerning Ms. Bugyi. It is true, as Robinson argues, that in <em>State v. </em>Dent, 51 <em>N.J. </em>428, 241 A.2d 833 (1968), the Supreme Court held that a trial court\u2019s comment that a juvenile accomplice, who testified for the State while serving his indeterminate sentence, had nothing to gain by that testimony, was reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 434-438, 241 A.2d 833. Here, however, the trial judge did not inject any statement as to whether Bugyi had something to gain by testifying for the State. To the contrary, he told the jury that \u201c[t]he law requires that the testimony of such a witness be given careful scrutiny. In weighing her testimony, therefore, you may consider whether she has a special interest in the outcome of the case and whether her testimony was influenced by the hope or expectation of any favorable treatment or reward or by any feelings of revenge or reprisal.\u201d Further, the judge\u2019s failure to recharge the jury on the credibility of an accomplice witness, in response to a question from the jury to recharge on the subject of credibility, did not violate the <em>Dent </em>rule. Moreover, the jury subsequently asked for various other readbacks over the next day and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>indicated its awareness to request further instructions if it desired them. Hence, the jury instructions and lack of them do not warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The State concedes that Gorman is entitled to \u201cgap time\u201d credits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5b(2). However, the State opposes defendant\u2019s entitlement to \u201cgap time\u201d credits against his parole ineligibility term. We agree. <em>See Richardson v. Nickolopoulos, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>241, 254-255, 540 A.2d 1246 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">On its cross-appeal, the State contends that the trial court erred in not imposing the extended term required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3d. We disagree. In <em>State v. Martin, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>10, 538 A.2d 1229 (1988), the Supreme Court held that, before an extended term for a second Graves Act violation can be imposed, the prosecutor at a hearing must provide a copy of the prior conviction, transcripts of testimony, or other proofs demonstrating that the defendant used a \u201cfirearm\u201d during the commission of the prior crime. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 538 A.2d 1229. Because there can be a question as to whether a \u201cfirearm,\u201d as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf, was involved in the prior transaction <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, the burden is on the State to prove prior use or possession of a \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16-18, 538 A.2d 1229. The Title 2A prior convictions (under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:151-5) here were not for offenses which had to involve use or possession of a \u201cfirearm,\u201d <em>see State v. Jefimowicz, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>152, 158, 574 A.2d 428 (1990), and the prosecutor did not produce the proofs required by <em>Martin. See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6h.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>On the first date scheduled for sentencing, July 10, 1989, the trial judge noted that the prosecution offered only previous \u201cindictments that charge violations of the law that include the armed feature\u201d. The judge rejected the sufficiency of those proofs and extended an opportunity to the prosecution to present further proofs, over the defendant\u2019s objection, at a later date. Before sentencing defendants on October 27, 1989, the judge again found, in the absence of further proofs, that the State had not met its burden of proving a prior Graves Act offense. He therefore properly declined to impose a mandatory extended term on the record presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Because of the mandatory nature of the extended term for a second Graves Act offense, we remand for reconsideration of the sentence. On the remand, the State should be permitted to present additional proofs if the court concludes, upon consideration of the issue, that there are no due process or double jeopardy preclusions because the sentence was initially fixed in the absence of proofs relating to the prior offenses. <em>See </em>and <em>compare, e.g., Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 <em>U.S. </em>430, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1852, 68 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>270 (1981); <em>State v. Koedatich, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>513, 524, 572 A.2d 622 (1990) (death penalty before jury); <em>State v. Martin, supra </em>(remand after extended term initially set). <em>See also, e.g., North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>711, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 23 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>656 (1969); <em>State v. Rodriquez, supra; State v. Stewart, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>596, 605-608, 477 A.2d 300 (1984) (requiring independent fact finding at sentencing phase of a Graves Act case). We do not now pass on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Finally, we address the interesting and troublesome issue stemming from Robinson\u2019s claim of entitlement to a new trial because Gorman, whose Fifth Amendment rights made him unavailable to Robinson as a witness at their joint trial, possessed evidence exculpating Robinson. An innocent defendant may be unable to learn the true facts and, in any event, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>present a defense through a culpable co-defendant who cannot be compelled to give evidence before or during their joint trial. Robinson asserts that his motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence would cure the violation of his right to due process and the deprivation of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The standard for granting a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is clearly set forth in <em>State v. Carter, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>300, 314, 426 <em>A.</em>2d 501 (1981). The new evidence must be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">(1) material to the issue and not merely cumulative or impeaching or contradictory; (2) discovered since the trial and not discoverable by reasonable diligence beforehand; and (3) of the sort that would probably change the jury\u2019s verdict if a new trial were granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Gorman testified at the new trial motion that he committed the armed robbery on January 9, 1987 with Denise Bugyi and Andrew Bell. He indicated that he \u201cknew Andrew Bell from doing drugs with him\u201d and knew that Bell \u201chad participated in robberies\u201d when asking him to participate. Gorman met Bugyi, who had been dating his nephew, through his girlfriend at a Christmas party. She and the girlfriend wanted Gorman to \u201ccop cocaine for them\u201d and he made arrangements with Robinson to make a purchase. Robinson thereafter \u201cdelivered the package\u201d which \u201cturned out to be baking soda.\u201d Bugyi became \u201c[vjery angry\u201d because she wanted to sell it to pay for her car. She \u201cbelieved that [Gorman] and Robinson colluded to steal [her] money\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">According to Gorman, Bugyi and Rouse returned from a trip to Indiana around Christmas time 1986, and Bugyi was still in need of money. Gorman told her that he would try to \u201cfigure out a way to get you the car payment money\u201d and thereafter planned the robbery of Consumer Electronics.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Gorman further testified that the composite sketch drawn by the police was \u201csimilar\u201d to Andrew Bell\u2019s appearance, that Bugyi and he dropped Bell off at the bank and later picked him up at the pizza parlor. Gorman stated that Robinson \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>participate in the robbery and was testifying at the motion because he wanted \u201cto clear my conscience because Jules didn\u2019t participate in this\u201d. He indicated that he did not \u201ccome forward prior to trial\u201d with this information because he was \u201cnever offered a reasonable deal to come forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Gorman also testified that Bugyi had never seen or met Andrew Bell before the night of the robbery, knew Robinson only by name, and to his \u201crecollection\u201d, had never seen him other than on \u201cthat one day down when we copped the cocaine\u201d. He further testified that he did not see Bell since the night of the crime, but that they spoke on the phone concerning whether the bag was found. Gorman concluded his direct testimony by stating that, \u201c[e]xcept for going to Jules, to look for Jules or picking up Jules\u201d, Bugyi\u2019s testimony was essentially accurate as to the details of what happened on the evening in question. He suggested that Bugyi had merely implicated Robinson with respect to the role played by Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">On cross examination, Gorman admitted that he and Robinson were incarcerated together for about eighteen months and that they talked about the trial. He acknowledged that he had been convicted of \u201cat least 11 armed robberies.\u201d He was asked and testified that he declined to take a polygraph about the case and could provide no phone number or address for Bell other than what he told police, that Bell lived \u201ceither [in] Vineland or Jersey City.\u201d Gorman indicated that he never told authorities that Bell was involved and that Robinson wasn\u2019t because he \u201cpleaded the Fifth Amendment through the entire time I was arrested through my trial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In resisting the motion for a new trial, the prosecutor contended that Robinson did not show \u201cdue diligence\u201d because he had not requested either a severance before trial (in order to obtain Gorman\u2019s testimony at Robinson\u2019s trial) and did not \u201crequest that the prosecutor provide use immunity\u201d to Gorman. She contended that \u201chad the defendant merely requested use immunity or had the defendant merely requested a severance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>then there would be some evidence of diligence on behalf of the defendant.\u201d She also suggested that the new trial motion had to be denied because Gorman\u2019s testimony did not \u201crise to the level of newly discovered evidence because ... there is no indication that the jury\u2019s verdict would probably be different,\u201d given Gorman\u2019s lack of credibility. In essence, she stated \u201cI think that his testimony is unbelievable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Gorman\u2019s trial counsel also testified on the motion for a new trial. He indicated that there was no communication between himself and Robinson\u2019s counsel concerning a severance and that he never indicated to Robinson\u2019s counsel that Gorman was involved in the robbery. According to Gorman\u2019s counsel</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aje\">... I indicated the opposite ... It was my feeling that Mr. Gorman was innocent of the charges against him. Based on the fact that it was just a co-defendant\u2019s statement. There was no other corroboration. It was my opinion that Mr. Gorman was not involved in this robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Denise Bugyi testified for the State at the hearing. She denied ever having any drug transaction with Robinson and denied selling drugs to make any type of car payment or loan payment. She indicated that the first time she met Robinson was \u201c[t]he night of the robbery\u201d and that her trial testimony was truthful. She stated that she had gone to Camden to buy cocaine but that \u201c[tjhere was usually lots of people with us\u201d and that the purchase was arranged by Gorman. She could not remember, although it was possible, that she saw Gorman purchase cocaine from Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The trial judge found that two of the requirements for a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence were met. He found that Gorman\u2019s testimony was material, concluding that \u201c[i]f someone believable were to say to the jury that a guy named Bell was there and Jules Robinson was not, that goes to the issue of who was there and who committed a crime.\u201d He also concluded that \u201cthere is no indication here that Jules Robinson had any information that James Gorman had been involved in the offense as he has now\u201d and that there is no evidence \u201cthat Robinson knew that Gorman was in on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>crime\u201d before the trial. He further stated that he could not \u201cfault counsel for not asking for a severance because it would not necessarily be a reasonably diligent thing to do under the circumstances,\u201d particularly because only the prosecutor could ask for immunity, citing <em>United States v. Rocco, </em>587 F.2d 144 (3rd Cir.1978). He indicated that even if there was a basis for the grant of immunity there was \u201cnothing on the record to show that Robinson knew that Gorman was in the crime.\u201d Hence, the judge concluded that the information was not previously discoverable by reasonable diligence. However, he denied the motion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">[b]ecause I have had the opportunity now to see and hear James Gorman. And the fact that part of a story is possibly true does not make the whole story true. His whole story can work even if he had done drug dealings with Jules Robinson down in Camden. Even if he had done drug deals with Andrew Bell. However, this is one of the few opportunities in a jury trial or in any part of a jury proceeding when the court has to make credibility findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The judge indicated that Gorman\u2019s answers to the questions concerning Robinson\u2019s participation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">lack[ed] sincerity, they lack credibility, they lack the ring of truth and I don\u2019t believe them. And of course, my conclusion as to his credibility is not the ultimate answer in the ease, but I need to make a weighing here of whether, if the Robinson case were replayed and if Gorman were to take the stand\u2014he will have been sentenced [by me] at that time\u2014 ... [a]nd if he were to tell the same story and his long serious record would come out, whether his saying what he said is likely to change the result in this case, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s been shown that this new evidence would probably produce an acquittal for Robinson. I have no way of absolutely knowing. Because one never knows what a jury is going to do. But I look at these facts as objectively as I can. And as I say that, I realize and I want the record to be clear, that this was not the strongest case in the world against Robinson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">I realize that Middleton was not able to make an in-court identification. That when he picked out Robinson\u2019s pictures from an array which had some weaknesses to it, the best he could say is I thought that, with the high probability, that was him. He did not make an in-court identification ... [b]ut we had someone from the pizza shop who was of some help in saying that Robinson looked like the man who came in at that point in time that would have been after the time of the crime that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">We had the testimony of Bugyi before the jury ... [a]nd the jury knew that she had a record ... The jury knows what kind of a sweet deal she got and how anxious she probably was and is to please the State and help them to make their case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>So they had all of this before them. They had a chance to evaluate her credibility. And even with that and with Denise Bugyi clay feet and all, warts and all, I did not believe that if she were balanced against James Gorman and his story and his record and his credibility, and assuming that he spoke with the same degree of sincerity or lack of it that he did here, I again say I do not believe that this would probably produce an acquittal. And I do not believe that there has been a' manifest denial of justice under the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">I believe that just as a recanting witness, just as with a co-defendant who attempts to exonerate co-defendants after they have been sentenced, I think the court is entitled to view these statements skeptically and critically and not gullibly and wide eyed; I believe that Mr. Gorman\u2019s story here today is ... a post-conviction fabrication ... [t]he fact that a man\u2019s been convicted of some theft crimes and armed robberies does not make everything that he says incredible. It\u2019s just that having heard what he said in this case, I don\u2019t believe him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We cannot fault Robinson for not moving to sever, particularly under these circumstances where counsel had no reason to believe that Gorman was involved in the criminal event. He may have concluded at the time that Gorman had no relevant knowledge, and there is no indication that Gorman consented to a pretrial interview by Robinson\u2019s counsel. In any event, a severance motion would have undoubtedly failed in light of the general preference to try co-defendants jointly and without indication that Gorman possessed exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 604-609, 573 <em>A.</em>2d 886 (1990); <em>State v. Morant, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 133, 574 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>502 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>323, 604 A.2d 598 (1990). Thus, in the absence of knowledge before trial that a co-defendant possesses evidence exculpatory to the defendant, a severance motion should not generally be a prerequisite for a successful motion for a new trial based on testimony from a co-defendant who agrees to waive his Fifth Amendment rights after verdict or to testify whenever rights are extinguished by final disposition of the case. Accordingly, we agree with the trial judge that the motion for new trial based upon the post-verdict statement of the jointly tried co-defendant could not be rejected because Robinson failed to move for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> The traditional criteria for evaluating motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence must be examined liberally when new information comes from a co-defendant who is unavailable, as a matter of law, at the time of trial. Under existing New Jersey law a defendant has no right to call a witness before the jury solely to have the witness invoke his privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to testify. <em>Cf. State v. Jamison, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>363, 374-375, 316 A.2d 439 (1974); <em>State v. Crews, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 232, 505 A.2d 198 (App.Div.1986), <em>affd o.b. </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>498, 523 A.2d 149 (1987); <em>State v. Cito, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 300-301, 517 A.2d 174 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>141, 526 A.2d 203 (1987); <em>State v. Nunez, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 132, 506 A.2d 1295 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Karlein, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 456, 484 A.2d 1355 (Law Div.1984). <em>See also Evid.R. </em>39. In any event, no one contends that a defendant may call a co-defendant to the stand during a joint trial. It is acknowledged that both the Fifth Amendment and our Rules of Evidence would preclude that.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">There may be constitutional issues and questions of fundamental fairness projected by the inability of a defendant in certain circumstances to call a witness for purposes of asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege before the jury and obtaining a beneficial inference. This is particularly true because, at present, only the State, and not the defendant, can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>immunize a witness. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-17.3. Robinson never attempted to call Gorman to the stand, and a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence premised on the inability to call a co-defendant to the stand is not the proper vehicle to examine that issue or the question of whether a defendant can ever seek to immunize a witness. Certainly it could never be done with respect to a co-defendant in a joint trial. In any event, the fact remains that because of the current status of New Jersey law and the fact that only the State can request immunity for a witness, we must reject the State\u2019s contention that Robinson\u2019s failure to seek immunity for Gorman precludes his motion for a new trial due to the absence of \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rocco, supra, </em>587 F.2d at 146-148; <em>but see State v. Redford, </em>248 <em>Kan. </em>130, 804 P.2d 983 (1991). Hence, Robinson satisfied the \u201cdue diligence\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">As the trial judge also noted, information from someone admittedly involved in a criminal transaction must generally be deemed more than \u201cmerely cumulative, impeaching or contradictory\u201d, although that may depend on the quality and quantity of the proofs at trial. In most instances, a defendant\u2019s testimony about the involvement of a co-defendant in a given transaction must be deemed \u201cmaterial to the issue\u201d, and the availability of the co-defendant to testify upon waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights following verdict, or upon final disposition of his case (and we do not decide when that occurs for these purposes), <em>see e.g., State v. Craig, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 257 <em>A.</em>2d 737 (App.Div.1969), <em>certif. denied, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>169, 259 A.2d 919 (1969), must be deemed \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d Thus, we agree with the trial judge that Gorman\u2019s testimony was \u201cmaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">But even though credibility determinations are generally for the fact-finder, a mere exculpatory statement of a co-defendant cannot by itself give rise to a new trial if that statement is clearly false or merely designed to give an accom-</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>plice a second chance for acquittal. While the motion judge upon receipt of a statement from a co-defendant jointly tried with the moving party should almost always grant an evidentiary hearing and treat the application most seriously, here the trial judge conducted such a hearing at which Gorman testified and was cross examined. At that hearing, the judge also heard from Gorman\u2019s counsel and Bugyi, the principal witness at the trial. The judge thereafter concluded that Gorman\u2019s story was clearly manufactured and did not have the minimum ring of truth sufficient to have the credibility issue presented to the jury. Given the proofs presented on the motion, the absence of any ability whatsoever to detail any specifics about Andrew Bell, and the trial judge\u2019s specific and detailed findings of fact based upon his assessment of credibility, we cannot conclude that the trial judge erred in denying the motion for a new trial. <em>See e.g. Hill v. Lockhart, </em>927 <em>F.2d </em>340, 345-46 (8th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Hendrix, </em>752 <em>F.2d </em>1226, 1234 (7th Cir.1985), <em>cert. den. </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2032, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>314; <em>United States v.

Sullivan, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>209, 232-33, 203 A.2d 177 (1964) (recantation of trial testimony). \u201cThis is especially true since [Gorman] as a sentenced co-defendant, had nothing to lose by exonerating [Robinson] and his testimony is therefore \u2018inherently suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.
