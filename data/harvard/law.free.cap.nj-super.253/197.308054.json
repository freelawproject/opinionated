A mandatory $1,000 D.E.D.R. penalty, $50.00 lab fee and $30.00 V.C.C.B. penalty were also imposed, and defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">On this appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">POINT I THE \u201cWITHIN 1,000 FEET OF ANY SCHOOL PROPERTY\u201d PROVISION OF <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 VIOLATES BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS FACIALLY AND AS APPLIED <em>(U.S. CONST. </em>AMEND.

The \u201cWithin 1,000 Feet of School Property\u201d Provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 Is Unconstitutionally Vague On Its Face And As Applied Herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">B.

Defendant Has Been Denied His Right To Equal Protection Of The Law <em>(U.S. Const. </em>Amend. XIV and <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947) Art.

CONST </em>(1947) ART. I, PAR. 12). (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We note that defendant expressly waived his right of appeal at the time of plea. Without addressing the impact of that fact in the absence of the State\u2019s attempt to annul the plea, <em>see R. </em>3:9-3(d), we summarily reject the points asserted in Points I and IV. <em>See e.g. State v. Gonzalez, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 95-96, 99, 574 A.2d 487 (App.Div.1990), rev. on appeal as to sentence, 123 <em>N.J. </em>462, 588 A.2d 816 (1991), and <em>certif. denied </em>on other issues, 122 <em>N.J. </em>400, 585 A.2d 399 (1990); <em>State v. Todd, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 570 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1990); <em>State v. Anaya, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 39-40, 568 A.2d 1208 (App.Div.1990); <em>State v. Ogar, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>459, 551 A.2d 1037 (App.Div.1989); <em>State in Interest of L.M., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 550 A.2d 1252 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>485, 555 A.2d 609 (1989), rejecting the contentions raised in these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">We address the remaining points because they relate to sentencing, notwithstanding the specifics of the plea agreement. <em>See and compare, e.g., State v. Robinson, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 498, 540 A.2d 1313 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">In Point II of defendant\u2019s brief, defendant argues that \u201cthe automatic imposition of a period of parole ineligibility due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>to defendant\u2019s failure to appear in court for sentencing is illegal and violative of [the] Code of Criminal Justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">At the time of the plea the assistant prosecutor explained that the State recommended a three year probationary sentence with 364 days to be served in the county jail as a condition of probation with mandatory fines and penalties and defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal. The assistant prosecutor thereafter said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">The only other thing that makes this a little different, Judge, is that this plea agreement is contingent on no prior indictable convictions and the defendant has requested OR bail pending sentence. The State has agreed to give him that with the understanding that we\u2019re making this recommendation only for the purposes of this plea, but if he doesn\u2019t show up for the sentencing his guilty plea will stand and there would be no recommendation as to sentence and also if he incurs a subsequent violation of probation. This recommendation\u2019s only for this plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Defendant indicated to the court that he understood the maximum penalty for the offense was five years imprisonment with a mandatory three year ineligibility term. The transcript also shows the following colloquy by the court and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATW\">Q. All right. Now, do you understand, Mr. Santiago, that if you don\u2019t show up on the day for sentencing that your guilty plea today will stand, you can\u2019t change that, but the sentence recommendation of the State, 364 days in the county jail and probation, that no longer applies to you? Do you understand that if you don\u2019t show up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">A. Yeah, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">Q. And what does it mean? What can I give you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">A. I believe it\u2019s three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">Q. Five, serve three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">A. Oh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">Q. Right? Three years before you\u2019re eligible for parole. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-15\">A. Um-hum. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">The transcript further reflects that the plea agreement was not that if defendant did not appear the court would have the discretion to impose any sentence (with a continuing waiver of a mandatory ineligibility term). Rather, the agreement was that if defendant did not appear for sentencing the judge could impose any lawful sentence, which would require a three year period of parole ineligibility under the statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Defendant argues that the negotiated plea was illegal. He notes, and properly so, that in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 502 A.2d 46 (App.Div.1985), we held that defendant could not be given an enhanced sentence merely because he did not appear for sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><em>Wilson </em>is distinguishable because it did not involve <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-7 or 2C:35-12 which would literally make the sentence lawful, either because of the agreement for a mandatory sentence if defendant did not appear, or because a mandatory sentence was required as no agreement regarding sentence survived the non-appearance. <em>Cf. State v. Wearing, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 591 A.2d 1350 (App.Div.1991); <em>but see State v. Vasquez, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 595 A.2d 520 (App.Div.1991). A legal sentence is one authorized by the Legislature, and the only authorized sentence for a 2C:35-7 violation requires the mandatory ineligibility term\u2014except and only to the extent the prosecutor recommends otherwise under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-12 and the judge accepts the recommendation. <em>See State v. Todd, supra. See also State v. Wearing, supra; compare State v. Vasquez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We are satisfied that the decision in this case is controlled by the principal holding in our recent decision in <em>State v. Shaw, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 601 A.2d 709 (App.Div.1991). <em>Shaw </em>involved a plea agreement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-12 conditioned on defendant\u2019s timely appearance for sentence and held \u201cthat a prosecutor may not condition a \u00a7 12 plea agreement on defendant\u2019s appearance at sentencing.\u201d 253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 195, 601 A.2d 709. The <em>Shaw </em>court exercised its original jurisdiction and imposed a sentence consistent with the original recommendation embodied in the plea agreement. <em>See </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 195, 601 A.2d 709. <em>See also State v. Martines, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>404, 599 A.2d 1289 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>We respectfully disagree with that remedy. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-12, that sentence could be imposed only upon the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, and his recommendation did not survive the non-appearance. <em>See State v. Wearing; compare State v. Vasquez, supra. </em>We therefore believe that the proper remedy is to permit the parties to renegotiate the plea agreement or for the defendant to withdraw the plea which should not have been initially accepted. <em>Cfi State v. Kovach, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>476, 453 <em>A.</em>2d 521 (1982). We are satisfied that a defendant cannot obtain the benefit of his bargain while dishonoring his commitment leading to the recommendation. <em>Cf. State v. Wearing, supra</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">If the prosecutor cannot \u201ccondition a \u00a7 12 plea agreement on defendant\u2019s appearance at sentencing,\u201d as held in <em>Shaw, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 195, 601 A.2d 709, the remedy must be addressed to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion at which time defendant may renegotiate or withdraw his plea. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The <em>Wilson </em>court amended the sentence and did not give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\">If <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-12 is unconstitutional, as suggested by Judge Shebell in his <em>Shaw </em>concurrence, the remedy might require imposition of the mandatory sentence under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7, not imposition of the sentence negotiated under the unconstitutional statute. <em>But see State v. Shaw, supra, </em>(Shebell, J.A.D., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
