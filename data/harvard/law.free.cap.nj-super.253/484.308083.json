The settlement was part of an approval of settlement of the claim of Mary Hetherington (Mary) as administratrix of employee John Hetherington (John). The Compensation Judge approved a $40,000 settlement from which $20,000 was to be paid to Hanover in full satisfaction of its PIP lien of $30,104.89. The administratrix consented to the settlement; Hanover did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation claim arose from injuries sustained by John in an automobile accident. At the time, he was superintendent for the Briarwood Coachlight Condominium Association. Hanover alleges that just prior to the accident, John and several other co-workers went to pick up supplies for the condominium. On the way they stopped at a motorcycle store to get parts for petitioner\u2019s motorcycle. While there, John was paged on his beeper and was told a drain at the condominium was overflowing. The accident occurred while he was on his way back to the condominium. He sustained $30,104.89 medicals which was paid by Hanover, his auto carrier, under PIP. Petitioner\u2019s widow and administratrix (Mary) sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits on his behalf. Hanover intervened, seeking reimbursement of the medicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Briarwood took the position, however, that John was not in its employ at the time of the accident. It offered to settle by paying $25,000 to Mary and $15,000 to Hanover. The offer was an all-or-nothing deal. Mary wanted to settle. Hanover, while not opposing a settlement with her as to the estate\u2019s compensation claim, took the position it would not settle its statutory reimbursement right for less than the full reimbursement. The Compensation Judge forced a \u201csettlement\u201d of $20,000 for each, reasoning that Hanover\u2019s interest was derivative only and that Mary was the real party in interest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Where, as here, there is available to an injured party both PIP benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the initial source of recovery is from the PIP carrier which is required to pay all benefits when due. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5, 6; <em>Olivero by Olivero v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 193, 488 A.2d 1071 (App.Div.1985). The PIP carrier, however, is not left without a remedy for recovering PIP payments where there is a compensable work-related accident. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-6, as amended in 1983, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">... If an insurer has paid those benefits [benefits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 and 10] and the insured is entitled to, but has failed to apply for, workers\u2019 compensation benefits or employees\u2019 temporary disability benefits, the insurer may immediately apply to the provider of workers\u2019 compensation benefits or of employees\u2019 temporary disability benefits for a reimbursement of any section 4 and section 10 benefits it has paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Similarly recognizing the right of reimbursement a PIP carrier has against the compensation employer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-15.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">Whenever the expenses of medical, surgical or hospital services, to which the petitioner would be entitled to reimbursement if such petitioner had paid the same as provided in section 34:15-15 of the Revised Statutes, shall have been paid by any insurance company or other organization by virtue of any insurance policy, contract or agreement ... the deputy directors or referees of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation are authorized to incorporate in any award, order or approval of settlement, an order requiring the employer or his insurance carrier to reimburse such <em>insurance company ... in the amount of </em>such medical, surgical or hospital services so paid on behalf of such petitioner. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">A PIP carrier, then, possesses a statutory right of reimbursement for the full amount of PIP payments made to an insured where the accident and injuries therefrom are found to be compensable. In <em>Solimano v. Consolidated Mutual Ins. Co., </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 369 A.2d 1003 (Law Div.1977), the PIP carrier was required to pay PIP payments notwithstanding the claim the insured\u2019s injuries were compensable under workers\u2019 compensation. However, premised upon to the statutory right of reimbursement from the employer, it also was \u201c... permitted to initiate, in its own name, a petition in workmen\u2019s compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>sation to determine what amount, if any, is collectible from the \u2018collateral source,\u2019 i.e., the compensation carrier.\u201d 146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 401, 369 A.2d 1003. <em>Accord, Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Para Mfg. Co., </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 535-36, 424 A.2d 423 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In <em>Solimano </em>and <em>Aetna, </em>the employee had not filed a petition, thus the carrier had the right to directly file one in its own name. But the existence or non-existence of a claim petition is not dispositive of the ability of the carrier to assert its own statutory right to reimbursement within the context of a worker\u2019s compensation proceeding. Thus, in <em>Olivero by Olivero v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 200, 488 A.2d 1071, we said: \u201c[s]ince the PIP carrier has the right to pursue the remedies of the employee in the Division or [sic] Workers\u2019 Compensation in default of a petition by an employee, <em>Aetna, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537, 424 A.2d 423 then NJM may intervene in the pending workers\u2019 compensation proceedings in order to <em>protect its interest to see that the full measure of benefits are awarded </em>in those proceedings in order to minimize like benefits which may be payable under the No-Fault Act____\u201d (citations omitted; emphasis added). <em>Cf Selective Ins. Co. v. Jones, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>641, 645, 583 A.2d 382 (App.Div.1990); <em>Lefkin v. Venturing </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 13, 550 A.2d 985 (App.Div.1988). <em>See also Speiser v. Harleysville Ins. Co., </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>507, 510, 568 A.2d 543 (App.Div.), <em>certif denied </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>647, 583 A.2d 337 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Here that is precisely what Hanover has done. It intervened in the pending workers\u2019 compensation action to protect its interest in receiving full reimbursement of the PIP benefits it has paid. Its right of reimbursement is a direct right against the employer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-6; it is not simply a lien against a compensation award to the petitioner. To be sure, it is dependent upon and, thus, derivative of the compensability of the worker\u2019s injuries. But as the Legislature has fashioned it, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>a remedy the carrier may pursue independently in the worker\u2019s compensation court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In forcing Hanover here to accept the settlement, the judge relied upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-20. That statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">In case of a dispute over or failure to agree upon a claim for compensation between employer and employee, or the dependents of the employee, either party may submit the claim ... to the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation____ when it shall appear that the issue or issues involve the question of jurisdiction, liability, causal relationship or dependency of the petitioner ... and the petitioner and the respondent are desirous of entering into a lump-sum settlement of the controversy, a judge of compensation may with the consent of the parties, after considering the testimony of the petitioner and other witnesses, together with any stipulation of the parties, and after such judge of compensation has determined that such settlement is fair and just under all the circumstances, enter \u201can order approving settlement.\u201d Such settlement, when so approved ... shall have the force and effect of a dismissal of the claim petition and shall be final and conclusive upon the employee and the employee\u2019s dependents, and shall be a complete surrender of any right to compensation or other benefits arising out of such claim under the statute____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Thus, pursuant to this statute, a compensation judge may, upon consent of the parties, approve a settlement. But we note that not only does this statute not refer to the PIP carrier\u2019s separate statutory right of reimbursement, but it plainly does not authorize a settlement without consent. We do not interpret the reference in the statute to consent by the petitioner and respondent and omission of reference to consent by the PIP carrier, as in anyway indicating legislative intent to confer upon either petitioner, the employer, or the judge the authority to force a settlement of the PIP carrier\u2019s claim. Indeed, we note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-15.1 specifically authorizes incorporation in an approval of settlement of \u201can order requiring the employer or his insurance carrier to reimburse\u201d an insurance company that has paid compensable medical expenses. It does not authorize, at least without the carrier\u2019s consent, <em>partial </em>reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">We acknowledge the judge\u2019s policy concerns where a petitioner may, for a variety of reasons, wish to settle, but where a carrier may not, and where the judge may determine the settlement to be in the best interests of the petitioner. In those instances, a separate settlement with the petitioner could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>be effectuated with the carrier left to pursue its claim for full reimbursement. But we think, under the present Legislative scheme, it is beyond the scope of the authority of a compensation judge to force a carrier to accept a settlement where, as here, the employer refuses to settle only with the petitioner, without settlement of the carrier\u2019s claim, notwithstanding any inequities the judge may perceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
