The two simple possession convictions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>merged into the convictions with intent to distribute. Since there were two events which gave rise to these convictions, Judge Rodriguez sentenced defendant to concurrent four-year terms for the first possession with intent to distribute and distribution, and to a consecutive seven-year term for the second possession of a larger amount of cocaine found when the police raided the premises. The principal point on this appeal is the right of the State to comment in summation upon defendant\u2019s demeanor during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Defendant was initially identified by an undercover officer who purchased cocaine from her, and on a later date was apprehended after a raid on premises where she was found in possession of 25.79 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">On this appeal defendant raises three points. He first claims that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s comments made in summation had the clear capacity to deprive defendant of a fair trial. (Partially raised below).\u201d Defendant then asserts additional points, not raised below, challenging the mandatory Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction (DEDR) penalties of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15. Finally, defendant claims that the trial judge imposed an excessive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Defendant challenges the prosecutor\u2019s summation in two respects. First, she disputes the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the fact that although defendant did not take the stand, the defendant could be seen crying during the trial. The prosecutor remarked that the jury should speculate whether she was also crying when she sold the cocaine to the undercover officer. Defendant claims that this comment infringed upon her right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">When defendant cried, she may have, in the words of <em>State v. Fioravanti, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>109, 120-121, 215 A.2d 16 (1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>919, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1365, 16 L.Ed.2d 440 (1966), engaged in \u201ctestimonial behavior before the jury,\u201d even if she did not take the stand. Her actions therefore could properly be the subject of fair comment. <em>Id. </em>at 121, 215 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>We have little direct authority in New Jersey either supporting or prohibiting comment by the State on a defendant\u2019s behavior during trial. In <em>State v. Capano, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 385, 311 A.2d 191 (App.Div.1973), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>500, 317 A.2d 712 (1974), we noted that comment on defendant\u2019s \u201cobstreperous behavior\u201d was not error. However, a prosecutor may not comment upon the <em>failure </em>of a defendant to act in a particular way during a trial. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>263, 295-296, 576 A.2d 834 (1990) (failure to make eye contact with jurors during a trial); <em>State v. Sims, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 176, 355 A.2d 695 (App.Div.1976) (improper prosecutor\u2019s comment that officer walked up to defendants, pointed them out and looked at them, but defendants did not return his stare or say he was lying). Also, defendant\u2019s crying here falls far short of the full series of unsworn statements made by the defendant who acted as his own attorney in a closing statement to the jury in <em>State v. Bontempo, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>220, 240-242, 406 A.2d 203 (Law Div.1979). There on a post-conviction relief application Judge Baime held that the prosecutor had properly been permitted to comment on defendant\u2019s unsworn remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Out-of-state authority is split concerning comments on a defendant\u2019s demeanor during trial. . Some cases have held that a defendant\u2019s display of emotion may be the subject of comment, or at least that comment thereon is not reversible error. <em>See State v. Norwood, </em>161 Wis.2d 676, 468 <em>N.W.2d </em>741, 742-743 (Ct.App.1991) (defendant\u2019s laughter during the testimony of the rape victim\u2019s mother was noted in her testimony and later commented upon in the State\u2019s summation; held not to be error since the mother\u2019s testimony supplied evidence of the laughter, and no general rule concerning comment on a defendant\u2019s demeanor need be adopted); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>65 <em>Md.App. </em>498, 501 A.2d 111, 114-115 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 <em>Md. </em>599, 505 A.2d 856 (1986) (because defendant testified, demeanor evidence was not so improper as to warrant reversal); <em>Black v. State, </em>402 So.2d 1128, 1132-1133 (Ala.Ct.App.1981) (defendant who had alleged an insanity defense which prevented her from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>talking and robbed her of all personality was observed during breaks talking to her family, walking around and acting normally; the State noted this behavior in summation, and the court stated that \u201c[t]he <em>conduct of the accused </em>or <em>the accused\u2019s demeanor </em>during the trial is a proper subject of comment.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Frankoviglia v. Camp, </em>394 <em>F.Supp. </em>1293, 1295-1296 (E.D.Mo.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>915, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1115, 47 L.Ed.2d 320 (1976) (prosecutor requested that the jury compare defendant\u2019s crying during his attorney\u2019s plea for his life with the lack of emotion during testimony of the details of the murder; held to be at most harmless error); <em>cf. Lesko v. Lehman, </em>925 A.2d 1527, 1544, 1554 (3rd Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>273, 116 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>226 (1991) (not specifically deciding whether the prosecutor\u2019s statements violated defendant\u2019s right not to testify or were \u201csimply an appropriate reference to [defendant\u2019s] demeanor at trial\u201d); <em>and cf. </em>the separate issue of the probative value of an accused\u2019s demeanor in court where sanity is in issue, <em>Riggins v. State, </em>107 <em>Nev. </em>178, 808 A.2d 535, 537 (1991), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>49, 116 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>27 (1991) (\u201cOther states that have considered this question all agree that the accused\u2019s demeanor has probative value where his sanity is in issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Contrary authority includes <em>United States v. Schuler, </em>813 A.2d 978, 979-982 (9th Cir.1987) (in a two-to-one decision with a strong dissent, the majority held that government may not comment on a defendant\u2019s laughter during trial when the defendant has not testified, since defendant\u2019s demeanor is not a proper subject for comment under the Fifth Amendment); <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>678 A.2d 1208, 1209-1210 (4th Cir. 1982) (in a two-to-one decision, the majority held that comments upon defendant\u2019s unsworn actions of pointing to pictures of the bank robbery and explaining matters to his lawyer violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and that a non-testifying defendant\u2019s demeanor in court may not be evidential nor properly the subject of comment; dissent accepted the trial judge\u2019s curative instruction); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>489 A.2d 1181, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>1186 (D.C.Cir.1973) (prosecutor may not \u201ccomment on the character of the accused as evidenced by his courtroom behavior;\u201d defendant found portions of his trial for armed robbery and assault humorous, and other parts angered him to the point of shouting out, requiring his removal from the courtroom).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Faced with such a balance of conflicting cases, it is difficult to discern the thread of a common rule. We can, however, reach what appears to us to be a reasonable guideline for trial judges. We determine that if a defendant attempts to inject his unsworn comments into a trial by word, gesture, display of emotion, or other demeanor, such an affirmative act may fairly be the subject of limited comment noting the fact of the behavior and that the comment or demeanor should not be considered by the jury. There may be no reference to defendant\u2019s failure to testify under oath. <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>609, 614, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1229, 1232, 14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>106; 109 (1965), <em>reh. denied, </em>381 <em>U.S. </em>957, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1797, 14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>730 (1965); <em>State v. Schumann, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>470, 477, 545 A.2d 168 (1988). The court should charge concerning the fact of defendant\u2019s assertions or demeanor, advising the jury that they should not be considered. Where, however, the asserted demeanor is clearly passive, there should be no comment. <em>State v. Johnson, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 295-296, 576 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Where the evidence of a display of emotion is active, the trial judge is faced with a difficult decision. Did the defendant cry or laugh voluntarily? Can the action correctly be interpreted as nervousness, sadness, fear, remorse, glee, irony or some private emotion? The better rule in such cases is to prohibit any comment by the State unless the demeanor evidence is clearly injected as an unsworn attempt to influence the jury. A pleading type of crying directed at the jury may be a clear appeal for compassion or sympathy, and might justify some appropriate comment. A tearful sob during adverse testimony may not justify any comment. - ' ' &lt;v_</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>An absolute rule of prohibition might hamstring the State in the presentation of its case, giving a defendant free access to the jury without comment by the State. There is a difference, however, between commenting upon the fact of the behavior (as in the case before us), and casting aspersions on the defendant\u2019s choice not to testify. We direct, therefore, that in each situation a record be made of the behavior or statement by defendant before the State\u2019s comment, <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 102 n. 1, 293 A.2d 176 (1972), and that the court pass upon the State\u2019s intended comment before it is made. <em>Cf. R. </em>1:7-3. In most cases a simple charge to the jury that it should disregard the defendant\u2019s comments or demeanor will suffice. Only in the clearest cases should the State be permitted some responsive comment, and then the comment must not infringe upon defendant\u2019s right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In this case there may be some question whether defendant\u2019s crying was a voluntary act, but we find that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were reasonably innocuous. They primarily pointed out the fearful or contrite behavior of defendant in the courtroom, and asked the jury to remember the testimony concerning the self-assured woman who sold drugs to the undercover investigator. The comment was akin to asking the jury to compare a defendant\u2019s physical appearance in court with that at the time of the crime. There was no expressed or implied comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify. We therefore see no intrusion on defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. Furthermore, even if permitting these comments were error, we find such error to be harmless. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Next, defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly commented on the undercover officer\u2019s testimony, and stated \u201cwhat does he have to gain, if anything, from telling you that he bought this cocaine from Luisa Rivera?\u201d This comment falls far short of the impermissible comment that if he lied, a police witness\u2019 \u201ccareer would be finished in a minute,\u201d criticized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>State v. West, </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 233, 367 A.2d 453 (App.Div. 1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>67, 372 A.2d 332 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Defendant also challenges the DEDR penalties. However, <em>State in the Interest of L.M., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 550 A.2d 1252 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>485, 555 A.2d 609 (1989), and the numerous cases that have followed it, have upheld this penalty. We concur with this precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Lastly, defendant objects to the 11-year sentence imposed upon her as a first offender. The judge stated that his basis was deterrence, and the fact that he did not want to give a message to the community that a noncustodial or short sentence was part of the cost of doing business. He imposed the presumptive terms, without parole disqualifiers, but made them consecutive because the offenses occurred at different times. We find no basis to interfere with the judge\u2019s discretionary determination. <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 401, 555 A.2d 559 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 364-365, 471 A.2d 370 (1984). We are still astounded that in a drug distribution case, a defendant can state that mitigating factors should have been that the conduct did not cause or threaten serious harm, or that defendant did not contemplate that such conduct would cause or threaten serious harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
