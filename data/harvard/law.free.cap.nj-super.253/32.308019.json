The apartment located in a high crime area known for drug activity had been the subject of two controlled buys. Defendant and a companion entered the apartment during the course of the warranted search. When they saw the police activity, they tried to leave but were stopped and brought inside. Both were patted down. The pat-down revealed nothing on defendant\u2019s companion and he was allowed to leave. Defendant was not read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Nevertheless, while defendant was being patted down, the police officer asked if he had anything on him. Defendant said he had some stuff for personal use and produced a dollar bill containing a small amount of cocaine. Defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Judge Wecker, in a carefully written opinion, ruled that the recovered cocaine must be suppressed, finding its discovery was the result of an illegal search. We affirm based upon the trial judge\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
