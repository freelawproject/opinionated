Although the State objected on the basis of prior threats of harm to the witness attributed to defendants some three years earlier, the trial court concluded the defendants\u2019 sixth amendment right to confrontation outweighed the State\u2019s need to protect its witness. We modify and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Defendants have been indicted for numerous offenses including loan sharking and gambling. The criminal activity is alleged to have occurred between May 1986 and June 1988. One of the State\u2019s primary witnesses is an individual whose real name is Charles Breitweiser. Following an arrest for sale of cocaine, Mr. Breitweiser agreed to cooperate with the State during its investigation of defendants in 1987 and did so over a 10-month time period. During this time, Mr. Breitweiser wore a \u201cbody mike\u201d and recorded several conversations with defendants arising from an alleged usurious loan of $2,500 defendants made to Mr. Breitweiser and their alleged attempts to extort repayment through threats of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>We have not been supplied with copies of transcripts of the conversations and the record does not reflect the language of the actual threats. We are aware the trial judge heard the threats at the time he listened to all the tapes during a <em>Driver</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing. And, although we do not have a verbatim version, the threats were thus characterized by the prosecutor during arguments before the trial court on defendants\u2019 application for disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that the threats which are on the tapes themselves are overwhelming\u2014I mean, they\u2019re not threats which would jump out at you, but they are threats____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">... you\u2019ll hear Mr. Driscoll <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Mr. Anagnos saying we\u2019U go to Connecticut, we\u2019ll look for you in Connecticut. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying to him on the tape. Now that is a threat because he isn\u2019t paying him their money----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">Mr. Anagnos was present with Mr. Driscoll when they told him\u2014Mr. Anagnos says to him I\u2019m holding him back right now and Driscoll says I\u2019m not going to let him hold me back, I\u2019m going to find you____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">I don\u2019t have a tape by Mr. Postorino threatening him, but the clear impact is Mr. Postorino\u2019s the one in charge of this____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">While Mr. Breitweiser expressed concern over his safety and his family\u2019s safety if he testified for the State, he declined protection pursuant to the federal Witness Protection Program, 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3521-3528. However, he requested and was given a new name and address, in addition to a new car and $2,500. For the last three years he has lived under his new name at the new location. His family has remained at their prior address. There is nothing in the record to support any determination that his family has in any way been threatened or harmed over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>last three years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aside from the State\u2019s representation that Mr. Breitweiser has no further arrest or conviction record under his new name, nothing is known about him during the last 3 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Shortly prior to trial, defendants made a Brady<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> request upon the prosecutor for, among other information, Mr. Breitweiser\u2019s current address. This request was refused based on the mistaken assumption Mr. Breitweiser was in the federal Witness Protection Program and because of the threats. However, a \u201crap sheet\u201d in addition to a written but unsigned agreement concerning Breitweiser\u2019s cooperation and benefits in return, were disclosed. Additionally, the State provided a representation by the prosecutor that there was no rap sheet under Mr. Breitweiser\u2019s new name.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Preliminarily, we note defendants\u2019 request for the current name and address of Mr. Breitweiser was initiated during pretrial discovery, albeit shortly before trial. In this respect, it has been cautioned that the sixth amendment right to confront witnesses is a <em>trial </em>right, and \u201cdoes not include the power to require the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>39, 53, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>989, 999, 94 L.Ed.2d 40, 54 (1987); <em>State v. Cusick, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 462, 530 A.2d 806 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>54, 532 A.2d 1118 (1987). Thus, defendants characterized their initial pretrial request as a <em>Brady </em>fourteenth amendment request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>R. </em>3:13-3(a)(7), subject to an appropriate protective order pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:13-3(d), however, does require pretrial disclosure of the name and address of witnesses. Moreover, the sixth amendment confrontation clause can encompass cross-examination to elicit such information during trial testimony of a witness. <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>129, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>748, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>956 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In <em>Smith, </em>the primary witness against defendant charged with drug offenses admitted during his testimony that the name he used was not his real name. Defendant then asked what his real name was. The prosecutor objected. The objection was sustained. In reversing defendant\u2019s conviction on that basis, the Supreme Court of the United States said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">In the present case there was not, to be sure, a complete denial of all right of cross-examination. But the petitioner was denied the right to ask the principal prosecution witness either his name or where he lived, although the witness admitted that the name he had first given was false. Yet when the credibility of a witness is at issue, the very starting point in \u201cexposing falsehood and bringing out the truth\u201d through cross-examination must necessarily be to ask the witness who he is and where he lives. The witness\u2019 name and address open countless avenues of in-court examination and out-of-court investigation. To forbid this most rudimentary inquiring at the threshold is effectively to emasculate the right of cross-examination itself. [390 <em>U.S. </em>at 181, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 750, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 959].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Further, quoting <em>Alford v. United States, </em>282 <em>U.S. </em>687, 688-689, 51 <em>S.Ct. </em>218, 219-20, 75 <em>L.Ed. </em>624, 626 (1931), the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">It is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop. Prejudice ensues from a denial of the opportunity to place a witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test, without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them____ To say that prejudice can be established only by showing that the cross-examination, if pursued, would necessarily have brought out facts tending to discredit the testimony in chief, is to deny a substantial right and withdraw one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial---- The question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201cwhere do you live?\u201d was not only an appropriate preliminary to the cross-examination of the witness, but on its face, without any such declaration of purpose as was made by counsel here, was an essential step in identifying the witness with his environment, to which cross-examination may always be directed.... [390 <em>U.S. </em>at 132, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 750, 19 L.Ed.2d at 959].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The constitutional right of confrontation, however, is not unlimited. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>673, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). See for example <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>15, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985) (admission of expert opinion in murder trial that victim\u2019s hairs found on cat leash, alleged to be the murder weapon, had been forcibly removed from her head when strangled did not deny defendant\u2019s confrontation rights even though expert could not recall the basis for the opinion); <em>State v. Crandall, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>649, 577 A.2d 483 (1990) (right of confrontation not violated by statute permitting sexual assault child victim to testify by closed circuit television); <em>State v. Boiardo, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>350, 416 A.2d 793 (1980) (nondisclosure of letters sent to a reporter by state\u2019s informant/witness, which could bear upon credibility, not violate defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights in a conspiracy trial where the information could be obtained through less intrusive means); <em>State v. Varona, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 577 A.2d 524 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>386, 585 A.2d 389 (1990) (nondisclosure of identity and address, and inability to confront during drug trial an informant, did not deny confrontation rights where informant\u2019s role was not substantial and defendant was able to fully cross-examine undercover investigator); <em>State v. Williams, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 571 A.2d 1358 (App.Div.1990) (right of confrontation not violated when, following in-camera proceeding, counsel was precluded from questioning police officer in a drug trial about the precise location of his surveillance site); <em>State v. Cusick, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452, 530 A.2d 806 (defendant\u2019s right to confront sexual assault child victim was not violated by nondisclosure, following in-camera review, of certain records of D.Y.F.S. and Authur Brisbane Child Treatment Center).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Specific limitations upon disclosure of the name and address of witnesses have, under certain circumstances, been upheld, notwithstanding <em>Smith v. Illinois. State v. Florez, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 589 A.2d 1382 (Law Div.1991) (substantial concern over safety of prosecutor\u2019s paid, professional informant who set up defendant\u2019s drug buy justified refusal to disclose informant\u2019s real name and address where other information was known about him and deemed sufficient to permit full cross-examination). <em>See also Clark v. Ricketts, </em>886 <em>F.2d </em>1152 (9th Cir.1989) (right of confrontation did not require government\u2019s \u201cJohn Doe\u201d to testify as to current address where his real identity and arrest record was disclosed, where that information was enough to give defendant the \u201cavenues of in-court examination and out-of-court investigation\u201d denied in <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>where \u201cJohn Doe\u201d did give a general area of residence during trial testimony, and where in-camera proceeding revealed \u201cJohn Doe\u201d was a Drug Enforcement Agency informant against whose life threats had been made and who was expected to provided testimony in other pending cases); <em>U.S. v. Spector, </em>793 F.2d 932 (8th Cir.1986) <em>cert. denied </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>1031, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>876, 93 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>830 (1987) (right to confrontation did not require informant to testify as to his address where cross-examination revealed his current address and where \u201ca review of the wide-ranging cross-examination of [the informant] disclosed an extensive knowledge of his background\u201d such as to give defendant an \u201cample opportunity to identify this witness with his environment,\u201d 793 <em>F.2d </em>at 938). <em>Accord U.S. v. Chavez-Vernaza, </em>844 <em>F.2d </em>1368,1376-77 (9th Cir.1988); <em>U.S. v. Mesa, </em>660 <em>F.2d </em>1070, 1075 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In seeking a reversal here, the State relies on <em>State v. Florez, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 589 A.2d 1382. Drug charges against defendant in that case arose from a \u201creverse sting\u201d operation in which police posed as sellers of cocaine in an effort to arrest mid-level cocaine dealers. A confidential informant agreed to arrange a meeting between the \u201csellers\u201d and the buyers, one of whom was defendant. The State\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>permit the informant to testify at trial with a hood over his head to protect himself and his family was denied as a violation of defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. Defendant then moved to obtain the true name and address of the informant. Considering the issue within the context of informant privilege, <em>see State v. Milligan, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>373, 383-84, 365 A.2d 914 (1976)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, and noting the existence of threats by a major drug organization arising from the informant\u2019s extensive and longstanding activities for the prosecutor\u2019s office, the trial court said: \u201cwe must be careful not to seriously impair an important law enforcement investigative technique when disclosure would render its future use valueless and expose a confidential informant to reprisal and death.\u201d 248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 62, 589 <em>A.2d </em>1382. Weighing this danger against the need for disclosure, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">The suggestion that defendants need the true name and address of Cl to enable defendants\u2019 investigators to inquire into his background is without merit. This information is neither relevant nor admissible. His credibility can be impeached only by evidence of his prior conviction of crime (there are none) or, as exists here, by showing that he has a pending criminal charge and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>testimony could be tainted by his hope or expectation of a favorable recommendation from this prosecutor. Defendants already have this information. One does not have to be a \"rocket scientist\u201d to appreciate that knowledge of Cl\u2019s true name and address will be of only \u201cperipheral assistance\u201d to defendants and is more apt to frighten and terrorize Cl and his family into believing that their lives will be in jeopardy if Cl continues to cooperate with the State. [248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 63 [589 A.2d 1382],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We do not necessarily agree with all that was said by the trial court in <em>Florez. </em>In particular, we disagree that the real name and address of a state\u2019s witness is not relevant or admissible and that credibility can be impeached only by prior convictions or pending charges. <em>See Evid.R. </em>20, 22 and 47 and comments thereunder. We agree with the observations of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Illinois </em>as to the various ways a witness\u2019 name and address can impact upon credibility issues. However, we do not suggest any disagreement with the result in <em>Florez </em>in light of the nature of the threats and impact upon the continuing cooperation with law enforcement officials by a paid, professional informer disclosure presented in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Here, we are not dealing with an issue of informant privilege. While Mr. Breitweiser cooperated with the prosecutor in this particular investigation, it does not appear that he is a paid, professional confidential informant with a continuing law enforcement relationship and his real identity has been disclosed. Moreover, the nature of the alleged threats here, as far as we can discern them to be, is significantly less substantial than in <em>Florez. </em>Indeed, in this respect we note that the threats were limited in time and occurred almost three years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">On the other hand, as the State points out, defendants already possess material that can be used to impeach Mr. Breitweiser during cross-examination. They know, for instance, that he is an accused drug dealer, and they are aware of his prior criminal record. They also know that he was paid and provided a car in return for his cooperation and they are aware of the terms of his plea bargain with the State. Further, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>defendants are aware of Mr. Breitweiser\u2019s actual name and prior residence, they also have sufficient information to investigate his prior background. But nothing is known about him for at least three years except the State\u2019s representation that he has no further criminal record. We consider this to be a substantial time period during which his entire life style and environment may have been such as to impact significantly upon his credibility as a witness during defendants\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We think substantial deference should be given the trial judge in the context presented here. It was he who heard the actual alleged threats during the <em>Driver </em>hearing and thus was in the best position to assess the weight thereof. It is also the trial judge who is in the best position to weigh the impact disclosure or nondisclosure may have upon defendants\u2019 ability to effectively cross-examine Mr. Breitweiser. Under these circumstances we are reluctant to conclude an abuse of discretion occurred here. We do not sense that the trial court\u2019s weighing of the State\u2019s interests in protecting Mr. Breitweiser and defendants\u2019 right to confront that witness went wide of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">However, recognizing that what is involved is a delicate balancing test, we think the interests of the State and defendants can both be accommodated short of ordering disclosure of Mr. Breitweiser\u2019s current name and address in open court. We think the trial court should, upon Mr. Breitweiser\u2019s appearance, conduct an in-camera <em>Rule </em>8 proceeding to ascertain what testimony Mr. Breitweiser might offer as to his current background, short of his actual name and address. At the <em>Rule </em>8 proceeding, the State, through its own investigation, should provide the trial court with background information relating to Mr. Breitweiser over the last three years. We then would leave it to the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether defendants still required the witness\u2019 current name and address or whether the additional information disclosed during the <em>Rule </em>8 in-camera proceeding would provide defendants, along with the other information they already have, with sufficient opportunity for effective cross-examination. In this respect, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>caution that the right of confrontation only guarantees \u201can opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>at 20, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 292, 88 L.Ed.2d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In the event the trial court determines Mr. Breitweiser\u2019s name and current address should still be provided, such disclosure should be limited to defense counsel and their investigators pursuant to a protective order designed to prevent disclosure to defendants either directly or indirectly. In this way, the interests of the State and defendants can both best be accommodated.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We thus modify the order below and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\"> <em>State v.
