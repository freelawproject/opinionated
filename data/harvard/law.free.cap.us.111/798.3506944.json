They answered by that name, setting up their title to the property and their claim to the possession. The record shows a notice by Ebbinghaus, the appellee and com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>p'lainant below, to the trustees of the German Evangelical Lutheran Concordia Church. The final decree was against the \u201c trustees or authorities of the said Concordia Church, whether under the name of the trustees of the German Evangelical Concordia Church, or under the name of the trustees of the German Lutheran Evangelical Concordia Church.\u201d The trustees appealed, but in their appeal bond they described themselves as trustees of the German Lutheran Evangelical Concordia Church. The case was entered here promptly and docketed in the name of <em>John G. Killian et al., trusteesw of the German Lutheran Evangelical Concordia Church Appellants </em>v. <em>John W. Ebbinghaus, trustee. </em>Both parties appeared and argued the case, as presented by the record, on its merits. No objection was made t\u00f3 the form of the appeal. A mandate which was sent to the court below described the appeal as \u201ctaken by John G. Killian <em>et al., </em>trustees of the German Lutheran Evangelical Concordia Church.\u201d As in this there was error, the mandate has been recalled, and we now order that a new mandate issue describing the cause below as between John <em>W. </em>Ebbinghaus, trustee, complainant, and John G. Killian <em>et al., </em>trustees of the German Evangelical Concordia Church, and August Sievers <em>et al., </em>trustees of the Eirst Reformed church defendants (Equity, No. 5,688) and the appeal as \u201ctaken by John G.
