Ex. Doc. 2d Sess. 24th Congress, vol. 2, Doc. No. 62. The first-three instalments were deposited with the States, at the respective dates fixed in the act of Congress, but no part of the fourth has ever been delivered. The reason why the last instalment was not deposited on the 1st of October, 1837, is shown by the message of President Van Bur\u00e9n to Congress, at its extra session in September of that year. He said: \u201c There are now in the Treasury $9,367,214, directed by the act of the 23d of June, 1836, to be deposited with the States in October next. This sum, if so deposited, will be subject, under the law, to be recalled, if needed, to defray existing appropriations; and, as it is now evident that the Avhole, or the principal part of it, wTill be wanted for that purpose, it appears most proper that the deposits should be Avithheld.\u201d 5 Cong. Globe and Appendix, 8, -1st Sess. 25th Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The Secretary of the Treasury, in his report to Congress, at the same session, after alluding to the then disturbed condition of the finances, and to the fourth instalment payable in October, 1837, suggested that, in A\u00daeAV of the condition of the finances, \u201c and the importance of meeting with efficiency and good faith all the obligations of the government to the public creditors, it would be most judicious to apply the Avhole instalment, as fast as it is Avanted and can be collected, to the prompt discharge of these obligations; and that the last deposit Avith' \u25a0 the States, not being a debt, but a mere temporary disposal of a surplus, should be postposed until Congress, in some different State of the finances, Avhen such an available surplus may exist, shall see a manifest propriety and ability in completing the deposits, and shall giAre directions to that effect.\u201d Ex. Doc. and Reports of Committees, 1st Sess. 25th Congress, Doc. No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">By an act of Congress, approved October 2d, 1837, it was proA\u00daded \u201c that the transfer of the fourth instalment of deposit directed to be made Avith the States under the thirteenth section of the act of June 23d, 1836, be and the same is hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>postponed until the 1st day of January, 1839: <em>Provided, </em>That the three first instalments under the said act shall remain on deposit with the States until otherwise directed by Congress.\u201d <em>5 </em>Stat. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">But, on the 1st day of January, 1839, there was not, as the petition admits, in the treasury, a sufficient amount to meet that instalment after paying existing appropriations for the current expenses of the government. And by the third section of an act approved August 13th, 1841, the entire act of June 23d, 1836, excepting its thirteenth and fourteenth sections, was repealed. 5 Stat. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The petition concedes that at no time since January 1st, 1841, until Avithin the past few years, has there been in the treasury, a surplus of money large enough, after defraying existing charges imposed by Congress, to make the fourth instalment of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">It is, hoAvever, alleged that there is noAV in the treasury of the United States a sufficient sum of money, after defraying all the existing charges imposed by Congress upon the treasury, and not needed or wanted by the Secretary to meet appropriations by laAv, or to meet the interest accruing upon the public debt or to meet all the expenditures of the government, estimated or ascertained by him for the present fiscal year, to make the deposits of the fourth instalment with all of the States Avith Avhich said deposits were directed to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The present Secretary of the Treasury, having refused, upon the demand of Virginia, by its duly authorized agent, to use any part of the public moneys for the purpose of meeting that instalment, the present application has been made for a mandamus-compelling him to deposit with that State an amount equal to one-fourth of the said sum of $2,931,237.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">No case is made for a mandamus. If it Avas the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, in execution of the act of 1836, to make the fourth instalment of deposit on the day fixed in that act, Avhatever \u2022 may have been, on that day, the Avants of the public treasury, his failure to do so was legalized by the act' of October 2d, 1837, postponing that deposit until January 1st, 1839. Of the latter act the State could not complain, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>that of January 23d, 1836, created no debt or legal obligation upon the part of the government, but only made the States the depositaries, temporarily, of a portion of the public revenue not needed, as was then supposed, for the purposes of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">What was the duty of the Secretary, on January 1st, 1839, to which time, by the act of 1837, the deposit of the fourth instalment was postponed? It is conceded that there was not in the treasury, on January 1st, 1839, a sufficient amount, available and applicable to public purposes, after paying -necessary appropriations for the expenses of the government, to meet that instalment. He could not, therefore, do what he might then lawfully have done, had the treasury, on January 1st, 1839, been in the condition contemplated by Congress Avhen the act of 1837 was passed. The last direction given by the legislative department upon the subject of this instalment, is found in the latter act. No authority has been conferred upon the Secretary, by subsequent legislation, to use any surplus revenue accruing after January 1st, 1839, for the purpose of meeting 'the fourth instalment of deposit. Congress, by the original act, as Ave have seen, charged the payment of the several instalments upon the revenue above $5,000,000 which might be in the treasury on January 1st, 1837. That charge was transferred to and imposed upon the surplus revenue in the treasury on January 1st, 1839! But no such charge has been imposed upon the revenue accruing subsequently to. the latter date. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Congress has permitted the thirteenth and fourteenth sections of the act of 1836, as modified by the act of October 2d, 1837, to . stand, for the purpose, as we infer, of showing not only the terms upon Avhich the States received the three first instalments of deposit, but that \u2022 those instalments are held by the States, subject to be reoalled in the discretion of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">But the legislative department of the government seems purposely to have refrained from making the fourth instalment of deposit a charge directly' upon any revenues accruing since January 1st, 1839. Since the last direction given by Congress upon the subject, the financial necessities and obligations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>government have been largely increased, and this circumstance, perhaps, suggests the reason why the legislative department has not fixed any day for the final execution of the act of 1886. Be the reason what it may, we are of opinion that,the Secretary of the Treasury has no authority under existing legislation and without further direction from Congress, to use the surplus revenue in the treasury, from whatever source derived, or whenever, since January 1st, 1839, it may have accrued, for the purpose of making the fourth instalment of deposit required by the act of 1836.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The petition for a mandamus must, consequently, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
