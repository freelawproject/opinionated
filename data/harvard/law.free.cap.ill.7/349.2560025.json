This is taken for granted where the report is in the proper form. The collector is presumed to have done his duty.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\" pgmap=\"365\">The record in this case shows,, that on the 29th day of March, 1844, the collector of La Salle county returned to the Circuit Court of said county, certain lands and lots, as having been assessed for taxes, for the year 1843, and on which the taxes remained due and unpaid, wdiich included the several lots in Adams\u2019 addition to La Salle, in the following form:</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201cAda,ms\u2019 addition to La Salle.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\" pgmap=\"365\">Lot.

John D. Cat\u00f3n presiding, the plaintiff in error appeared and objected to judgment against the several lots in said town. It appeared that the plaintiff was the owner of the said lots. At the hearing, the Court overruled the objection of the plaintiff, and rendered judgment against the said lots, and made an order for the sale of the same, to which decision of the Court in overruling the objections of the plaintiff, the said plaintiff excepted separately to the decision of the Court upon each of the objections.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\" pgmap=\"366\">The case is brought into this Court by writ of error, and the following are the errors assigned:</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\" pgmap=\"366\">1.

Because the paper which purports .to be a report of the collector, is insufficient in this, that it does not appear that the owner or owners of said town lots in the \u201cAdams\u2019 addition to La Salle\u201d had no goods or chattels within the county of the said collector, (the county of La Salle,) on which the said collector could levy for the taxes, interest and cost, alleged to be due and unpaid on the said town lots;</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\" pgmap=\"366\">3.

It does not require the return to state, that the owners have no goods and chattels, &amp;c. The return made is substantially as required by statute.</p> <opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b367-4\" pgmap=\"367\">The Opinion of the Court was delivered by</p> <author id=\"b367-5\" pgmap=\"367\">Treat, J.</author> <p id=\"Ada\" pgmap=\"367\">In March, 1844, the collector of La Salle county reported to the Circuit Court a list of land and town lots, on which the taxes were due and unpaid for the year 1843. E. D. Taylor, the proprietor of numerous lots in Adams\u2019 addition to the town of La Salle, appeared and objected to the sale of the same, on the ground that the collector did not state in his report that the owner had no goods and chattels within the county, on which he could levy for the payment of the taxes. The Court overruled the objection, and entered judgment on the collector\u2019s return. Taylor excepted to the decision, and now assigns it for error. The seventeenth section of the \u201cAct concerning the Public Revenue,\u201d approved February 26th, 1839, requires the collector to collect the taxes assessed on real estate by the seizure and sale of the personal property of the owner, and by the 25th section, if the taxes cannot be collected in this manner, he is required to return the delinquent list to the Circuit Court for judgment. The form of the judgment prescribed in the twenty ninth section recites, that the return of the collector shows that the owners have no goods and chattels within the county, on which he can levy for the taxes. The precise form of the return is given in the twenty fifth section, and by it the collector is not required to state that he is unable to collect the taxes by the seizure and sale of the personal property of the proprietor. This is taken for granted where the report is made in proper form. The collector is presumed to have performed his duty. The return in the present case was a substantial compliance with the statute, and there was no error in the decision complained of.</p> <p id=\"b367-6\" pgmap=\"367\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b367-7\" pgmap=\"367\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
