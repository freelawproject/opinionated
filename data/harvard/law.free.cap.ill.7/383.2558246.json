The provisions of the Act of January 6, 1843, are substantially the same as those of the former Act, and it is therefore unconstitutional. As, bythe Constitution of the United States, that Court has ultimate, exclusive jurisdiction of questions of this kind, this Court is bound by its decision.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-10\" pgmap=\"399\">Trespass in the Gallatin Circuit Court, brought by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error, as sheriff of Gallatin county, and heard before the Hon.

To this declaration the defendant filed a demurrer, which was overruled by the Court and judgment given for the plaintiff, which is now assigned for error.</p> <p id=\"b400-6\" pgmap=\"400\">The only question presented for our consideration is the constitutionality of that law. The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of McCracken v. Hayward, decided at the January term 1844, have distinctly decided that the Act of 1841 is in express violation of the Constitution of the United States and void. The provisions of the Act first mentioned are substantially the same as those of this Act. As by the Constitution of the United States that Court has ultimate exclusive jurisdiction of that question, we are bound by its decision.</p> <p id=\"b400-7\" pgmap=\"400\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b400-8\" pgmap=\"400\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b400-9\" pgmap=\"400\"> Wilson, C.
