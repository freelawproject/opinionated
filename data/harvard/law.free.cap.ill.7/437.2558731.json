The judgment is the foundation of title, and if void, the proceedings under it are mere nullities. The execution is the particular authority to the sheriff to malee the sale, and if not in pursuance of the judgment, the acts of the sheriff are unwarranted, and his deed vests no title in the purchaser. These principles are strictly applicable to sales of land under the provisions of the \u201cAct concerning the public revenue,\u201d approved February 26,1839.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b453-11\" pgmap=\"453\">In an action of ejectmentto recover the possession of land, purchased at a sheriff\u2019s sale for taxes, the plaintiff; in order to substantiate his allegation of title, must exhibit, first, a valid judgment against the land; second, a valid precept authorizing the sheriff to make the sale; and third, a proper conveyance of the land from the sheriff.

The judgment and order of sale in 1840 is void, for not pursuing the form-given by the statute, and in not filling the blanks left in the statutory form with the substantial allegations of thefime at which the Collector made his return of the list of lands delinquent for taxes, and in not further stating, \u201cand, that the taxes thereon remained due and unpaid on the day of the date of said collector\u2019s return.\u201d The form in this proceeding must be strictly pursued, and the facts as to the return' of the Collector at the time specified by law, and that the taxes then remained due and unpaid, must in this summary proceeding affirmatively appear tipofi the face of the record to give the Court jurisdiction. The order of sale without these facts appearing on the face of the record is not voidable only, but absolutely void. Thatcher v. Powell\u2019s Lessee, 5 Peters\u2019 Cond. R. 28-31; Stead\u2019s Executors v. Course, 2 Peters\u2019 Cond. R. 151-154, and notes; McClung v. Ross, 4 Peters\u2019 Cond. R. 603-606; Buckmaster v. Carlin, 3 Scam. 104; Swiggart v.

The order of the Court at the September term 1844, amending the judgment, order of sale and precept of 1840, cannot help it, because there was nothing to amend. The previous order was a nullity; from the face of the record the Court never had jurisdiction, and clearly no power to amend. Could the Court in this kind of summary proceeding under a special statute, which prescribes its course, and that course not pursued in 1840, in 1844 make, by amendment, that legal, which before was illegal and void. The whole proceeding was corum non jit dice. Thatcher v. Powell\u2019s Lessee, 5 Peters\u2019 Cond. R. 28-31, and the authorities above cited, and particularly the cases in 1 Scam. 323, 325; 3 Johns. Cases, 108, and 3 Johns. Ch. Rep. 344; 1 Cowper 15-18.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\" pgmap=\"455\">III. The Court, by the Common Law, and by the provisions of our statute, had no power or right over the judgment and record made at a term previous, by new entries to alter or change the record at a subsequent term of the Court in which the judgment was rendered. 1 Petersdorff\u2019s Com. Law 504, 537; R. L. 1833, 64, \u00a7 5; Gale\u2019s Stat. 49, \u00a7 5, and 533, \u00a7 20; Rev. Stat. 49, \u00a7 5. After the term is ended, clerical omissions only can be amended, and the making or omitting an order in the order book is a judicial, not a clerical error. 1 U. S. Dig. 157, \u00a7\u00a7 354, 362, 364, 365, 368, 371, 372, 374.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\" pgmap=\"455(27) 456(26)\">The amendment was substantial, and for that reason, even in an ordinary proceeding between parties regularly in Court, could not have been made. Botkin v. Pickaway Co., Ohio Cond. R. 375. The thirtieth section of the Act directs that this form shall be pursued, and that makes the form in this proceeding substance.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\" pgmap=\"456\">The amendment operates to the prejudice of third persons, not parties or privies, or in any way connected with the parties to the suit of Pike v. Hall, it being a collateral proceeding, in which the order of amendment was made. And for this reason, according to common law principles, not allowable. The defendant in this suit never had any notice of the application to amend the judgment, wrhich he would be entitled to, if the proceedings were amendable. But not having had such notice, the amendment is consequently void as to him, unquestionably. An amendment will never be allowed, when it will operate prejudicially upon the rights of third persons. Hart v. Pasmore, 4 Maule &amp; Selwyn; 1 Petersdorff\u2019s Com. Law, 503; Hunter v. Todd, 1 Scam. 551.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\" pgmap=\"456\">IY. But if the Court had power to make the amendment, and the judgment and order of sale were amendable in these particulars, the judgment is still void because the statement in the recital of the judgment as amended, \u201cthat the Collector reported the delinquent list on the eighth day of March, 1840, for the taxes of 1839,\u201d if true, shows that the Court had no jurisdiction. There then being no term of the Circuit Court for the county of Schuyler, and that not being the time fixed by law for holding said Court, the report was not made in pursuance of law, and therefore void, and all the subsequent proceedings thereon founded. Revenue Law 1839, 12, 14, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 27, 32. The further amendment, that the taxes remained due and unpaid at that date, would also prove unavailing, as the report is to be made to a term of Court which was not held until afterwards. See same sections of the Act of 1839; and from this it appears that the law had not been sufficiently complied with to authorize the Court at its March term 1840, or at the September term 1844, to render any judgment in the premises. Laws of 1839, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-7\" pgmap=\"456(21) 457(249)\">V. If the Court had the power to amend, the amendment could only be made from the Collector\u2019s report and notice, with the advertised list; and in reviewing the amendment with a view to inquire and ascertain whether there was any thing to amend by, we insist that the Court ought to have examined the original report of the Collector and advertised list with the notice on file, to see if the foundation is laid to enter a judgment before an amendment could be made. For the purpose of showing that no such foundation was laid, at the March term 1840, we offered on the trial of this cause, in connection with the question of amendment, the Patent and advertised list and notice, showing that the lands in question were not listed in the name of the Patentee, nor advertised in giving the notice as the statute requires. The notice fixing the second Monday of April, 1840, as the time of sale, when the twenty sixth section of the Act requires the sale to be advertised to take place on the second Monday next succeeding the term of the Court at which judgment was rendered, and also to show that the land in controversy was not described in the advertisement. And if it appeared from the report, which is the fact, that the land was not listed as the law required, or not described, or that the notice was otherwise not in accordance with the law, the Court had no jurisdiction to enter the judgment against the land in controversy, and, therefore, no power or authority to make the amendment.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-5\" pgmap=\"457(155) 458(85)\">VI. The same reasons and principles of law apply to the precept offered in evidence herein with others, following, to wit: The precept by the thirty first section of the Act of 1839, is to be a copy of the Collector\u2019s report, together with the order of the Court thereon, &amp;c.,\u2014the form of which is prescribed by the statute and specially directed to be pursued. \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30, 31. In this the precept is void, because it does not copy the judgment as it originally was, nor is it a copy of the judgment as amended. The precept recites that the Collector returned his report to the Circuit Court of said county, on the- day of April, 1840; the judgment reciting that it was made on the eighth day of March, 1840, thus showing the Collector\u2019s report to have been made at a time subsequent to the entry of the judgment of the Court, when, by law, the report must precede the judgment; and by the certificate of the clerk of the Court to the precept it appears that the report of the Collector was made at a time different from either the amended judgment or the amended precept, that time being the sixteenth day of March, 1840. This process to be valid must show on its face that such a judgment was rendered by a competent Court as will justify its emanation. Hinman v. Pope, 1 Gilman, 131.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-5\" pgmap=\"458\">VII. The order of the Court in 1844, amending the judgment and precept, does not authorize the precept to be amended in this particular, nor is the precept amended in the particular manner required by the order of amendment by inserting the words, \u201cand that the taxes thereon remained due and unpaid, on the day of the date of the said Collector\u2019s return.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-6\" pgmap=\"458\">VIII. The judgment and precept originally if held to be good, notwithstanding the preceding objections, yet are void; in this cast; there being no description in the judgment or precept of the lands in controversy, and it not appearing in the caption of the Collector\u2019s report as recited in the judgment and precept, nor any thing appearing upon the report opposite to, or in connection with the name of the Patentee or present owner, designating in what section, township and range, said land is situated, they are for this reason void as against this land, and as such lay no foundation for the introduction of the sheriff\u2019s deed.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-7\" pgmap=\"458\">IX. There being no foundation laid for the deed by the introduction of a legal judgment and precept, under the tax law of 1839, against the lands in controversy, the deed should have been excluded. Hinman v Pope, 1 Gilman, 131.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-8\" pgmap=\"458(83) 459(24)\">X. We had the right to show by way of rebutting the statutory prima facie character of the deed, to prove that the land in question was not listed in the manner required by law, nor advertised as required by the twenty sixth section of the Act of 1839, and for this purpose the Patent and advertised list and notice were offered. The Court admitted the Patent, but excluded the advertisement and notice, and thereby prevented us from comparing the lands advertised with the land described in the Patent, and also, from asking instructions to the jury as to the effect of the evidence so .offered.</p><attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-5\" pgmap=\"459\">S.

The judgment is the foundation of the title, and if void, the proceedings under it are mere nullities. The execution is the particular authority to the sheriff to make the sale, and if not in pursuance of the judgment, the acts of the sheriff are unwarranted and his deed vests no title in the purchaser. This Court decided in the case- of Hinman v. Pope, 1 Gilman, 131, that these principles are strictly applicable to the sales of land under the provisions of the \u2018\u2022\u2019\u25a0diet concerning the Public Revenue,\u201d approved February 26th, 1839. The plaintiff, therefore, in an action of ejectment to recover the possession of land which he has purchased at a sheriff\u2019s sale for taxes, in order to substantiate his allegation of title, must exhibit, first, a valid judgment against the land; second, a valid precept authorizing the sheriff to make the sale; and third, a proper conveyance of the land from the sheriff. These are essential to the validity of the title; none of them can be dispensed with. When these requisites are shown, the plaintiff may safely rest his case, and it must prevail unless overthrown by his adversary. He is not required to go back of the judgment, and show that a particular person had title to the land, either at the time of the assessment or at the rendition of the judgment. The judgment is against the land and not against a particular individual. The land itself is sold and not a particular interest in it. If the land was subject to taxation, and the proceedings under the revenue law have been regular, and the owner has failed to redeem within the time limited by the law, then, the whole legal and equitable estate is vested in the purchaser. A new and perfect title is established. This results from the paramount authority of the State to levy taxes on property within its limits and coerce the payment by subjecting the property to sale. It is one of 'the necessary and inherent rights of the sovereign power. This case, therefore, is not like the one of a sale under an ordinary judgment, where the purchaser only succeeds to the title, which the debtor had at the recovery of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">We now proceed to inquire, whether the judgment and subsequent proceedings were properly admitted in evidence in the present case.</p> <p id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465(171) 466(405) 467(52)\">The form of the judgment is given in the twenty ninth section of the Act before referred to, . and the thirtieth section declares, that such form \u201cshall be pursued as near as the. nature of the case will permit.\u201d' The judgment in question, as originally entered, is in some respects variant from the prescribed form. The day on which the Collector returned the delinquent list to the Circuit Court is left blank; and the statement, \u201cthat the taxes thereon remained due and unpaid on the day of the date of the said Collector\u2019s return,\u201d is omitted. These are the only omissions in the judgment. The commencement or caption of the Collector\u2019s report is copied into the judgment. With these exceptions, the judgment is in the required form. The form of the Collector\u2019s report is prescribed in the twenty fifth section, and the caption furnishes the only evidence of the non-payment of taxes. In this case it is carried into the record and made part of the. judgment. The evidence upon which\" the Court acted in this particular is-inserted in the judgment, instead of the legal conclusion resulting from the evidence. The report shows the non-payment of the taxes, and to this extent the report is adopted as part of the judgment. The judgment shows as fully that the taxes were due and unpaid, as if it contained the precise- language of the statute. This is equivalent and sufficient. The mere failure to insert the day on which the report was presented,- ought not to invalidate the judgment. The twenty fifth section,. as changed by the fourth section of the Act of February 1st, 1840, requires the Collector to file his report five days previous to the first day of the term of the Court. The presumption of the law is, that he performed his duty in this respect. -The provision, however, is directory to the Collector, and his failure to comply with it literally does not affect the jurisdiction of the Court. It is enough for this purpose, that the report is made before the case is heard and the judgment pronounced. The judgment states that the report was presented, but omits to state on what precise day. The report was before the Court, and was the foundation of its judgment. The judgment shows on its face, that all of the material requisitions of the statute were complied with. The year for which the taxes were assessed; the description of the land and the amount of the taxes on each tract; the fact that the Collector was unable to obtain payment of the taxes, by the seizure and sale of the personal property of the owners, and the- compliance with the law by the Collector in making the proper return, and in giving the requisite notice of the application for judgment, all clearly appear from the judgment. The omissions and variations in the judgment are merely in matfers of form, and evidently clerical mistakes, which ought not to vitiate the judgment, especially when it is apparent from the face of the proceeding that the Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, and proceeded to make the proper adjudication. Another objection taken to the judgment is, that it is not entitled in any pending suit. The application for jud'gffient is required by the twenty eighth section to be entitled in a particular way, and placed at the head of the common law docket. The object of this requisition is to bring the matter directly to the notice of the Court, that it may dispose of it before progressing with the trial of causes. The entry in the docket is not a necessary part of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b467-5\" pgmap=\"467\">Again, it is insisted, that the judgment is void as it respects the tract of land in controversy, because the township and range are not given. There is no just foundation for this objection. The marks which follow the section, clearly refer to the township and range of the two preceding tracts. This reference makes the description complete, and places the matter beyond all dispute. The judgment, as originally entered, was valid, irrespective of the amendments subsequently made. The order, however, allowing the amendments, was proper. They were only the correction of clerical mistakes, and could prejudice no person\u2019s rights. They brought no new matter into the case. The time when the report was presented could at once be ascertained by reference to the indorsement of the clerk, on receiving it; and the report and judgment both furnished the evidence to authorize the other amendment. The amendments gave no additional efficacy to the proceedings, but put them in stricter conformity to \u2022the provisions of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">What has been said respecting the judgment, is equally \u2022applicable to the precept, and disposes of most of the objections to. it. The thirty first section, as modified by the ninth \u2022section of the Act of February 1st, 1840, requires the clerk to make out, under the seal of the Court, a copy of the judgment, and declares that it shall constitute the process on which the land shall be sold. This was substantially complied with in thfe present case. The precept shows when the judgment was rendered, the description of the land, the amount of taxes and costs on each tract, and for what year due and unpaid, and the order of the Court directing the sale. The statement that the report was made in April is manifestly a mistake, for the precept shows that the judgment was rendered in March, on a report made previously.</p> <p id=\"b467-7\" pgmap=\"467(10) 468(31)\">The forty second section gives the form for the sheriff\u2019s deed; the deed in this case, strictly pursues the form, and states correctly the precise proceedings. The judgment and precept being valid, the deed was not obnoxious to any just exception.</p> <p id=\"b468-5\" pgmap=\"468\">It is the opinion of the Court that the judgment, precept and deed were properly admitted in evidence, and that these, with the additional proof that the defendant was in the possession of the premises at the commencement of the suit, made out aprima facie case on the part of the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b468-6\" pgmap=\"468(308) 469(137)\">In dismissing the various objections taken to these proceedings, I cannot forbear the remark that they are purely technical. The duty of every citizen to contribute, in proportion to the value of his estate, towards the support of the Government which protects him in the enjoyment of his rights, must be acknowledged by all; The present revenue laws are liberal in their character; the rate of taxation is uniform and reasonable; the tax payer can readily ascertain the amount he is required to pay. He has several months in which to make payment after his property is assessed. If he omit to pay, and his land is sold, he has still the right to redeem within two years from \"the sale. If, after all this delay, he suffers his title to be transferred to the purchaser, the loss must be attributed to his gross disregard of his duties and interests, and not to the fault or injustice of the law. He should not, then, be permitted to defeat the title of the purchaser, by interposing mere technical objections. If allowed to do it, he is enabled to take advantage of his own laches and wrong, not only to defeat the claim of the purchaser, but to avoid altogether the payment of his share of the public burdens. Where all the material requisitions of the laws have been substantially complied with, Courts should not hesitate to sustain rights fairly acquired under them. It is time that the object and design of these enactments should be regarded. Judges should not be on the alert to.discover frivolous objections, and resort to mere technical rules to sustain them, in order to defeat the claim of a purchaser. Such objections are generally insisted on, and have in some instances been countenanced by the Courts. They proceed from a one sided view of the subject. The allegation that the land is sacrificed for a trifle, and the purchaser is acquiring acres for cents, is alone regarded, while the obligations of the tax payer and the rights of the Government are not considered. If the proceedings under these laws are to be subjected to mere technical tests, taxes will remain unpaid, individuals will cease to bid at sales, and thus the principal object of the laws may be frustrated. But, if on the other hand, by the application of reasonable rules, some assurance is given that the titles will be sustained, the taxes will be generally paid, the competition at the biddings will be increased, and instead of whole tracts of land being sold to pay the the taxes due upon it, small portions only will suffice.</p> <p id=\"b469-5\" pgmap=\"469\">The only remaining question to be considered is, whether the Circuit Court erred in rejecting the evidence offered by the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b469-6\" pgmap=\"469(246) 470(32)\">As we have already observed, the plaintiff made out a prima facie case. It must prevail unless successfully assailed by the defendant; the forty third section of the Act under which these proceedings were had, as modified by the seventy third section of the Act of March 3d, 1845, after providing that the sheriff\u2019s deed shall be prima facie evidence of certain facts, proceeds to declare, that \u201cin controversies and suits involving the title to land claimed and held under and by virtue of a deed executed by the sheriff as aforesaid, the person claiming title, adverse to the title conveyed by such deed, shall be required to prove, in order to defeat the said title, either that the said land was not subject to taxation at the date of the sale; that the taxes had been paid; that the land had never been listed and assessed for taxation; or that the same had been redeemed, according to the provisions of this Act, and that such redemption was had or made for the use and benefit of persons having the right of redemption under the laws of the State. But no person shall be permitted to question the title acquired by a Collector\u2019s deed, without first showing that he or she, or the person under whom he or she claims title, had title to the lands at the time of the sale, or that the title was obtained from the United States or this Rate, after the sale, and that all taxes due upon the lands, have been paid by such person, or by their agent, or the person under whom he claims'title as aforesaid.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b470-5\" pgmap=\"470\">According to the provisions of this section, after the plaintiff has produced a sheriff\u2019s deed founded on a valid judgment and precept, the defendant is precluded from questioning the validity of the title acquired by such deed, unless he first shows, that he or the person under whom he claims, had title to the land at the time of the sale for taxes, or that the title was obtained from the United States or this State subsequent to such sale. He must bring himself within this provision of the law before he is allowed to assail the plaintiff\u2019s title. The sheriff\u2019s deed is conclusive against all the world but those having title to the premises. If the defendant has title, or can connect himself with the title of another person, he is then permitted to defeat the title, of the purchaser, by establishing any of the defences enumerated and authorized in the foregoing section. And perhaps he may go further and accomplish the same object, by disproivng any of- the matters, the existence of which, the deed is declared to furnish prima facie evidence.</p> <p id=\"b470-6\" pgmap=\"470\">In this case the defendant did not place himself in the proper position to attack the plaintiff\u2019s title. He neither showed title in himself, or connected his possession with the title of any other person. The patent was only evidence of title in Martha James. He failed to show that he has succeeded to her title, or that he was her tenant, or the tenant of any one claiming title through her. Omitting wholly to prove that he had any subsisting right to the land, he was precluded by the express provisions of the statute, by going behind the payment and insisting that the land was not listed and advertised in pursuance of law. The evidence offered by him was, therefore, properly excluded by the Court.</p> <p id=\"b470-7\" pgmap=\"470\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b470-8\" pgmap=\"470\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b459-16\" pgmap=\"459\">Wilson, C.
