The declaration was in assumpsit, for goods sold, and money had and received. Pleas, non assumpsit, and payment. Trial before a jury, and verdict for the plaintiffs for $45. The Court overruled a motion for a new trial, and judgment was rendered on the verdict. The defendant tendered a bill of exceptions embodying the whole of the testimony. They now assign for error, the refusal of the Court to grant them a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b47-11\" pgmap=\"47(90) 48(50)\">The evidence shows this state of facts. During the summer of 1842, Ansley &amp; Co. left for sale certain cases of boots and shoes with Stahl &amp; Brewster, who were commission merchants. They sold all of the cases but two, and paid over to Ansley &amp; Co. the proceeds before the commencement of the suit. There was no evidence of a sale of the residue of the goods, nor of a failure to deliver them on request. On this state of case, the verdict was unwarranted. The jury was not authorized to infer from the evidence, a sale of the goods, and so charge the defendant for money had and received to the plaintiffs\u2019 use; nor an appropriation of the goods by the defendants to their own use, and so charge them, as purchasers, with the value.</p> <p id=\"b48-5\" pgmap=\"48\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, with costs, and the cause is remanded for -further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b48-6\" pgmap=\"48\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b47-13\" pgmap=\"47\">Wilson, C.
