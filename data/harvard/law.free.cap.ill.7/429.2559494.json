If the suit proceeds to judgment, and the attachment is not in the mean time dissolved, the plaintiff has the benefit of a general judgment against the defendant, and a specific lien on the estate attached for its payment.

The law does not provide for constructive service by publication, but in attachment it is otherwise; though there be neither service nor appearance, the defendant'may be brought into Court by publication. In this case, the action was assumpsit, commenced by summons, aided by an attachment. Rev. Stat. 70, Ch. IX, \u00a7 30. The issuing of the writ did not abate nor extinguish the original suit, but was engrafted upon it to give it effect, to secure the property of the defendant, and to do that which the summons failed to do, to bring Moore properly into Court. The writ of attachment and the proceedings under it, did not lose their relation to, or connection with the original suit, but were so far distinct as to conform to proceedings \u201crequired or permitted in original attachments, in all things as near as may be.\u201d See \u00a7 30, before cited. Hamilton, having suspended proceedings in the original suit, and sought the aid of the proceeding in attachment, was entitled to its benefit as long as was necessary to secure the remedy sought. The publication, then, was equivalent to service, for according to the law regulating attachments, it brought the defendant within the jurisdiction of the Court, so as to authorize judgment against him, and execution against the property attached.</p> <opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b446-8\" pgmap=\"446\">The Opinion of the Court was delivered by</p> <author id=\"b446-9\" pgmap=\"446\">Treat, J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> </author> <p id=\"Asm\" pgmap=\"446(68) 447(106)\">On the 9th of June', 1845, Hamilton commenced an action of assumpsit in the Hancock Circuit Court against Moore. The return on the summons was \u201cnon cst inventus.\u201d On the 17th of June, Hamilton filed a bond and affidavit, and under the 30th section of the \u201cJlct concerning attachments\u201d approved February 12th, 1833, sued out an attachment in aid of the action of assumpsit. The writ was levied on a tract of land and some personal property. Notice of the pendency of the attachment was -regularly given by publication. At the October term 1845, the default of Moore was entered and the plaintiff\u2019s damages assessed at $145-74, for .which amount a judgment was rendered, to be satisfied by a sale of the property attached. Moore was not personally served either with the process of summons or attachment; \u00f1or did he ever enter his appearance. It does not appear that the action of assumpsit has been disposed of. Moore now prosecutes a writ of error for the reversal of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b447-5\" pgmap=\"447(285) 448(121)\">The only material question presented by the record, is, whether, under the circumstances, the judgment was warranted. It was contended by the counsel for the defendant in error, that the action of assumpsit and the .attachment were distinct proceedings, and that the latter might be prosecuted, to final judgment without noticing the former. In the. Opinion of the Court, this position cannot be sustained. They constitute, in fact, but one case; the attachment is but an adjunct of the original case. It is to be entitled in the pending suit and be in aid thereof. It is only process and a part of the proceedings of the case originally commenced. By the service of the writ of attachment, the defendant is prevented from alienating or carrying away his estate during the pendency of the suit. If the action proceeds to judgment, and the attachment is not in the mean time dissolved, the plaintiff has the benefit of a general judgment against the defendant, and a specific lien.on the estate attached for its payment. Before the plaintiff can realize the fruits of the attachment by subjecting the property to sale, he must procure a service of the process in the original action, and obtain judgment therein. The action must be first disposed of. If it fails, the attachment goes with it. If the plaintiff cannot procure a service of process, his proper course is to discontinue his case, and sue out an original attachment. If this attachment can be regarded as an independent proceeding, one of the principal provisions of the attachment law could be easily evaded. The statute only allows the remedy by attachment to recover indebtedness growing out of contracts, express or implied, or ascertained and liquidated by a judgment. An- original attachment cannot be sued out for the purpose of recovering damages for a tort. By the 30th section, an attachment may be sued out in aid of an action of trespass. If the-attachment thus instituted could be carried on without reference to the pending action, the effect would be to permit the plaintiff to recover a judgment in attachment against a non resident for a personal injury. This xvould allow him to do indirectly by this kind of proceeding, what he cannot do directly by an original proceeding. The remedies by attachment are in derogation of the common law, and ought not to be extended by implication.</p> <p id=\"b448-5\" pgmap=\"448\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed with costs, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b448-6\" pgmap=\"448\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b446-10\" pgmap=\"446\"> Wilson, C.
