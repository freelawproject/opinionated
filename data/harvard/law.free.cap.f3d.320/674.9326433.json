O\u2019Dell, III, appeals from an order sentencing him to a mandatory minimum sixty months imprisonment for possession of marijuana with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), and manufacture of marijuana, also in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">On August 15, 1991, agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and several other law enforcement agencies executed federal search warrants at O\u2019Dell\u2019s properties in Monroe County, Tennessee. Entering the first property, O\u2019Dell\u2019s farm, agents discovered a barn that housed a \u201csophisticated marijuana growing operation.\u201d (J.A. at 44.) The district court described \u201cthree growing rooms containing over 100 marijuana plants.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Agents actually seized 203 plants. The marijuana had a wholesale value of approximately $406,000. O\u2019Dell does not dispute that the plants belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Agents also discovered one large bag of harvested marijuana plants. In a nearby residential structure occupied by O\u2019Dell\u2019s father, Jackson C. O\u2019Dell, Jr., officers located marijuana seeds and firearms. Agents found O\u2019Dell at the barn when they arrived. Searching his person revealed a pilot\u2019s license and information sheets related to the special light bulbs used to grow marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The law enforcement officers simultaneously executed the second warrant at O\u2019Dell\u2019s residence. There, officers discovered various other items linking O\u2019Dell to marijuana cultivation: <em>High Times </em>magazines, marijuana seeds, triple-beam balance scales, books describing how to cultivate marijuana, and receipts, pamphlets and sales brochures for marijuana seeds and growing equipment. Officers also found five firearms, including high-powered rifles, handguns, and shotguns. Finally, the government discovered flight maps to Central America and a ledger book that apparently documented several cocaine smuggling trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">A one-count information was filed against O\u2019Dell on July 30, 1993, after O\u2019Dell agreed to waive indictment and plead guilty. That information charged O\u2019Dell with manufacturing marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The information also cited the applicable penalty provision, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">On November 8, 1993, O\u2019Dell agreed to plead guilty to the information pursuant to a plea agreement in which he agreed his offense was punishable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The Probation Office then prepared a presentence report also, stating that there was a minimum mandatory sentence of five to forty years pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The Presentence Report\u2019s offense conduct section noted that agents seized and videotaped 203 marijuana plants grown on O\u2019Dell\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The government then made clear that it conditioned its acceptance of the plea agreement on the pleas of O\u2019Dell\u2019s father and sons to various related state charges. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Dell (O\u2019Dell III), </em>247 F.3d 655, 661-62 (6th Cir.2001). When O\u2019Dell became concerned that his plea agreement could prevent his father and sons from obtaining a judicial diversion from state court, the government added a sentence to the plea agreement indicating that \u201cnothing in this clause of the plea agreement is intended to prevent the defendant\u2019s father or the defendant\u2019s sons from applying for or obtaining a judicial diversion and their obtaining such diversion will not affect this plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. When O\u2019Dell\u2019s father and sons refused to plead to the state charges, the government reported the breach to the district court and indicated that it was no longer bound to abide by the plea agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ment, although the government did not actually seek to withdraw its assent. <em>Id. </em>The court, however, declined to enforce the plea agreement and ordered the parties to proceed to trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">On December 6, 1994, the government charged O\u2019Dell in a four-count indictment. Count one charged O\u2019Dell with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Like the earlier information, the indictment contained a reference to the applicable penalty provision, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). In count two, O\u2019Dell was charged with manufacturing marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). This count also cited the penalty provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Counts three and four alleged O\u2019Dell used property to manufacture marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856, and that O\u2019Dell must forfeit the property pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">On January 3, 1995, O\u2019Dell was arraigned. O\u2019Dell then filed dozens of motions raising numerous issues. O\u2019Dell appealed the denial of some of the motions, and the government cross-appealed when some of the motions resulted in the district court dismissing portions of the indictment. <em>See United States v. One Tract of Real Prop., </em>95 F.3d 422 (6th Cir.1996) (reversing dismissal of forfeiture count with prejudice); <em>United States v. O\u2019Dell (O\u2019Dell I), </em>Nos. 95-6414 and 95-6415, 1996 WL 515345 (6th Cir. Sept.10, 1996) (affirming district court\u2019s denial of O\u2019Dell\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds and reinstating forfeiture count) (unpublished); <em>United States v. O\u2019Dell (O\u2019Dell II), </em>Nos. 96-6737 and 97-5098 (6th Cir. Dec. 8, 1997) (unpublished order) (dismissing several of O\u2019Dell\u2019s other appeals); <em>O\u2019Dell III, </em>154 F.3d 358 (reinstating counts dismissed under the Speedy Trial Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">O\u2019Dell\u2019s case went to trial on March 3, 1999. O\u2019Dell waived his right to a jury trial and tried his case before the district judge. The district court took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">On March 24, 1999, the Supreme Court decided <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). <em>Jones </em>construed the federal carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, which has three subcategories with punishments that increase based on aggravating factors. The Court interpreted \u00a7 2119 as \u201cestablishing three separate offenses by the specification of distinct elements, each of which must be charged by indictment, proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to the jury for its verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 119 S.Ct. 1215. In so holding, the Court explained that \u201cunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment,' any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">The court ultimately found O\u2019Dell guilty of counts one and two. The Probation Office prepared a second presentence report stating that, unless the so-called \u201csafety valve\u201d sentencing statute applied, O\u2019Dell would receive a five-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). O\u2019Dell objected to the presentence report, arguing that \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) did not apply because he qualified for the safety valve. On July 29, 1999, the court accepted O\u2019Dell\u2019s position and applied the safety valve. O\u2019Dell thus received an eighteen-month sentence. The government appealed. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Dell (O\u2019Dell IV), </em>247 F.3d 655 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Before this Court, the government argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the safety valve did not apply, making the statutory mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>minimum inappropriate. The United States also claimed, alternatively, that O\u2019Dell should have received twenty-four months. O\u2019Dell argued that he met his burden of establishing that the safety valve applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">On June 26, 2000, the Supreme Court filed its opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). During the pendency of the government\u2019s appeal in <em>O\u2019Dell TV, </em>O\u2019Dell filed requests to allow him to raise new arguments. On October 24, 2000, O\u2019Dell sought to raise a <em>Kyllo </em>issue after the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>United States v. Kyllo, </em>190 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. granted </em>530 U.S. 1305, 121 S.Ct. 29, 147 L.Ed.2d 1052 (2000) (No. 99-8508). O\u2019Dell again sought to raise a <em>Kyl-lo </em>issue following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">We issued our opinion in <em>ODell IV </em>on April 24, 2001. We held that application of the safety valve was improper and that the minimum mandatory provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) applied instead. <em>O\u2019Dell TV, </em>247 F.3d at 687. We reversed and remanded with the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">With respect to the government\u2019s appeal in Case No. 99-6153, we hold that the district court\u2019s finding that O\u2019Dell successfully established his eligibility for the protection of the \u201csafety valve\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(f) and USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2 was clearly erroneous. Thus, we VACATE the judgment of sentence entered by district court and REMAND for re-sentencing without application of the safety valve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\"><em>Id. </em>On May 8, 2001, O\u2019Dell filed a petition for rehearing, which we denied on June 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">On remand, O\u2019Dell filed a motion arguing that the mandatory minimum in \u00a7 841(b) still did not apply, now raising a <em>Jones/Apprendi </em>argument for the first time. The district court directed the parties to brief the mandate rule and the question of whether O\u2019Dell could raise the <em>Jones/Apprendi </em>issue at this stage. In a written memorandum and order, the district court concluded that the remand was limited and that it lacked the authority to consider the <em>Jones/Apprendi </em>issue. The court also held, alternatively, that the <em>Jones/Apprendi </em>issue had no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">On August 20, 2001, O\u2019Dell filed another motion for a guideline sentence, this time basing his argument on the then-recently announced (but subsequently vacated and reversed <em>en banc) </em>Ninth Circuit decision in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>259 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2001), <em>reh\u2019g granted, </em>265 F.3d 1085, <em>rev\u2019d, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">On the day <em>of </em>sentencing, September 4, 2001, O\u2019Dell filed two new motions. First, O\u2019Dell argued that pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and the Eighth Amendment, he should receive a downward departure. He also argued that a mandatory minimum sentence would violate his Fifth Amendment right to due process and Eighth Amendment right to protection from cruel and unusual punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">The district court rejected these motions and sentenced O\u2019Dell to the mandatory minimum term of sixty months followed by four years of supervised release. O\u2019Dell filed this timely appeal. O\u2019Dell has already served more than the eighteen-month sentence he claims the trial court should have imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">At oral argument, O\u2019Dell\u2019s counsel conceded that recent Supreme Court decisions in <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), and <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), vitiated the <em>Jones/Apprendi </em>and jurisdictional arguments that constituted most of O\u2019Dell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the only issue we must decide is whether the <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>remand was limited or general. If we hold that the <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>remand was general and if we remand the case for an entirely new sentencing hearing, O\u2019Dell could then make his Fifth and Eighth Amendment arguments to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The interpretation of a mandate is a legal issue which this Court reviews <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, </em>131 F.3d 595, 598 (6th Cir.1997). We find that the district court properly construed this Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>as a limited order rather than a general order.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">A. The Mandate Rule Defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The mandate rule has two components\u2014the limited remand rule, which arises from action by an appellate court, and the waiver rule, which arises from action (or inaction) by one of the parties. As the Second Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">The mandate rule \u201ccompels compliance on remand with the dictates of the superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or <em>impliedly </em>decided by the appellate court.\u201d Likewise, where an issue was ripe for review at the time of an initial appeal but was nonetheless foregone, the mandate rule generally prohibits the district court from reopening the issue on remand unless the mandate can reasonably be understood as permitting it to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-13\"><em>United States v. Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">The basic tenet of the limited remand component of the mandate rule is that \u201ca district court is bound to the scope of the remand issued by the court of appeals.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>168 F.3d 263, 265 (6th Cir.1999). Appellate courts have the authority to give either a general or limited remand. As this Court explained in <em>Moore, </em>if a remand is general, the district court can resentence the defendant <em>de novo, </em>\u201cwhich means the district court may redo the entire sentencing process including considering new evidence and issues.\u201d 131 F.3d at 597. When the remand is not general, \u201cthe district court\u2019s resentencing authority [is limited] to the issue or issues remanded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. The mandate rule serves the interest in finality. \u201cRepetitive hearings, followed by additional appeals, waste judicial resources and place additional burdens on parole officers and personnel and on hardworking district and appellate judges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599-600 (quotation omitted); <em>Super X Drugs Corp. v. FDIC, </em>862 F.2d 1252, 1256 (6th Cir.1988) (issuing limited remand \u201c[t]o conserve judicial time and resources\u201d). When considering sentencing remands, however, we are less likely to find a general mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-19\">to impose a limited remand, an appellate court must sufficiently outline the procedure the district court is to follow. The chain of intended events should be articulated with particularity. With sentencing issues, in light of the general principle of de novo consideration at re-sentencing, this court should leave no doubt in the district judge\u2019s or parties\u2019 minds as to the scope of the remand. The language used to limit the remand should be, in effect, unmistakable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apo\"><em>Campbell, </em>168 F.3d at 268. Thus, \u201c[a] limited remand must convey clearly the intent to limit the scope of the district court\u2019s review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-20\">In <em>United States v. Moored, </em>38 F.3d 1419, 1421 (6th Cir.1994), this Court ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>plained that to determine whether a remand is limited or general, one should look to the purpose of the rule \u2014 encouraging finality and discouraging wasteful litigation \u2014 and \u201cthe spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court\u2019s opinion and the circumstances it embraces.\u201d <em>See also Campbell, </em>168 F.3d at 266 (noting that mandates should be viewed in the context of the entire opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">O\u2019Dell argues that the district court mistakenly construed the <em>O\u2019Dell TV </em>mandate as limited. That mandate read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">With respect to the government\u2019s appeal in Case No. 99-6153, we hold that the district court\u2019s finding that O\u2019Dell successfully established his eligibility for the protection of the \u201csafety valve\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(f) and USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2 was clearly erroneous. Thus, we VACATE the judgment of sentence entered by district court and REMAND for re-sentencing without application of the safety valve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">247 F.3d at 687. According to O\u2019Dell, the trial court erroneously interpreted this text as precluding any consideration of his new arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">B. <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>Contained a Limited Remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">In <em>Moore, </em>131 F.3d at 598, we cited language from three different cases as examples of general mandates. In <em>United States v. Young, </em>34 F.3d 500, 505 (7th Cir.1994), the court considered the scope of this mandate: \u201c[w]e therefore vacate the district court\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.\u201d Next, in <em>United States v. Caterino, </em>957 F.2d 681, 684 (9th Cir.1992), the Ninth Circuit analyzed this mandate: \u201c[t]he district court erred by adding multiple vulnerable victim adjustments to Appellantfs] offense level under the Guidelines. We therefore VACATE ... [Defendant\u2019s] sentence[ ] and REMAND for resentencing.\u201d Finally, in <em>United States v. Cornelius, </em>968 F.2d 703, 705 (8th Cir.1992), the Eighth Circuit considered this order: \u201cwe reverse the district court\u2019s determination that Cornelius was not an armed career criminal under \u00a7\u00a7 924(e) and remand for resentenc-ing.\u201d As we explained, \u201c[e]aeh of these three mandates was a general mandate because each one of these cases involved a remand order that simply vacated or reversed the sentence imposed by the district court and remanded for re-sentencing.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>131 F.3d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Our <em>Moore </em>decision also discussed several cases in which courts issued limited remands. 131 F.3d at 598. In <em>United States v. Polland (Polland I), </em>994 F.2d 1262, 1271 (7th Cir.1993), the Seventh Circuit wrote: \u201c[f]or the foregoing reasons, the conviction is AFFIRMED, the sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing on the issue of obstruction of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Polland (Polland II), </em>56 F.3d 776, 778 (7th Cir.1995) (finding that the language from <em>Polland I </em>was a limited mandate). Likewise, in <em>United States v. Cassity (Cassity I), </em>631 F.2d 461, 466 (6th Cir.1980), we wrote: \u201c[t]he judgments of conviction are vacated and the cases are remanded to the district court for hearings on the suppression issue.... The court shall order a new trial for, and grant the suppression motion of, each appellant whose legitimate expectations of privacy are found to have been violated by the beeper surveillance.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cassity (Cassity II), </em>720 F.2d 451, 459 (6th Cir.1983) (holding that the mandate in <em>Cassity I </em>was a limited mandate).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The difference between the limited mandates and the general mandates is the presence of limiting language. <em>Moore, </em>131 F.3d at 598 (explaining that in each of the three limited remand examples discussed, \u201con a subsequent appeal, the Court construed its remand order as general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>rather than specific because the order contained no limiting language\u201d). The <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>mandate, however, specifically instructed the court to \u201cresentenc[e] without application of the safety valve.\u201d 247 F.3d at 687. Therefore, based on the distinction demonstrated in <em>Moore </em>between general and limited mandates, <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>contained a limited mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Additionally, <em>Moore </em>highlighted the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Byrne, </em>83 F.3d 984 (8th Cir.1996), <em>aff'd sub. nom. United States v. Santonelli, </em>128 F.3d 1233 (8th Cir.1997), as another example of a limited mandate. The Eighth Circuit phrased its mandate this way: \u201c[w]e affirm Santonelli\u2019s conviction on all counts, vacate his sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 994. Significantly, according to the Eighth Circuit, <em>Byrne </em>was a limited mandate despite its general phrasing because the language \u201cmust be read with the analysis offered in the opinion.\u201d <em>United States v. Santonelli, </em>128 F.3d at 1237-38 (8th Cir.1997). Thus, context matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">A key circumstantial factor indicates that <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>contained a limited mandate. The government not only argued that the court should have imposed a five-year sentence, it also argued alternatively that a sentence below twenty-four months was error. Yet we found it unnecessary to address the latter contention. <em>O\u2019Dell IV, </em>247 F.3d at 675. If we intended a general remand and a <em>de novo </em>sentencing, it would have made sense to address the government\u2019s alternative argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">O\u2019Dell argues that district courts may consider issues beyond the scope of a limited remand \u201c Vhere there is substantially different evidence raised on subsequent trial; a subsequent contrary view of the law by the controlling authority; or a clearly erroneous decision which would work a manifest injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell, </em>168 F.3d at 269 (quoting <em>Moored, </em>38 F.3d at 1421); <em>see also United States v. Bell, </em>988 F.2d 247, 251 (1st Cir.1993) (\u201c[T]he so-called \u2018mandate rule,\u2019 generally requiring conformity with the commands of a superi- or court on remand, is simply a specific application of the law of the case doctrine and, as such, is a discretion-guiding rule subject to an occasional exception in the interests of justice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">The trial court\u2019s failure to hear O\u2019Dell\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument is not a \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d because O\u2019Dell waived his opportunity to raise <em>Apprendi. </em>The Supreme Court decided <em>Apprendi on </em>June 26, 2000, during the pendency of <em>O\u2019Dell </em>TV.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the parties filed their final briefs with this Court on April 7, 2000, oral argument was not until October 31, 2000. O\u2019Dell could have raised <em>Apprendi </em>then. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>246 F.3d 520, 529 (6th Cir.2001) (explaining that the Court allowed the defendant to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>issue during oral argument when <em>Apprendi </em>was decided after final briefs were submitted and defense counsel wrote the Court requesting to be allowed to raise <em>Apprendi </em>during oral argument), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Leachman, </em>309 F.3d 377 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">Furthermore, Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) states that \u201c[i]f pertinent and significant authorities come to a party\u2019s attention after the party\u2019s brief has been filed\u2014or after oral argument but before decision\u2014a party may promptly advise the circuit clerk by letter, with a copy to all other parties, setting forth the citations.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>fact, this Court issued one of its major <em>Apprendi </em>decisions, <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>242 F.3d 348 (6th Cir.2001), <em>overruled by United States v. Leachman, </em>309 F.3d 377, on February 16, 2001, months before publishing the <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>opinion. O\u2019Dell had ample opportunity to make his <em>Apprendi </em>argument before this Court decided <em>O\u2019Dell IV.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The district court properly construed this Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>as a limited order rather than a general order. We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-17\">. O'Dell argued in his brief that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case because of an alleged defect in the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">. The Supreme Court decided <em>Jones </em>even earlier, on March 24, 1999. <em>See Jones v.

NELSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">I agree that the remand in <em>O\u2019Dell IV </em>was limited rather than general. I write separately, however, to note that were it to be held that the remand was general rather than limited, it would make no difference to the result in this case. The motions that Mr. O\u2019Dell filed in the district court on the day of his sentencing \u2014 pleadings styled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion for Downward Departure\u201d and \u201cMotion to Resen-tence Within Constitutional Protections of Fifth Amendment Due Process and Eighth Amendment Protections\u201d \u2014 could not properly have been granted in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">As to the request for a downward departure, it is clear that O\u2019Dell was subject to a mandatory minimum five-year sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). It is equally clear that he could not claim the benefit of any statutory exception to the five-year mandate. This being so, the district court had no power to depart from the requirements of the statute. See <em>United States v. Burke, </em>237 F.3d 741, 745 (6th Cir.2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">\u201cIn the absence of one of the exceptions set out in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7\u00a7 3553(e), (f), or such other similar exceptions as Congress may create, defendants may not be sentenced, by means of a downward departure, to a term of imprisonment or other punishment below the minimum imposed by the statute under which they were convicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">As to the constitutional claim, under the facts of this case, the notion that a five-year sentence was somehow unconstitutional strikes me as frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
