Lambright, Jr. (Lambright), appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following his guilty-plea conviction for willful deprivation, under color of law, of another\u2019s constitutional rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. Lambright, who was working as a corrections officer at a Texas state prison at the time of the offense, assaulted an inmate named Michael McCoy (McCoy), causing his death. Lambright argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence by two levels based upon a finding that his victim was a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). Lam-bright also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for downward departure from the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The sentencing guidelines provide for a two-level increase in the base offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). For the enhancement under \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) to apply, the victim must be \u201cunusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or ... otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d \u00a7 3Al.l(b) &amp; comment, (n.2); <em>see also United States v. Moree, </em>897 F.2d 1329, 1335-36 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo; </em>we review a finding of unusual vulnerability for clear error and to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion was plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>119 F.3d 1205, 1218 (5th Cir.1997)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">The district court based its conclusion that the victim McCoy was a vulnerable victim on the findings that he was completely dependent upon the care of the correction officers, that he was locked in his cell prior to the assault, and that he could not protect himself from the assault. The district court\u2019s findings are consistent with our holding in <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>172 F.3d 347, 353 (5th Cir.1999), in which we determined that the sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.3, which applies if the victim was physically restrained in the course of the offense, applied to a former deputy sheriff, who assaulted an arrestee while she lay face down and handcuffed. We noted that the victim \u201ccould not defend herself against an assault, and could not flee from harm\u201d and that \u201c[the defendant] took advantage of this restraint and the particular vulnerability of the victim.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Tapia, </em>59 F.3d 1137, 1143 (11th Cir.1995) (incarcerated government informant attacked by fellow inmates was vulnerable victim under \u00a7 3A1.1; court found that informant \u201cwas particularly vulnera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ble by virtue of his incarceration with [the defendants] and his inability to escape\u201d); <em>United States v. Hershkowitz, </em>968 F.2d 1503, 1505-06 (2d Cir.1992) (\u00a7 3A1.1 enhancement applied to prisoner attacked by detention facility guard).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Consequently, we find that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Lambright knew or should have known that McCoy was a vulnerable victim was \u201cplausible in light of the record as a whole\u201d and it was not clear error for the district court to enhance Lambright\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). <em>Robinson, </em>119 F.3d at 1218 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u201cWe have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not. to depart downward from the guideline range only if the court based its decision upon an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Yanez-Huerta, </em>207 F.3d 746, 748 (5th Cir.2000). \u201c[T]here must be something in the record [to] indicate that the district court held such an erroneous belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The record does not reveal that the district court mistakenly believed that it could not depart downward on Lam-bright\u2019s sentence. The record reflects that the district court denied Lambright\u2019s requested downward departure after hearing extensive argument from his counsel and considering not only whether there were specific guideline provisions that would support the defendant\u2019s request, but also whether this was an extraordinary case that would fit under the general provisions of \u00a7 5K2.0. The district court also considered that the defendant\u2019s conduct resulted in the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review Lambright\u2019s claim that the district court erred in declining to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines in imposing his sentence. <em>Yanez-Huerta, </em>207 F.3d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">Accordingly, Lambright\u2019s sentence is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
