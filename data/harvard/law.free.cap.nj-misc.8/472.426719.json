However, as the application, though made on notice and argued on both sides (the utility board remaining passive in the matter) is merely for the allowance of a rule to show cause, such rule will be allowed, with the suggestion to the parties that if in view of what has been said, a speedy determination of the whole matter is desired, a writ may go at the option of the defendant Public Service Co-ordinated Transport.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
