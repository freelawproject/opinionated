The principal injury received by the plaintiff was a fracture of the right arm at the elbow joint, which made the amputation of the arm above the joint necessary. The trial resulted in a verdict in her favor, the jury awarding her $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">In our opinion, the verdict is so excessive as to make it manifest that it could not have been the result of a fair, impartial and dispassionate consideration of the evidence in the case, and, for this reason, we conclude that the verdict should be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
