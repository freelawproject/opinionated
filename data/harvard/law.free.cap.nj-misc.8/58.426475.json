If the accident occurred as described by the plaintiff in his testimony, the jury was entirely justified in its finding that it was the result solely of the negligence of the driver of the defendant\u2019s truck. After hearing the testimony on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>sides, it was their function to determine what the truth of the matter in issue was, and the fact that they believed the plaintiff, and not the witnesses of the defendant, affords no ground for setting aside the verdict as against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">As to the award, our examination of the proofs relating to the character of the plaintiff\u2019s injury and his loss of earnings, .satisfies us that instead of being excessive it was a very reasonable allowance that the jury made to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
