The crossing was. protected by a crossing bell. Plaintiff brought his action against both railroad companies and a trial of the action resulted in a verdict in his favor of $9,000 against the New York and Long Branch Eailroad Company, and against him and in favor of the Central Eailroad Company of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">The defendant, New York and Long Branch Eailroad Company, has this rule and seeks to set aside the verdict against, it for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">1. That no negligence was established against it. This is-upon the contention that the crossing bell was ringing at the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>time of the happening and that it was not established by the preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">With this we do not agree. Prom the proofs a fair jury question was presented and of such a character as does not warrant this court in setting aside the finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">2. By the clear weight of the evidence plaintiff\u2019s decedent was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We think this was a fair jury question and that the result reached should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">3. That the verdict is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">We think it was fairly within the proofs and does not indicate that it is the result of passion, prejudice or mistake. Consequently it should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The rule is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
