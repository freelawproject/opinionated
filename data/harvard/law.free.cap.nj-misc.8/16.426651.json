The property has a frontage of seventy-five feet on West Fifth avenue and a depth of two hundred feet. Upon the property is a two-story and attic frame house recently remodeled so as to provide accommodation for two families.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Roselle has a zoning ordinance pursuant to the constitution of the state and chapter 274 of the laws of 1928. Under this ordinance relator\u2019s property is in a zone where occupancy by two families is forbidden. A similar ordinance was in existence when he purchased the property in 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">An appeal from the action of the building inspector in refusing to issue a certificate of occupancy was taken to the board of adjustment, who upheld his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-13\">There is nothing in the record to rebut the presumption that the ordinance is a reasonable exercise of the police power. <em>Oxford Construction Co. </em>v.
