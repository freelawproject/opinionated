However, the respondent, in order to take care of the children of the deceased, offered to settle the case on the basis of the payment of $2,000 to the widow and a counsel fee of $200 to the attorney for the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">The petitioner, Mrs. Rose Curto, was placed on the stand and questioned in regard to the settlement, and she stated that a settlement on this basis was entirely satisfactory to her. Accordingly, after a complete consideration of this matter, the referee found that it was to the best interests of all parties to settle the matter on the basis outlined above and accordingly approved of a compromise settlement on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">$$$$$$ *</p>\n<author id=\"b670-13\">John J.
