The husband sued to recover for loss of consortium and moneys necessarily expended by him to accomplish the cure of his wife, and the wife\u2019s claim was for compensation for pain and suffering and loss of wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The case was tried at the Passaic Circuit and resulted in a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">We cannot say from a fair reading of the testimony that it is clear to us that the finding of the jury in favor of the defendant was the result of mistake, partiality, prejudice or passion, and, therefore, we have reached the conclusion that the rule should be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
