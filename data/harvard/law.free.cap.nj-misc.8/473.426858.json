The ordinance does not prohibit apartment houses. It further appears that on January 11th, 1930, Jersey City had in preparation a new zoning ordinance, but with respect to whether or not it since has been passed the record is silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The city now urges, among other things, that, in view of the fact that a new zoning ordinance is in preparation it should not now be required to grant the permit in question, especially since there is now outstanding in possession of the relators a permit authorizing the construction of the apartment houses <em>'five feet from the building line.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In this state of uncertainty as to the pertinent factual situation especially with respect to an outstanding permit inconsistent with the one now applied for, we think that the proper course is to award an alternative writ in order that thereby, with the return and other pleadings, the issue may be framed. An alternative writ is awarded accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
