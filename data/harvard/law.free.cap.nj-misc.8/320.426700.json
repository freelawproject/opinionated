The second count alleges there is due the plaintiff the sum of $792.79 for sundry goods sold and delivered, between January 3d, 1927, and October 20th, 1927, under an agreement between the parties, that the plaintiff should charge a reasonable price for the goods sold. The defendant filed an answer and counter-claim. The trial resulted in a directed verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of $848.18 and a verdict of no cause of action, as to the defendant\u2019s counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a nonsuit as to both counts, which was refused by the trial court, to which ruling an exception was noted. This is the alleged error as a ground of appeal. No testimony was offered by the defendant. It is sufficient to say, as part of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, <em>Exhibit </em>P-3a and <em>Exhibit </em>P-5a were introduced into evidence, being letters, <em>Exhibit </em>P-3a signed J. B. McClellan and <em>Exhibit </em>P-5a signed McClellan Studios, Incorporated, LeEoy D. McClellan, treasurer, in which <em>Exhibit </em>P-3 a, it is stated, \u201cbut about the 1st of September we will pay <em>some </em>off, as soon as business picks up we will clear up the balance. Trusting you will grant us this length of time;\u201d <em>Exhibit P-5 </em>a, \u201cwe will start payment of your account in the latter part of January as we are not doing a thing at this time.\u201d This evidence precludes a nonsuit by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Finding no error in the record the judgment of the Atlantic County Circuit Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
