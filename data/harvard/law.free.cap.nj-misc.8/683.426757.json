The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the jury awarding her $20,854.08. We are asked to set aside this verdict upon two grounds\u2014first, because it is against the weight of the evidence; second, because it is excessive. Our examination of the proofs satisfies us that the jury was justified in its finding that decedent\u2019s death was due solely to the carelessness of defendant\u2019s employe in the driving of the latter\u2019s truck; and that, although the award is large, it is not so clearly excessive as to justify us in setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
