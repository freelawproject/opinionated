The factual situation is that the state highway commission desired for highway purposes a portion of these leased lands and the plaintiff below as owner of the title in remainder conveyed to said highway commission eight hundred and twenty-three one-thousandths of an acre of a total of two and two hundred and thirty-eight one-thousandths acres, expressly subject to the estate and interest of the defendant below under its lease. Subsequently the state highway commission instituted proceedings to condemn the defendant-lessee\u2019s interest in such -lands. This proceding resulted in an award to the defendant of $9,822.32 \u201cas the value of the leasehold interest in said lands and damages thereto as aforesaid.\u201d Such was the language of the report of the condemnation commissioners. This sum has been paid to and accepted by the defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Two grounds of reversal are urged by the appellant. 1. That the proceeding in question amounted to an eviction of it as tenant and entitles it to an abatement of the rent reserved proportionate to the nature and extent of the eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We think this is not legally or logically sound, but conclude that the proper rule is that laid down in 1 <em>Washb. Beal Prop. </em>324, which is as follows: \u201cIt has sometimes been attempted to apply the principle of eviction from a part of the premises where lands under lease have been appropriated to public use, under the exercise of eminent domain * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>but the better rule, and one believed to be adopted in most of the states, is that such a taking operates, so far as the lessee is concerned, upon his interest as property for which the public are to make him compensation, and does not affect his liability to pay rent for the entire estate according to the tenor of his lease, and this extends to ground rent; such taking does not abate any part of the rent due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">2. No provision is made in the statute under which the condemnation proceedings were had for the inclusion in an award made to compensate the tenant and no such amount, was included in the award made to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We conclude that this is without legal merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The statute in question directs the commissioners \u201cto appraise the said land or property and assess the damages,\u201d \u201cto view and examine the land * * * and make a just and equitable assessment of the amount to be paid by the petitioner for such land and damages aforesaid,\u201d and further provides that where a part of a tract is taken compensation shall be made for the value of that part taken and damages awarded, if any for and toward the portion not taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Here about one-third of the leased lands was taken and the lease had eleven years and four months to run. Computing the rent reserved for this term would be about $6,800; the award was $9,822.32, and the difference is $3,000. The commissioners were controlled by the measure of value of leaseholds laid down in <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Eisner, </em>100 <em>N. J. Nq. </em>101, namely the present value of the difference between the market value of the leasehold and the rent reserved, and we must say that the commissioners in their award not only applied this rule but also allowed in their award damages amounting to or being tantamount to an abatement in the rental value of the premises by reason of taking the part in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Wo conclude that this ground of appeal is likewise without legal substance and that the judgment under review must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
