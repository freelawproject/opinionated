Plaintiff instituted suit against the defendant and such action was tried November 29th, 1927, resulting in a verdict against the defendant for six cents. Under a rule to show cause obtained by the plaintiff this court set the verdict aside and directed a new trial as to damages only. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>700.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">On February 11th, 1930, the cause was retried, resulting in a verdict of $500 against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">The present rule is held by the defendant who seeks to set aside the verdict assigning and arguing three reasons, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">1. Error in the charge of the court in withdrawing from the jury consideration of nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">Under the facts and circumstances established we are unable to find prejudicial error in the instruction complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">2. The verdict is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-17\">This we find not to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-18\">3. Error in permitting an actuary to testify as to capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>sums necessary to produce $200 and $100 per year during the life expectancy of a woman thirty-one years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">We find no substance in this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The rule will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
