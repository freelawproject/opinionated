The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendants, and the contention before us is that this verdict was contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>weight of the evidence. Out consideration of the testimony relating to the conditions under which the collision occurred leads us to the conclusion that the jury was entirely justified in its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
