Since there was no agreement as to the facts, but on the contrary it was insisted that the facts were not fully stated and some of those stated were in dispute, it seems to us the proper course, as matters now stand, is to grant an alternative writ, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
