The rule was denied, hence, an application to the court <em>in banc. Pamph. L. </em>1927, <em>p. </em>396, does not prevent this application from being made, that statute has no application. It would serve no useful purpose to pursue the argument of the relators through all the points argued in the brief; suffice it to say, we think the rule should be denied. The writ of <em>mandamus </em>is discretionary. <em>Silvester </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Princeton, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>18. It is never issued, where the legal right of the relator is in doubt or unsettled. <em>Erion </em>v. <em>Pension Commission, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>464. The case of <em>Kaslovisky </em>v. <em>Castles, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>599, is an authority for denying the rule. The application for a rule to show cause is therefore denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
