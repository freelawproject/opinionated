This power cannot be so delegated by the municipality. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Mravlag, </em>115 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>350.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Section 5 of the ordinance provides for imprisonment not exceeding ninety days or a fine of $150, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\"><em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>ch. </em>152, <em>art. </em>10, \u00a7 7, provides that the governing body of every municipality may prescribe a penalty for violation of any ordinance, either by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding ninety days, or a fine not exceeding $200, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">It will be seen that the ordinance should only have fixed the maximum of fine as provided by the statute, leaving to the magistrate the exercise of the discretion imposed by the statute. Instead, the council of the city exercised this dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>cretion in the ordinance without reference to the offender or the circumstances of the violation, and deprived the magistrate of any consideration of whether his discretion should be exercised in dealing with the offender to inflict a lesser fine. <em>Massinger </em>v. <em>Millville, </em>63 <em>N.
