The rule to show cause contained a provision that it should not be a waiver of any grounds of appeal existing in favor of defendant. Just what the reasons considered on the rule were, we do not find disclosed by the state of the case. But that for present purposes is immaterial. Eor looking at the grounds of appeal we find none which can possibly help the appellant. None of them point out any cause for reversal \u00a1with sufficient precision to apprise the court or opposing counsel of the injury complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">In order, however, to be sure that no injustice has been done, we have considered the matter which has been argued in appellant\u2019s brief, and find no merit in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
