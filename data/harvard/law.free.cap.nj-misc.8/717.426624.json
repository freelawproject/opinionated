Decedent was a policeman, and while riding his motorcycle homeward from Morristown at night collided with a truck and was fatally injured. The workmen\u2019s compensation bureau made an award, which, on appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">The first point made for the prosecutor is that there was no evidence to support a finding that the accident arose out of and in course of employment. Our examination of the evidence satisfies us to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">The second point is that by the terms of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1913, <em>p. </em>230, no compensation should be awarded, as the earnings of deceased exceeded the maximum figure mentioned in the statute and put him out of the class to be compensated. Counsel admits that <em>Jersey City </em>v. <em>Borst, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>454; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>101 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>1033, is to the contrary, but saj^s it was wrongly decided. However, it seems to have stood for thirteen years as the law, and the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>requires our adherence to it as settling the law for present purposes. <em>Hornsby </em>v. <em>Perth </em>Amboy, 99 <em>N. J. L. </em>277; <em>Public Service Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Matteucci, </em>143 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>221; 6 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1545.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The judgment and award under review are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
