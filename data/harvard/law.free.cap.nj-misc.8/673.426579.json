The plaintiff\u2019s decedent was a conductor in the employ of the Erie railroad at the time of the happening of the accident, and was in charge of a train running from. Caldwell to Jersey City. The accident occurred on a Sunday morning in January about half past ten o\u2019clock. The decedent, desiring to obtain a Sunday newspaper, caused the train to be stopped opposite to a news store for the purpose of purchasing the newspaper. The stop was not a regular station. Plaintiff\u2019s decedent left the train, crossed over Bloomfield avenue, which adjoined and ran parallel to the right of way of the railroad, went into the store, purchased a newspaper, and in attempting to cross Bloomfield avenue on his return to the train was struck by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the defendant\u2019s automobile. The proofs showed that there had been a heavy storm on the preceding day; that the sidewalk on Bloomfield avenue had been cleared of the snow, which had been thrown into the gutter, causing an embankment of a foot or two in-height; and that the sidewalk itself, the embankment and the roadway of Bloomfield avenue were covered with ice. The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the jury finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of the defendant in the driving of his automobile, and that it was not contributed to by any negligence on the part of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The finding of the jury on the question of the contributory negligence of the decedent is so clearly against the weight of the evidence, in our opinion, that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. The principal witness called by the plaintiff was one Tichenor, who was a passenger on the train and was the only person who observed decedent\u2019s movenants continually from the time the latter left the newspaper store until he was struck by the defendant\u2019s automobile. Upon his cross-examination he described the accident as follows: <em>\"Q. </em>Now, when Mr. Schoonover came out of the newspaper store, did you notice what he had in his hand? <em>A. </em>He had a newspaper. <em>Q. </em>You knew he was going for a paper, didn\u2019t you? <em>A. </em>Yes; I saw him with a newspaper. <em>Q. </em>Did he run as he came out of the newspaper store? <em>A. </em>No, he didn\u2019t run; he couldn\u2019t run. <em>Q. </em>He slid? <em>A. </em>Yes. <em>Q. </em>He slid along the sidewalk? <em>A. </em>Yes. <em>Q. </em>Did he slide over the curb? <em>A. </em>He did. <em>Q. </em>He slipped over the curb into Mr. De Camp\u2019s car, didn\u2019t he? <em>A. </em>Just what he did, yes. <em>Q. </em>It was a continual slide ? <em>A. </em>Yes, it was. <em>Q. </em>Right from the point of the newspaper store right into Mr. De Camp\u2019s car was a continual slide, wasn\u2019t it? <em>A. </em>That is just exactly what it was. . <em>Q. </em>He did not stop once, Mr. Tichenor, from the time he left the newspaper store, the door, rather, until there was the collision, did he? <em>A. </em>No. <em>Q. </em>Didn\u2019t stop? <em>A. </em>He attempted to stop as he saw Mr. De Camp\u2019s car. <em>Q. </em>Yes, that was the time he threw his hands up? <em>A. </em>Yes, that is right. <em>Q. </em>That was the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>time he looked, wasn\u2019t it? A. Yes, it was. <em>Q. </em>And the time he looked for the first time Mr. De Camp\u2019s ear was five feet away? A. Approximately. <em>Q. </em>That is, when he threw his hands up you say he still slipped, slipped down under the car; isn\u2019t that true? A. Yes, he was about two feet off of the curb.\u201d This testimony was not controverted by other evidence offered either on behalf of the plaintiff or by testimony submitted by the defendant. It demonstrates, as we think, that the accident was the result partially at least of the contributory negligence of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The rule to show cause will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
