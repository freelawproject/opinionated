Such grant is specifically made \u201csubject to any rights heretofore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>granted by the legislature of this state to the city of Cape May in and over the beach strand, lying between high and low water marks of said Atlantic ocean * *</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Several questions are raised by the relator, the principal ones amongst which are the power of the legislature to grant to the city of Cape May the powers which were attempted by the act of 1875, <em>supra; </em>that such act is unconstitutional; that the ordinance of the city of 1878, <em>supra, </em>is uncertain as to the lands attempted to be brought under control and that such attempted control of the strand by the city under such ordinance is invalid because it is the taking of private property without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We think there is nothing of legal substance in any of these contentions and for that reason the application for the writ should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">If, however, upon the other hand it can be said that these grounds are substantial then serious and important legal questions are raised by them reaching toward and into valuable property rights creating a situation where the right to the permit sought by the relator is uncertain, doubtful and not clear, and for that reason the discretion of this court should be exercised in the direction of refusing the writ applied for. <em>Board of Public Utility Commissioners </em>v. <em>Lehigh Valley Railroad </em>Co., 7 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>160, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The application for the writ of <em>mandamus </em>is, therefore, denied, and the rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
