His injury was the fracture of three processes of the vertebrae. He was in a plaster cast from the time of the accident, August 16th, 1928, until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>latter part of October of the same year, and at the time of the trial, March 8th, 1930, was still incapacitated and it appears fairly certain that to have a recovery that will permit him to work he will have to undergo a serious operation. He has a verdict for $1,050.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">His father, the other plaintiff, had expended or obligated himself to expend, up to the time of trial $504.25 in seeking to effect a cure of the son\u2019s injuries. The further operation, said to be necessary, will cost $500. From the time of the happening for a period of at least six months the father lost the value of the son\u2019s services in his business and since that time has had them only to a limited degree. The father\u2019s verdict is $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">We are asked to set these verdicts aside as being inadequate. We are satisfied that they are inadequate and therefore the rule will be made absolute and a <em>venire de novo </em>issue as to the damages only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
