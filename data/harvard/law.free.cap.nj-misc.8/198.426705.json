This being true we think the indictment fatally defective. <em>State </em>v. Lyon, 45 <em>N. J. L. </em>272; <em>State </em>v. Cohen, 7 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The case, but recently brought before us, is speedily disposed of to the end that a new indictment may be found before the statute of limitations shall intervene to protect the defendant from prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The motion to quash will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
