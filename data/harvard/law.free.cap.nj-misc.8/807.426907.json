A motion to quash was made and denied. The defendant also filed a special plea setting up the alleged illegality of the indictment, owing to the facts and circumstances surrounding the discharge of the grand jury on July 25th, 1930, and its reinstatement on August 9th, 1930. This was overruled. It thus appears that this case is in much the same posture as the case of State <em>v. </em>Miller, decided at this term of this court, and for the reasons therein expressed the writ of <em>certiorari </em>applied for will be denied, and the rule to show cause discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
