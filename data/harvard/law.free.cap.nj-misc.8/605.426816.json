The injuries to Mrs. Gutbrodt, as proved, consisted of a broken arm, injuries to the neck which left a large scar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>inability to rest, sleeplessness and what was described by the physicians as a double sight which causes her to stagger in walking. Mentally she is left in a weakened condition with loss of memory and is described as unfit to take her place in society or to become a mother. Such a condition, if believed by the jury to exist, presented a serious case of physical impairment and mental disturbance which were not improperly appraised as represented in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The verdict in favor of the child was justified by the proofs. The proofs established the loss of a number of teeth and a broken jaw, which caused a distortion of the face, changing his physical appearance. We cannot say that $5,000 was-excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">On the question of liability the case was clearly one for the jury and on the evidence produced the jury\u2019s finding should not be disturbed. It was shown that the parties were-driving in opposite directions along the Lincoln Highway between Lawreneeville and Princeton. A collision occurred due, it was claimed, to the defendant swerving his car from its proper side of the highway to the side on which plaintiffs, were proceeding. The facts themselves and the proof to-sustain them were peculiarly jury questions, and we cannot say that the result reached was unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The remaining grounds consist of alleged trial errors and call for no special mention. Our examination leads us to-the view that none of them are substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">It would serve no useful purpose to grant a rule and further extend litigation. The application is therefore denied..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
