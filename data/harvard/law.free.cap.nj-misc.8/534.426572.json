Preceding them was a car owned and operated by the defendant. The complaint is that this car suddenly and without any warning turned to its left across the higlrwuy, in order to enter a driveway just as the plaintiff\u2019s car was in the act of overtaking and passing it. The result was a collision in which the plaintiff Pauline Jensen was injured, and both cars were damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Pauline Jensen sued for damages for personal injuries, her husband, Peter Jensen, for damages to his car and the defendant, Kinsley, counter-claimed for damages to his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">The result of a trial of the cause was a verdict of no cause of action against all of the parties. Such a verdict demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>strates that the jury found that both Peter Jensen and Daniel R. Kinsley were negligent and their negligence produced and caused the happening.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">However, from the proofs, it is impossible for us to find how the jury was justified in finding against the plaintiff Pauline C. Jensen.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The rule to show cause will therefore be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
