Sufficient to say that our examination of the record leads us to the conclusion that the award to the husband was not so exorbitant as to be disturbed; but that the amount awarded to Eose Eivello is excessive and should be reduced to $1,500. If the last named plaintiff will remit the excess of damages over the amount named, the rule will be discharged; if not, the verdict as to the damages awarded her will be set aside and a new trial awarded as to such damages; the verdicts standing good in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
