In that respect the correctness of the verdict is placed in very great doubt and has every appearance of a compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Under such circumstances it should not be set aside as to damages only but <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Although the rule is limited this court has power to enlarge it. <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Blade, 1 N. J. Mis. R. </em>4; <em>Gyorfy v. Levy, Ibid. </em>157; <em>Stoll </em>v. <em>Shantz, </em>6 <em>Id. </em>1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">We conclude that this ease is a case calling for the exercise of such power</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">The rule to show cause is therefore made absolute and a <em>venire de novo </em>will issue for the retrial of all the issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
