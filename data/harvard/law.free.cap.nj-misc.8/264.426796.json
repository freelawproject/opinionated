Defendant\u2019s explanation was that he turned to the curb distant five feet on his right to avoid striking a boy who darted out from his left side. The plaintiff Yerner testified that defendant had given him a different explanation. This the defendant denied. We think a fair jury question was presented and that the rule should be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
