The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the jury awarding him $5,000, and we are now asked to set the verdict aside first because the proofs did not justify a finding that the accident was the result of carelessness on the part of the defendant, and second, because the verdict is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">Our examination of the proofs satisfies us that neither of these contentions have substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">\u25a0 We conclude, therefore, that the rule to show cause should be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
