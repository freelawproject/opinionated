WINGERT, GENERAL ADMINISTRATRIX AND ADMINISTRATRIX AD PROSEQUENDUM OF WILLIAM WINGERT, DECEASED, PLAINTIFF, v. ALEX DANSON, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b359-4\">Submitted October term, 1929</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AFI\">Decided May 6, 1930.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b359-7\">Before Gtjmmere, Chief Justice, and Justices Kalisch and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-8\">Eor the plaintiff, <em>Francis A.

The plaintiff, as general administratrix, has a verdict of $6,000. Upon the count in the complaint alleging right to recover damages for the death of her decedent, plaintiff as administratrix <em>ad prosequendum </em>was nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Under the plaintiff\u2019s rule the sole ground urged is directed at the alleged error in nonsuiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">We think this was not error. <em>Migliaccio </em>v. <em>Public Service Railway Co., </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>496; <em>affirmed, </em>102 <em>Id. </em>442. Also, see same ease, No. 35 of this term of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">Under the defendant\u2019s rule, portions of the court\u2019s charge instructing the jury that they might consider aggravation of a cancerous condition from which decedent was suffering, are attacked as being erroneous. We think this is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Defendant further attacks the verdict as being excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">We do not find it to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">The rules will therefore be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
