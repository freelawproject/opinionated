Respondent has a verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">It is urged that this judgment should be set aside and reversed upon the grounds, generally speaking, because the trial court erred in refusing to nonsuit and to direct a verdict in favor of appellant. After verdict appellant had a rule to show-cause why the verdict should not be set aside and urged and argued as grounds therefor that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and excessive. Upon a hearing under such rule the trial court discharged it. Where it is urged under such a rule the verdict is against .the weight of the evidence such insistence is tantamount to an admission that there was some evidence, although insufficient, to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the verdict. Under such circumstances a reservation of exceptions to refusal to nonsuit or direct a verdict is unavailing as a ground of appeal. <em>Catterall </em>v. <em>Otis Elevator Co., </em>103 <em>N. J.
