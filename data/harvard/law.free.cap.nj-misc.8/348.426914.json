There was no brokerage agreement in writing but the plaintiff-appellant relies upon section 10 of the statute of frauds (1 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1453) as a basis for his right to recover. A judgment of nonsuit was directed in favor of the defendant Simon Miller, and at the close of the entire case a verdict was directed in favor of the remaining defendant, Pauline Miller, and a judgment against the plaintiff below entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">For reversal of such judgments various grounds are urged. \u25a0 1. Error in rulings excluding evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">We find no error in such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">2. and 3. Error in nonsuiting as to Simon Miller and directing a verdict in favor of Pauline Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">We are unable, from the proofs, to find any merit in either of these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">The judgments under review will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
