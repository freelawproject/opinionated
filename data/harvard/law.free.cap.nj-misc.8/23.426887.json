The jury returned a verdict in favor of the boy\u2019s mother for $1,000 for expenses incurred by her, and a verdict in favor of the lad for $1,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 rule for a new trial rests on the issue of \u2022the adequacy of the damages in favor of the boy. In the light of the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 physician that he has made a complete recovery and that he merely suffers from a little toeing-in, it is unnecessary to disturb the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
