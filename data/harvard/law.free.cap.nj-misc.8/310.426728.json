Assignment 4 and specification 4\u2014\u201cBecause the trial court refused to sustain the defendant\u2019s objection to the following question: \u201cWith your wife ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">We quote the questions and answers pertinent to this point:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-18\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What.is your wife\u2019s name? <em>A. </em>I can\u2019t just think. It is Anna Mazcinko. <em>Q. </em>What is your name? <em>A. </em>Wyckoff. <em>Q. </em>Are you married to her? <em>A. </em>Yes, sir. <em>Q. </em>When were you married? <em>A. </em>On May 4th, 1924. <em>Q. </em>Where were you living on January 28th, 1929? \u25a0 <em>A. </em>Living at the Hotel Bel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>mont in Newark. <em>Q. </em>With yonr wife? Mr. Cutley\u2014I object to it\u2014it is immaterial whether he was or not. The Court \u2014I will admit it. Mr. Cutley\u2014I ask for an exception. Exception allowed, signed and sealed. <em>Q. </em>I beg your pardon? <em>A. </em>It wasn\u2019t my wife. Mr. Dunn (assistant prosecutor)\u2014 Will that young lady come forward? Mr. Cutley\u2014I would like to have my objection noted to this procedure. The Court \u2014Your objection will be noted. Mr. Cutley\u2014And an exception. <em>Q. </em>Do you know this young lady? <em>A. </em>Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The question under attack was assuredly not relevant to any issue in the cause under trial, and, undoubtedly, the answer was improperly admitted. However, we are unable to see how one upon trial charged with assault and battery with intent to kill can be prejudiced by the fact that he was then living with a woman not his wife unless such relationship had something to do with the assault and battery. In the present case it did not. While we do not approve of the tactics employed by the state and notwithstanding that in holding that the question objected to should not have been permitted to be answered, still we are unable to say, upon the whole case, such error prejudiced the plaintiff in error in maintaining his defense upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">2. Alleged error in the charge of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u201cThe burden of proof is on the state. By that I do not mean it is necessary for the state to produce more witnesses numerically than the defendant, but it must produce witnesses whose testimony carries greater weight with you than the testimony of the witnesses produced on the part of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The complaint against this instruction seems to be that it is probable that it gave the jury to understand that the state must prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence rather than to a point beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">A reading of the entire charge absolutely controverts this imputation. The particular excerpt above quoted, and relied upon, is both preceded and followed by full and abundant instructions that the state must establish the guilt of the plaintiff in error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>3. That the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. This is wholly without factual substance. A most casual reading and consideration of the proofs abundantly refutes this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
