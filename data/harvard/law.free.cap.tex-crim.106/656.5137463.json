The juror also testified that the prosecuting witness identified some of the lumber by the paper on it; that if it had had paper on it, it would have been worn off by its use as a floor in the hog pen. The court declined to receive this testimony and we are not able to determine its materiality. It seems to have been merely a debate touching the evidence rather than new evidence. It was more in the nature of an argument among the jurors touching the construction to be placed upon the testimony. Todd v. State, 93 Tex. Crim. Rep. 555; Jack v. State, 20 Tex. Crim. Rep. 660. At all events, in the absence of a statement of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>we are not able to determine whether there was error, or that the matter was material, but must assume that the trial court reached a correct conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AUk\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
