We are of the opinion that this testimony, under the facts and circumstances of the case, should have been excluded. The fact that appellant was seen in an automobile with his arm around another woman and was seen to kiss said woman, would have no relevancy to show that he had deserted his wife and child. The testimony in both instances, we think, is inadmissible and should not have been introduced. Moore v. State, 218 S. W. 1059, 87 Tex. Crim.
