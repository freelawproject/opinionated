Appellant objected to the court sending the message on the ground that it was an interference with the jury in their deliberations, and because it would probably have the effect of forcing a verdict. The sheriff delivered the judge\u2019s message and upon his return reported that the jury said, \u201cAsk the judge to give us a few minutes.\u201d The bill states that \u201cshortly thereafter\u201d the jury returned their verdict and that appellant excepted to the action of the court in \u201ccommunicating with the jury without bringing them into open court because his action in effect forced a verdict against the defendant.\u201d In briefing the point the appellant insists that the action of the court was in violation of Art. 671, C. C. P., which is:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u201cNo person shall be permitted to be with a jury while they are deliberating upon a case, nor be permitted to converse with a juror after he has been impaneled, except in the presence and by the permission of the court, or except in a case of misdemeanor where the jury have been permitted by the court to separate. No person shall be permitted to converse with the juror about the case on trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Appellant is insisting on a construction of the statute which would give it such application as not heretofore invoked. The cases cited by him, among them being Mauney v. State, 85 Tex. Crim. Rep. 184, 210 S. W. 959; Early v. State, 103 S. W. 873; Mann v. State, 204 S. W. 434; Touissant v. State, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep. 514, 244 S. W. 514, clearly show that the statute has been applied to prevent conversation by jurors with outsiders. We think it has no application to an officer of the court acting under the direct authority of the trial judge in a matter looking to the orderly and proper dispatch of the business of the court, and which is not shown to have operated injuriously to accused. The Osborne case, 93 Tex. Crim. Rep. 54, 245 S. W. 928, is not in point. There the action of the trial judge, which was condemned, was. going into the jury room and discussing with the jury the meaning of the court\u2019s instructions theretofore given. In the present case there is no pretense that the sheriff did more than deliver the judge\u2019s message and return the jury\u2019s answer. The trial judge should always exercise great care in any communication with the jury in order that it might not be calculated to force from them a verdict. We cannot bring ourselves to conclude that anything in the court\u2019s conduct in the present case is subject to such inference. Finding that he could not proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>with another trial on account of lack of jurors it was, doubtless his purpose to ascertain if it would be necessary to order tales-men or whether the jury in the present case would likely be available within a reasonable time. The statement in the bill that they did report \u201cshortly\u201d after the inquiry was made gives this court little information as to the time intervening between the inquiry and the report. The bill does not show that injury resulted to appellant. We think the rule that injury is presumed and the burden is on the state to rebut the presumption does not apply here as in the class of cases cited. The point discussed is the only one briefed for appellant. Another bill is found in the record which we have considered but it presents no error calling for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AcU7\">\n<em>-Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
