In the judgment and order of the District Court it appears that evidence was heard. No statement of the evidence heard is before this court. The indictment charges a capital offense, and the question of right to bail would depend upon the evidence heard. Not having the evidence before us we are not in a position to pass upon its sufficiency and must assume that the trial judge, in denying bail, was justified by the facts before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">The application for a writ of habeas corpus is therefore denied and the relator ordered remanded to custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
