Jones. Conviction was for manslaughter, punishment being five years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">It is unnecessary to state the facts. The judgment must be reversed for a clear violation of the mandatory provision of Art. 710, C. C. P., which prohibits the allusion to or comment on accused\u2019s failure to testify. It is suggested by the State\u2019s Attorney that the bill of exception bringing the point forward may not be full enough. The bill shows that the language used by the County Attorney was: \u201cThis defendant not testifying, this defendant, I do not mean to refer to this defendant not testifying.\u201d It also shows that attorney for appellant immediately objected because the language was in violation of the statute and was a direct reference to the failure of appellant to testify, \u201cHe having elected to not testify in this cause.\u201d The bill in our opinion does not fail to show that appellant did not testify. The very language objected to makes it apparent and the further statement in quotation removes any possible doubt. It is unfortunate that the County Attorney forgot himself. Realizing at once the mistake he had made he undertook to retrieve it, but if the means employed had been intentional the failure of accused to testify could have been no more forcefully called to the jury\u2019s attention. As long as the statute remains as it is this court must enforce it. We find in the record an affidavit with reference to this matter, but in view of the court\u2019s approval of the bill of exception, together with the fact that he instructed the jury not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>to consider the remark of counsel, we cannot consider the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">Several other bills of exception are found in the record. Some of them are qualified. We think, as presented, none of them show error. One of them complains that the state was permitted to prove that \u201cdeceased did not make any effort to pull his gun out * * * just before the defendant shot him.\u201d Of cours\u00e9 the state had a right to prove, if it could, that deceased made no effort to draw a gun. The objection was that the question called for a conclusion of the witness, but the bill is not sufficiently full to make this apparent. The matter is upon a vital issue in the case and attention is directed to it in order that upon another trial examination of witnesses upon this point may not involve their conclusions if it did do so in the present trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\u25a0 The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\">ON STATE\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b606-7\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AuRt\">In his.motion for rehearing, state\u2019s counsel cites many authorities to the point that the complaint of the reference in argument of the failure of the accused to testify is not available in the absence of exceptions showing that the accused did not in fact testify. This rule has been asserted many times, and its existence is not open to question. In its application, however, to the present record we are not able to concur with the views of the State\u2019s Attorney. On the face of the bill, as shown in the original opinion, it is made to appear that counsel in argument did refer to the appellant\u2019s failure to testify, and an exception was immediately addressed and a bill reserved in which the language used, referring to the accused, is: \u201cHe having elected not to testify in this cause.\u201d In holding the bill sufficient to comply with the rule heretofore announced, the opinion is expressed that no violence has been done to the precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
