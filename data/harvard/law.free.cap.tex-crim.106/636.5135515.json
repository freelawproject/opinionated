The record further discloses that the deceased, Robert Schaffner, and Tommy Bell had engaged in a fight prior to the homicide, and that thereafter the Bell boys and other parties acting with them engaged in a fight with the deceased and his father, F. C. Schaffner, in the town of Sealy with the result that Robert Schaffner, his father, F. C. Schaffner, and two of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Bell boys were killed. It was the contention of the state that the appellant, acting with the Bell boys and other parties, was an actual participant in precipitating the fight and took an active part therein, and that his acts and motives were prompted by malice toward the said F. C. Schaffner, deceased. While the appellant failed to testify in his own behalf, he defended upon the ground, and introduced testimony to the effect, that he was not acting with the Bell boys and others in the fight, but, on the contrary, that he was standing near the scene of the difficulty engaged in a conversation with one Will Phenice when the fight began and suggested to said Phenice that they separate the parties, and that this was his only connection with the affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel rely upon two propositions for a reversal of this case. In bill of exception No. 1 the appellant complains of the action of the court, after the witness Will Phenice had testified favorably to appellant\u2019s defense and the state, on cross-examination, had proved by said witness that he had been indicted for theft, in refusing to permit the witness, on re-direct examination, to testify and explain the circumstances of said indictment for, The purpose of removing the imputation of untruthfulness that had been cast upon his testimony, and for the purpose of reinstating the witness before the jury. Upon objection by the state, the court refused to permit said witness to make the explanation, but offered to permit said witness to testify as to what became of the charges against him. We are of the opinion that the learned trial judge fell into error in refusing to permit this witness to explain said charges against him and to reinstate himself, if he could, before the jury by removing the cloud placed upon him and his testimony by reason of said charges. Tippett v. State, 37 Tex. Crim. Rep. 186; Wallace v. State, 82 Tex. Crim. Rep. 588, 200 S. W. 407; Skinner v. State, 251 S. W. 810; Randell v. State, 278 S. W. 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The appellant also complains of, and at the proper time objected and excepted to, the following portion of the court\u2019s charge on manslaughter:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\u201c (b) The act must be directly caused by the passion arising out of the provocation. It is not enough that the mind is merely agitated by the passion arising from some other provocation, or a provocation given by some other person than the party killed or other persons acting with the party killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The appellant contends that this charge was too restrictive in that it did not permit the jury to take into consideration the ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>acts and conduct of F. C. Schaffner, Hauley Vireck, and other persons acting with them, but restricted the jury to the consideration alone of the acts and conduct of Robert Schaffner, deceased, while the evidence showed that the other parties were acting with him at said time. We are of the opinion that the appellant\u2019s contention will have to be sustained, and that the learned trial judge should not have restricted the jury to the provocation of Robert Schaffner alone but should have instructed them to consider the acts and conduct of others who were acting with him at the time of the homicide. This issue was clearly raised by the testimony introduced in behalf of appellant to the effect that Robert Schaffner, deceased, and his father, F. C. Schaffner, deceased, Ernest Schaffner and Hauley Vireck were acting together in the fight. This court has held many times that it was error to restrict a manslaughter charge to the acts and conduct of one party alone where others were acting with such party at said time. Byrd v. State, 39 Tex. Grim. Rep. 609, 47 S. W. 721; Stacy v. State, 48 Tex. Crim. Rep. 97, 96 S. W. 327; Brown v. State, 54 Tex. Crim. Rep. 127, 112 S. W. 80; Garcia v. State, 70 Tex. Crim. Rep. 485, 156 S.

W. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">For the errors above discussed, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING BY STATE.</p>\n<author id=\"b657-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A4mM\">The state urges in its motion that we were wrong in holding that the trial court\u2019s refusal to let witness Phenice explain the theft charge which the state proved had been lodged against him, was error on the part of the lower court. It is contended'*\u2019that recent decisions of this court go further in reference to letting in detailed explanations in such cases, than the earlier holdings of the court do. It has been the uniform rule since the days when the Supreme Court had appellate jurisdiction of criminal cases in Texas, that a witness has the right to explain any fact brought out against him by the other party which tends to create distrust of the truthfulness or integrity of the witness. State v. Ivey, 41 Texas 38; Kunde v. State, 22 Tex. Crim. App. 98; Bruce v. State, 31 Tex. Crim. Rep. 594. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>general principle thus announced is believed to be the same as that here involved. In Tippett v. State, 37 Tex. Grim. Rep. 191, we seem to have first spoken directly on the point involved. A witness was shown in' that case to be under indictment for theft. We said in our opinion that on re-examination by the party introducing him the witness should have been allowed to state that he was a bona fide purchaser of the alleged stolen cattle, and that he had not stolen them. In Cowart v. State, 71 Tex. Crim. Rep. 116, we said that if the state proved that the accused had been indicted for embezzlement, he had the right to explain, at least in a general way to show the cases amounted to nothing, <em>and </em>that he was never tried or convicted upon them, <em>and </em>that they were dismissed. We also said \u201cHe might not go into details of the transaction.\u201d The state relies in the motion before us on what is said in the Cowart case, supra, and the Howard case, 111 S. W. 1038. We think the Howard case not in point but clearly distinguishable. In that case the witness proved to be under indictment, was not asked about such fact or to make any explanation, by the accused placed on the witness stand the attorney who represented the witness referred to, and offered to prove by the attorney that he had investigated the charges against his client and that there was no foundation for such charges. This testimony was rejected, and we correctly upheld its rejection. In the Tippett case, supra, the doctrine of the instant cas\u00e9is announced, not so much in detail but substantially, for if one against whom it has been shown that he is under indictment, may testify he did not steal the property in question but bought it and paid for it in good faith, the Rubicon is crossed, and the domain of detail is invaded. In the Cowart case, supra, we are at some loss to know just what the great judge writing the opinion meant when he said therein if one who had been asked if he was under indictment, and admitted it \u2014 that he might explain in a general way and show that the case amounted to nothing, <em>and </em>might show that the case had been dismissed or never tried. We are constrained to believe that if the attention of the judge of this court writing that opinion had been focused on this exact point and the decision in the Tippett case, supra, had been brought before him, as well as those cases announcing the general principle above referred to, he probably would not have used the expression in the opinion which is relied on by the state here but would have expressed himself, as was his wont, with vigorous clarity and in accord with the doctrine of the recent cases. How could one explain, even in a general way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>so that the explanation would have any weight or be of value, without some details?</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">There is a difference between the Tule in civil cases and in criminal cases in this state in regard to admitting testimony that one has been charged with crime as affecting the credibility of the person so charged, as a witness in court. The practice in criminal cases allows such proof. Manifestly when one has been so charged, and the case against him has subsequently been dismissed or an acquittal had, the question of the reflective force of proof of the fact that he has been charged merely, might be doubtful. If either party know in advance \u2014 and the very fact of asking such question would afford ground for presumption of such knowledge \u2014 that the charge against the witness has been dismissed or that he had been acquitted, it would seem to be fair for such party to ask of the witness if he has not been so charged, under peril of having the party thus attacked make his statement that he was not guilty, or make such explanation as he reasonably desires in connection therewith. Upon the testimony of such attacked witness, however, we think the matter should rest and that other witnesses might not be called on the issue, as was attempted in the Howard case, supra. To us this rule seems fair. Even if one who admits that he has been convicted attempts to make some explanation in mitigation or refutation of the reflection resulting from such proof, and the attacking party be denied the right to introduce testimony controverting this issue, it still seems the attacking party would have the best of the argument. We are unable to agree with the state\u2019s contention in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Upon the other proposition advanced in the motion, viz.: that we erred in holding the charge on manslaughter too restrictive because it did not permit the jury to take into consideration the acts and conduct of others beside the deceased, we are constrained, upon re-examination of the record, to think we were correct. Careful analysis of the charge excepted to shows that in fact the trial court in effect told the jury that they could not take into consideration the acts of persons acting with deceased, in arriving at a solution of appellant\u2019s claim that he was acting under passion arising from an adequate cause in killing deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The state\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">\n<em>State\u2019s motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Morrow, P.
