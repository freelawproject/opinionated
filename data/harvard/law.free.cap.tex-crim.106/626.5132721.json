The case was tried in April, 1926, after the taking effect of the Revised Criminal Statutes of Texas on September 1, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Art. 820aa of the Penal Code of Texas of 1918 specifically forbade one operating an automobile upon a public highway without having displayed upon the front and the back number plates corresponding with the number assigned to such car by the Highway Department of this state. The codifiers omitted from the statutes as compiled and adopted by the Thirty-Ninth Legislature said Art. 820aa. Art. 17 of the 1925 P. C., which became effective on September 1 of said year, specifically provides that no offense committed and no fine, forfeiture or penalty incurred under existing lawis previous to the time when this code takes effect' shall be affected by the repeal herein of any such laws, but the punishment of such offense * * * shall take place as if the law repealed had remained in force. We regard the provisions of this statute just referred to as applicable. Under the law as it existed at the time of the filing of this complaint, and under the testimony offered on behalf of the state upon this trial, we have no doubt but that there was a violation of the statute on the part of appellant. He is shown to have operated a car for a considerable time, upon the public highways of Wichita County, without having any number plates upon it at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">There are three bills of exception in the record. No. 1 complains of the testimony of the witness Glenn, who said: \u201cI had seen him before this operating without a license and on the Iowa Park road, and before w&lt;e had the conversation.\u201d We cannot tell from the bill what the conversation was, nor what the relevance of the testimony objected to might be. It certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>was material to prove by some witness that he had seen appellant operating his car without a license number. The bill reveals no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">Bill of exceptions No. 2 complains of the refusal of the learned trial judge to permit appellant to state what his intention was in regard to violating the law when he drove his truck. The bill shows that the question was asked and the answer made. There is nothing to show that the answer was excluded. We think the question and answer would be improper, and if objection had been duly made it should have been sustained. It is not shown that the matter did not go before the jury. The remaining bill is to the refusal of an instructed verdict favorable to appellant. We perceive no error in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b646-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AbQ\">Appellant brings forward but one claim in his motion, that being that we erred in upholding the action of the lower court in permitting the officer to testify that he had seen appellant driving his truck without license on more than one occasion. A careful review of the effect of this testimony does not lead us to change our minds. Appellant admitted himself that he had been driving the truck for quite a while without a license. The jury gave him the lowest fine. We are unable to perceive any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Morrow, P. J., not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"A7R8\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
