The record is before us without a statement of facts or bills of exception, and this court is therefore unable to determine whether or not the trial court committed error in passing upon the application. In the absence of a statement of facts, the presumption prevails in this court that the action of the trial court in refusing to grant said application was proper and that no error was committed.

The allegations in an application or petition for writ of habeas corpus are not evidence and cannot be considered as such, although the same are duly verified. Ex Parte Barnes, 166 S.
