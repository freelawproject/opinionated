The motion for new trial set up the fact that by a number of witnesses appellant could prove that he was a kleptomaniac, that is, a person who has an irresistible impulse to steal. Appellant\u2019s attorney is one of the party who makes the affidavit that such fact can be established in behalf of the accused. Certainly, if it was known to appellant\u2019s attorney that such was the situation of his client, the testimony could in no sense be said to be newly discovered. We do not think the learned trial judge abused his discretion in overruling the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
