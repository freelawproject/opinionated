As shown by the bill of exceptions, a witness was permitted to testify that when prosecutrix came home she was crying and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>complained of feeling sick, and told witness that Clifford Taylor had tried to rape her; that he carried her upstairs to a room and was wrestling with her, and that she got her feet wet and lost her slipper. We do not think it error to receive the testimony. Reid v. State, 287 S. W. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The evidence seems ample to support the conviction. Prosecutrix was a girl fifteen years old, and testified positively to the act of intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
