Timely objections were urged because of this omission, and a special charge on the subject was presented, which was refused, as is shown by bill of exception No. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">As was said in the Lewis case, 231 S. W. 113:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">\u201cThe court does not determine the weight of the testimony nor whether it is true or false in concluding whether to submit manslaughter. His only duty is to ascertain if any evidence raises the issue, regardless of what he may think of its cogency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">\u201cIf there is evidence which, however weak or inconclusive it may seem to the court, tends to prove facts from which the jury may deduce a finding of manslaughter,- it is error to fail to charge on it.\u201d Branch\u2019s Criminal Law, Sec. 504, and the collation of authorities supporting the text quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">Judge Lattimore, in the Steen case, 225 S. W. 531, made the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">\u201cThe causes named in our statute as adequate to reduce a homicide to manslaughter are well understood to be instances, and not limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">The appellant and deceased were strangers. The deceased and Violet Douglas were whispering to each other the first time the appellant saw them together, which was the night before the homicide. Shortly afterwards, Violet Douglas told appellant that deceased was going to make her \u201ccatch a rabbit.\u201d She was obviously afraid of him. Deceased had practically taken appellant\u2019s money from him the night before the homicide. Violet Douglas had signified to appellant that it would not be safe for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>him to protest or interfere. Appellant knew that Violet Douglas had told deceased that he was her half brother. The next morning \u2014 the morning of the homicide \u2014 Violet Douglas had told the appellant that Ragsdale \u201chad liked to have killed her\u201d and that she was afraid to ask him for appellant\u2019s money. She told appellant that deceased would kill her. Appellant knew that they were living with one another. He knew that deceased claimed her as his woman. He knew that deceased was drinking heavily. Appellant had seen deceased put his pistol in his shirt. The witnesses Ross and McGown had told appellant of their having been run out by deceased with a pistol. Appellant saw that they were frightened. Later deceased had come in saying that Violet Douglas had run away from him. Deceased had told appellant that \u201cthe old lady owns one-half interest in this house and I am running her part of it.\u201d Appellant was so exercised over the situation that he tried to find an officer. Violet Douglas was so frightened that she begged appellant to lock her up in one of the rooms and again told appellant that deceased was going to kill him. In order to avoid trouble, appellant told her to keep deceased away. Evidently he was apprehensive. The woman left the rooming house. Deceased had already gone. In a short while she and deceased' returned. When deceased appeared, appellant asked him to leave, telling him he had no business on the place, that he was drinking, and that appellant was trying to run a respectable house. Deceased, to quote the witness Caldwell, \u201cwas drunk; he certainly wasn\u2019t the Montie Ragsdale that I knew. I knew Montie Ragsdale pretty well, and he did not act like Montie Ragsdale.\u201d Violet Douglas said, \u201cWe are going to run this place to suit ourselves.\u201d The appellant demanded that they leave. The deceased himself replied, \u201cTo hell with you. We will go where we God-damned please.\u201d Deceased advanced along the counter. There was only sixteen inches between them, that being the width of the .counter. Deceased grabbed for the appellant with his left hand and reached at his shirt with his right, where appellant had seen him put his pistol only a few hours before. Appellant\u2019s back was to the wall; he had no means of escape. He fired and killed the deceased, not even knowing his name at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Can it be said that these facts would not produce in a person of ordinary temper that degree of anger, rage, resentment or terror sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We think there is no question that the evidence raises the issue of manslaughter, and, that being true, the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>of that issue should pass from the court to the jury under appropriate instructions. Steen v. State, 225 S. W. 531; Branch\u2019s Criminal Law, Sec. 504; Lewis v. State, 231 S. W. 113; Washington v. State, 151 S. W. 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Bills of exception Nos. 1 and 2 complain of the state being permitted on re-direct examination of the witness Maude Ham-ilton to prove by her certain facts tending to explain why she and deceased were convicted of the offense of fornication in the city of San Angelo. These bills present no error. The rule is where a witness has been impeached by proof that he had plead guilty and paid a fine for some offense, he is entitled on re-examination to show such explanatory circumstances in connection with the offense to which he plead guilty as would remove the implication of untruthfulness and serve to reinstate him as a witness. Branch\u2019s Annotated Penal Code, Sec. 172, page 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Some criticism is addressed to the charge in other parts than those discussed and there are other questions raised by bills of exception, but the matter complained of will not likely occur in another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">For the error discussed, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"Abv\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
