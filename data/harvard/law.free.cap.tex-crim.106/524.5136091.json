He stopped his car on the public square across the street just opposite the courthouse on the east side of the square. At the time he was driving said car he was drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">The charging part of the indictment in this case reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">\u201cDid then and there unlawfully, while under the influence of intoxicating liquors, drive and operate an automobile upon a public street within the limits of an incorporated town, to-wit: the public square, within the limits of the incorporated town of Center, Shelby County, Texas, against the peace and dignity of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">Appellant\u2019s first bill of exceptions complains that the trial court erred in not quashing the above indictment. The term public square is usually applied to land on which a courthouse is erected. In this state there are few county sites in which there is not set apart a certain block, part or parcel of land designated as the \u201cpublic square,\u201d and they are generally intended as sites for the erection of courthouses. That part of a public square used by the public to move about on, either on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>foot or in automobiles, buggies, wagons and other vehicles, constitutes and is a public highway. Bouvier defines a \u201cstreet\u201d as \u201ca public thoroughfare or highway in a city or village.\u201d It follows, therefore, that a public street or public square are one and, the same, being used interchangeably and synonymously. We, therefore, hold that the learned trial judge was correct in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to quash said indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Appellant\u2019s bill of exception No. 3 is nothing more nor less than a repetition of his objections and exceptions to the court\u2019s main charge. We have carefully reviewed such charge and find the same a correct enunciation of the principles of law involved in this case as well as a full and complete submission of all the issues raised by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">There being no errors in the record and the facts being amply sufficient to support the verdict, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b544-10\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A3r\">A deputy sheriff testified that he saw the appellant driving his automobile upon the street. Quoting the witness, he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">\u201cI went out to his car. Roy was driving it, and at that time, he was drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">On cross-examination he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">\u201cI did not know what he was drinking. I judge he was drunk from his appearance, * * * and his breath. He had no whiskey there, but had some empty bottles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">On re-direct examination he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">\u201cI could tell the contents of the bottles from the smell. It smelled like \u2018jake.\u2019 These were soda-water bottles, and had had \u2018jake\u2019 or jamaica ginger in them. When he drove up there and stopped his car, he fell over on the steering wheel, and I could see that he was drunk. At that time I smelled his breath. From my experience as an officer, I would say he had been drinking \u2018shinney\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">Another witness, Wilson, testified that he saw the appellant and said that he was drunk. He said:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">\u201cOf my own knowledge, I could not say he was actually \u2018dog drunk,\u2019 but he was drunk; but I could tell he had been drinking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>pretty heavily. I could smell his breath and tell he was drinking, but I don\u2019t reckon I could tell exactly what he had been drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">In his motion for rehearing, appellant earnestly contends that the case is one which depends upon circumstantial evidence alone. Circumstantial evidence is defined thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u201cIt is evidence of more facts than one, which, in combination, create the presumption that still another fact exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">See Bishop\u2019s New Crim. Proc., 4th Ed., Vol. 1, p. 672, Sec. 1073. A charge on circumstantial evidence is required when the state relies solely upon that character of evidence to secure a conviction. Hunnicutt v. State, 18 Tex. Crim. Rep. 489, and other cases collated in Michie\u2019s Encyc. Digest of Tex Crim. Rep., Vol. 4, p. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In the present case the gist of the offense was the drunkenness of the accused while he was driving an automobile. The mere fact that he was driving an automobile would not take the case out of the law of circumstantial evidence. In the present instance, however, we do not think that the drunkenness was proved by circumstances alone. In Underhill\u2019s Crim. Ev., 3rd Ed., Sec. 278, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u201cA non-expert witness may testify that the accused or some other person was intoxicated on a given date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">This announcement is supported by many authorities collated in the note. Among them is the case of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Eyler, 217 Pa. 512. This case is also reported in 11 L. R. A. (N. W.), p. 639, where will be found an exhaustive note, from which we quote:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u201cSince drunkenness is of such common occurrence that its recognition requires no peculiar scientific knowledge, and since it is practically impossible to describe the minute and peculiar appearance of a person, his acts, gestures, looks, and other indications of a state of sobriety, or of intoxication, thus making an expression as to whether or not a person is intoxicated, in effect a statement of a fact rather than a mere opinion as to the existence of a fact, it has been held as a general rule, without a single decision found to the contrary, that a witness not an expert may give his opinion as to whether or not a person is intoxicated, it naturally being understood that he had the opportunity to observe the facts upon which he bases his opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFRZ\">The statement by each of the state\u2019s witnesses that the appellant was drunk is a statement of fact. The correctness of the conclusion or statement in the present case is tested by cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>examination, and the surrounding facts, confirmatory of the main fact, were properly developed in order that the jury might determine the issue, that is, whether the presumption of innocence was overcome, but the development of the confirmatory circumstances did not, in our opinion, convert the present case into one depending alone upon circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
