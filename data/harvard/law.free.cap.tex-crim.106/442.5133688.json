All of this testimony set out above was excepted to by the appellant for the reason that it was highly inflammatory to the minds of the jury, and would incite and prejudice them unduly against the appellant, and that said testimony was merely the hearsay statement and conclusion of the police officer, inasmuch as it appeared therefrom that he did not see any of said transaction and could only have known the facts by reason of what was told to him by some other person, and for the further reason that no indictment or criminal charge had ever been based upon said transaction, and that said transaction so testified to over appellant\u2019s objection relates to another and different crime other than that for which the appellant was being tried arid which had occurred something like a year before the transaction for which the appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>being tried. In the admission of this testimony, the learned trial judge fell into error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">The rule laid down in the case of Pettiett v. State, 272 S. W. 473, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u201cIt has been the unbroken rule in this state since the organization of this court that the defendant should be tried upon the merits of each case, and proof of extraneous crimes which does not go to show intent, identity or system, or which is no part of the res gestae is not admissible if it could only show that defendant was a criminal generally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In this case there was no denial on the part of the appellant of his guilt, he having entered a plea of guilty and asked for a suspended sentence. The testimony was inadmissible on the issue of suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Again, we find in the case just cited above, the following expression of this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u201cThe application for a suspended sentence simply puts the reputation of one accused of crime in issue, and this reputation is to be proved, not by specific acts of misconduct, but by competent evidence to show whether his reputation is good or bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Where a defendant has voluntarily put his character in issue, it is not competent or relevant to the issue to admit on rebuttal, on the part of the prosecution, evidence of a series of individual acts, each forming a separate offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The admission of this evidence was clearly calculated to injure appellant\u2019s chance to secure a suspended sentence, and we are not prepared to say, in view of the fact that the jury assessed a penalty greater than the minimum and declined to suspend the sentence, that the jury did not appropriate this testimony. Johnson v. State, 241 S. W. 484; McKnight v. State, 265 S. W. 892; Bowman v. State, 265 S. W. 1038; Pettiett v. State, 272 S. W. 473; Elkins v. State, 276 S. W. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The learned trial judge having fallen into error in permitting the introduction of the evidence complained of in the last two bills of exception, it is our opinion that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
