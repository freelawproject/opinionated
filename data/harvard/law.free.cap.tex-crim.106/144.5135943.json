This testimony was introduced over the objection of the appellant to the effect that, in the absence of a search warrant, testimony to what was found upon the search was rendered inadmissible by Art. 727a, C. C. P., 1925, declaring that testimony acquired through an illegal search shall not be admitted; and by Art. 4a, C. C. P., 1925, in which a search for intoxicating liquor in the building occupied by the appellant was rendered unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">The learned trial judge, over the appellant\u2019s objection, sanctioned the introduction of the testimony upon the ground that the offense having taken place at a time antecedent to the date on which the statutes mentioned became effective, the objection was not available to the appellant, although at the time of his trial the statutes in question had become operative. This court has held in several cases that the statutes mentioned were applicable to facts available to the accused at the time of his trial, though the offense was charged to have been committed at an earlier date. See Odenthal v. State, No. 9967; Sherow v. State, No. 9927, not yet reported; Askew v. State, 127 S. W. 1037; Mrous v. State, 21 S. W. 764; Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574; Ruling Case Law, Vol. 25, p. 791, sec. 38; Underhill\u2019s Crim. Ev., 3rd Ed., sec. 11; Hallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Under the law of this state, the officers having searched the appellant\u2019s house without a search warrant and without his consent were forbidden, against the appellant\u2019s objection made on the trial, to give testimony against him of the result of the search in which whiskey was found upon his premises. There being no evidence against the appellant except that which was obtained by means of the illegal search mentioned, and that having been received over his objection, the judgment must be reversed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"ATf\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
