It became a very important inquiry as to whether the appellant was present at the place where the still was operated from daylight until 11 o\u2019clock in the morning, as testified to by the two officers, or whether appellant was in his field plowing from daylight until 10 o\u2019clock in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Appellant expected to prove by the witness, Edna White, as shown by her affidavit attached to the motion for a new trial, that on the morning of the day appellant was arrested appellant went to plow in the field with the Collier boys; that after the appellant had gone to the field M. T. Dulaney and his wife passed appellant\u2019s house in a wagon in which the witness saw some barrels and other things; that soon after they passed the witness saw smoke coming from a point down in a pasture which appellant and Dulaney jointly had charge of; that the witness sent her small boy for the appellant, who came to the house, and she told him of seeing Dulaney and his wife in a wagon going in the direction of the smoke, and told appellant they were down there making whiskey and for appellant to go and stop them; that this was about 10:30 in the morning; that appellant then went on down there; that no one was in the wagon but M. T. Dulaney and his wife; that appellant was not down in the pasture at the still until she sent him down there to stop Dulaney from manufacturing whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The affidavit of the absent witness, Martha Stewart, as attached to appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, shows that she would have testified, if present, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><em>\u201cI </em>am the wife of Henry Stewart and live about one-half mile from the defendant, Nelson White. On the day Nelson White was arrested in this case I was at Mat Collier\u2019s house and I saw Nelson White plowing in his field with the small boys of Mat Collier. He was plowing in his field until about 10 o\u2019clock in the morning when I saw his son come to the field after him and saw him leave the field and go to his house. He was not out of the field until he left at about 10 o\u2019clock. I was confined to my bed when Nelson White was tried with a small baby, and I was unable to attend this trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The court, in explaining his action in overruling the motion for a continuance, stated that this testimony was cumulative. The evidence in this case tended to prove an alibi, and the learned trial judge charged on alibi. The authorities in this state hold that when an alibi is the defense the more witnesses produced the stronger it makes the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The motion for continuance clearly shows that the appellant used all diligence within his power to procure the attendance of said two witnesses.- The facts th\u00e1t appellant expected to prove by said two witnesses, beyond any question, were very material to his defense and were probably true, and we are unable to say that they would not have produced a different result. The appellant attached to his motion for a new trial the affidavit of each of said witnesses that they would have sworn, if present, to the facts stated in the application for continuance. Having attached the affidavits of the absent witnesses to the motion for a new trial, the question of the probable truth of such testimony was no longer one for the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We are of the opinion that the learned trial judge erred in overruling the appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance and especially in not granting a new trial after the affidavits of the witnesses had been attached showing what their testimony would be. Terry v. State, 272 S. W. 466, and cases therein cited; Cruz v. State, 272 S. W. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">For the error above discussed, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
