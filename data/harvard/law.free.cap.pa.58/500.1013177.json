L. 129) was passed, providing : \u2014 -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-11\">\u201c That George Carey Tharp Schnauffer, of Perry county, be authorized to change his name from George Carey Tharp Schnauffer, to George Carey Tharp, and he shall henceforth be called and known by the name of George Carey Tharp, and by that name he shall be able and capable in law to sue, &amp;c., and to do all other legal acts as effectually to all intents and purposes as he could have done if no change had ever been made therein, and he shall be capable of taking and inheriting any estate, real and personal, of George Tharp and Mary his wife, as fully and effectually as if he were their own child born in lawful wedlock.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-12\">George C.

J.) being of opinion with the Commonwealth, entered judgment in her favor for $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-16\">The defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error the entering of the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-17\"><em>B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiSN\">The learned judge below was certainly right in holding that the case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Nancrede, 8 Casey 389, ruled the case in hand in favor of the Commonwealth. What was said in the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Stump, 3 P. F. Smith 132, now relied on by the plaintiif in error, was but a <em>dictum, </em>and besides, it appears to be a case of a different kind from the present. We decline discussing the value of that <em>dictum </em>at present. There is no essential difference between the Act of 1842, creating the plaintiff in error an heir, and the Act of 1855, under which Nancrede and the Commonwealth was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
