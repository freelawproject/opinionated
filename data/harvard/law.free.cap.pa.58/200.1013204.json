Wait testified that in January 1864 the logs in dispute were at the place on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Clearfield creek, where those he had purchased were to be delivered ; there was no freshet in 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">The defendants made the following offers of evidence, which were rejected, and several bills of exception sealed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">1. That the quantity of \u201cE\u201d logs in the boom at the time of the issuing and service of this writ was unknown both to plaintiff and defendant, and that this could not be ascertained by any human means till the same were rafted out and scaled. To be followed by proof that the same were afterwards rafted out of said boom and counted and measured and their quantity ascertained by the boom scaler appointed by the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming county, and that the real quantity did not exceed 238,000 feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">2. That 50,000 feet of the logs marked \u201cE,\u201d being part of the same logs in controversy, were stopped at the West Branch Boom at Lock Haven in April and May 1864; that the same were sawed by S. M. Beekford, and delivered by him to the plaintiff in December 1864; also that 30,000 feet of said logs marked \u201c E\u201d escaped the Susquehanna Boom in the April and May floods of 1864, and were taken up by the plaintiff at points below the Susquehanna Boom, and were manufactured and converted by the plaintiff to his own possession and use after the issuing and service of this writ of replevin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">3. The quantity of logs marked \u201cE\u201d which were rafted out of said boom and delivered to the said Anderson Harvey prior to the issuing and service of this writ of replevin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-10\">4. The quantity of logs with the mark \u201cE,\u201d being the same logs in controversy in the action, which came into the boom prior to 11th day of May 1864, the date of plaintiffs\u2019 contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-11\">5. The quantity of logs marked \u201cE\u201d .on the end, being the logs in controversy in this case, that came into the Susquehanna Boom prior to the 22d day of July 1864, the day the logs were replevied. This evidence being offered to show the quantity of logs which were actually replevied, as the quantity was then unknown to both parties, as appears by the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-12\">There was other evidence on both sides on the question of delivery by Caldwell, the value of the logs, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-13\">Defendants\u2019 points, with their answers, were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-14\">1. If the jury find that the logs in controversy were put on \u201cthe main Clearfield creek,\u201d the place mentioned for delivery in the contract of sale to Wait for Harvey, as specified in the terms of said contract, such placing of the logs at the place of delivery under all the evidence in the cause, was a delivery of the logs both in law and in fact to Harvey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-15\">2. If the jury find that there was no actual delivery of the logs to Finney before they came into Harvey\u2019s actual possession at and in the boom, and Harvey received them in good faith, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>having been apprised that they had been sold by Caldwell to Finney, he is entitled to hold them as against the claim of Finney, and their verdict should be in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">Answer to 1st point: \u201c The placing of the logs by Caldwell at the place designated in the agreements between Caldwell and Wait, dated February <em>28th </em>1863, is evidence of delivery under the contract on the part of Caldwell. But we refuse to instruct you that the delivery of the logs at that place, under all the evidence in the cause, was a delivery of the logs in law to Harvey. Whether in fact they were delivered to him we submit to you under all the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">Answer to 2d point: \u201c If there was no actual delivery of the logs to Finney before they came into Harvey\u2019s actual possession at and in the Boom, and Harvey received them in good faith, without having been apprised that they had been sold by Caldwell to Finney, it will not entitle the defendants to your verdict unless you are satisfied from the evidence that there was a delivery of the.logs to Harvey by Caldwell, or with his knowledge and consent. As the contract between Caldwell and Harvey was an ex-ecutory one, and certain things were to be done by Harvey after the delivery of the logs on the bank of Clearfield creek, Harvey was not entitled to possession of the logs until he did what he stipulated to do. If Harvey had actual possession, this actual possession, to avail him and entitle him to your verdict, must have been done with the consent of Caldwell. If there was a delivery to Harvey, then the title was in him. In the language of the Supreme Court, the vesting of title waited upon the delivery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">There was a verdict $3631.59 for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">The defendants took a writ of error and in seven specifications assigned for error the rejection of their offers of evidence and the answers to their points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-10\"><em>W.

It was brought against the Susquehanna Boom Company, and this is the first thing to be noticed. It is an incorporated company, authorized to erect and maintain in the West Branch of the Susquehanna an artificial barrier, called a boom, composed of piers and timbers, to intercept and secure the floating logs and lumber driven down the stream. Its duty is to keep guard by day and night, so that no lumber shall escape; to raft all logs and lumber out of the boom securely and faithfully, and secure them below for the owners, and for this service to receive certain tolls and charges. To guard the public against imposition, all logs rafted out of the boom shall be counted and measured by a competent person appointed by the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming county. The owners of the logs, &amp;e., are required to mark them well, for identification, before they are set afloat, and to register their marks on the books of the company. The boom thus becomes the receptacle of innumerable logs, amounting to millions of feet annually. The logs are-sent adrift by their owners in the upper regions of the river and its tributaries, and many are stranded by the way. Those arriving lie in the boom in confused masses, piled and submerged, and how many of each owner\u2019s \u201c drive\u201d are caught, no one can tell, until they are rafted out below and identified by their marks. Such is the party against whom the replevin issued, a bailee of the logs of many owners, unnumbered and unknown at the time of the issuing of the writ. The plaintiffs, conscious of these facts, and founding their estimate on the number of feet \u201c scaled\u201d or measured to them on the river above, issued their writ for 329,760 <em>feet </em>of white-pine saw-logs, <em>more or less, </em>marked or stamped \u201cE\u201d on the end of each log, of the value of $15 per 1000 feet. Anderson Harvey, who claimed the same logs under a prior contract, and whose mills must stop if he failed to obtain his usual supply, procured a \u201c claim property bond,\u201d to be given by the boom company, and was afterwards admitted as a co-defendant, to defend his interest. The return of the sheriff was \u201creplevied as within commanded. Defendants gave bond and retained property.\u201d The defendants [pleaded non cepit and property, and on the trial offered to prove by the boom scaler and others that the quantity of logs marked \u201cE\u201d in the boom at the time of the issuing and service of the writ was unknown to both plaintiffs and defendants, and could not be ascertained by any human means until they were rafted out and \u201c scaled\u201d (that is, the quantity computed by a scale or table of measurement as applied to the dimensions of the logs), and to follow this by proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that they were afterward rafted out and counted and measured by the boom scaler, appointed according to law, and that the real quantity as thus ascertained did not exceed 238,000 feet. They offered to prove also that about 50,000 feet of the logs in eontrovesy never arrived at the Susquehanna boom, but were stopped above at the Lock Haven boom, and there sawed and delivered to the plaintiffs; and that about 30,000 feet of the same lot of logs had escaped out of the Susquehanna boom before the issuing and service of the writ, and were taken up below, manufactured and converted by the plaintiffs to their own use after the issuing and service of the writ. They further offered to prove by the same officer and others how many of the logs marked \u201cE\u201d had been rafted out of the boom and delivered to Harvey before the issuing and service of the writ. All these offers were rejected on the ground that by the claim of property and return of the sheriff the defendants were fixed for the 329,760 feet of logs stated in the writ. Knowles <em>v. </em>Lord, 4 Wharton 500, and kindred cases are cited in support of this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In the view we take of the case before us, we do not intend to impugn or to shake in the least degree the doctrine of that case ; that a defendant in replevin, who claims property in the goods mentioned in the writ, retains them and gives bond for their return and for indemnity, if the property in them be adjudged against him; conclusively admits possession of all the goods, and will- not be permitted to contradict the return of the sheriff that the identical goods mentioned in the writ were left in his hands. But if the principle of an ordinary case of replevin, such as that was, should be applied to this ease, it would require us to use a mere legal presumption adopted for the furtherance of justice to work the grossest wrong, contrary to the palpable facts and against the common understanding of all the parties and the sheriff himself. When the plaintiffs issued the writ against the boom company, they knew its character and purpose, and that, in the language of the offer, by no human means could the quantity of logs marked \u201cE\u201d be ascertained in the boom until they were rafted out and measured. Mixed with innumerable others, submerged, embedded in the mud, piled and heaped together, and filling the river for a mile or more, no human power could reach them until one after another they were loosened below,, and floated out. Had the sheriff gone with his writ to deliver possession to the plaintiffs, what could he do ? They could not show him their logs and he could not find them. Well knowing these things, the plaintiffs did not issue' their writ for a certain number of logs, but for 329,760 feet of logs <em>more or less. </em>What kind of feet were they\u2014 lineal or cubic? How many feet more, than 329,760, or how many less were there? This number of feet it appears means inch board measure. How many logs were there throughout which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>this number of feet was distributed ? All these questions should be definitely answered, before we can fix the defendants conclusively for 829,760 feet, by board measure, contained in an unknown number of logs. How can we say conclusively that, \u201cReplevied as within commanded \u2014 defendants gave bond and retained the property,\u201d means that the defendants had in their possession a certain number of logs containing this specific number of feet ? The return independently of the writ asserts no number and proves none, while the writ itself is vague and uncertain. It specifies no certain numbpr of logs, and no specific number of feet, but an uncertain number of feet in an unknown number of logs. When we view the character of the boom company, the nature of its duties imposed by law, the impossibility of determining the number of the logs in the boom, the means adopted by law to ascertain, through an impartial officer, the extent of the company\u2019s liability and its claims for tolls and charges, and then look at the vague character of the writ and return, and the knowledge of all parties of the state of the case, we must perceive at once that neither the sheriff nor the defendants had any idea that a claim of property and bond could apply to a certain number of logs or a fixed number of feet, but that they .were intended to cover' and secure what in the due course of the operations of the boom company should be found to be in its possession. We can conceive of no ranker injustice than to fix upon the defendants, by a forced presumption, a specific liability for the very logs that went into the hands of the plaintiffs, and which never came into the boom or had gone out of it before the writ issued. The indefiniteness of the writ and return, and the circumstances by which we distinguish this case from Knowles <em>v. </em>Lord, are not wanting in analogies, where a similar vagueness and want of precision have formed the ground of exceptions to the general rule. Thus where a schooner was sold under an order to sell her \u201c together with all and singular her tackle, apparel and furniture, or so much thereof as might be necessary,\u201d and the marshal returned that he had sold her, \u201ctogether with her tackle, apparel, &amp;c.,\u201d the deputy marshal was permitted, in an action of trover for certain of her sails, to prove that the sails were expressly excepted and were not sold, notwithstanding the objection that it contradicted the return: Dolan <em>v. </em>Briggs, 4 Binney 496. A return of \u201c levied on grain, household furniture, &amp;c., and left at the plaintiffs\u2019 risk,\u201d and another return \u201clevied on goods per inventory,\u201d were held not to be conclusive of satisfaction: Little <em>v. </em>Delancey, 5 Binney 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">A registry on the 5th of November 1792 of a negro slave, \u201c born some time in May last or the beginning of June,\u201d was held to be bad because of its vagueness, as the birth might have been before the 5th of May, and the registry therefore made more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>six months afterwards : Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Jesse <em>v. </em>Craig, 1 S. &amp; R. 23. A sheriff\u2019s return to a fi. fa. of \u201cdebt and costs paid\u201d made more than two years after the return-day, was held not to be conclusive: Weidman <em>v. </em>Weitzell, 13 S. &amp; R. 96. Where a fi. fa. had lain in the sheriff\u2019s hands six years, and was then returned <em>nulla </em>bona, the return will not preclude evidence to contradict it: Pennock\u2019s Ex. <em>v. </em>Carr, 1 Rawle 420. A sheriff was held to be competent to prove that a return of \u201cproceedings stayed by plaintiff\u2019s attorney,\u201d which had been struck out by running a line through it, was his return, and had not been struck out by him: Meredith <em>v. </em>Shewall, 1 Penna. R. 495. A return of <em>nulla bona </em>to an execution on a judgment against a surety in a replevin-bond, is not conclusive of the sureties\u2019 insolvency, in an action against a sheriff for taking insufficient sureties in the bond: Myers <em>v. </em>Clark, 3 W. &amp; S. 535. So what property is or is not embraced in a levy which is obscure in its terms, may be shown by parol evidence: Scott <em>v. </em>Sheakly, 3 Watts 50; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Danner, 2 Harris 25; Atkinson\u2019s <em>Lessee v. </em>Cummins, <em>9 </em>Howard 479. In two of these cases, adjoiners mistakenly called for by the sheriff\u2019s levy were rejected, and land bounded by them excluded. A levy upon three writs against partners, <em>subject to </em>a levy on a writ against one of the partners for his individual debt, and sales returned on all, it was held in a proceeding to make distribution that it might be shown that the property was partnership property: Vandike\u2019s Appeal, 5 Harris 271. So the real value of property replevied may be proved against the value fixed in the writ: Gibbs <em>v. </em>Bartlett, 2 W. &amp; S. 35. Thus there is abundant authority that records and returns which under ordinary circumstances furnish conclusive presumptions of their truth, may, through vagueness, informality and irregularity, be so much impaired in their character, that the presumption is only prim\u00e1 facie, and can he rebutted by proof. Such we think is the case here. The rejected evidence ought therefore to have been received. It is proper to add that we refused, when this case was here before, to express our opinion on the point now decided, on the ground that the writ and return were not then before us. We discover no error in the answers of the court to the defendant\u2019s first and second 'points. The contract of Caldwell with Wait for Anderson Harvey being executory and dependent, the hauling of the logs and depositing them at the place appointed for delivery was not <em>ipso facto </em>a delivery of the logs. Delivery in such a case consists of two acts, the manual act, of placing the property there, and the mental act, or intention to deliver. Without the latter no delivery could be affirmed, and it was for the jury and not for the court to determine with what mind the logs were taken by Caldwell and deposited at the place of delivery. Without an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>intention on part of Caldwell to deliver under the contract with Wait, the property not passing by the agreement itself, there was nothing to prevent Caldwell from selling the logs to Finney, in the absence of evidence to show that Wait or Anderson Harvey for whom he bought, had complied or was ready at the time of delivery to comply with the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
