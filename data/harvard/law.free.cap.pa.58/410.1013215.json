Also the will of Samuel Keller, proved September 7th 1863. By this will he made provision for the support of his wife, and gave her a life estate in a tract of land which he ordered to be sold by his executors at her death, and the proceeds divided amongst such of his heirs as should then be living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-13\">He gave small legacies to three of his children. He then gave \u25a0 the residue of all his estate, real and personal, to his ten children, whom he named. He also gave them the privilege, commencing with the oldest, to take two farms belonging to him, at a price for each farm which he named; and if none of them should take these farms, he directed his executors to sell them, the proceeds in either case to be divided amongst his children. The tract in question was not mentioned specifically in the will. He appointed his son Daniel Keller (the defendant), and three others, his executors. The defendant gave in evidence several conveyances, tracing the title of this land from John Penn to David G-. Barnitz, on the 3d of September 1841, and a deed dated March 2d 1864, from Barnitz to himself. The consideration paid to Barnitz was stated to be $46.93.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-14\">The plaintiff submitted several points to the court on the question of the Statute of Limitations, which the finding of the jury makes it unnecessary to state. He submitted other points, which with the answers of the court are as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201c 5. If the jury believe Samuel Keller was in the actual possession of the land at the time he made his will and at the time of his death, and that Daniel Keller accepted as devisee and legatee under said will and received his share and acted as executor, and if said Daniel Keller knew his father was in possession of said land when he made his will and at the time of his death, then Daniel Keller is trustee for the other devisees under said will and he cannot retain any title acquired by him subsequently to the death of testator against them and to their prejudice, but holds the same in trust for them and as their trustee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">Answer : \u201c If the defendant knew that Samuel Keller was in the actual possession of the land, and used it as a wood lot, being one of the executors, he could not purchase for his own use. If he purchased, he holds as trustee for the use of the heirs of Samuel Keller, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">\u201c 6. As Daniel Keller, the defendant, now repudiates that he holds in trust for the plaintiff and other devisees, and claims entirely for himself, it is such conduct and bad faith on his part as dispenses with any tender on the part of defendant before suit brought, if otherwise he had been entitled to a tender before suit brought.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-8\">Answer: \u201c The court answer this point in the affirmative, but we further instruct the jury that if the plaintiff is entitled to recover, he can only recover a conditional verdict, subject to the payment of one-tenth of the purchase-money, which David Barnitz received from the defendant on the 2d of March 1864, with interest from that date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">The jury found for the plaintiff the one undivided tenth part of the land claimed; execution to stay till the plaintiff pays or tenders $7.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-10\">The defendant took a writ of error; and, among others, assigned for error the answers to the above points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-11\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7N\">Title by the Statute of Limitations in the ancestor of the parties to this suit was negatived by the jury, and the only party who could complain of this is the defendant in error. But she makes no complaint, and therefore all question on that subject is out of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">There was abundant evidence in the case that Samuel Keller, the father of both parties, had long claimed and exercised acts of ownership over the land in dispute, and up to the time of his death. Whether his title was perfect or not we need not inquire. His possession descended to his heirs as tenants in common. They would succeed by descent cast. Was it competent, therefore, to one of the executors, which the plaintiff in error and defendant below was, to buy in an outstanding title and hold against his co-tenant ? The authorities cited by the defendant in error, to which many more might be added, most clearly establish that it was not, and to them we refer. His purchase was for the benefit of the tenants in common, if they or any of them chose to claim it. Magdalene Keller did so choose, and recovered. The defendant below claiming in opposition to the trust, it was not essential that a tender should have preceded the institution of the suit: Beck <em>v.' </em>\u00dchrich, 4 Harris 503. This equity was preserved in the conditional verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Seeing no error in any part of the case,</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
