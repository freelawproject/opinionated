Benners, survivor of the firm of Isaac R. Benners &amp; Co., defendant. The claim was for a balance due by defendant on an invoice of fruit, contracted for in England and shipped to defendant to New York. The whole amount of the shipment was $2967.85, which was reduced to $896.95 by quercitron bark shipped to plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed to recover this balance at gold prices with interest from December 17th 1863. The only question in the case was whether it was to be paid on that basis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-14\">William J.

He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>objected to paying it just then because, as he said, gold was too high, but he said he would endeavor to pay it before the year was out; he admitted that he owed the account, that Clemens need be in no hurry as he would get interest. This account is made up on the basis of gold, and the charges are made as payable in gold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">The court (Hare, A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">The debt sued for was a debt contracted in England, or rather the balance of a debt contracted and partially liquidated there by returns in quercitron bark. In the absence of any understanding to the contrary the balance was due and payable there. This being so, it was payable in the legal currency of the country, denominated pounds, shillings and pence, and the representative of gold. Of course, as any payment obtained here would be payable in legal tender notes, the value of the gold in legal tenders, with interest, would be what in amount the judgment should be. The <em>lex loci contractus </em>must control in interpreting the contract: Allshouse <em>v. </em>Ramsay, 6 Whart. 331; Watson <em>v. </em>Brewster, 1 Barr 381, and authorities cited by the defendant in error. This view of the case is sufficient to affirm the judgment without reference to any question arising on our Legal Tender Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-13\">The judgment being right in amount is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
