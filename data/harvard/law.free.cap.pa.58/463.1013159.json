In December 1857, plaintiff told him to drive the hogs to Trego and Henderson, who were to meet him near Hagerstown. Witness drove 142 hogs, and near Hagerstown met Trego, who engaged him to deliver the hogs at Chambersburg, gave witness $500 for plaintiff, and told him to tell plaintiff to make out the bill for corn while he had the hogs on hand, and he would send albthe money together when he had sold the hogs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-17\">Ewing, another witness, had been employed in September 1857, by defendants to drive hogs from plaintiff\u2019s to Carlisle ; plaintiff and defendants went with witness on the road, and Trego asked plaintiff to look for more hogs ; that he would pay 6\u00a3 cents per pound as long as hogs were 9 cents per pound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-18\">A number of letters from January 22d to December 10th 1857, inclusive, some signed \u201c Levi Trego,\u201d and some \u201c Trego &amp; Hen derson,\u201d all in the handwriting of Trego, were received in evidence against the objection of the defendants, and bills of exception sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The letters speak of hogs being sold, of wanting more at a time named; that Henderson would bring money; that if plaintiff got any hogs they would try to deal with him, and that he should not buy for any one else; that if he could get hogs they would come when they heard from him; that he should engage all the hogs he could, &amp;c. A letter of October 15th 1857, signed by Trego, directed plaintiff not to buy any hogs, and hoped he had not any engaged; of October 20th, signed by Trego, expressed disappointment that plaintiff had bought hogs, and said he had told him not to buy till he should hear from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">Plaintiff gave evidence that Henderson and Trego had hogs, and had been dealing in hogs together about 1856, 1857 and 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">The defendants gave in evidence a number of letters from the plaintiff to Trego. In one dated February 13th 1858, he says: \u201c I received your note of the 10th instant, with Smyser &amp; Wilts\u2019s note enclosed, and sent back, stating that you could not get it discounted. I will send it on for collection,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">They then offered the note referred to in the letter, to be followed with the record and declaration in a suit to November Term 1859, by Lewis against Trego, on the note, for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff was not dealing with Henderson and Trego jointly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\">The offer was rejected, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-12\">The plaintiff asked the court to charge :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-13\">2. It devolves upon the defendants to show that the hogs sent by Lewis in December 1857 were not received by Trego, for Trego &amp; Henderson, and on the terms offered to Lewis in the letters from them, and as detailed by Mr. Ewing. Where parties have dealt with another jointly and on the pledge to him of their joint credit, they must show when that course of dealing ceased, and what new arrangement was made in its place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-14\">The court (Graham, P. J.) answered. \u201c If the authority from defendants to plaintiff to purchase hogs for them was general and continuing, then we answer this point in the affirmative. But if it was limited, and given to purchase particular lots only,, then the plaintiff must show a joint authority from defendants, to purchase the hogs in controversy to entitle him to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-15\">The defendants submitted a number of -points. Those, the answers to which were assigned for error, with the answers, are as-follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-16\">1. There can be no recovery by the plaintiff in this action unless the plaintiff has satisfied the jury that this particular lot of hogs was purchased by both Henderson and Trego, and that they assumed a joint liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-17\">The court said :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201c <em>We </em>answer this in the affirmative, unless the evidence satisfies you that there was a continuing authority from defendants to plaintiff to purchase hogs for them which had not been countermanded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">2. As this suit is not against the defendants as copartners, but as co-contractors in a single transaction for the hogs sent to Pennsylvania in December 1857, evidence of purchase of hogs by defendants from the plaintiff at any former time, and of what defendants or either of them then said or wrote in regard to the transactions then on hand, is not admissible to fix any joint liability on defendants for the hogs which were sent in December 1857 ; and all testimony which was admitted of that kind should be dismissed from their consideration by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">Answer: \u201c We cannot answer this as requested. You will consider all the evidence in determining the joint liability of defendants in this cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">3. The declarations of Trego at the house of the plaintiff, on the porch, and when Mr. Henderson was in the house, as detailed by witness Ewing, and the letters signed Trego &amp; Henderson, in the handwriting of Trego, are not evidence against Henderson, and can only affect Trego, by whom the declarations were made and the letters written. And the direction of Lewis to Clark, that he was to drive the hogs to Trego and Henderson, and that Trego and Henderson were to meet him near Hagerstown, are not evidence to affect Henderson, as he was not present, and it was not communicated to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\">Answer: \u201c The conversations of Trego in the absence of Henderson, and the letters written by Trego, are not evidence to affect Henderson, unless sanctioned and approved by Henderson, nor are conversations of plaintiff in the absence of Henderson evidence against Henderson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-10\">5. The counts in the declaration as amended were objected to at the time they were asked to be amended; and they were amended after the Statute of Limitation would bar any other action, and against the consent of defendants, and there can be no recovery on them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-11\">\u201cWe cannot answer this as requested. The court did permit the declaration to be amended as stated. But no new cause of action has been introduced, no transaction between the parties has been shown except the alleged purchase and sale of these hogs, which, it appears, was made in Virginia and not in Pennsylvania.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-12\">6. If the plaintiff seeks to recover on the evidence that when Henderson and Trego were in Virginia, in September 1857, Trego said that he and Henderson would pay 6\u00a3 cents per pound, as long as pork was at 9 cents per pound, and that Lewis should go \u2022on and look out for more hogs, and that in pursuance of this agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ment, plaintiff did go on and purchase and deliver Logs in December 1857, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">Answer: \u201cWe do not understand that the plaintiff seeks to recover on any particular isolated item of evidence, but on all the evidence in the case, tending to show a joint authority from defendants to purchase hogs for them and a delivery of the hogs to Trego, as the plaintiff alleges, for Trego and Henderson. If there was authority from defendants jointly to purchase these hogs and they were purchased in pursuance of such authority, and delivered to Trego, one of the purchasers, and there was no subsequent understanding or agreement between the plaintiff and Trego, that Trego alone was to pay for them or sell them for the plaintiff, then the plaintiff may recover. But if the evidence fails to satisfy you that the hogs were purchased in pursuance of a joint authority from defendants, then the plaintiff cannot recover. We have before said that the amendments of the declaration, permitted by the court, will not prevent a recovery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $1132.84, for which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">The defendants sued out a writ of error, and assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-9\">I.

As the plaintiff in error has discussed them in classes, we may follow the same path. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>amendment of the declaration permitting the promises to he laid as made in Virginia, adding the proper <em>videlicet </em>to bring the action \u25a0within the jurisdiction of the court, was not erroneous. The action was brought to recover the price of the hogs purchased in Virginia. All the evidence and the history of the case show conclusively that Lewis, who was a farmer living in Frederick county, Virginia, had his transactions with the defendants there. There is not even a pretence that the cause of action arose in Pennsylvania. Now that the omission of the pleader to state the formal averment that the contract was made in Virginia, should close the door against an amendment of this merest form, would be a stigma upon the administration of justice. Undoubtedly the court will never permit a party to shift his ground or enlarge its surface by introducing an entirely new and different cause of action, especially when by reason of the Statute of Limitations, or an award of arbitrators, or for some good reason, it would work an injury to the opposite party. But amendments which tend only to advance the interests of justice are not only proper, but necessary, and should always be allowed. In this connection we will also dispose of the last error alleged in entering a judgment on a verdict for a sum greater than the damages laid in the declaration. The declaration urns clearly amendable in the court below, and the entry of judgment was merely an oversight. The action was brought in 1859, and in consequence of the suspension of intercourse between Virginia and Pennsylvania, by the war of rebellion, was not tried until 1867. The damages were laid in $1000, and the verdict was recovered for $1132.84, the excess being a sum much below the interest which had accrued on the demand in the mean time. The sum recovered, exclusive of the interest, therefore, was less than the damages laid in the declaration at the time it was filed. In eases where even jurisdiction depends on the sum demanded, as in an appeal from a justice of the peace, the jurisdiction is not ousted by the recovery of a greater sum where the excess is merely the interest accrued after suit brought. The plaintiff had the right to amend in the court below, and this being the case we will permit it to be done here. The authorities cited by the defendant in error clearly justify this exercise of our discretion. Some <em>dicta </em>have been cited that the court will reverse for this cause. Where the justice of the case demands it, we might perhaps decline to permit it after the party had slipped his opportunity. But the legislature has led the way to the making of amendments of the most vital character, altering names Christian and surname, changing and adding names of parties, and even striking out parties where too many have been included. It becomes us to keep pace with legislative reform instead of lagging in its rear. Nothing is a matter of more form than the sum inserted at the conclusion of a <em>narr. </em>as the damages suffered. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>therefore will allow the amendment which would have been of course in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We think the court below was right in receiving in evidence the letters and acts of Trego, one of the defendants. It is not always in the power of the party to give direct evidence of the joint acts of parties charged jointly. He may follow each by his separate steps, until he is able to bring them together, and show that they are in company with each other, and acting concurrently. Often the most complete chain of evidence binding parties together, is forged of separate links, and to refuse to weld them together by means of proof would frustrate justice. The rejection of the suit brought on the note endorsed by Trego did the defendants no injury. It was not alleged that this evidence tended to show payment, and the endorsement being upon the note of a third party to Trego individually, was necessarily the separate act of Trego. It did not therefore of itself sever the relation of Trego and H\u00e9nderson in the purchase of the hogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We think there was abundant evidence of the joint relation between Trego and Henderson in purchasing the hogs, to carry the case to the jury. The argument'of the plaintiff in error that because a man may be jointly concerned in five transactions, and yet not in the sixth, therefore the prior purchases of the plaintiff by both the defendants in 1856 and 1857 were no evidence of their joint relation in the last purchase in 1857, is not convincing. It is true that standing alone these former transactions might he insufficient to secure a verdict, but connected with the other evidence they constituted a strong circumstance in the cause. A man\u2019s ordinary course of dealing is often resorted to and relied on in the proof of liability. Thus where one is in the habit of sending a servant to take up goods, it is held to be proof where some of the goods are not shown to have been taken up, by direct proof of his order. Both parties were together in their last visit to Virginia in September, and started for hom&lt;? with a drove of hogs. Lewis accompanied them a part of the way, and Trego and Henderson were sitting on their horses in the road talking-to Lewis of purchasing hogs. Trego told Lewis to go on and look out for more hogs. Lewis went on and bought hogs to the number of 142 in the same fall, and in December drove them into Pennsylvania to Trego. These are the hogs for which the claim was made in the suit. Clearly this justified submitting the case to the jury on all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
