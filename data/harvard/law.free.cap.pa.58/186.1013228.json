Admits making the first contract, denies that there was any consideration, avers that it became inoperative after 30 days from its date. 2. Admits the second contract and the payment of $500, and avers that it provided in case either of the referees should refuse to act, that B. D. Hamlin should select a person to fill the vacancy. 3. Has these averments: \u2014 \u201c I deny that any report was made by the persons agreed upon in the contract of 6th June 1866, as stated in the 5th paragraph of the. plain tiff\u2019s bill, and I also deny that the said persons agreed upon in said contract or any or either of them ever made a report in writing to me of their estimate of the quantity of timber on the land described in said contract. I aver and state that A. D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Hamlin, one of the persons agreed upon, never made a full examination of the said timber; that the said Blair and Hagadorn made an examination of a portion thereof in the absence of the said Hamlin; that when the said Blair, Hagadorn and Hamlin were looking at said pine timber, or that portion thereof which was examined by all of them together on the ground, the said Hamlin frequently estimated the number of logs in a tree, and his estimate exceeded the estimate of the said Blair, and when the matter was referred to said Hagadorn, he would coincide with the said Hamlin in his estimate, but the said Blair in his minutes would note the said tree as containing his own instead of the estimate made by said Hamlin and Hagadorn, and the said Hagadorn kept no minutes of the estimates made of said pine timber when they were making the examination on the ground. I also aver that the said Hamlin was not present at any figuring up of the estimates or at any consultation with the said Blair and Hagadorn about the quantity of the said pine and cherry timber after the examination had been made, and had no notice of the time and place of such consultation or of making the award, but that the whole calculation of the amount and quantity and the making of the award was done by the said Blair and Hagadorn in the absence of the said Hamlin, with the aid and assistance of the said plaintiff, in my .absence, and without my knowledge and consent.\u201d 4. Denies the tender of the full amount of the consideration; 5, avers that the timber amounted to 800,000 feet of pine and 400,000 feet of cherry; 6, notice was served on the plaintiff and the referees of the revocation of their authority, and on the plaintiff of the amount of timber. 7. Plaintiff has refused to have any other estimate made, defendant has tendered a return of the $500 with interest, and given notice of a rescission of the contract, because the estimate was not in accordance with its terms and was palpably erroneous, as not having more than half the timber, and plaintiff refused to have a new estimate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">The plaintiff filed a general replication and an examiner was appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\">The testimony taken was very voluminous; a detail of it would not assist in elucidating the questions decided in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-10\">There was evidence that the three referees went through the timber, counted and measured it, took memoranda in the woods of their work; before there was an opportunity to determine upon the other matters necessary for a final decision by the referees, and for making the report, Hamlin one of the referees was taken quite ill, so as to be unable to be consulted in the matter. The plaintiff urged the completion of the report during Hamlin\u2019s sickness, expressing his belief that it was not probable that Hamlin would recover; plaintiff was present with the other referees when they were making their calculations and consulting as to the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>port, made suggestions to them as to the correctness o\u00a3 their figures, estimates, &amp;c. The defendant by a number of witnesses, experienced lumbermen, gave evidence that the timber was greatly under estimated; their estimates varied from 950,000 to about 1,100,000 feet of pine timber; the cherry timber was estimated at about 675,000 feet; there was evidence of declarations of the plaintiff that there was about twice as much timber as had been estimated in the report. There was some conflict in the evidence; the referees who were examined adhering to the accuracy of their report. There was also evidence tending to show the delivery of the report to the defendant, and that he did not object to it; and that both parties acted on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">The case was heard twice in the court below before Williams,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">' A.

The controversy turns upon facts, and involves a variety of circumstances. Eifty-eight witnesses were examined, whose testimony fills one hundred and twenty:three pages of solid small type. Much of the evidence is conflicting, and relates to a peculiar local business. Such a case ought to have gone to a master for a report upon the facts. We may not be able to do justice to it, as to us all witnesses appear alike when their depositions come before us on paper. No judge of the Common Pleas should take such a case on the evidence, without a reference first to a master, to sift the testimony and collate and report the facts. He should appoint some one competent to act both as examiner and master. Having heard the witnesses and familiarized himself with the case in every step\" of its progress, the -master is more competent to determine upon the credibility of opposing witnesses, and to judge of the evidence. Being fully possessed of the case, the dispute is apt to be confined to the real grounds of controversy. It is to be hoped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the judges of the Common Pleas will follow these suggestions, and thus do justice to the parties and to their own judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">After a careful examination of the evidence (a labor of several days), we have come to the conclusion that the estimate of the timber made under the contract is too uncertain and doubtful to warrant a decree of specific performance. The contract falls within the scope of a chancellor\u2019s jurisdiction, and has been so far executed as to entitle the plaintiff to a decree of specific performance, but for a single fact. The parties, by their agreement, made its execution depend upon a count of the trees on the land, and an estimate of the quantity of lumber contained in them, making the payment dependent on the number of thousand feet to be found by the estimate. They agreed upon the persons to make the count and estimate the quantity, and provided for a new selection of persons in case of their failure to act. The three persons appointed did act to a partial extent, and a report was signed by the requisite number. It is the real character of this report which is the subject of dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"A0v\">The sale of the timber is the true subject of the contract, and the count and estimate \u25a0 are only the means of its execution. Equity, therefore, to prevent a failure of the principal matter, might, in a proper case, furnish a means of ascertaining the quantity of lumber, if the contract made had failed without a serious fault on part of the plaintiff, or. its- execution had become impossible through fortuitous causes. But the plaintiff founds his bill upon the contract-means, asserting that-a fair and true estimate had been made according to its terms. He must show, therefore, a full and fair performance of the contract-mode of ascertaining the price of the timber. Without this it is impossible to execute it specifically, payment of the price being as indispensable as the conveyance of the timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In such a mass of evidence it is impossible to discuss the facts in detail within any proper limits of an opinion. It is sufficient to indicate the points of doubt cast upon the report by the entire volume of the testimony. The first matter to be noticed is the admitted defect in the report, apparent on its face, to wit, the entire omission to estimate the cherry timber on the first-mentioned tract. Had this been the only objection to the report, and merely the result of an oversight or misapprehension, equity might have aided the plaintiff by means of a supplemental report. But this objection, furnishing a direct ground of assault upon the report, is strengthened by the cloud thrown over the whole estimate by the conduct of the appraisers and of the plaintiff. That Hamlin, one of the appraisers, did not unite in making up the estimate which resulted in the report of the other two estimators, is beyond a doubt. He participated in counting the trees and estimating the number of logs each would cut, and also set down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>some of the observations on paper, but he took no part in the computations necessary to finish the estimate and to make up the report. It is said this was only a matter of calculation. This is not correct. The papers made in the woods were to be compared, their results ascertained and suggestions made to each other before there could be a final and full calculation made. We are informed by Hamlin himself that he was not satisfied with their observations on the ground, that many of the standing trees were estimated at the top cut as of the diameter of twelve inches, which he is convinced would have cut from fourteen to sixteen inches, and many trees were estimated at six logs which would have cut seven, making a difference of probably 150,000 feet. There is evidence also that one, and perhaps both, of the other two appraisers were not fully satisfied with the conclusions made upon the ground. Hamlin had no notice of the meeting of the other two to calculate the quantity, cast up the amount and make up the report, and took no part. It was the right of each party to the contract to have the benefit of his skill and observation, and of his suggestions in making up the final estimate. No one now can know how far his views and \u2022 suggestions might have influenced the minds of his coadjutors and convinced them of errors in their observations or of allowances proper to be made. It is said in extenuation that he was sick and could not be had. Under other circumstances this fact might be laid as a ground to induce a chancellor to aid the execution of the contract because of the failure of the agreed mode through an unforeseen contingency. But it will not make that good which is bad because of its consequence. The report made without Hamlin\u2019s participation in the deliberations which led to it is not saved by his sickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Next we have the conduct of the plaintiff. That he undertook to get up the report in the absence of Hamlin, by assisting Hagadorn and Blair to make it, is not questioned; but the question is how far his interference may have affected the result. It is quite possible he copied correctly from the book the count and observations made upon the ground, so far as he assisted to make out the paper from which he and Hagadorn calculated the quantities; and it is possible he made the calculations correctly; but how can we know this confidently ? Hagadorn and Blair may have felt satisfied with his work, but it is still true that he did that which it was Hamlin\u2019s province and not his to do. It is just here that the evidence of the actual quantity of the timber on the ground makes its deepest impression. The report estimates the quantity of pine lumber at 400,000 feet, and of cherry at 218,940 feet. Since the report, the trees have been counted and estimated by various witnesses, many of them experienced lumbermen, at 950,000, 965,000, 979,000 and 1,053,000 feet of pine. One estimate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>founded upon an average obtained from twenty trees, gave 1,121,324 feet of pine. The cherry trees were estimated-at 676,077 feet, of which those on the first-mentioned tract, omitted from the report, made 10,829 feet. Now, allowing a large margin for errors and for rotten timber, yet the disparity between the number of feet estimated by the appraisers in their report and that estimated by many others equally competent leaves upon the mind a painful uncertainty as to the fidelity of the report, which, connecting itself with the conduct of the appraisers and the interference of the plaintiff, renders it difficult to be assured that a decree founded upon it will be based upon justice and fairness. Here it is we think the learned judge committed an error. Instead of looking at the question with the conscience of a chancellor, who is moved to make a decree only by a full conviction of the equity and fairness of the estimate, he viewed it as a mere law judge determining upon the legal effect of the report. Having satisfied himself that the evidence was insufficient to establish a clear case of fraud, he then determined that at law the report was final and conclusive between the parties, and decreed accordingly. But in cases of specific performance, courts of equity will not interfere to decree performance, except where it would be strictly equitable to make such a decree: 2 Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7\u00a7 750, 750 a. An agreement, to be entitled to be carried into specific performance, ought to be certain, fair and just in all its parts: Id., \u00a7 769. A defendant may resist a decree on evidence, where evidence of a like character would be insufficient to establish the case of the plaintiff: Id., \u00a7 770, The specific performance of awards, as well as of contracts, rests on the sound discretion of the court; and if, upon the face of the award or otherwise, it appears that there are just objections to enforcing it, courts of equity will not interfere: Id., \u00a7 1459. On all the evidence, we are unable to say that the report in this case is entirely trustworthy. It is defective on its face as to the cherry timber, and it is made uncertain and doubtful by the evidence of its imperfection and the contradiction of its correctness. Without the report, or such a substitute in a case of failure as equity would resort to in aid of the contract, no decree can be made. We must, therefore, reverse the decree in this case and dismiss the bill, but in such a manner as will not impair the rights of the plaintiff under his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The decree of the court below is therefore reversed, and the bill of the plaintiff dismissed at his costs, but without prejudice to the plaintiff in any future proceeding upon the contract by action, bill or otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
