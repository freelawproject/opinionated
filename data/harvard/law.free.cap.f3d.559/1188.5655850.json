Demarick Hunter is a federal prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of 188 months for being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). He moved to vacate his sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and the district court denied his motion. Hunter then sought a certificate of appealability from this Court, and we denied the application. The Supreme Court vacated our order denying the certificate of appealability and remanded for reconsideration in the light of its decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>490 (2008), which held that driving under the influence was not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Because Hunter has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d we deny his motion for a certif\u00edcate of appeal-ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">Hunter requests a certificate of appeala-bility for two issues that are relevant to the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Be-gay. </em>First, Hunter contends that his due process rights were violated when he was sentenced as an armed career criminal based on two prior convictions for carrying a concealed weapon. Second, Hunter argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the use of his prior firearms convictions in determining that he was subject to an armed career criminal enhancement. Neither argument involves a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Before the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Begay, </em>we held that carrying a concealed weapon was a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act, <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 401 (11th Cir.1996), and was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998). After <em>Begay, </em>a panel of this Court determined that these prior panel precedents had been undermined to the point of abrogation by the decision of the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). This Court also stated, in dicta, that carrying a concealed weapon is not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">Although <em>Begay </em>provides good reason to conclude that Hunter was erroneously sentenced as an armed career criminal, a sentencing error alone does not amount to \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Before Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, <em>id., </em>the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), provided the standard for granting a certificate of probable cause, which required a petitioner to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a federal right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893, 103 S.Ct. at 3394 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act substituted the narrower term \u201cconstitutional\u201d for the term \u201cfederal\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-8\">Under AEDPA, a COA may not issue unless \u201cthe applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). Except for substituting the word \u201cconstitutional\u201d for the word \u201cfederal,\u201d \u00a7 2253 is a codification of the CPC standard announced in <em>Barefoot v. Estelle. </em>Congress had before it the meaning <em>Barefoot </em>had given to the words it selected; and we give the language found in \u00a7 2253(c) the meaning ascribed it in <em>Barefoot, </em>with due note for the substitution of the word \u201cconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\"><em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1603, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citation omitted). \u201cThe term \u2018constitutional right\u2019 means something very different from the term \u2018federal right,\u2019 and because we must assume Congress \u2018means in a statute what it says,\u2019 <em>Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 254, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 1149-50, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992), we give effect to the change.\u201d <em>United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256, 263-64 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc). We may issue a certificate of appealability only where a petitioner makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitutional </em>right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>Although Hunter presents his arguments for a certificate of appealability as involving a denial of due process and ineffective assistance of counsel, Hunter\u2019s sentencing error did not give rise to a violation of the Constitution. Hunter was afforded due process at his sentencing hearing, and sentencing errors \u201care generally not cognizable in a collateral attack.\u201d <em>Buggs v. United States, </em>153 F.3d 439, 443 (7th Cir.1998); <em>see also Cepero, </em>224 F.3d at 267-68; <em>United States v. Segler, </em>37 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.1994). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Hunter must prove that \u201c \u2018no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford v. Hall, </em>546 F.3d 1326, 1333 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc)). Hunter cannot satisfy that burden because, when his original sentence and direct appeal occurred, our precedent, <em>Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, foreclosed the argument that carrying a concealed weapon was not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">Hunter\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
