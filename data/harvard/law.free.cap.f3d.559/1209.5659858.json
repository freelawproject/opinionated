We granted a certificate of appealability as to whether the district court erred in denying Mamone\u2019s claim challenging his restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-26\">On appeal, Mamone argues his restitution amount was improperly assessed and the case needs to be remanded for a \u201cthorough [r]estitution [h]earing.\u201d He argues the restitution order was illegal for a number of reasons, including: (1) it violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663 and 3664, (2) he was never provided with a list of victims and corresponding loss amounts, (3) lack of proof, and (4) he was not legally responsible for some of the alleged offenses resulting in restitution. He con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>tends the district court improperly calculated the sentencing guidelines because the guidelines should have used the conspiracy to commit money laundering provision as opposed to the provision that applies to substantive acts of money laundering. Finally, he argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel at both the trial and appellate levels. In his reply brief, he contends a \u00a7 2255 motion is the proper vehicle to challenge the restitution order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">With regard to a district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">The statute states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-6\">[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a court ... claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">In <em>Blaik v. United States, </em>a federal prisoner sought to have the restitution portion of his sentence reduced under \u00a7 2255. 161 F.3d 1341, 1342-43 (11th Cir.1998). We held \u201c\u00a7 2255 cannot be utilized by a federal prisoner who challenges <em>only </em>the restitution portion of his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343 (emphasis added). Focusing on the \u201cclaiming the right to be released\u201d language from \u00a7 2255, we noted that, if we granted the restitution reduction, we would be taking an action \u201cthat is not authorized by the plain language of the statute\u201d because a restitution reduction did not constitute release from custody. <em>Id. </em>at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-11\">In <em>Kaminski v. United States, </em>the Second Circuit, citing our opinion in <em>Blaik, </em>agreed that \u00a7 2255 could not be used to bring a collateral challenge addressed solely to noncustodial punishment, such as restitution. 339 F.3d 84, 87 (2d Cir.2003). The Second Circuit went on to address whether challenges to noncustodial punishment were cognizable under \u00a7 2255 when joined with challenges to custody. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cKaminski\u2019s petition not only attacks the restitution order, it also contains claims that his sentence of <em>incarceration </em>was, in part, illegal.\u201d). Kaminski proposed an interpretation of \u00a7 2255, in which a motion seeking release may also request that other, noncustodial aspects of one\u2019s sentence be vacated, set aside or corrected; the government proposed an interpretation, in which \u00a7 2255 would be limited to attacking custodial aspects of sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 87-88. The Second Circuit held that habeas claims are designed to attack wrongful custodies, and there was no reason why the presence of a plausible claim against custodial punishment would make a noncustodial punishment more amenable to collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 89. \u201cCollateral relief from noncustodial punishments is not made more readily available to a petitioner just because that petitioner happens at the time to be subject also to custodial penalties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>The Ninth Circuit addressed a similar situation where non-cognizable claims, such as relief from restitution, were brought in a motion that contained cognizable claims for release from custody. <em>United States v. Thiele, </em>314 F.3d 399, 400 (9th Cir.2002). It held that cognizable claims under \u00a7 2255 do not \u201crun interference\u201d for non-cognizable claims, and, thus, claims seeking relief other than release from custody cannot be brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 402. The proper focus was on the relief sought in the claim itself, not other claims mentioned in the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">We have never addressed the precise issue of whether restitution can be challenged in a \u00a7 2255 motion if cognizable claims seeking release from custody are also raised. Our holding in <em>Blaik, </em>however, supports our conclusion that Mamone cannot utilize \u00a7 2255 to challenge his restitution. <em>See Blaik, </em>161 F.3d at 1343 (holding that \u201c\u00a7 2255 cannot be utilized by a federal prisoner who challenges only the restitution portion of his sentence\u201d). In <em>Blaik, </em>we also noted that granting a restitution reduction in a \u00a7 2255 motion would be taking an action clearly not authorized by the statute\u2019s language. <em>Id. </em>at 1342; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). This same reasoning applies here. The plain language of the statute indicates \u00a7 2255 applies to \u201ca prisoner in custody ... claiming the right to be released.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. As the Ninth Circuit determined in <em>Thiele, </em>\u201c[n]on-cognizable claims do not morph into cognizable ones by osmosis.\u201d 314 F.3d at 402. We agree, and conclude the presence of a cognizable claim against Mamone\u2019s custodial punishment does not make his non-cognizable claims more amenable to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">Moreover, allowing a contrary rule could result in incongruent access to federal ha-beas review. <em>See United States v. Segler, </em>37 F.3d 1131, 1137 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cA convicted defendant who receives an allegedly erroneous fine because of constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel cannot seek post-conviction relief under \u00a7 2255 and neither should a petitioner who is both fined and imprisoned have the opportunity to assert an identical fine-related claim under \u00a7 2255.\u201d); <em>Smullen v. United States, </em>94 F.3d 20, 25-26 (1st Cir.1996) (adopting the congruence rationale) (citation omitted). Such a result would be unwarranted by the language and purpose of \u00a7 2255, which has a uniform focus on custodial sentences. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Further, such incongruence \u201cwould encourage petitioners to bring frivolous claims against sentences of incarceration when, in fact, the only colorable claims available are against restitution orders.\u201d <em>Kaminski, </em>339 F.3d at 88. Finally, other circuits addressing the precise issue at hand have held the presence of cognizable claims did not make non-cognizable claims suddenly meritorious in the context of a \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>Id. </em>at 89; <em>Thiele, </em>314 F.3d at 402; <em>see also Virsnieks v. Smith, </em>521 F.3d 707, 721-22 (7th Cir.2008) (relying on \u00a7 2255 cases to conclude a petitioner under \u00a7 2244 cannot bypass the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement simply because the petition includes an independent, cognizable claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">Based on this Court\u2019s prior precedent, the statutory language, and sister circuit authority, the district court did not err in refusing to address Mamone\u2019s restitution challenge in the context of his \u00a7 2255 motion. Despite the presence of claims challenging his custody and requesting release from custody, the restitution claim did not seek release from custody and was rightly denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">. Normally, we will not address an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2004). Nonetheless, we view Mamone\u2019s initial arguments regarding the restitution amount as constituting an implicit argument that \u00a7 2255 is the proper vehicle. <em>See Tannenbaum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(\"Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
