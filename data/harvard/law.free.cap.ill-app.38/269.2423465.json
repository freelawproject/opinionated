He says that reason and justice are with his view of the case, and I think that this doctrine has become the settled law of the country and that where there is an agreement or consent of the partners there can be no doubt about it.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\" pgmap=\"267\">As further illustrating the question here presented a careful consideration of the authorities will show that a partnership debt is no greater or more sacred than an individual debt; that a lien does not exist in favor of a partnership debt where it would not of an individual debt.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\" pgmap=\"267\">That the portion of the effects of a partnership of one of the partners can be set aside as personal property exempt witli the consent of the other partner or partners, seems to be clearly stated.

Cross, 117 Ill. 109; Hunnicutt v. Swenney, 63 Geo. 586; Swearenger v. Bassett et al., 65 Texas, 267; which last case is affirmed, and the rule clearly stated in Heckle v. Grewe, 125 Ill. 63, recognizing the doctrine of consent. This doctrine is also recognized in the case of McMasters v. Alsop, 85 Ill. 157.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\" pgmap=\"267(45) 268(80)\">Assuming that a partnership debt is the same as an individual debt and the same rights as between the firm as an individual, as against the individual the statute would have the right of exemption; the same right exists in the firm; the only party that could object is the other partners; the creditors are not in \u00e1 position to object. They have no lien on the property and are in no better position than an individual creditor. As further illustrating this view of the case see McClary et al. v. Bisby, Adm\u2019r, 36 Ver. 254; Thorn v. Thorn, 14 Iowa, 49; Greenwood &amp; Son v. Maddox &amp; Toms, 27 Ark. 638; Burton, Moses &amp; Bro. v. Moses Baum, 32 Kas. 641.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">The case in 55 Alabama is based upon a special question, and I desire to call the attention of the court to the question-</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-6\" pgmap=\"268\">First. There is evidently a distinction between exemptions as against executions and attachment, and cases of general assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\" pgmap=\"268\">Second. That by the authorities in the cases given a general assignment for the benefit of creditors is ipso facto a dissolution of the partnership, and -as held by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, 57 Wis. 649, and other cases cited, that there is a severance of the property in a legal or technical sense for the purpose of exemption.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\" pgmap=\"268\">Construing the law of exemptions liberally, the petitioner without doubt is entitled to his exemptions. I concede there are cases holding that a partner is not entitled to his exemptions, but in these cases they were cases against an execution and not cases of general assignment for the benefit'of creditors; and so far as stated in \u00edhe case in 55 Alabama, where there was a continuing partnership. And I desire the court not to overlook the decision between a continuing partnership and one dissolved by general assignment.</p><attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-9\" pgmap=\"268\">Messrs.

A. R. Willis &amp; Son, which had made a general assignment to appellee for the benefit of its creditors, under the statute; that he was the head of a family, residing with the same, and as such entitled to an exemption of property of the value of \u00a7400, to be selected by him out of the stock of goods so assigned and now in the hands of appellee; that his partner consents to such exemption; that by the assignment lie did not convey nor intend to convey what was .exempt by law, and that he has no other property out of which he can have said exemption set off to him. It therefore prays for an order to the assignee to set off the same out of the stock so in his hands.</p> <p id=\"b269-7\" pgmap=\"269(107) 270(88)\">To this petition a. demurrer was interposed by the assignee, which was sustained by the County Court, and also by the Circuit Court on appeal, and judgment entered accordingly. We think appellant had no such property in the stock before or after the assignment as would entitle him to the statutory exemption ont of it. Firm assets are a trust fund for the payment of its creditors. The partners individually can have no absolute property in it or in any specific part of it until the creditors are fully satisfied. This elementary doctrine of the law of partnership has been held to bar analogous claims of dower and homestead exemption in real estate of the firm Trowbridge v. Cross, 117 Ill. 109; Simpson v. Leech, 86 Ill. 286; Bopp v. Fox, 63 Ill. 540; its like operation upon personal property to bar such a claim as is here made is clearly recognized in Heckle v. Grewe, 26 Ill. App. 339, and same case in 125 Ill. 58; and the precise question here presented is decided in the case of Croft Brothers, 8 Bissell, 188, and in Ex parte Hopkins, assignee, 104 Ind. 157.</p> <p id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">We are unable to see how a dissolution of the partnership or the consent of the copartner, before the firm creditors are satisfied, can operate to give a partner any greater right to the firm assets or any part thereof, as against the creditors, than he would otherwise have.</p> <p id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
