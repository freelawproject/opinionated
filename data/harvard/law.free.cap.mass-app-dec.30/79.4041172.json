Rule 28, Rules of District Courts (1952); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Cornell Andrews Co. v. B. </em>&amp; <em>P. RR., </em>215 Mass. 381, 387; <em>Gibbons v.

Meyer, of Everett, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">There was evidence in the case which, if believed, would have warranted a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The plaintiff duly filed the following requests for rulings which the trial judge denied without giving any reasons for their denial or making any findings of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The Supreme Judicial Court held in many cases that where a party has made a request that the evidence warranted a finding in his favor, and the evidence did warrant such a finding, the refusal of the requested ruling is error unless the judge, by clear and definite findings has demonstrated that it was inapplicable or immaterial because of his findings. <em>John Hetherington </em>&amp; <em>Sons Ltd. v. William Firth Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, 18, 19; <em>Bresnick v. Heath, </em>292 Mass. 293, 298; <em>Home Savings Bank v. Savransky, </em>307 Mass. 601, 603; <em>Bern v. Boston Consolidated Gas Co., </em>310 Mass. 651; <em>Belger v. Arnot, </em>344 Mass. 679, 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Since no findings of facts were made by the trial judge to show that these requests were inapplicable or immaterial, there was prejudicial error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The finding for the defendant is therefore <em>reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Thos.
