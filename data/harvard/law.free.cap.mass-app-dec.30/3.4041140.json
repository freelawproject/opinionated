Please state everything that you did, in the order in which it was done, in an attempt to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">ANSWER: Applied brakes and attempted to prevent the skidding and jackknifing of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-14\">There were no other witnesses or evidence. At the close of the trial and before the final arguments, the defendants made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>following requests for rulings and the court\u2019s disposition thereon:</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">1. The only evidence of how the alleged accident happened that caused the plaintiff damage was the answer of the defendant, Sidney A. Smith, to interrogatory No. 12: \u201cBriefly, the vehicle I was operating jackknifed and hit the pole owned by the plaintiff\u201d, and his further answer to interrogatory No. 13: \u201cStraight prior to the vehicle skidding and jackknifing, after, which I cannot actually describe the course of the vehicle I was driving, except to say it went to the right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">COURT: No, there are other interrogatories pertinent to accident. I rule as requested, that aside from interrogatories, there was no other evidence bearing on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">2. The court must rule, as a matter of law, that there is no evidence of negligence of either defendant, based on the facts mentioned in No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">COURT: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-9\">3. The court must find, as fact, that there is no evidence of negligence of either defendant, based on the facts alleged in No. 1. COURT: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-10\">4. The plaintiff .cannot introduce through its accounting manager, the cost to it of repairing the alleged damage to the plaintiff\u2019s equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-11\">COURT: No, I find that the cost of the damages appeared in the records of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tiff, which records are kept in usual course of business and were offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AWm\">The court found for the plaintiff against both, defendants on all counts of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">The defendants claim to be aggrieved by the denial of their requests for rulings Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">Prior to the case being remanded to this court, answers #13 and #14 of the interrogatories propounded by the plaintiff to the defendant Sidney A. Smith were stricken from the record and further answers ordered. The net result was that the original answer to interrogatory #13 which set forth that the vehicle at issue was a trailer truck, was stricken and in its place the answer speaks about a vehicle skidding and jackknifing.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">Common sense would indicate (where there is a reference to jackknifing) that the vehicle was a trailer truck, but the further answers to interrogatories #13 and #14 leave it as a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">We cannot read into the case that the vehicle was a trailer truck where the only evidence on that phase is from the interrogatories and the answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">We think there should be a new trial. Prior to that, interrogatories can be filed and with the answers will definitely set forth that the vehicle in question was a trailer truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-10\">Even then the quantum of the evidence as to negligence may be questionable where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the evidence refers to skidding and jackknifing with an absence of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">But in view of our order we will not pass on that phase of the case at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">In passing we should point out .that interrogatory and answer #4 of plaintiff to defendant Sidney Smith, speaks about the corporation name as H. Cohen and Company, Inc., whereas the writ lists it as H. Cohen and Co., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">This is a good example of a trial where the judge is given a paucity of evidence and he is then expected to come up with the right answer. <em>New trial ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b17-8\">\n<em>Lewiton, J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b17-9\">I concur in the result reached by the court, but I would grant a new trial on other grounds. In my opinion the evidence, as reported to us, was not sufficient to warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the operator of the vehicle which came in .contact with the property of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-10\">The plaintiff introduced the defendant Smith\u2019s answers to interrogatories and is bound by such answers, there being no evidence in the case tending to contradict them. <em>Warren v. DeCoste, </em>269 Mass. 415, 419-20; <em>Washburn v. R. F. Owens Co., </em>258 Mass. 446, 4491 <em>Minihan v. Boston Elev. Rwy. Co., </em>197 Mass. 367, 373. Applying this rule, it appears that a vehicle (which can fairly be assumed to have been a trailer-truck) was being operated on a wet road at a speed which was not shown by the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>therefore was not shown to have been excessive, and that the vehicle skidded and jackknifed, and hit a pole owned by the plaintiff. It is elementary that mere skidding is no evidence of negligence. <em>Glavine v. Gaudette, </em>335 Mass. 170, 171; <em>Sherwood v. Radovsky, </em>317 Mass. 307, 308-9 and cases cited.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b18-7\">Peter Hiam, of Boston, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Anm\">Philip T. Cowin, of Boston, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b18-4\">The report indicates a complete absence of evidence as to the specific cause of this accident, and I am unable to draw any inference from common knowledge or experience that the unexplained skidding and jackknifing of a trailer-truck under such circumstances is attributable to negligent operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">However, since the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings were based on only a part of the evidence the trial judge was correct in denying them. There was no request for a ruling as to the sufficiency of the entire evidence to warrant a finding of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">In the light of the entire situation, I think it appropriate that a new trial be granted, rather than an order for entry of judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
