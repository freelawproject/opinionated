He claims that the district court should have dismissed the conviction because by the time of sentencing Congress had amended the federal firearms statutes, and he argues that the three-year sentence he received was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In 1979 Holley was convicted under Texas law of promoting gambling and sentenced to five years in prison. The state court suspended his sentence and placed Holley on probation for five years. In 1984 the court set aside the conviction and dismissed the indictment pursuant to Texas law providing expunction of a criminal conviction for \u201csatisfactory fulfillment of the conditions of probation.\u201d Tex.Code Crim. Proc.Ann. art. 42.12 \u00a7 7 (Vernon 1979). Holley subsequently was charged with and, on January 29, 1986, pleaded guilty to, the two federal firearms violations that are on appeal here. On July 21, 1986, the district court sentenced him to two concurrent three-year terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">There is no question about Holley\u2019s culpability under the law in effect when he was charged and pleaded. At that time 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">(g) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014 (1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">to ship or transport any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">(h) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"App\">(1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">The word \u201cconviction\u201d in this provision was interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983). The Court concluded that \u201cexpunction of a state conviction was not intended by Congress automatically to remove the federal firearms disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 103 S.Ct. at 993. In addition, the Court stated that \u201cfor purposes of the federal gun control laws, we equate a plea of guilty and its notation by the state court, followed by a sentence of probation, with being \u2018convicted\u2019 within the language of \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and (h).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 103 S.Ct. at 992. Plainly, then, as the law existed prior to May 19, 1986, the conviction and sentencing of Holley were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">On that date in 1986 Congress amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20). Appellant argues that his conviction should be set aside on the basis of this amendment. However, Holley\u2019s conduct, occurring in years prior to 1986, is not governed by this amendment because the amendment was not effective until November 14, 1986. Section 110 of Public Law No. 99-308, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-15\">The amendments made by this Act [amending sections 921, 922 ...] shall become effective one hundred and eighty days after the date of the enactment of this Act [May 19, 1986].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 note (Supp.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">Holley advances the common law rule that the repeal of a criminal statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>abates all prosecutions not finally disposed of by the highest court authorized to directly review them, though he is aware that a federal statute has been enacted to at least partially counteract the doctrine of abatement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u00a7 109. Repeal of statutes as affecting existing liabilities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. On its face, this general federal savings statute would appear to bar Holley\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Holley argues that the savings statute does not apply to this case, because the Supreme Court has held that it \u201cwas meant to obviate mere technical abatement.\u201d <em>Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, </em>379 U.S. 306, 314, 85 S.Ct. 384, 390, 13 L.Ed.2d 300 (1964). The Court\u2019s example of a technical abatement is the substitution of a new statute with a greater schedule of penalties. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Hamm </em>itself, the new statute at issue was the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made illegal prosecutions for peaceably sitting in at all-white lunch counters. The Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act would have retroactive application, since it \u201cworks no such technical abatement. It substitutes a right for a crime. So drastic a change is well beyond the narrow language of amendment and repeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although appellant attempts to bring himself under <em>Hamm, </em>it is evident that the change in the firearms statute wrought by Congress in May of 1986 cannot be termed \u201cdrastic.\u201d Rather, it changes the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d so as to exclude cases where state expungement has occurred. Unlike the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this was unquestionably a case of \u201camendment and repeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Moreover, in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>429 F.2d 566 (5th Cir.1970), we applied the general savings statute in a case analogous to the instant one. We held that \u201ca conviction based on [the Federal Firearms Act of 1947] can be validly rendered after repeal of that statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Holley also cites in his favor <em>Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974), where, without discussing the general savings statute, the Court spoke on the question of the retroactivity of a change in the law. The case does not prove Holley\u2019s point, however, for the Court there adopts what it calls the \u201cbroad\u201d view that \u201ca change in the law must be given [retroactive] effect <em>unless </em>there was clear indication that it was <em>not </em>to apply in pending cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712-13, 94 S.Ct. at 2017 (emphasis in original). In the instant case, there is indeed an indication that Congress did not intend the May 1986 changes to apply to pending cases. By its own terms, the amendment is to take effect only 180 days after its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Next, Holley points out that his federal firearms conviction and sentence are dependent upon the Supreme Court\u2019s statutory interpretation, in <em>Dickerson, </em>of the term \u201cconviction,\u201d as including expunged convictions. But, he argues, this interpretation has been discredited by the amending legislation, whereby \u201cconviction\u201d no longer includes \u201cexpunged conviction.\u201d Holley contends that \u201can amendment substituting a new phrase for one previously construed indicates that the judicial construction of the earlier phrase did not correspond with the legislative intent,\u201d and so \u201cit appears likely that the Supreme Court in <em>Dickerson </em>and this Court in its earlier decisions misapplied or misinterpreted the Federal Firearms Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">It does not lie within our province to annul <em>Dickerson, </em>but the legislative history of the 1986 amending legislation flatly contradicts Holley\u2019s argument. The House report on the history of the legislation states that it \u201cexpanded the class of persons eligible for relief from the disabilities imposed under the [Gun Control] Act. It benefits persons who had been convicted of a crime ... [and] have been subsequently determined to have reformed.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 495, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1327, 1331. Nowhere is it suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>such \u201cexpansion\u201d was made necessary only because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dickerson. </em>Nor indeed is there any mention at all of <em>Dickerson, </em>although the legislative history does contain discussion of other Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Finally, appellant argues that although the penalty he received was within the statutory limits, nevertheless it \u201cis overly harsh, disproportionate and cruel and unusual.\u201d He cites no case holding a term of three years imprisonment to be harsh or \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d Instead, he argues that the three-year term is \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d in light of the legislative changes that have occurred. We have previously rejected this argument. In <em>United States v. Rojas-Colombo, </em>462 F.2d 1091 (5th Cir.1972), defendant challenged his 20-year sentence because Congress repealed the statute under which he was convicted \u201cand replaced the repealed offenses with similar proscriptions carrying maximum imprisonment of only 15 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1091. Defendant\u2019s contention was that, because of the statutory change, imposition of the pri- or maximum 20-year sentence \u201cviolated the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution against cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201cthe contention is without merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same is true of the contention raised by Holley.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
