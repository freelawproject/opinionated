J.</author>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Appellants San Francisco Tomorrow and Parkmerced Action Coalition (PMAC) appeal the San Francisco Superior Court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn the decision by respondents City and County of San Francisco (City) and its board of supervisors (Board) approving the Parkmerced Development Project (the project). The project involves the long-term redevelopment of the privately owned, 152-acre Parkmerced property by real party in interest Parkmerced Investors Properties, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Appellants challenge the court\u2019s denial of their writ petition contending: (1) The \u201cLand Use Element\u201d (sometimes called the \u201cUrban Design Element\u201d) of the San Francisco General Plan (General Plan) is inadequate for failing to include standards for population density and building intensity. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65302, subds. (a), (b).) (2) The project and the various project approvals are inconsistent with the \u201cpriority policies\u201d and other policies of the General Plan. (3) The environmental impact report (EIR) and the findings underlying the City\u2019s approval of the project were inadequate under standards established by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.). (4) The court erred in sustaining a demurrer to appellant PMAC\u2019s cause of action for violation of its due process rights. (5) The court erred in including in the administrative record transcripts of proceedings before an advisory body that were not before the Board when it certified the EIR and approved the project. We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">A. <em>The Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The project involves major modifications to Parkmerced, a 3,221-unit residential rental complex on 152 acres. The site is located near Lake Merced, in the southwest comer of San Francisco. It is surrounded by the Stonestown Galleria shopping mall, San Francisco State University, two golf courses, and residential neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The original Parkmerced complex was built in the 1940s by MetLife as one of eight large-scale developments created around the country to provide affordable middle-income housing. The architect for Parkmerced was the New York City firm Leonard Schultze &amp; Associates and its design involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>noted San Francisco architect Frederick H. Meyer. The landscape plan was designed by famed San Francisco architect Thomas Church, designer of the master plans for the University of California, Berkeley and Santa Cruz campuses, among other notable landscapes. Originally consisting of 192 acres and 3,483 residential units, significant portions of the site were sold off to San Francisco State University and to various private owners. The remaining complex, which is the subject of the project and resulting CEQA review, consists of 152 acres and 3,221 residential units. Parkmerced Investors has owned the complex since October 2005. The complex\u2019s housing is currently divided between eleven 13-story towers containing 1,683 rental units and 170 two-story \u201ctownhouse\u201d buildings containing 1,538 units. Over the course of 20 to 30 years, the project would demolish all townhouse units, build an equal number of replacement units and add 5,679 units for a total of 8,900 units. Of the new nonreplacement units, some would be rental units, while others would be sold. Some of the new units would be below-market-rate units, as required by City ordinance. The remainder would be market-rate units.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">As described, \u201cThe proposed Project is a long-term (approximately 20-30 years) mixed-use development program to comprehensively re-plan and re-develop the approximately 116-acre Site (152-acres including streets). The Project proposes to increase the residential density, provide new commercial and retail services, provide new transit facilities, new parks and open space amenities and improve existing utilities and stormwater management systems within the development Site. Of the existing 3,221 residential units on the Site, approximately 1,683 units located within the 11 existing towers would remain and approximately 1,538 existing apartments would be demolished and replaced in phases over the approximately 20 to 30-year development period. As provided in the proposed [development [ajgreement, all 1,538 new replacement units would be subject to the San Francisco Rent Stabilization Ordinance and existing tenants in the to-be-replaced existing apartment units would have rights to relocate into new replacement units of equivalent size with the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms at their existing rents. An additional 5,679 net new units would also be added to the Site for a project total of 8,900 units. New buildings on the Site would range in height from 35 feet to 145 feet, and would not be taller than the existing towers, which will remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u201cNeighborhood-serving retail and office space would also be constructed as part of the proposed Project and concentrated on Crespi Drive, near the northeast part of the Site and the light-rail line. The proposed new neighborhood core would be located within walking distance of all the residences within Parkmerced. In addition, small neighborhood-serving retail establishments would be constructed outside of the neighborhood core, in proximity to residential units throughout the Site. A new preschool/elementary school and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>daycare facility site, fitness center, and new open space uses including athletic fields, walking and biking paths, a new farm, which the Sponsor proposes will be organic, and community gardens would also be provided on the Project Site. Infrastructure improvements would include the installation of [a] bioswale system to retain and treat stormwater on-site and renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and photovoltaic cells, which are detailed in the Sustainability Plan. Transportation improvements would include the realignment of the Muni M-Oceanview light-rail line through the Project Site, redesign and redevelopment of all public streets within the Project Site to meet the City\u2019s Better Streets design standards, provision of car-share and bike-sharing stations throughout the Project Site, pedestrian safety and traffic improvements to intersections adjacent to the Project Site, construction of new bicycle paths, provision of a free shuttle service to Daly City BART and other items detailed in the Transportation Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">B. <em>Project Approvals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In addition to an EIR, prepared pursuant to CEQA, project approval also required amendments to the City\u2019s General Plan, zoning map, and planning code (to add the Parkmerced special use district [sometimes referred to as the SUD]), as well as approval of a local coastal zone permit and the negotiated development agreement between the City and real party in interest (collectively Project Approvals).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Real party in interest applied to the City for environmental review of the project in January 2008. In May 2009, the City issued a notice of preparation for the project EIR. The draft EIR (DEIR) was released for public review on May 12, 2010. A 60-day public comment period followed. The City\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission held a hearing to receive input on the DEIR. The comments and responses document was released on October 28, 2010, and informational meetings were held by the planning commission. On February 10, 2011, the planning commission held a formal public hearing and voted to certify the project\u2019s final EIR (FEIR) and to recommend that the Board approve the project and related Project Approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">On March 1 and 2, 2011, appellants and others filed timely appeals with the Board contesting certification of the FEIR. The Board heard the appeal on March 29, 2011, and took public comment. After close of the public comment, the Board voted to continue the item. Meanwhile, the Board\u2019s land use and economic development committee (LUEDC) took additional public comment on the remaining project approvals. The LUEDC held four hearings\u2014on March 28, April 18, May 16, and the morning of May 24, 2011. At the May 16 and May 24 meetings, the LUEDC discussed and approved amendments to the approvals. At the end of the May 24 hearing, the LUEDC forwarded the amended documents to the Board without recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>On the afternoon of May 24, 2011, the Board held a hearing on the continued EIR appeal and the project approvals. At the end of that meeting, the Board denied the appeal, upheld certification of the EIR and approved the project. On June 6, 2011, the Board finalized the project approvals. The mayor signed the approvals on June 10, 2011, and a notice of determination was filed that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">C. <em>The Petition for Writ of Mandate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Appellants filed their \u201cVerified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\u2019 on July 11, 2011. Disputes over the content of the record followed and appellants moved to \u201cClarify the Extent of the Administrative Record,\u201d seeking to exclude certain hearings from the record. The court granted in part and denied in part the motion, ordering hearings before the LUEDC and the Historic Preservation Commission to be transcribed and included in the record and excluding two hearings occurring after the Board\u2019s certification of the EIR. The trial court also granted real party\u2019s demurrer (joined in by the City) to the seventh and eighth causes of action of PMAC for declaratory relief and for violation of due process rights. The operative pleading, the \u201cVerified Third Amended Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate,\u201d was filed on April 6, 2012. Following a hearing on the merits of the petition, the trial court took the matter under submission. It issued its order denying the petition on all counts on December 14, 2012. Judgment was entered on January 16, 2013, and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">I. General Plan Adequacy</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">A. <em>General Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u201cThe Legislature has required every county and city to adopt \u2018a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county or city. . . .\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65300.) A general plan provides a \u2018 \u201ccharter for future development\u201d \u2019 and sets forth a city or county\u2019s fundamental policy decisions about such development.\u201d <em>(Friends of Lagoon Valley v. City of Vacaville </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 815 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 251] <em>(Friends of Lagoon Valley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u201c \u2018[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Since consistency with the general plan is required, absence of a valid general plan, or valid relevant elements or components <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>thereof, precludes enactment of zoning ordinances and the like.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The general plan consists of a \u201cstatement of development policies . . . setting forth objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals.\u201d [Citation.] The plan must include seven elements\u2014land use, circulation, conservation, housing, noise, safety and open space\u2014and address each of these elements in whatever level of detail local conditions require [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fonseca </em>v. <em>City of Gilroy </em>(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u201cThe adoption or amendment of a general plan is a legislative act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65301.5.) A legislative act is presumed valid, and a city need not make explicit findings to support its action. [Citations.] A court cannot inquire into the wisdom of a legislative act or review the merits of a local government\u2019s policy decisions. [Citation.] Judicial review of a legislative act under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is limited to determining whether the public agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, entirely without evidentiary support, or procedurally unfair. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Federation of Hillside &amp; Canyon Assns. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1195 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 543].) \u201c[0]nly those portions of the general plan which are impacted or influenced by the adoption or amendment can properly be challenged in the action which is brought.\u201d <em>(Garat v. City of Riverside </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259, 289-290 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 504], disapproved in part on another ground as stated in <em>Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 743, fn. 11 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143].)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Appellants attack the San Francisco General Plan itself, arguing the Urban Design Element of the General Plan is inadequate for failing to include standards for population density and building intensity as required by Government Code section 65302, subdivision (a), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe [general] plan shall include the following elements: [][] (a) A land use element that designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land .... The land use element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The trial court concluded that a reasonable person could conclude, as did the City, that table 1-27 and map 1-2 in the General Plan\u2019s \u201cHousing Element,\u201d and maps 4 and 5 in the Urban Design Element provide the information described in Government Code section 65302, subdivision (a). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\"><em>1. Population density. </em>The terms \u201cpopulation density\u201d and \u201cbuilding intensity\u201d are not defined by the statute. In <em>Twain Harte Homeowners Assn. v. County of Tuolumne </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 664 [188 Cal.Rptr. 233] <em>(Twain Harte), </em>the court determined \u201cthe reasonable interpretation of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u2018population density\u2019 as used in Government Code section 65302 is one which refers to numbers of <em>people </em>in a given area and not to dwelling units per acre, unless the basis for correlation between the measure of dwelling units per acre and numbers of people is set forth explicitly in the plan.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 699, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The Urban Design Element of the General Plan includes a \u201cLand Use Index.\u201d This index includes land use maps and references to land use policies scattered through other elements. Appellants acknowledge, as they must, that the actual layout of a general plan is generally within the local agency\u2019s discretion. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65301; see <em>Garat v. City of Riverside, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th 259, 296 [plan may be adopted in any format deemed appropriate or convenient, including combining of elements, a single document or group of documents relating to subjects or geographic segments of the planning area].) The Land Use Index has a section labeled \u201cPopulation Density and Building Intensity Standards.\u201d This section points to density and intensity standards in the commerce, industry and housing elements, and various area plans. It also has a series of maps depicting city wide guidelines for building height and building bulk, and which depict a citywide commercial and industrial density plan expressing densities in terms of a FAR (floor area ratio), the ratio between gross floor area to lot area. However, the identified \u201carea plans\u201d do not include the Parkmerced area.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The section of the Housing Element describing the existing housing stock contains a table (1-27, <em>\u201cGeneralized Housing Densities Allowed by </em>Zoning\u201d) and corresponding map (1-2, <em>\u201cGeneralized Housing Densities Allowed by </em>Zoning\u201d) that together provide an adequate description of the population densities for the Parkmerced area. Table 1-27 of the Housing Element sets forth five categories of housing density (low, moderately low, medium, moderately high, and high) and specifies the types of zoning districts that relate to each category. For each category, the table states both the \u201caverage units per acre\u201d and the \u201cpopulation density,\u201d in addition to describing the general locations where these density levels may be found. Map 1-2, on the following page, shows the locations of each housing density category throughout the City. A narrative preceding the table and map describes them: \u201cTable 1-27 offers a listing of the City\u2019s zoning categories that permit residential development, grouping these by generalized housing density levels. Map 1-2 provides a generalized illustration of housing densities citywide.\u201d The map identifies portions of the Parkmerced site as \u201cmedium density,\u201d corresponding to an average population density of 124 persons per acre, and other portions as \u201chigh density\u201d corresponding to an average population density of 651 persons per acre. Accordingly, the General Plan includes a statement of population density (numbers of people) for the territory it covers. (See <em>Twain Harte, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.3d at p. 699; see also <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 350 [176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 620] [there must be a perceptible connection between density standards and locations within the jurisdiction].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Government Code section 65302, subdivision (a) does not require a general plan\u2019s population density statement to be \u201cprescriptive,\u201d rather than \u201cdescriptive,\u201d as appellants suggest. Rather, that section requires a statement of <em>recommended </em>densities, not binding or inflexible limits on density. (See <em>Sequoyah Hills Homeowners Assn. v. City of Oakland </em>(1993) 23 Cal.App.4th 704, 718 &amp; fn. 7 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 182] <em>(Sequoyah) </em>[map that is \u201c \u2018largely illustrative in nature\u2019 \u201d is a standard of population density under Gov. Code, \u00a7 65302, subd. (a), even though a city\u2019s approvals may occasionally deviate from details of the map].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Moreover, respondents dispute appellants\u2019 claim that table 1-27 only describes existing densities. The averages in the table correspond to specific zoning designations and general locations throughout the City, as also identified in the table. Therefore, respondents maintain, geographic locations and the zoning designations throughout the City also signal the generally recommended population density. Further, the Housing Element contemplates that new housing will generally be constructed at densities similar to the surrounding development. Therefore, table 1-27 and map 1-2 also project the likely future densities throughout the City. (See Housing Element pt. I, pp. 92-93 [discussion projecting future residential development on in-fill sites at lower densities in neighborhoods characterized by single-family homes, and higher densities closer to downtown and in the City\u2019s mixed-use districts].) We conclude the General Plan adequately states population densities.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">2. <em>Building intensity. </em>Terming the General Plan building intensity standards \u201cmarginally better\u201d than its \u201cpopulation density\u201d standards, appellants argue that the Urban Design Element inclusion of a citywide map of maximum building heights, and its map identifying building bulk standards are insufficient, as the standards do not contain the usual measure of floor intensity ratios and bulk limits are set only for parts of a building exceeding a certain height.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The Urban Design Element includes a map of the various permitted building heights citywide and a separate map addressing building bulk. (Land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Use Index, pp. 108-109, figures VI.4, \u201cUrban Design Guidelines for Height of Buildings,\u201d and VI.5, \u201cUrban Design Guidelines for Bulk of Buildings Map.\u201d) The bulk map establishes maximum dimensions of buildings <em>above specified heights. </em>These height and size limitations help define the envelope or \u201cintensity\u201d of buildings throughout the City. They include standards for the Parkmerced site.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Building intensity for the site is further regulated through the project\u2019s General Plan amendment and SUD. Project approvals amend height map 4 to establish a boundary around the Parkmerced site and replace existing height regulations with a notation to \u201c \u2018See Parkmerced Special Use District, Section 249.64 of the Planning Code and Sectional Map HT13 of the Zoning Maps.\u2019 \u201d The SUD, in turn, establishes building height and bulk for the site through amendments to the applicable zoning height map and a bulk table. The ordinance establishing the Parkmerced SUD also contained amendments to the Planning Code identifying permitted uses in each of the newly established Parkmerced classes of use districts, as well as prohibited uses in the SUD as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The standards for building heights and the bulk limits for buildings above specified heights are precisely the sorts of standards called for in <em>Twain Harte, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.3d at page 699 (standards might include \u201crestrictions such as height or size limitations, restrictions on types of buildings or uses to be permitted within a designated area\u201d). The building intensity requirement of Government Code section 65302, subdivision (a) was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">3. <em>Correlation of circulation element with changes in population density and building intensity. </em>Appellants suggest the General Plan is also deficient in that the \u201cTransportation Element\u201d is not correlated with the Land Use Element, as required by Government Code section 65302, subdivision (b). In a single paragraph in their opening brief, appellants argue that without adequate building intensity standards, the General Plan \u201ccannot predict the increased transportation demand associated with future development and adjust the circulation element accordingly.\u201d As we have determined building intensity standards were adequate, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Furthermore, as recognized in <em>Federation of Hillside &amp; Canyon Assns. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at page 1196, \u201cthe internal consistency and correlation requirements do not require a city or county to limit population growth or provide traffic management measures to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ensure that its transportation infrastructure can accommodate future population growth. The Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq.) does not require a city or county to avoid adverse impacts on transportation. Rather, the city has broad discretion to weigh and balance competing interests in formulating development policies, and a court cannot review the wisdom of those decisions under the guise of reviewing a general plan\u2019s internal consistency and correlation. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">As respondents point out, the Project Approvals reflect the City\u2019s decision to limit parking and roadway capacity in areas well served by transit. We do not second-guess such a policy choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">II. Project Consistency with the General Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">As is often the case, the standard of review and the degree of deference this court is to apply to the decision of the City is determinative of many of the issues presented. Appellants, joined by amici curiae Sierra Club and California Preservation Foundation, contend that deference to the City\u2019s interpretation of the priority policies of the General Plan was unwarranted, because the priority policies had been enacted via a citizen\u2019s initiative, \u201cProposition M,\u201d rather than authored by the City itself. Appellants and amici curiae argue that the initiative must be interpreted to effectuate the intent of the voters and that the City\u2019s intent and its interpretation of the meaning of the policies are irrelevant and entitled to little, if any, deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Appellants and amici curiae further maintain that the priority policies must be strictly construed, as Proposition M requires that the City make findings of consistency with those priority policies for all future projects, and that the plain language of Proposition M requires a <em>specific </em>finding of consistency with each and every priority policy identified therein. Consequently, appellants and amici curiae assert that the consistency findings here were inadequate, insofar as they were based on determinations that the project was generally compatible with the priority policies or that \u201con balance\u201d the project will further the priority policies and not obstruct their attainment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">A. <em>Deference to the City\u2019s Interpretation of the General Plan Priority Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">As stated by the Sixth Appellate District in <em>Pfeiffer v. City of Sunnyvale City Council </em>(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1562-1563 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 380] <em>(Pfeiffer): </em>\u201cOur evaluation of appellants\u2019 contention is governed by well established standards.\u201d \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018An action, program, or project is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>attainment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.] State law does not require perfect conformity between a proposed project and the applicable general plan. . . .

It is true that many cases explain that reviewing courts accord great deference to the agency\u2019s determination \u201c \u2018because the body which adopted the general plan policies in its legislative capacity has unique competence to interpret those policies when applying them in its adjudicatory capacity.

The above cases also recognize that \u201c \u2018[bjecause policies in a general plan reflect a range of competing interests, the governmental agency must be allowed to weigh and balance the plan\u2019s policies when applying them, and it has broad discretion to construe its policies in light of the plan\u2019s purposes.

Such deference to the actions of the legislative body stems from well-settled principles of court respect for the separation of powers.

Unlike <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1116, 1165 [134 Cal.Rptr.3d 499, 265 P.3d 1002], holding that sponsors of citizens\u2019 initiatives must be allowed to defend their validity, this case does not involve a challenge to the <em>validity </em>of a citizen\u2019s initiative. Rather, it is a challenge to the City\u2019s <em>application </em>of the General Plan and, specifically, to the City\u2019s interpretation and application of the priority policies adopted by Proposition M and found today in section 101.1, subdivision (a) of the City\u2019s planning code. The same rules of construction that apply to other amendments to the planning code or to the General Plan apply here. \u201cOnce an initiative measure has been approved by the requisite vote of electors in an election, ... the measure becomes a duly enacted constitutional amendment or statute.\u201d <em>(Perry, </em>at p. 1147.) As our Supreme Court has observed, \u201c \u2018Although the initiative power must be construed liberally to promote the democratic process [citation] when utilized to enact statutes, those statutes are subject to the same constitutional limitations and rules of construction as are other statutes.\u2019 <em>(Legislature </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 658, 675 [194 Cal.Rptr. 781, 699 P.2d 17].)

Furthermore, the general plan at issue in <em>Endangered Habitats </em>explicitly did not allow balancing of certain identified policies. Rather, it mandated compliance with a specific plan in order to maintain a buffer between urban development and a national forest. The specific plan distinguished between mandatory and permissive provisions and a consistency checklist explained that \u201c \u2018 \u201cshall\u201d indicates a mandatory [Regulation to which there are no exceptions, while \u201cshould\u201d indicates a non-mandatory [guideline.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 785-786.)

They shall be included in the preamble to the Master Plan and shall be the basis upon which inconsistencies in the Master Plan are resolved:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">\u201c(1) That existing neighborhood-serving retail uses be preserved and enhanced and future opportunities for resident employment in and ownership of such business enhanced;</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">\u201c(2) That existing housing and neighborhood character be conserved and protected in order to preserve the cultural and economic diversity of our neighborhoods;</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">\u201c(3) That the City\u2019s supply of affordable housing be preserved and enhanced;</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">\u201c(4) That commuter traffic not impede Muni transit service or overburden our streets or neighborhood parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">\u201c(5) That a diverse economic base be maintained by protecting our industrial and service sectors from displacement due to commercial office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>development, and that future opportunities for resident employment and ownership in these sectors be enhanced;</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u201c(6) That the City achieve the greatest possible preparedness to protect against injury and loss of life in an earthquake;</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u201c(7) That landmarks and historic buildings be preserved; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u201c(8) That our parks and open space and their access to sunlight and vistas be protected from development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 101.1 of the planning code provide that the City may not adopt any zoning ordinance or development agreement authorized pursuant to Government Code section 65865, unless, \u201cprior to that adoption it has specifically found that the ordinance or development agreement is consistent with\u201d the priority policies and the City\u2019s master plan. Subdivision (e) of section 101.1 provides that similar consistency findings \u201cshall\u201d be made by the City before \u201cissuing a permit for any project or adopting any legislation which requires an initial study under [CEQA], and prior to issuing a permit for any demolition, conversion or change of use, and prior to taking any action which requires a finding of consistency with the Master Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The language of section 101.1, subdivision (b) of the City\u2019s planning code, that the priority policies are to \u201cbe the basis upon which inconsistencies in the Master Plan are resolved,\u201d does not remotely provide the type of specificity and clarity that is found in the general plan policies of either <em>FUTURE, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th 1332 or <em>Endangered Habitats, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th 777. A reasonable person could conclude that such language allows the City to weigh and balance the priority policies and to construe them in light of the purposes of the General Plan. As for the specific priority policies themselves, the plain language of these policies lacks the type of directive courts use to determine whether a policy is mandatory\u2014use of words such as \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall.\u201d Our reading of the priority policies here persuades us they are neither \u201cmandatory\u201d nor \u201cclear,\u201d and the project does not directly conflict with them, unlike the plans in <em>FUTURE </em>and <em>Endangered Habitats, </em>where the project in each case directly conflicted with one or more specific and mandatory policies set forth in the general plans to the degree that no reasonable person could conclude they were consistent. While the City planning code requires that procedurally, a project must be found consistent with the policies, the policies themselves contain no objective standards, but only subjective standards that neither prohibit any particular development or type of development nor command any particular outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Nearly 30 years ago, immediately after passage of Proposition M, the San Francisco City Attorney issued an analysis of that measure, observing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that in passing Proposition M, the voters intended to alter the City\u2019s practice of determining consistency by considering the relevant policies as a whole\u201d and concluding that \u201cthe consistency requirement of Proposition M calls for a balancing of the eight Priority Policies rather than strict compliance with each and every one. Subject to the other provisions of Proposition M and the Code, the City Planning Commission [or other entity required to make the consistency finding] may approve each project ... if, after considering all aspects of the project, the Commission concludes that approval of the project would further the Priority Policies and not obstruct their attainment. If a particular action would advance some Policies while frustrating others, a finding of consistency would be proper only if the Commission concludes that the benefits in furthering some of the Policies outweigh the harm in impeding others.\u201d (S.F. City Atty., Opn. No. 86-17 (Dec. 16, 1986) pp. 15-16, fn. omitted.) The opinion pointed out that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that in passing Proposition M, the voters intended to alter the City\u2019s practice of determining consistency by considering the relevant policies as a whole\u201d <em>(id., </em>pp. 14-15)\u2014an approach approved by this division in <em>Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage v.

In two somewhat prescient examples, the city attorney pointed out that priority policy No. 3, encouraging affordable housing projects, would likely violate priority policies Nos. 1 and 2, if the projects replaced existing housing or existing retail businesses; and that the priority policy of preserving existing affordable housing (priority policy No. 3) could easily conflict with the priority policy of achieving the greatest possible earthquake preparedness (priority policy No. 6). <em>{Ibid.) </em>We agree with the city attorney\u2019s long-settled construction of this legislation and with its observation that \u201crequiring perfect consistency with each of the Priority Policies could prevent many, if not all, affordable housing projects.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">C. <em>Priority Policy Consistency Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Appellant challenges the City\u2019s findings that the project and its accompanying approvals were consistent with priority policies Nos. 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Amici curiae join appellants in arguing that the project is inconsistent with policies Nos. 2 and 7. In finding that the development agreement was in conformity with the General Plan, as amended, and the eight priority policies of San Francisco Planning Code section 101.1, the Board adopted and incorporated by reference the findings made by the planning commission. The planning commission had found that the development agreement and related approval actions were, \u201con balance,\u201d consistent with the General Plan and with the priority policies of San Francisco Planning Code section 101.1, subdivision (b), stating its reasons, in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u201c[Priority Policy No. 2] The existing housing and neighborhood character will be conserved and protected in order to preserve the cultural and economic diversity of our neighborhoods:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u201cThe proposed Project would preserve the existing diversity and character of Parkmerced by maintaining the same number of rent controlled units (3,221 rent controlled units) that currently exist at Parkmerced. The Project would accomplish this by conserving 1,683 existing rent controlled apartments, which would remain subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, and replacing all 1,538 existing rent controlled apartments that would be demolished by the Project with a new unit that would be subject to the same protections as contained in the Rent Stabilization Ordinance for the life of the building. In addition, under the proposed Project, residents of buildings proposed for demolition would be given the opportunity to relocate to such replacement units in a new building and would be assessed the same rent as their previous unit. The Project would also enhance the diversity of Parkmerced by constructing a large number of new BMR [below market rate] affordable units. Currently, Parkmerced has no BMR units. Further, the proposed Project would enhance the character of the Parkmerced neighborhood by establishing a social and commercial core, improving pedestrian accessibility, and creating open space and recreational opportunities, [f] . . .

These improvements would alleviate the overcrowding issues at the existing Parkmerced/SFSU station and improve the connection to SFSU by requiring riders to cross Holloway Avenue as opposed to Nineteenth Avenue. The realignment would also reduce the walking distance to transit for residents of Parkmerced, thereby encouraging the use of public transportation. In addition, the proposed roadway re-alignments would ease the burden on City streets in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the Parkmerced area by improving traffic flow. Finally, the proposed Project would add approximately 90 on-street and 6,252 off-street parking spaces, ensuring that residents of the proposed Project do not rely on parking in the adjoining neighborhoods, [f] . . .

Although none of the buildings on the Project Site are designated City landmarks, as mitigation for the Proposed Project\u2019s impacts to historic resources under [CEQA], the Project Sponsor will prepare documentation of the site based on the National Park Service\u2019s Historic American Building Survey/Historic American Engineering Record Historical Report Guidelines and provide a permanent display of interpretative materials concerning the history of the original Parkmerced complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u201c[Priority Policy No. 8] Parks and open space and their access to sunlight and vistas will be protected from development:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u201cThe proposed Project would provide 68 acres of open space in a network of publically accessible neighborhood parks, athletic fields, public plazas, greenways and a farm. The Project would provide significant additional open space in the form of private or semi-private open space areas such as centralized outdoor courtyards, roof decks, and balconies. These private and semi-private open spaces would be required within the development of each residential building within Parkmerced. The parks and open space would be more accessible and usable than the current open spaces. Parks and open space within, and in the vicinity of, the proposed Project would continue to receive a substantial amount of sunlight during the day when use is at its highest rate. Existing coastal views from parks located to the east and north of the Protect Site would be maintained with implementation of the proposed Project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The priority policy consistency findings made by the City are supported by the reasons given by the planning commission and are supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>record. We cannot conclude that no reasonable person would make such determinations. Appellants\u2019 and amici curiae\u2019s challenges to these findings are based upon their rigid reading of the priority policies and their refusal to recognize the general rule giving discretion to the Board to balance the numerous General Plan priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">D. <em>Project Consistency with Other General Plan Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Appellants contend that other policies in the General Plan echo the priority policies and that project approvals are also inconsistent with those policies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having rejected appellants\u2019 premise\u2014that the project and Project Approvals were inconsistent with the priority policies\u2014we also reject their conclusion. Nevertheless, we briefly address the claims of inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">1. <em>Housing element policy 3.6 consistency determination. </em>Housing element policy 3.6 states: \u201cPreserve Landmark and Historic Residential Buildings.\u201d This policy is by its terms more narrow than priority policy No. 7, as it is limited to historic <em>residential </em>buildings. Parkmerced does not contain any landmark or historic <em>buildings, </em>residential or otherwise. A reasonable person could conclude the project and project approvals were not inconsistent with this general plan element.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">2. <em>Community safety element policy 2.11 regarding hazards from gas lines. </em>Appellants contend community safety element policy 2.11, which states, \u201creduce hazards from gas fired appliances and gas lines,\u201d is similar to priority policy No. 6. Appellants argue the project site is located \u201cvery close to major [Pacific Gas and Electric Company] gas pipelines\u201d and that the \u201cPlanning Department attempted to belittle the risk involved using, data . . . that antedated the San Bruno [pipeline] explosion of the previous fall.\u201d Appellants urge the data used by the City antedated the San Bruno explosion and they speculate that the project \u201cwill impede emergency response to a foreseeable catastrophic failure . . . .\u201d The City consulted federal authorities as to the location of gas pipelines (noting that \u201cthe closest gas transmission line to the Project Site is PG&amp;E\u2019s Line 109, which generally follows Alemany Boulevard,\u201d outside project boundaries) and as to the risk of gas line explosions, finding them \u201crare.\u201d The City\u2019s risk assessment <em>did </em>take into consideration the San Bruno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>incident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The City\u2019s reliance on building codes and regulations to assist in its determination that a project will reduce potential hazards was proper. (See <em>Oakland Heritage Alliance v. City of Oakland (2011) </em>195 Cal.App.4th 884, 904 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 755] [compliance with building codes and the other regulatory provisions, in conjunction with a detailed geotechnical investigation, provided substantial evidence that the mitigation measures would reduce seismic impacts to a less than significant level].) Also relevant is the City\u2019s response to the earthquake preparedness priority policy No. 6, that \u201cnew buildings would be constructed with all applicable building codes and regulations with regard to seismic safety,\u201d including recommendations from the geologic, geotechnical and seismic study conducted for the project in May 2008. The City determined appellants\u2019 argument was \u201cspeculative\u201d as it had been presented with no data or evidence that PG&amp;E pipelines in the vicinity of the project posed a hazard to residents or visitors that would result from implementation of the proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We conclude a reasonable person could have reached the conclusion reached by the City here that the project was consistent with community safety element policy 2.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">E. <em>Project Consistency With Numerous Other Additional General Plan Objectives and Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">As in <em>Sequoyah, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 704, appellants here challenge the project on the basis of seven of the numerous policies and objectives encompassed in the General Plan (which City numbers at 78 or more). Given the standard of review here and the discretion vested in the City to weigh and balance General Plan policies in its determination whether the project is consistent with the General Plan <em>(id. </em>at p. 719), we would be hard pressed to overturn the City\u2019s determination in this case were we to find it unsupported with respect to a single policy. After identifying at least 78 objectives and policies in the Housing, Urban Design, and Transportation Elements with which the project is consistent, the City found that replacing the Parkmerced housing development, designed to separate land uses and rely extensively on automobile use, with a modem and sustainable development that will alleviate the City\u2019s housing shortage, promote transit use, and increase energy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>efficiency without displacing any tenants furthers the General Plan\u2019s purposes and is \u201con balance\u201d consistent with the General Plan. Based on substantial evidence in the record, we conclude that a reasonable person could reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">III. CEQA<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">IV. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Appellants contend the trial court erred in dismissing appellant PMAC\u2019s due process claim upon real party\u2019s demurrer. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The eighth cause of action alleged that as tenants of Parkmerced, members of PMAC hold property rights associated with their rent-controlled units, that they will be displaced by the Project Approvals and the development agreement, that they have a due process right to notice and an opportunity to be heard, and that these rights were violated by the refusal to properly provide notice to them and to allow them to readdress the Board following significant changes to the development agreement and to Project Approvals affecting their property rights. The last-minute changes to the development agreement added provisions that in the event a court challenge invalidates the rent control provision, real party will provide the tenants with relocation assistance and damages that will compensate them for the loss. These changes were made in the attempt to minimize any uncertainty about tenants\u2019 ability to retain rent control in the new units whatever the impact of the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1954.50 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Appellants acknowledge the well-settled rule that \u201conly those governmental decisions which are adjudicative in nature are subject to procedural due process principles.\u201d <em>(Horn v. County of Ventura </em>(1979) 24 Cal.Sd 605, 612 [156 Cal.Rptr. 718, 596 P.2d 1134], italics omitted <em>(Horn).) </em>\u201cLegislative action generally is not governed by these procedural due process requirements because it is not practical that everyone should have a direct voice in legislative decisions; elections provide the check there. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Calvert v. County of Yuba </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 613, 622 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 797]; see <em>Horn, </em>at p. 613; <em>Nasha v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 482 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 772].)  Appellants also acknowledge that the approval of a development agreement is a legislative act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65867.5, subd. (a) [\u201cA development agreement is a legislative act that shall be approved by ordinance and is subject to referendum.\u201d]; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>generally <em>Arnel Development Co. v. City of Costa Mesa </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 511, 523 [169 Cal.Rptr. 904, 620 P.2d 565] <em>(Arnel) </em>[\u201cpast California land-use cases have established generic classifications, viewing zoning ordinances as legislative and other decisions, such as variances and subdivision map approvals, as adjudicative\u201d].) Nor do appellants dispute that the approvals at issue here are classified as <em>legislative </em>acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Nevertheless, appellants posit the novel theory that a development agreement, while not a project approval, is an <em>entitlement </em>and not a \u201claw of general applicability.\u201d Therefore, appellants contend, approval of the development agreement is subject to due process protections, despite its characterization by statute as a legislative action. No case cited by appellants supports this argument\u2014that a legislative act may trigger procedural due process rights when it is arguably not a law of general applicability. Such holding would upset well-established legislative-adjudicative act categorical distinctions and likely would cause uncertainty and confusion. California courts are not required to conduct an individualized assessment into the type of land use decision at issue. <em>(Arnel, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 517.) In <em>Arnel, </em>the California Supreme Court held that a zoning ordinance is a legislative act that may be enacted by initiative, whatever the size of parcel or number of landowners affected, unlike administrative zoning decisions, adjudicatory in nature, such as the grant of a variance or the award of a conditional use permit. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 514-515.) The court emphasized the \u201cproblems courts will face if we abandoned past precedent and attempted to devise a new test distinguishing legislative and adjudicative decisions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 522-523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As respondents point out, appellants rely on a handful of cases as supporting the expansion of due process protection where a legislative act \u201cexceptionally affected\u201d a small number of people. (See <em>Bi-Metallic Co. v. Colorado </em>(1915) 239 U.S. 441, 446 [60 LEd. 372, 36 S.Ct. 141] <em>(Bi-Metallic) </em>[distinguishing <em>Londoner v. Denver </em>(1908) 210 U.S. 373 [52 L.Ed. 1103, 28 S.Ct. 708], as involving a \u201crelatively small number of persons . . . , who were exceptionally affected, in each case upon individual grounds\u201d]; <em>Harris v. County of Riverside </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 904 F.2d 497, 502 [holding that due process applied to zoning ordinance that \u201c \u2018exceptionally affected\u2019 \u201d Harris\u2019s land].) None of these cases would apply due process requirements to the approval of a general plan amendment, zoning ordinance or development agreement encompassing 152 acres and affecting renters in more than 1,500 units. (See <em>Arnel, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 522-523.) As <em>Bi-Metallic </em>recognized in finding no due process right at issue in that case: \u201cWhere a rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>conduct applies to more than a few people, it is impracticable that every one should have a direct voice in its adoption.\u201d <em>(Bi-Metallic, </em>at p. 445.)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Moreover, insofar as approval of the development agreement requires consideration of broad-based policy issues and the exercise of legislative discretion, it is conduct that does not fit well within the framework of adjudicatory decisions. (See <em>Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition, LLC v. Town of Mammoth Lakes </em>(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 435, 443-444 [120 Cal.Rptr.3d 797] <em>(Mammoth Lakes).)</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Whether or not approval of the development agreement here is conduct applying to more than a few people, it is undisputed that under state law the approval of the development agreement is a <em>legislative </em>act. As such, it has long been held that no procedural due process rights attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Nor do we find persuasive appellants\u2019 theory that because the development agreement granted a vested right to the developer, \u201clocking in\u201d the regulatory framework under which further approvals would be considered, Parkmerced tenants necessarily acquired vested rights entitling them to procedural due process. That the development agreement may provide a vested right to the developer does not necessarily take away vested rights from PMAC or its members. Moreover, courts have repeatedly rejected the claim that an approval should be subject to procedural due process requirements simply because it affects property rights in some manner. Legislative actions often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>involve approvals affecting individual property rights. (E.g., <em>Oceanside Marina Towers Assn. v. Oceanside Community Development Com. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 735, 745 [231 Cal.Rptr. 910] <em>(Oceanside Marina </em>Towers) [despite \u201csubstantial impact on surrounding properties,\u201d public entity\u2019s selection of a site for a new public improvement consistently has been held to be a quasi-legislative act exempt from due process hearing requirements].)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Appellant contends that under <em>Horn, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 605, a property owner whose property interest would be directly and significantly affected by granting a vested right to another property has a right to due process. However, <em>Horn </em>first concluded that approval of a tentative subdivision map was \u201cadjudicatory\u201d in nature. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 614 [\u201cSubdivision approvals, like variances and conditional use permits, involve the application of general standards to specific parcels of real property. Such governmental conduct, affecting the relatively few, is \u2018determined by facts peculiar to the individual case\u2019 and is \u2018adjudicatory\u2019 in nature.\u201d].) Only <em>thereafter </em>did the court address the argument of the subdivider that the plaintiff neighbor had suffered no significant deprivation of property which would invoke constitutional rights to notice and hearing. As to that point, the court held that <em>\u201cwhenever approval of a tentative subdivision map </em>will constitute a substantial or significant deprivation of the property rights of other landowners, the affected persons are entitled to a reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before the approval occurs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 616, italics added.) In this case, having properly determined the first question, that a legislative act was involved to which act procedural due process did not attach, the trial court was not required to analyze whether the members of PMAC suffered a substantial or significant deprivation of property rights. (See <em>Oceanside Marina Towers, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 744.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Because the character of the development agreement approval is a legislative act, and it has long been established that procedural due process rights to notice and hearing do not attach to such acts, we conclude the court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the eighth cause of action.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">V. Administrative Record</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Appellants contend the trial court erred in including in the administrative record transcripts of a set of hearings before the LUEDC of the Board. Appellants contend transcripts of the LUEDC hearings were not relevant to the City\u2019s decision because these documents were not before the decision maker\u2014the Board\u2014when it certified the EIR for the project on June 6, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">From August 10, 2010, to May 24, 2011, the LUEDC, a committee of the Board, held five meetings to consider the project and development agreement. The last of these was held the morning of May 24, hours before the Board considered and certified the EIR appeal and the project. At both the May 16 and May 24 meetings, the LUEDC discussed and approved amendments to the approvals. At the end of the May 24 hearing, the LUEDC forwarded the amended documents to the Board without recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">On the afternoon of May 24, the Board heard the appeal of the EIR, denied the appeal and approved the project. On June 6, 2011, the Board finalized the Project Approvals. In certifying the EIR, the Board found that \u201cthe FEIR files and all correspondence and other documents have been made available for review by this Board and the public. These files are available for public review by appointment at the Planning Department offices at 1650 Mission Street, and are <em>part of the record </em>before this Board by reference in this motion . . . .\u201d (Italics added; see Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21081.6, subd. (a)(2).) (Hereafter, all statutory references are to the Public Resources Code, unless otherwise indicated.)

This language demonstrates that the Legislature intended courts to avoid narrowly applying the 11 categories set forth in section 21167.6, subdivision (e) when such an application would subvert the purposes underlying CEQA.\u201d <em>(Consolidated Irrigation Dist. v.

Rather, it addressed the issue whether evidence admittedly <em>not contained in the administrative record </em>was admissible in a traditional mandamus action under CEQA to determine that the agency had abused its discretion within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>meaning of section 21168.5. <em>(Western States, </em>at p. 565.) The Supreme Court held, \u201ccourts generally may not consider evidence not contained in the administrative record when reviewing the substantiality of the evidence supporting a quasi-legislative administrative decision under . . . section 21168.5\u201d and that \u201cextra-record evidence is generally not admissible to show that an agency \u2018has not proceeded in a manner required by law\u2019 in making a quasi-legislative decision.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Appellants contend that it is not sufficient documents were \u201cavailable to\u201d the decision makers before they made their decision. <em>Western States </em>certainly stands for the proposition that documents generated <em>after </em>the Board decision are generally inadmissible on the abuse of discretion issue. However, it nowhere holds that the documents must be identified in the motion affirming certification of the EIR in order to be \u201cbefore the decision maker.\u201d Appellants\u2019 attempt to extract support for their position from <em>CID, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.4th at pages 718-723, is unavailing. That part of the <em>CID </em>opinion addressed whether documents referenced in comment letters on the DEIR should be included in the administrative record under section 21167.6, subdivision (e)(7). In determining whether such documents were \u201c \u2018submitted to\u2019 \u201d the public agency, the court used the general meaning of \u201cpresented or made available for use or study.\u201d <em>(CID, </em>at pp. 723-724.) The court held documents that were \u201creadily available for use by City personnel\u201d and documents named in a comment letter along with a <em>specific </em>Web page at which the document could be easily located, together with a specific request that they be included in the record satisfied the statute; whereas documents referenced with a citation to a general Web site were \u201cnot made readily available to City and, therefore, are not part of the record of proceedings under section 21167.6, subdivision (e)(7).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 724.) Not only does this portion of <em>CID </em>interpret a different part of the statute, but the question whether documents and other evidence referenced in comment letters by the public are \u201creadily available\u201d to the City is patently distinguishable from the question of the ready availability to the City of the City\u2019s own hearings. The court could certainly conclude that members of the Board did not need instruction on where to find the recordings of its committee meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Furthermore, the LUEDC hearings undisputedly occurred <em>before </em>the Board\u2019s decision. The Board\u2019s motion that it had \u201cheard testimony and received public comment regarding the adequacy of the FEIR\u201d is reasonably determined to include public testimony before Board committees. Under the Board\u2019s Rules of Order, the full Board did not take separate public testimony on matters that were before a Board Committee. (Board, former Rule of Order 1.5(b), eff. Feb. 15, 2011 [\u201cIf a committee has provided the opportunity for public testimony and forwarded an ordinance, resolution, or motion to the full Board, the Board does not provide a second opportunity for public testimony at the full Board meeting\u201d].) Testimony received by the Board as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the adequacy of the FEIR includes the testimony submitted on project approvals at committee hearings preceding the determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Appellants have failed to show that the trial court erred in determining the LUEDC hearings were properly part of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">D. <em>No Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Finally, we agree with respondents that even if the LUEDC committee\u2019s transcripts were not part of the administrative record, the trial court\u2019s order of inclusion would not constitute reversible error, absent a showing by appellants as to how they were prejudiced by the inclusion of the transcripts. Appellants have not tried to demonstrate actual prejudice, but rely upon a theory that <em>any </em>violation of CEQA\u2019s procedural mandates is \u201cpresumptively prejudicial,\u201d citing <em>Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish &amp; Game Com. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 137 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 580, 939 P.2d 1280].<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Recently, our Supreme Court has explained: \u201cAn omission in an EIR\u2019s significant impacts analysis is deemed prejudicial if it deprived the public and decision makers of substantial relevant information about the project\u2019s likely adverse impacts.
