(mother) seeks relief from the juvenile court order terminating the discretionary reunification services she was receiving pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) of section 361.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, mother claims that the services offered to her were unreasonable and therefore termination of those services was improper. There appears to have been some confusion in the juvenile court regarding the appropriate legal standards to apply when a dependent minor has been placed with a noncustodial parent pursuant to section 361.2 and reunification services are offered to the previously custodial parent under that statute. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that\u2014when a minor is placed with a previously noncustodial parent at disposition pursuant to section 361.2\u2014a reasonable services finding need not be made at subsequent hearings monitoring that placement. Nevertheless, seeing no abuse of discretion in the juvenile court\u2019s order terminating mother\u2019s reunification services, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Mother\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the San Mateo County Human Services Agency (Agency) failed to provide her with reasonable reunification services. Thus, she claims, the juvenile court\u2019s finding that reasonable services were offered to her was erroneous, and its subsequent order terminating those services must be reversed. She requests an order on remand that she be provided with six additional months of services. Because we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>a reasonable services finding need not be made at a hearing monitoring a dispositional placement with a previously noncustodial parent, we reject mother\u2019s contentions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">A. <em>Placement with a Noncustodial Parent Pursuant to Section 361.2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">As a general rule, when a child is removed from parental custody under the dependency statutes, the juvenile court is required to provide reunification services pursuant to section 361.5 to \u201cthe child and the child\u2019s mother and statutorily presumed father.\u201d (\u00a7 361.5, subd. (a).) The purpose of these reunification services is \u201cto facilitate the return of a dependent child to parental custody.\u201d <em>(In re Jodi B. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1322, 1326 [278 Cal.Rptr. 242], italics omitted; see <em>In re Baby Boy H. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 470, 478 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 793] [purpose of reunification efforts is to \u201celiminate the conditions leading to loss of custody and facilitate reunification of parent and child\u201d thereby furthering the \u201cgoal of preservation of family, whenever possible\u201d].) Unless an express exemption exists, reunification services provided pursuant to section 361.5 are mandatory, subject to strict timelines, and monitored through periodic court reviews at which parents are admonished that failure to participate successfully in reunification efforts could lead to the termination of their parental rights. (\u00a7\u00a7 361.5, 366.21, 366.22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">The juvenile court law, however, provides an alternate track for minors who are removed from a parent when a previously noncustodial parent is available and requests custody of the child. Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 361.2 provides: \u201cWhen a court orders removal of a child pursuant to Section 361, the court <em>shall first determine </em>whether there is a parent of the child, with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of Section 300, who desires to assume custody of the child. If that parent requests custody, the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.\u201d (Italics added.) Once the juvenile court places a minor with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with this statute, it has three dispositional options. It may grant custody to the previously noncustodial parent and terminate dependency jurisdiction. (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (b)(1).) It may order that a home visit be conducted within three months of the minor\u2019s new placement and that the results of that visit be provided to the court before it takes further action with respect to custody of the minor. (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (b)(2).) Or, it may order that the previously noncustodial parent \u201cassume custody\u201d of the minor subject to the supervision of the juvenile court. (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (b)(3).) If the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>chooses option three, it \u201cmay order that reunification services be provided to the parent or guardian from whom the child is being removed, or the court may order that services be provided solely to the parent who is assuming physical custody in order to allow that parent to retain later custody without court supervision, or that services be provided to both parents, in which case the court shall determine, at review hearings held pursuant to Section 366, which parent, if either, shall have custody of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The interplay between section 361.5 and section 361.2\u2014which were enacted simultaneously by the Legislature in 1986\u2014has been the subject of some discussion in the courts. (See, e.g., <em>In re Adrianna P. </em>(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 44, 53-54 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 918]; <em>In re Janee </em>W. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1444 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 445] <em>(Janee W.); In re Erika W. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 470, 475 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 548] <em>(Erika W.); </em>see also Stats. 1986, ch. 1122, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13, pp. 3982-3986.) In <em>Erika W., </em>for instance, the Sixth District Court of Appeal concluded that mandatory reunification services pursuant to section 361.5 need not be provided to a previously custodial parent when a child is removed from that parent and placed in the custody of a previously noncustodial parent. <em>(Erika W., supra, </em>at pp. 475-476.) Under these \u201climited\u201d circumstances the court held, section 361.2 \u201cinvests the juvenile court with discretion as to the provision of reunification services to the parents.\u201d <em>(Erika W, supra, </em>at p. 475.) The <em>Erika W. </em>court reasoned that\u2014since both statutes were part of the same legislative act\u2014\u201cthe only rational intent which can be ascribed to the Legislature is the intent to enforce <em>a different set of rules regarding the provision of reunification services </em>in those cases where custody of a minor is shifted from one parent to another parent.\u201d <em>(Erika W, supra, </em>at p. 475, italics added; see <em>ibid, </em>[\u201cwe find it impossible to conclude that section 361.5 intended to make mandatory that which simultaneously enacted section 361.2 .. . explicitly made discretionary\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">In <em>In re Nicholas H. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 251 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 261] <em>(Nicholas H.), </em>Division Two of the First District Court of Appeal was faced with a situation similar to that at issue in the present case. In those proceedings, Nicholas was removed from his mother, Kimberly, and placed in the home of Thomas, his presumed father. Both parents were given services. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 257.) At a subsequent hearing, the court terminated mother\u2019s reunification services, granted sole physical custody of Nicholas to Thomas, and dismissed dependency. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 258.) Kimberly argued on appeal that the juvenile court was required to return Nicholas to her care at the review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>hearing at issue, absent a finding that to do so would create a substantial risk of detriment to Nicholas\u2019s safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 262.) Such a detriment finding is required at six-, 12- and 18-month review hearings when a minor has been placed in foster care and reunification services are provided pursuant to section 361.5. (See \u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subds. (e) &amp; (f), 366.22, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">The appellate court disagreed. Although it confirmed that review hearings are to be held pursuant to section 366 when a child is placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with section 361.2, it concluded that this was simply to ensure that \u201cdependent children who have been placed with a previously noncustodial parent rather than in foster care also receive meaningful and expeditious periodic review of their cases.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 265.) The court went on to reject the view that the procedures prescribed by section 366 et seq. (including the detriment finding required by \u00a7\u00a7 366.21 and 366.22) \u201cmust be rigidly applied and followed verbatim when the status review is of a child who has not been placed in foster care.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>at p. 265.) Noting that \u201c[a] parent placement poses very different considerations for the juvenile court than does a foster care placement\u201d and that \u201cthose considerations must govern any reasonable interpretation of section 366 et seq. as it applies to dependent children who have been placed with a previously noncustodial parent,\u201d the court concluded that no detriment finding was necessary. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 265; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 265-267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Instead, the <em>Nicholas H. </em>court held that the issue to be resolved at a hearing reviewing placement with a noncustodial parent is expressly stated in section 361.2, itself. <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 267.) Specifically, that statute \u201cdirects that \u2018at review hearings held pursuant to Section 366,\u2019 the court must determine \u2018which parent, if either, shall have custody of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, when making such a custody determination, \u201cthe court\u2019s focus and primary consideration must always be the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Three years later, in <em>Janee W., supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th 1444, the Second District Court of Appeal addressed the issue of reunification services in the context of a section 361.2 placement. In that case, two minors were placed with their previously noncustodial father at the six-month review hearing. <em>(Janee W, supra, </em>at pp. 1448-1449.) At the 12-month review hearing, the juvenile court indicated that it did not believe that reasonable services had been offered to the mother during the previous six months. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1453.) However, since the children were safe in their father\u2019s care, the juvenile court awarded full legal and physical custody of the minors to the father and terminated dependency jurisdiction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1449-1450.) Citing the then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>relevant court rule, the appellate court first noted that a placement with a noncustodial parent pursuant to section 361.2 can occur at subsequent review hearings even though, by its terms, section 361.2 applies only when a court first takes jurisdiction over a minor. <em>(Janee W., </em>supra, at p. 1451.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It then broadly concluded that the statutory and rule provisions entitling a parent to reasonable reunification services \u201care inapplicable when a child is removed from the custody of one parent and placed with another under section 361.2.\u201d <em>(Janee W, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1453.) Specifically, in the context of that particular case, the court held that \u201ceven if reunification services are offered to the previously custodial parent, once the dependency court determines that further supervision of the children in the home of the previously noncustodial parent is not required, the failure to provide adequate reunification services to the other parent does not prevent the court from terminating jurisdiction under section 361.2.\u201d <em>(Janee W., supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">Finally, in <em>In re A.C. </em>(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 636 [88 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] (A.C.), the Fourth District Court of Appeal discussed the interplay between section 361.5 and section 361.2 when parents receive some services under each provision. In A.C., the two minors were removed from their mother\u2019s home and, prior to disposition, placed with their previously noncustodial father. At the May 2006 dispositional hearing, family maintenance services were ordered for the father. <em>(A.C., supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at pp. 639-640.) The mother was offered \u201c \u2018enhancement\u2019 services,\u201d defined as nonreunification child welfare services designed to \u201c \u2018enhance the child\u2019s relationship with that parent by requiring that parent to address the issues that brought the child before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 640, 641-642 &amp; fn. 5.) Thereafter, the minors were removed from their father\u2019s custody in September 2007 pursuant to a section 387 supplemental petition and placed with a relative. (A.C., <em>supra, </em>at p. 640.) At the November 2007 dispositional hearing on the supplemental petition, reunification services were ordered for both parents pursuant to section 361.5. After these reunification services were continued at the June 2008 six-month review, the minors appealed, arguing that both parents had already received more than the 18 months of child welfare services statutorily authorized by section 361.5 and that the continuation of such reunification services was therefore improper. (A.C., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 639-640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>The <em>A.C. </em>court disagreed with the minors, holding that the continuation of reunification services at the six-month review was appropriate. (A.C., <em>supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at p. 639.) Specifically, the court concluded that the \u201c[s]ection 361.5 time limits for reunification services start to run when a child is removed from all parental custody at the disposition hearing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In contrast, \u201c[t]he clock does not start running when the child is placed with a noncustodial parent pursuant to section 361.2.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, in <em>A.C., </em>the parents were entitled to a full complement of reunification services based on the minors\u2019 November 2007 removal from the custody of both parents, despite the previous provision of section 361.2 services. <em>(A.C., supra, </em>at p. 649; see <em>In re T.W. </em>(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1167-1169 [154 Cal.Rptr.3d 669] <em>(T.W.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Applying these precedents to the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the child welfare services provided herein pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) of section 361.2 were wholly discretionary and analytically distinct from the mandatory reunification efforts required by section 361.5. (See <em>A.C., supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at pp. 648-649; <em>Erika W, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 475; cf. <em>Joel T, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at pp. 267-268.) As the <em>Joel T. </em>court noted: \u201cThe distinction between the services provided when the minors remain in parental custody and when the minors have been removed from parental custody is a subtle but important one. Services designed merely to support a family\u2019s functioning may or may not be the same as those designed to reunify a family even if the ultimate goal in each case is to ameliorate the problems which led to the dependency at the outset.\u201d <em>(Joel T, supra, </em>at p. 268.) Additionally, a parent\u2019s level of engagement in section 361.2 services may differ when the expectation of a timeline for that parent to complete those services, \u201cfacing ultimate termination of parental rights under an advisement,\u201d is not in place. <em>(A.C., supra, </em>at pp. 648-649.) Moreover, \u201c[c]hildren who are placed with at least one of their parents from the beginning of the dependency are differently situated than those who immediately enter foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>care. Such a child, in most cases, is not suffering from the same level of disruption and need for prompt permanency adjudication as he or she might otherwise experience in a foster care placement.\u201d (A.C., <em>supra, </em>at p. 652; see <em>Erika W, supra, </em>at p. 478 [when a child is placed with a noncustodial parent, the goal of returning a dependent minor to parental custody has already been met and therefore \u201creunification services are not necessary\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">We further agree with the <em>Nicholas H. </em>court that\u2014while review hearings are to be held pursuant to section 366 when a child is placed with a previously noncustodial parent pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) of section 361.2\u2014this does not mean that all of the procedures prescribed by section 366 et seq. \u201cmust be rigidly applied and followed verbatim when the status review is of a child who has not been placed in foster care.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 265.) Rather, the understanding that \u201c[a] parent placement poses very different considerations for the juvenile court than does a foster care placement. . . ,\u201d will guide our interpretation of section 366 et seq. as it applies to the section 361.2 placement at issue in this case and the necessity for a reasonable services finding. (Cf. <em>Nicholas H., supra, </em>at pp. 265-267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">In addition, when determining whether a reasonable services finding should be \u201crigidly applied\u201d to the facts of this case, we also find crucial the A.C. court\u2019s analysis of the differences between the reunification services offered pursuant to section 361.5, the services provided in connection with a noncustodial parent placement under section 361.2, and the family maintenance services authorized by section 362. Specifically, we endorse the <em>A.C. </em>court\u2019s statement that \u201ca section 361.2 placement with a noncustodial parent should be treated in the same manner as a section 362 placement with a custodial parent. In either case, the time limits for services set forth in section 361.5 do not apply if dependents are not removed from the custody of both parents at the dispositional hearing.\u201d (A.C., <em>supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at p. 649.) Indeed, \u201c[djespite the existence of an actual (if brief) removal from the parent\u2019s \u2018custody\u2019 (or \u2018physical custody\u2019) between the initial detention and the dispositional hearing, section 361.5 is inapplicable in the absence of a disposition ordering a placement with someone other than a parent.\u201d (A.C., <em>supra, </em>at p. 650; see <em>T.W., supra, </em>214 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1167-1169.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>Here, Jaden was placed with his previously noncustodial father at the September 2012 dispositional hearing. As a consequence, the section 361.5 reunification \u201cclock\u201d did not begin to run against either parent and the potential termination of their parental rights was not an issue for them. <em>(T.W., supra, </em>214 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1169-1170.) Rather, if Jaden was subsequently removed from the custody of his father through the filing of a section 387 supplemental petition, both parents would still be entitled to a full complement of section 361.5 reunification services before facing the possibility that their parental rights could be terminated and Jaden permanently removed from their care. (See <em>T.W., supra, </em>at pp. 1169-1170.) Under such circumstances, we believe that the juvenile court was not required to make a reasonable services finding pursuant to subdivision (e) of section 366.21 before terminating the discretionary reunification services mother was receiving under subdivision (b)(3) of section 361.2. To be sure, the quality of the reunification services provided to a formerly custodial parent and that parent\u2019s level of participation in those services are valid and relevant considerations when the juvenile court is reviewing a section 361.2 placement. However, the court\u2019s focus should not be on the reasonableness of those services per se, but rather on which parent, if either, should receive custody of the child and whether further court supervision is warranted. (Cf. <em>Nicholas H., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 268; see <em>T.W., supra, </em>at p. 1168 [court\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d when reviewing a placement under section 361.2 is \u201cto provide a stable, permanent parental home\u201d for a dependent minor \u201cthrough services under section 361.2, with the possibility of eventually giving permanent custody of [the minor] to one or the other parent\u201d].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">In sum, where, as here, a dependent minor is not removed from the custody of both parents at the dispositional hearing and services are provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) of section 361.2, we conclude that no reasonable services finding need be made at the periodic review hearings monitoring that placement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">B. <em>No Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Having determined that no reasonable services finding was required at the May 2013 review hearing in this matter, we next consider whether the juvenile court\u2019s order terminating mother\u2019s section 361.2 services was otherwise supportable. As stated above, under subdivision (b)(3) of section 361.2, \u201c[t]he decision whether to provide services and to which parent is discretionary to the court because the child is not out of the home, but in placement with a parent.\u201d <em>(In re Gabriel L. </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 644, 651 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 193]; see <em>Erika W., supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 475.) We will therefore uphold the juvenile court\u2019s decision to terminate mother\u2019s reunification services in this case unless that decision amounted to an abuse of discretion. As has been oft repeated, when we review a juvenile court order for abuse of discretion, the \u201c \u2018appropriate test ... is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason. When two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 272 [279 Cal.Rptr. 576, 807 P.2d 418]; see <em>In re Stephanie M. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 318-319 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706] <em>(Stephanie M.), </em>quoting Walker.) Accordingly, we will not reverse the juvenile court\u2019s decision unless that court \u201c \u2018has exceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd determination . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Geoffrey G. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 412, 421-422 [159 Cal.Rptr. 460] <em>(Geoffrey G.); </em>see <em>Stephanie M., supra, </em>at p. 318, quoting <em>Geoffrey </em>G.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">Whether the juvenile court abused its discretion in this instance is further informed by the statutory context within which its decision to terminate mother\u2019s section 361.2 services was made. When a minor is placed with a previously noncustodial parent pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) of section 361.2, the juvenile court is required to determine, \u201cat review hearings held pursuant to Section 366, which parent, if either, shall have custody of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>child.\u201d When making such a determination, as in any dependency case, \u201cthe court\u2019s focus and primary consideration must always be the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., </em>supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at p. 268; see \u00a7 202, subd. (d); see <em>In re B.T. </em>(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 685, 692 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 651] [\u201c[t]he paramount concern of any dependency proceeding is the child\u2019s best interests\u201d].) Further, section 361.2 \u201cexpressly contemplates that reunification services will be offered only for the purpose of facilitating permanent parental custody of the child by one or the other parent.\u201d <em>(Erika W, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 476.) Thus, if \u201cthe previously custodial parent has the potential to provide a safe stable permanent home for the child, reunification services can be offered to the previously custodial parent in the hope that this parent will remedy his or her deficiencies and reunify with the child.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 477.) On the other hand, the court may order that services be provided solely to the previously <em>noncustodial </em>parent \u201cin order to allow that parent to retain later custody without court supervision.\u201d (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (b)(3).) Finally, if a dependent has been placed with a formerly noncustodial parent, the court shall determine at each six-month review \u201cwhether supervision is still necessary.\u201d (\u00a7 366.21, subd. (e); see mies 5.708(k), 5.710(b)(2), 5.715(b)(3) &amp; 5.720(b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">When the juvenile court\u2019s decision to terminate mother\u2019s section 361.2 services is viewed within this framework, it is abundantly clear that no abuse of discretion has occurred. At the outset of this opinion, we recounted in detail the facts underlying this matter, and we will not rehash them here. Suffice it to say that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that, at the time of the six-month review in May 2013, mother did not have the potential to provide a safe, stable, or permanent home for Jaden. Moreover, it was also evident that it was in Jaden\u2019s best interests to focus on father as the parent most likely to retain later custody without juvenile court supervision. (See \u00a7 361.2, subd. (b)(3).) Jaden was thriving in his father\u2019s care. In contrast, mother had made no progress in solving the problems that led to Jaden\u2019s initial removal; continued to obstinately and belligerently maintain that she did not require any services to reunify with the minor; and remained completely oblivious to the significantly detrimental impact that her actions were having on her son. Further, given mother\u2019s erratic behaviors, her inability to work with father in Jaden\u2019s best interests, and her propensity to ignore court orders, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that continued supervision of the situation by the juvenile court was appropriate. In sum, we find the juvenile court\u2019s order in this case to be entirely proper.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>III.

There are no statutory time limits on the provision of family maintenance services. <em>(Bridget A. v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 285, 312 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 647].) Rather, at review hearings held at six-month intervals, the juvenile court may continue such services if it determines that \u201cconditions still exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under Section 300, or that those conditions are likely to exist if supervision is withdrawn.\u201d (\u00a7 364, subd. (c); see <em>Janee W, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1450.) Thus, at issue is whether \u201ccontinued supervision is necessary.\u201d (\u00a7 364, subd. (c).) In <em>In re Joel T. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 263 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 538] <em>(Joel </em>27), the Third District Court of Appeal concluded that, when a minor is removed from parents who have been receiving family maintenance services, those family maintenance services cannot be counted as section 361.5 reunification services. Instead, the court must still provide such parents with the full measure of statutorily mandated reunification services pursuant to section 361.5, based on the minor\u2019s subsequent removal from parental custody. <em>(Joel I, supra, </em>at pp. 267-268.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1044-7\"> We recognize that in <em>In re N.M. </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 845 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 187] (N.M.), the Fourth District Court of Appeal held that the timelines for reunification services under 361.5 begin for both parents if the child is detained from their custody at the <em>onset of the dependency action, </em>regardless of whether the court grants one parent custody at the dispositional hearing under a family maintenance plan. <em>(N.M., supra, </em>at pp. 853-855.) <em>N.M. </em>is arguably factually distinguishable (being in essence a family maintenance case) and interpreted an earlier version of section 361.5. <em>(T.W., supra, </em>214 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1167-1168; see <em>A.C., supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at pp. 647-648.) More importantly, however, we believe that its analysis ignores the crucial distinction between temporary detention and removal from parental custody after all necessary findings are made. Thus, to the extent our decision conflicts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>the rationale of <em>N.M., </em>we\u2014-like the courts in A.C. and T.W.\u2014disagree with <em>N.M. </em>(See A.C., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 649-650; see also <em>T.W., supra, </em>at pp. 1167-1169.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1045-7\"> We note that, when a dependent minor is not placed with a parent at disposition and mandatory reunification services are offered pursuant to section 361.5, that statute expressly provides that \u201c[p]hysical custody of the child by the parents . . . during the applicable time period [for the provision of section 361.5 services] shall not serve to interrupt the running of the time period.\u201d (\u00a7 361.5, subd. (a)(3).) Thus\u2014even if the child is subsequently returned to a parent and section 361.2 is invoked because that parent was previously noncustodial\u2014the applicable timelines for reunification services are still running and the parents continue to be faced with the possibility that, if reunification efforts are ultimately unsuccessful, their parental rights could be terminated. While we need not reach this issue, it is arguable that, under such circumstances, a reasonable services finding might be required if juvenile court supervision is continued. (Cf. <em>In re Calvin P. </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 958 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 654] [where mother and father were granted reunification services pursuant to \u00a7 361.5 reasonable services must be found to have been provided to mother despite fact that minors were subsequently returned to father\u2019s care under family maintenance plan].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1046-8\"> We agree with mother that <em>Janee W. </em>does not necessarily mandate this result. However, we believe the holding in <em>Janee W. </em>is consistent with our determination. As discussed above, <em>Janee W. </em>holds that the failure to provide adequate reunification services to a previously custodial parent does not prevent the court from terminating jurisdiction under section 361.2 once the juvenile court determines that supervision of the placement with a previously noncustodial parent is no longer required. <em>(Janee W., </em>supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1455.) In that situation, as in the present circumstances, failure to comply with arguably inadequate reunification services could not later be used as the basis for termination of parental rights because custody has been returned to a parent and dependency dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1047-6\"> While there was clearly some confusion in the juvenile court as to the necessary findings to be made at the May 2013 hearing, reversal is not required where, as here, the correct findings were amply supported by the evidence. <em>(In re A.J. </em>(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 525, 538 [153 Cal.Rptr.3d 851]; <em>Janee W, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1450; see <em>People v.
