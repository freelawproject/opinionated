(Father) and plaintiff Keisha W. (Mother) are the parents of Marvin M. II (Minor). Father appeals from an August 2012 restraining order that, among other things, awarded custody of Minor to Mother (A137991), and from the family court\u2019s January 2013 acceptance of jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3400 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (A137861).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the restraining order at issue in A137991, and dismiss the appeal in A137861 as being from an unappealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">\n<em>Case No. A137991</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">On August 6, 2012, Mother requested a restraining order to protect herself and Minor, bom in April 2006, from Father. Mother\u2019s accompanying declaration explained that she and Father previously lived in Texas and were in a relationship that ended in April 2010. She described instances of domestic violence and threatening conduct by Father that caused her to leave Texas with Minor in August 2011. According to the declaration, on May 31, 2012, Father picked up Minor from his daycare in California and absconded with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Minor to Nevada. Mother sought return of Minor and modification of a January 2011 Texas custody order that provided for shared custody of Minor. Mother informed the superior court that, in July 2012, the Texas court indicated it no longer had jurisdiction over custody because the parents and Minor no longer lived in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The superior court issued a temporary restraining order on August 8, 2012, and set a hearing on the request for a restraining order for August 31. On August 30, Father filed a written response with extensive attachments, opposing, among other things, Mother\u2019s custody request. Following the August 31 hearing, the superior court issued a restraining order protecting both Mother and Minor from Father, and ordering that Mother have physical custody of Minor. The court found it had \u201cjurisdiction to make child custody orders in this case under\u201d the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On September 20, 2012, the restraining order was served on Father in Nevada. On February 26, 2013, Father filed a notice of appeal of the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>Case No. A137861</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">On November 28, 2012, Mother commenced a family court proceeding by filing a petition for custody and support. She requested physical custody of Minor with supervised visitation for Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Father challenged the family court\u2019s jurisdiction to adjudicate the custody issue under the UCCJEA. On January 30, 2013, the superior court conducted a UCCJEA conference call with judges from the Nevada and Texas courts. The court\u2019s minutes reflect that the Texas court \u201cdecline[d] jurisdiction,\u201d the Nevada court \u201cneither accepted] nor decline[d] jurisdiction,\u201d and the California court \u201caccepted] jurisdiction over this matter.\u201d At a February 4 hearing, the court retained jurisdiction \u201cpending further notice,\u201d ordered that Minor be turned over to Mother, and set hearings on the issue of jurisdiction and custody for February 21 and April 8, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">On or around February 5, 2013, Father appealed from the family court\u2019s January 30 acceptance of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">I. <em>The Appeal from the August 31, 2012 Restraining Order (A137991)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">At the outset, we conclude the February 26, 2013 appeal (A137991) from the August 31, 2012 restraining order was not untimely. Under rule 8.104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>of the California Rules of Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Father had 180 days after entry of the order to appeal, unless he received notice as specified in rule 8.104(a)(1)(A) or (B). Rule 8.104(a)(1)(A) requires the filing of an appeal within 60 days after \u201cthe superior court clerk serves on the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled \u2018Notice of Entry\u2019 of judgment or a file-stamped copy of the judgment, showing the date either was served . . . .\u201d Rule 8.104(a)(1)(B) requires the filing of an appeal within 60 days after \u201cthe party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled \u2018Notice of Entry\u2019 of judgment or a file-stamped copy of the judgment, accompanied by proof of service . . . .\u201d In the present case, the record contains a completed \u201cProof of Personal Service\u201d form reflecting that Father was served with a copy of the restraining order on September 20, 2012. However, the form does not reflect that the order was file-stamped or that Father was served with a document entitled \u201cNotice of Entry.\u201d Thus, Father had 180 days from entry of the order to appeal. Because February 26, 2013, is within 180 days from August 31, 2012, the appeal in A137991 is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Father contends issuance of the restraining order violated the UCCJEA, because a Texas family court had already issued a child custody order regarding Minor. \u201c[T]he UCCJEA is the \u2018exclusive means of determining subject matter jurisdiction in custody disputes involving other jurisdictions. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.] The UCCJEA ensures that only one state has jurisdiction to make \u2018child custody determinations,\u2019 which, as relevant here, is defined in section 3402, subdivision (c), to include a \u2018permanent, temporary, initial, and modification order\u2019 of a \u2018court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Fernandez-Abin &amp; Sanchez </em>(2011) 191 CaI.App.4th 1015, 1037 [120 Cal.Rptr.3d 227] <em>(Fernandez-Abin).) </em>The UCCJEA applied to the restraining order at issue in the present case. (\u00a7 3402, subd. (d) [for purposes of the UCCJEA, the term \u201c \u2018[cjhild custody proceeding\u2019 . . . includes a proceeding for . . . protection from domestic violence . . .\u201d]; see <em>Fernandez-Abin, </em>at pp. 1037-1039.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In the present case, the superior court found it had \u201cjurisdiction to make child custody orders in this case under the\u201d UCCJEA. Father argues the court did not have temporary emergency jurisdiction under section 3424,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because Minor was not present in California on August 31, 2012. However, we conclude the more pertinent question is whether the superior court had jurisdiction to modify the Texas court\u2019s custody determination under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>3423. That section provides that a court may \u201cmodify a child custody determination made by a court of another state\u201d if the California court has jurisdiction to make a custody determination under section 3421, subdivision (a)(1) or (2), and the court \u201cdetermines that the child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other state.\u201d (\u00a7 3423.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">It is undisputed that neither Minor nor either of the parties was residing in Texas on August 31. As for jurisdiction over Minor, subdivision (a)(1) of section 3421 provides: \u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3424, a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if any of the following are true: [][] (1) This state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.\u201d Mother averred she and Minor moved to California in August 2011, which provided a basis for a determination California was Minor\u2019s home state. (\u00a7 3402, subd. (g).) In a supplemental letter brief, Father contends California was not Minor\u2019s home state because Minor was not residing in the state for six consecutive months immediately prior to Mother\u2019s August 6, 2012 request to modify the custody order. But where Minor is absent and a parent is present, section 3421, subdivision (a)(1) provides as an alternative that California was the home state within six months of commencement of the proceeding. That provision applies here. <em>(Brewer </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1312, 1317 [160 Cal.Rptr.3d 853].) We conclude the superior court had jurisdiction to modify the Texas custody order under section 3423.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Father also contends the superior court was obligated to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the UCCJEA because Mother brought Minor to California in violation of the Texas order and failed to promptly seek modification of that order. He relies on subdivision (a) of section 3428, which provides that \u201cif a court of this state has jurisdiction under this part because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless\u201d the parents acquiesce in jurisdiction, a court of a state having jurisdiction \u201cdetermines that this state is a more appropriate forum under Section 3427,\u201d or \u201c[n]o court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in Sections 3421 to 3423, inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We conclude the superior court impliedly found that no court of any other state had jurisdiction under the UCCJEA at the time the restraining order was issued in August 2012. (\u00a7 3428, subd. (a)(3).) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Texas and Nevada were the only other states with possible claims to jurisdiction. Regarding Texas, under Texas Family Code, section 152.202, subdivision (a)(2) (the analogue to \u00a7 3428, subd. (a)(2)), the Texas court had \u201cexclusive continuing jurisdiction\u201d over custody \u201cuntil [][]... [][] ... a court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.\u201d It is undisputed that neither the parties nor Minor resided in Texas in August 2012. Regarding Nevada, that state did not have jurisdiction because, among other possible reasons, Minor had not yet resided there for six months as of August 31. (Nev. Rev. Stat. 125A.085 [Nevada analogue to \u00a7 3402, subd. (g)].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>For the above reasons, the superior court had jurisdiction under section 3423 to modify the Texas court\u2019s custody determination on August 31, 2012.* **<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">II. <em>The Appeal from the January 30, 2013 UCCJEA Conference (A137861)</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In A137991, the August 31, 2012 restraining order is affirmed.

P0 (b) A court of this state or a court of the other state determines that the child, the child\u2019s parents, and acting as a do not reside in the other state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> For the first time at oral argument, Father cited <em>In re Nelson B. </em>(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1121 [155 Cal.Rptr.3d 746] (Nelson) in support of a new argument that, until Father moved away from Texas, Minor\u2019s presence in California was an unauthorized \u201c \u2018temporary absence\u2019 \u201d from Texas that could not be counted towards the six-month residence requirement in section 3402, subdivision (g). <em>Nelson </em>is distinguishable. In that case, the issue was whether Maryland was the minor\u2019s home state at the time of commencement of a dependency proceeding, where the minor ran away from Maryland but his aunt continued to live there. <em>(Nelson, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1124-1125, 1130.) The court concluded the minor\u2019s absence from Maryland was a \u201c \u2018temporary absence\u2019 \u201d for purposes of section 3402, subdivision (g). <em>(Nelson, </em>at p. 1130.) The statutory language at issue provides that, in determining a child\u2019s period of residence, \u201c[a] period of temporary absence ... is part of the period.\u201d (\u00a7 3402, subd. (g).) In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the present case the issue is not whether Texas was Minor\u2019s home state on August 6, 2012, because no parent lived in Texas at that time. The issue is whether California was Minor\u2019s home state, and section 3402, subdivision (g) does not state that periods that arguably can be characterized as temporary absences from other states do <em>not </em>count towards the six-month residency period. The statute simply specifies that temporary absences should not <em>defeat </em>a state\u2019s claim to home state status, which was the situation in <em>Nelson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b521-12\"> In the present <em>case, </em>both parties allege the other engaged in unjustified conduct\u2014Mother by leaving Texas with Minor and failing to promptly seek a modification of the Texas custody order; Father by taking Minor to Nevada without Mother\u2019s consent or knowledge, and retaining Minor in violation of the Texas order. (See <em>In re Marriage of Nurie </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 478, 511-512 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 200].) Because section 3428, subdivision (a)(3) was applicable, we need not decide whether Mother engaged in unjustified conduct. Neither need we decide whether the separate domestic violence exemption in section 3428, subdivision (d) was applicable. Finally, we note that, even if Nevada had a claim to jurisdiction, Nevada Revised Statutes section 125A.375 (the Nevada analogue to \u00a7 3428) might have required Nevada to decline to exercise jurisdiction due to Father\u2019s allegedly unjustified conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b521-13\"> Father contends section 3426, subdivision (b) obligated the superior court to communicate with Texas and Nevada before modifying the Texas custody order. However, that provision was inapplicable because it was clear neither of those states had jurisdiction over the Minor on August 31, 2012. (\u00a7 3426, subd. (b) [\u201cIf the court determines that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court in another state <em>having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this part, </em>the court of this state shall stay its proceeding and communicate with the court of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>other state.\u201d (italics added)]; see <em>In re Marriage ofSareen </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 371, 377 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 687] [trial court did not violate \u00a7 3426, subd. (a), where it was clear India did not have jurisdiction under the UCCJEA].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b522-12\"> Father also contends the superior court lacked personal jurisdiction over <em>him, </em>because he lacked the minimum contacts with California necessary for assertion of such jurisdiction. However, he fails to present any reasoned argument with citations to relevant supporting authorities <em>(Badie v. Bank of America </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 784-785 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273]) that the superior court needed personal jurisdiction over him to issue a restraining order and modify the Texas custody order under the UCCJEA. (See \u00a7 3421, subd. (c) [\u201cPhysical presence of, or personal jurisdiction over, a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make a child custody determination.\u201d].) Finally, we need not and do not address Father\u2019s contentions that the trial court violated his due process rights at the August 31 hearing, because those contentions were not presented in a timely fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 581.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
