Briones (Petitioner) seeks review of a circuit court order dismissing his Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition, which sought to vacate his conviction of attempted first degree murder in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 705-500 (1985) and 707-701(l)(a) (Supp. 1992). Relying on our opinion in <em>State v. Briones, </em>71 Haw. 86, 784 P.2d 860 (1989), the trial court determined that the petition was frivolous and thus no evidentiary hearing was held. <em>See </em>HRPP 40(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Briones, </em>we reversed Petitioner\u2019s convictions of attempted second degree murder and second degree murder, in violation of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 705-500 and 707-701.5 (Supp. 1992). Later, the circuit court dismissed both charges in accordance with our instructions. Our affirmance of petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence for attempted first degree murder yielded the petition, the dismissal of which we now review. Because we agree with Petitioner in certain respects, we reverse his conviction of attempted first degree murder and remand to circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>for a new trial. Although the facts of this case are ably set out in <em>State v. Briones, supra, </em>a brief summary is useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Shortly after arriving uninvited at a party on May 3, 1987, Petitioner allegedly took a shotgun from the car in which he arrived then shot and killed one person, pumped the gun, then shot and wounded another person. Both victims were guests at the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Petitioner was charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\"><em>Count I - </em>Attempted first degree murder for the attempted murder of more than one person \u201cin the same incident,\u201d in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 705-500 and 707-701(l)(a);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\"><em>Count II </em>- Second degree murder for causing the death of the first victim, in violation of HRS \u00a7 707-701.5(1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\"><em>Count III - </em>Attempted second degree murder for attempting to cause the death of the second victim, in violation of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 705-500 and 707-701.5(1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\"><em>Count IV </em>- Place to keep firearm, in violation of HRS \u00a7 134-6 (1985); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\"><em>Count </em>V - Possession of a firearm by a person indicted for certain crimes, in violation of \u00a7 134-7(b) (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">Petitioner was convicted by a jury on all five counts. At trial, Petitioner\u2019s counsel objected that convicting Petitioner of Count I as well as Counts II and III violated the double jeopardy prohibitions of the State and Federal constitutions as well as HRS \u00a7 701-109(l)(a) (1985) because Counts II and III were included and derivative offenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Count I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No objections were raised as to Petitioner\u2019s convictions on Counts IV and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel further argued at trial that the death of the first victim rendered Petitioner\u2019s conviction of attempted murder in the first degree (Count I) an impossibility, because one cannot be convicted of an inchoate, attempted crime as well as the substantive crime itself. The trial court resolved the issues by denying defense counsel\u2019s objections and imposing sentences on all five counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel reasserted his arguments on appeal. Without directly addressing the double jeopardy issue,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>on Count I but reversed his convictions on Counts II and III, and remanded the case for dismissal of those two counts based upon the trial court\u2019s violation of an express statutory provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">[B]ecause the exception clause of HRS \u00a7 707-701.5 directs the fact finder to first consider the elements of first degree murder, as codified in HRS \u00a7 707-701(l)(a), once it found Defendant guilty of the inchoate crime of attempted first degree murder, it was precluded from also considering the second degree murder and attempted second degree murder charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\"><em>State v. Briones, </em>71 Haw. at 94, 784 P.2d at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">HRS \u00a7 707-701.5(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\"><em>Except as provided in section 707-701 </em>[first degree murder], a person commits the offense of murder in the second degree if the person intentionally or knowingly causes the death of another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atl\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Petitioner is currently serving a prison sentence of life <em>without </em>parole, as a result of his conviction of attempted first degree murder (Count I). Had Petitioner been convicted of either Count II or III, or both, the sentence would have included the possibility of parole. Petitioner retained different counsel and filed a Rule 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court dismissed the petition and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">A. Impermissible Presumption of Guilt</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Petitioner asserts that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning Counts I, II, and III, combined with the prosecutor\u2019s explanation in closing argument, led the jury to conclude that if petitioner were guilty of second degree murder (Count II) and attempted second degree murder (Count III), then petitioner was automatically guilty of attempted first degree murder (Count I). Petitioner maintains that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue at trial and on appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The judge sufficiently instructed the jury regarding the elements of the individual counts. The judge\u2019s instructions in pertinent part were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">There are three elements to the offense of attempted murder in the first degree, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution has done so, you must find the defendant guilty as charged. If the prosecution has not done so, you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">The three elements are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">1. The defendant, Isagani P. Briones, shot Jessie Peralta and Floracindo Queja, Jr. <em>in the same </em>incident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-13\">2. The defendant did so intentionally;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-14\">3. Defendant\u2019s conduct, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, was a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the death of Jessie Peralta and Floracindo Queja, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">The defendant, Isagani P. Briones, is charged in Count II of the complaint, with the offense of murder in the second degree of Floracindo Queja, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">There are two elements to the offense of murder in the second degree, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution has done so, you must find the defendant guilty as charged. If the prosecution has not done so, you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">The two elements are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">1. The defendant, Isagani Briones, caused the death of Floracindo Queja, Jr. by shooting him in an incident separated in time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">2. The defendant did so intentionally or knowingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">There are three elements to the offense of attempted murder in the second degree, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution has done so, you must find the defendant guilty as charged. If the prosecution has not done so, you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">The three elements are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-13\">1. The defendant, Isagani P. Briones, shot Jessie Peralta in an incident separated in time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-14\">2. The defendant did so intentionally;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-15\">3. Defendant\u2019s conduct, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, was a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tial step in a course of conduct intended to cause the death of Jessie Peralta. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s explanation in closing argument was similar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">In addition to that, and here we come to the principal charge, murder in the first degree and the phrase there is \u201cin the same incident\u201d. If you find that in one event, he killed Floracindo Queja and in a separate event, he tried to kill Jessie Peralta <em>and that both of those events were part of a single course of action, </em>then he is guilty of attempted murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">It is clear that the jury, despite petitioner\u2019s assertions to the contrary, was required to find the element of \u201cin the same incident\u201d, or \u201cpart of a single course of action\u201d, in order to find petitioner guilty of attempted first degree murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No \u201cpresumption of guilt\u201d occurred as a result of either the judge\u2019s instructions or the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Our assessment that the issue lacks merit, no matter when raised, effectively disposes of any claim of error arising out of a failure to present the issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">B. Right to a Fair Jury Trial and Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">The second point petitioner raises is that the Hawaii Supreme Court violated Petitioner\u2019s right to trial by jury when it \u201ctook it upon itself to decide which count the jury would have convicted on if properly instructed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Petitioner\u2019s Opening Brief, </em>filed Mar. 13, 1992 in No. 15833, at 10. Petitioner argues that had his counsel raised the right to trial by jury issue during the appeal, our decision would have been different.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Although we disagree with petitioner\u2019s rationale, the right to a fair jury trial includes the right to have all charges clearly presented to the jury in order to obviate the possibility of inconsistent findings of fact if the jury were to find against the defendant on all counts. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 701-109(l)(c) (1985 and Supp. 1991). Accordingly, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, even though sufficient to apprise them of the elements of the individual counts, should have also included an explanation that a unanimous guilty verdict on Count I, attempted first degree murder, would necessarily preclude guilty verdicts on Counts II and III, second degree murder and attempted second degree murder, respectively.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The omission of proper instructions allowed the jury\u2019s verdicts to contain inconsistent factual findings in violation of HRS \u00a7 701-109(l)(c), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">(1) When the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each offense of which such conduct is an element. He may not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>(c) Inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish the commission of the offenses[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The state of mind essential to support a charge of attempted first degree murder of two people is inconsistent with that state of mind necessary to support separate counts of second degree murder and attempted second degree murder. When the jury returned verdicts on Counts I \u2014 III, Petitioner\u2019s counsel could, therefore, have argued that HRS \u00a7 701 \u2014 109(l)(c) precluded inconsistent multiple convictions arising out of the same conduct. The key issue thus becomes whether Petitioner\u2019s trial and appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue of inconsistent factual findings may have affected Petitioner\u2019s right to a fair jury trial and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">1. Inconsistent Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In order to understand the reason that Petitioner\u2019s convictions on Counts I \u2014 III violate HRS \u00a7 701 \u2014 109(l)(c), we must examine the relationship between the crimes of first and second degree murder. A conviction for first degree murder may occur, <em>inter alia, </em>when a person \u201cintentionally or knowingly causes the death of. .. more than one person in the same or separate incident.\u201d HRS \u00a7 707-701(a) (Supp. 1992). Several convictions of second degree murder may instead ensue if the multiple deaths result from acts committed with separate states of mind. By the following examples, we clarify the state of mind necessarily related to the first degree murder term \u201csame or separate incident,\u201d and distinguish it from the separate states of mind related to an incident which gives rise to multiple convictions of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>First, the requisite state of mind to cause the death of two or more persons in the same incident may be found where an actor fires one or several bullets indiscriminately into a crowd of people and more than one person dies. Such an act can readily be described as intentionally or knowingly causing the death of more than one person in the \u201csame incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Second, in the case of a serial killer, the requisite state of mind to cause the death of more than one person may be found in a continuing course of conduct, or a common scheme or plan, even though the acts may be \u201cseparated in time.\u201d Whether such acts are deemed to have occurred in the \u201csame incident\u201d or \u201cseparate incidents,\u201d for purposes of HRS \u00a7 707-701(l)(a), will depend on factors such as location, time, and method. Even facts demonstrating that the deaths occurred only a few seconds apart could be described as \u201cseparate incidents,\u201d and may be charged as such. The key factor supporting a charge of first degree murder is the actor\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Finally, we examine the case of an actor who causes the death of two or more people in incidents separated in time but without the intent to cause both deaths as part of a common scheme or plan. For example, an actor, in the course of committing robbeiy of a convenience store, shoots and kills an employee. Afterwards, a passer-by is shot and killed by the actor attempting to escape. Although two people were killed in separate incidents during the same criminal episode, the actor may not be guilty of first degree murder because the requisite state of mind to cause the death of two or more people in the same or separate incident arguably is lacking. The actor would possibly be guilty, however, of two separate counts of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>As the examples indicate, the murder or attempted murder of two or more persons by a single actor may or may not be committed with separate states of mind. The legislature recognized these distinctions when it amended HRS \u00a7 707-701 in 1986 to broaden the first degree murder category.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both the House and Senate stated, \u201c[y]our Committee intends that persons convicted of serial killings be subject to life imprisonment without parole.\u201d Serial killings are acts occurring in \u201cseries\u201d and are by definition, therefore, related events.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state of mind of the accused provides the relationship between the murders of a serial killer and is the distinguishing factor between separate counts of second degree murder and one count of first degree murder. The state of mind with which the actor acts must be clearly and unambiguously established in order to sustain a first or second degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Thus, although the prosecutor was allowed to charge Petitioner with Counts I \u2014 III, defense counsel should have objected to the guilty verdicts because they were based on an inconsistent, irreconcilable factual premise: that Petitioner intended to murder both victims as part of the <em>same plan </em>(guilty of Count I); <em>and </em>that Petitioner acted with separate, unrelated states of mind to cause the death of each victim (guilty of Counts II <em>and </em>III). Because a jury could have viewed the evidence as sufficient to support either scenario, it was the <em>jury\u2019s </em>function to determine beyond a reasonable doubt which of the two mutually exclusive states of mind Petitioner had during the incident. It was error for them to decide that Petitioner had both. <em>Milanovich v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 551, 555-56 (1961) (Defendant could not be guilty of the offense of larceny of property and of the offense of receiving that same property.); <em>People v. Hoffer, </em>106 Ill. 2d 186, 478 N.E.2d 335, 340, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 847 (1985) (Guilty verdicts on charges of murder and manslaughter imply that jury found two mutually exclusive mental states for same act requiring reversal and new trial on all counts.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">An examination of Petitioner\u2019s prior counsel\u2019s appellate brief explains his failure to object to the multiple, inconsistent guilty verdicts on Counts I \u2014 III. Prior counsel harbored a fundamental misapprehension of the relationship between first and second degree murder. Counsel argued that as long as an actor caused the death of two or more people he or she could be convicted, barring other defenses, of first degree murder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such a conviction would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>be possible, he asserted, whether or not the killings occurred in related or unrelated incidents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This interpretation fads to account for the greater culpability of the more serious offense, is clearly contrary to the legislative history, and violates HRS \u00a7 701 \u2014 109(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Counsel <em>could </em>have argued, both at trial and on appeal, that the factual inconsistency concerning Petitioner\u2019s state of mind inherent in the multiple convictions violated \u00a7 701 \u2014 109(l)(c). If argued on appeal, the inconsistent verdicts concerning multiple convictions would have required reversal and a new trial. <em>Milanovich, </em>365 U.S. at 555-56; <em>United States v. Daigle, </em>149 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>409, <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>248 F.2d 608 (D.C. Cir. 1957), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 913 <em>(1958); Hoffer, </em>106 Ill. 2d at 195, 478 N.E.2d at 340 (mutually exclusive guilty verdicts require reversal and a new trial). The question is whether petitioner\u2019s prior counsel was constitutionally <em>required </em>to raise such an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">2. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Petitioner asserts that his prior counsel failed to present the issue of a potential violation of his constitutional right to trial by jury at trial and on appeal. First, any complaint of counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance <em>at trial, </em>contained in a Rule 40 petition, is usually waived pursuant to HRPP 40(a)(3), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">Inapplicability. Said proceeding shall not be available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled upon or waived. An issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issue. There is a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Where petitioner has been represented by the same counsel both at trial and on direct appeal, no waiver of the issue of trial counsel\u2019s performance occurs because no realistic opportunity existed to raise the issue on direct appeal. <em>Matsuo v. State, </em>70 Haw. 573, 577, 778 P.2d 332, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>334 (1989) (Rule 40 petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was not waived where his trial counsel failed to perfect appeal); <em>McBride v. State, </em>595 N.E.2d 260 (Ind. App. 1992). The issue of ineffective assistance of <em>appellate </em>counsel is also properly before us, as it could not have been raised until after the conclusion of the appeal. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>6 Haw. App. 331, 335, 720 P.2d 1015, 1019 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">No constitutional right to an appeal exists. <em>State v. Dannenberg, </em>74 Haw. 75, 837 P.2d 776, 778 (1992); <em>McKane v. Durston, </em>153 U.S. 684 (1894). Hawaii guarantees by statute the right to an appeal to every criminal defendant who deems himself or herself aggrieved by a district or circuit court judgment. HRS \u00a7 641-12 (1985) and \u00a7 641-11 (Supp. 1991), respectively. For appeals as of right, a criminal defendant has the right to assistance of counsel pursuant to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause. U.S. Const, amend. XIV; Haw. Const, art. I, \u00a7 5; <em>Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>373 U.S. 905 (1963). An appeal as of right is adjudicated in accordance with due process of law only when the appellant has the <em>effective </em>assistance of counsel. <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 396, <em>reh\u2019g denied, 470 </em>U.S. 1065 (1985). The burden to show ineffective assistance of trial or appellate counsel rests with the petitioner. <em>Kimball v. Sadaoka, </em>56 Haw. 675, 676, 548 P.2d 268, 269 (1976); <em>State v. Antone, </em>62 Haw. 346, 348, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">No Hawaii Supreme Court case has defined the standard by which the effectiveness of appellate counsel is to be judged.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Federal jurisdictions have applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>standards for evaluating trial counsel to the actions of appellate counsel. <em>Griffen v. Aiken, </em>775 F.2d 1226 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Cir. 1985), <em>cert, denied, </em>478 U.S. 1007 (1986); <em>Schwander v. Blackburn, 750 </em>F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir. 1985); <em>Gray v. Greer, </em>800 F.2d 644, 646 (7th Cir. 1986); <em>Beavers v. Lockhart, 755 </em>F.2d 657, 660-61 (8th Cir. 1985). We have declined, however, to adopt the federal standard for reviewing trial counsel\u2019s performance. <em>State v. Smith, </em>68 Haw. 304, 310 n.7, 712 P.2d 496, 500 n.7 (1986). Because we believe it appropriate to extend our stricter review of counsel\u2019s performance to the appellate stage in order to more fully protect the defendants\u2019 rights, an outline of the current trial standard is necessaiy.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Ineffective Assistance at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">In any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the burden is upon the defendant to demonstrate that, in light of all the circumstances, counsel\u2019s performance was not objectively reasonable \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>State v. Kahalewai, </em>54 Haw. 28, 30, 501 P.2d 977, 979 (1972) (quoting <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 (1970)). In <em>State v.

Appellate courts neither find facts, except to determine if substantial evidence existed to support the trial court\u2019s conclusions, nor judge credibility, nor weigh the evidence. Nonmeritorious arguments or explanations are discarded without prejudicial effect. Moreover, appellate courts may dispense with oral argument at their discretion. As such, it is counsel\u2019s responsibility, in the limited time and space allowed, to present issues that may have influenced the <em>trial court\u2019s </em>decision adversely to his or her client. Our focus, therefore, is not upon the possible, or even probable, influence appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions had on the appellate court, but, instead, we center on whether counsel informed him or herself enough to present appropriate appealable issues in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">An \u201cappealable issue\u201d is an error or omission by counsel, judge, or jury resulting in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>defense.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Every appealable issue is not required to be asserted.

The aggravating facts were not essential elements of the crime of murder. <em>State v. Apao, </em>59 Haw. 625, 634, 586 P.2d 250, 257 (1978); <em>State v. Lester, </em>64 Haw. 659, 670, 649 P.2d 346, 354 (1982). Murder was also not to be considered a lesser included offense of murder for hire, <em>State v. Lincoln, </em>3 Haw. App. 107, 120, 643 P.2d 807, <em>816 (1982); Lester, supra, </em>nor a lesser included offense of the murder of a witness, <em>Apao, supra; </em>both factual situations were sufficient to enhance the sentence of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In 1986, the legislature transformed the aggravating circumstances contained in \u00a7 706-606 into the elements of the new penal offense of first degree murder, \u00a7 707-701. As such, what was once referred to as simply \u201cmurder\u201d became murder in the second degree (\u00a7 707-701.5), a completely separate offense and never considered an included offense of murder in the first degree (\u00a7 707-701) under any of the provisions of \u00a7 701-109(4). <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language 1303 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> Defendant-Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4d\">Whether or not multiple killings were committed with an intent to kill multiple persons or to kill specific, individual persons, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>whether they were committed in the same incident, in a single course of action, or in separate actions, is entirely irrelevant to establishing whether the offense offirst or second degree murder is committed.

Such evidence did not surface at trial. The defense, after opening statement, was that the police identified the wrong person and that the prosecution\u2019s case rested on faulty identification. It is no surprise, then, that the jury discredited the evidence in Petitioner\u2019s favor and counsel\u2019s closing arguments that Petitioner was not the perpetrator nor had he any motive to he.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> In <em>Kimball v. Sadaoka, </em>56 Haw. 675, 548 P.2d 268 (1976), the court, without enunciating a standard, found that an appellant, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>counsel failed to raise an issue in his written briefs but who nevertheless was permitted to present the question in his oral argument, was not denied effective assistance of appellate counsel because the issue not only lacked merit but was, in fact, noticed by the court. The outcome in <em>Kimball </em>is consistent with the standard enunciated herein. In <em>Bryant v. State, </em>6 Haw. App. 331, 720 P.2d 1015 (1986), the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), relying on federal case law, directly addressed the standard for appellate counsel\u2019s performance. The standard of review enunciated <em>inBryant </em>focused on whether appellate counsel\u2019s choice of issues on appeal fell below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Only if omitted appellate issues were \u201csignificant and obvious,\u201d would counsel\u2019s performance be questioned. Furthermore, any omitted \u201csignificant and obvious\u201d issues should then he compared to those issues originally raised to determine if the omitted issues are \u201cclearly more likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial.\u201d The two part test enunciated <em>in Bryant </em>thus imposes a dual burden upon a criminal appellant to prove ineffectiveness of appellate counsel, which is analogous to the standard utilized in federal jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Federal cases concerning effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel rely on the standard enunciated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984), a test criticized as being too burdensome for defendants to meet because it imposes a double burden upon defendants trying to show their counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, resulting in a prejudice requirement almost impossible to surmount. <em>State v. Smith, </em>68 Haw. 304, 310 n.7, 712 P.2d 496, 500 n.7 (1986). <em>Strickland </em>required not only that trial counsel\u2019s action or omission be an \u201cunprofessional error,\u201d but that that error resulted in a \u201creasonable probability that. .. the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d 466 U.S. at 694. The holding in <em>Smith </em>specifically rejected the standard enunciated in <em>Strickland. Id. Bryant\u2019s </em>reliance on federal case law to establish a standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Smith </em>and inherently suspect. The \u201csignificant and obvious\u201d and \u201cclearly more likely\u201d standards, aside from being vague, are indistinguishable from the burdensome prejudice standard enunciated in <em>Strickland </em>and its progeny. Moreover, to the extent that the holding in <em>Bryant </em>centers the analysis on the decision of the appellate court hearing the issues, rather than on the possible effect an omitted issue would have had on the trial court, <em>Bryant </em>is further disapproved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> The Supreme Court of California in <em>People v.

The latter part of theequationis similar to the rule enunciated in <em>Strickland, </em>where an additional showing of prejudice must be made such that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to present significant and obvious issues would establish a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694,104 S.

The petition in this case presents nothing new; the record before us differs not one iota from that in <em>Briones I. </em>Although I am deeply troubled by the potential \u201cprecedential quagmire\u201d created by a reexamination of our past opinions via a Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition, <em>see </em>majority opinion at 453 n.5,1 cannot escape the fact that the holding of <em>Briones I </em>is tantamount to appellate \u201cplain error\u201d and we should simply \u201cfess up\u201d to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The majority acknowledges that the circuit court adequately instructed the jury regarding the elements of attempted first degree murder (Count I), second degree murder (Count II), and attempted second degree murder (Count III).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Majority opinion at 450-52. Moreover, I read the majority opinion to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict as to Count I was supported by substantial evidence;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that conclusion is certainly implicit in <em>Briones I, see </em>71 Haw. at 94-95, 784 P.2d at 864, and I subscribe to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>I understand the reasoning of the majority opinion to be as follows: (1) HRS \u00a7 701-109(l)(c) (1985) forbids convictions of more than one offense if inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish the commission of the offenses; (2) the state of mind with respect to the attendant circumstance of \u201cin the same incident,\u201d necessary to support the petitioner\u2019s conviction of the attempted first degree murder of two persons, is inconsistent with that necessary to support his separate convictions of second degree murder and attempted second degree murder, <em>see </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 707-701(l)(a) (Supp. 1992), 707-701.5 (Supp. 1992), 705-500 (1985), 702-206(l)(b) (1985), and 702-206(2)(b) (1985); (3) the circuit court should have instructed the jury that it could not convict on both Count I, on the one hand, and Counts II and III, on the other; (4) the circuit court\u2019s failure so to instruct the jury resulted in guilty verdicts implicitly containing inconsistent factual findings; (5) the failure of the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel to raise the issue of inconsistent verdicts constituted ineffective assistance; and (6) the petitioner is therefore entitled to a new trial on Counts I, II, and III. I agree with points (1) through (4) and point (6); on the other hand, I believe that point (5) improperly deflects responsibility from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">It is obvious that had the circuit court instructed the jury that it could not decide Counts II and III of the complaint if it was able to reach a unanimous guilty verdict as to Count I, and vice versa, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict as to Count I would have foreclosed it from reaching Counts II <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>and III, and there would have been no inconsistent verdicts. The <em>Briones I </em>court recognized as much when it held that \u201cthe [petitioner\u2019s] attempted first degree murder conviction precluded his second degree murder and attempted second degree murder convictions.\u201d 71 Haw. at 94-95, 784 P.2d at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">It is equally obvious, as the majority maintains at 453 of its opinion (and as the <em>Briones I </em>court should have recognized as well), that the \u201c[circuit court\u2019s] instructions to the jury ... <em>should </em>have ... included an explanation that a unanimous guilty verdict on [C]ount I, attempted first degree murder, would necessarily preclude guilty verdicts on Counts II and III, second degree murder and attempted second degree murder, respectively,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he omission of proper instructions allowed the jury\u2019s verdicts to contain inconsistent factual findings in violation of HRS \u00a7 701-109(l)(c)____\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See State v. Liuafi, </em>1 Haw. App. 625, 643, 623 P.2d 1271, 1282 (1981); <em>cf. State v. Horn, </em>8 Haw. App. 167, 169-70, 796 P.2d 503, 504-05 (1990) (cited with approval in <em>State v. Klafta, </em>73 Haw. 109, 118, 831 P.2d 512, 517 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">I believe, however, that the majority is mistaken when it suggests that \u201c[t]he key issue thus becomes whether [the petitioner\u2019s] . . . counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue of inconsistent factual findings may have affected [the petitioner\u2019s] right to a fair trial and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Majority opinion at 454. On the contrary, \u201cthe trial court is the <em>sole source </em>of all definitions and statements of law applicable to an issue to be resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Williamson, </em>72 Haw. 97, 103, 807 P.2d 593, 596 (1991) (emphasis added). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">[it] is the <em>duty of the circuit judge </em>to see to it that the case goes to the jury in a clear and intelligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>manner, so that they may have a clear and correct understanding of what it is they are to decide, and he shall state to them fully the law applicable to the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>State v. Feliciano, </em>62 Haw. 637, 643, 618 P.2d 306, 310 (1980) (quoting <em>People v. Henry, </em>395 Mich. 367, 373-74, 236 N.W.2d 489, 492 (1975)) (emphasis added). And faced with inaccurate or incomplete instructions, \u201c[t]he <em>trial court has a duty to, </em>with the aid of counsel, either correct the defective instruction or to otherwise <em>incorporate it into its own instruction\u201d State v. Riveira, </em>59 Haw 148, 155, 577 P.2d 793, 797 (1978) (emphasis added and citations omitted); <em>see </em>HRPP 30(c) (1981). In other words, the ultimate responsibility properly to instruct the jury in this case lay with the circuit court and <em>not </em>with trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In <em>Briones I, </em>\u201cwe affirm[ed] the [petitioner\u2019s] conviction and sentence as to the attempted first degree murder offense (Count I) . . . , reverse[d] the conviction and sentence as to the second degree murder offense (Count II) and the attempted second degree murder offense (Count III), and remand[ed] with instructions to dismiss Counts II and III.\u201d 71 Haw. at 95, 784 P.2d at 864. On the record before us at the time, which, as I have noted, has not changed one iota by the present petition, that was the wrong result for the very reasons cited by the majority opinion but unfairly charged to the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that the ultimate disposition of the present matter was somehow \u201caltered\u201d by the petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to argue on appeal that the petitioner\u2019s multiple murder convictions violated HRS \u00a7 701-109(l)(c), majority opinion at 467, is, in my view, incorrect. If the <em>Briones I </em>court had merely read the very United States Supreme Court case law on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>majority opinion now relies, it \u201cwould not have found the [petitioner\u2019s] multiple convictions to be \u2018harmless error.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>majority opinion at 467 n.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">As a general proposition, \u201c[i]nconsistent verdicts are not per se grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Liuafi, </em>1 Haw. App. at 643, 623 P.2d at 1282; <em>see generally United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 105 S. Ct. 471, 83 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1984); <em>United States v. Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. 544, 96 S. Ct. 1023, 47 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1976); Annotation, <em>Inconsistency of Criminal Verdict as Between Different Counts of Indictment or Information, </em>18 A.L.R.3d 259 (1968). Nevertheless, <em>Milanovich v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 551, 81 S. Ct. 728, 5 L. Ed. 2d 773 (1961), on which the majority opinion <em>now </em>relies, <em>see </em>majority opinion at 457, 458-59, and which had been on the books for eighteen years when <em>Briones I </em>was decided, is dispositive of the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In <em>Milanovich, </em>a husband and wife were convicted of stealing property belonging to the United States, and the wife was also convicted of receiving and concealing the stolen property. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 81 S. Ct. at 728. A five-member majority of the United States Supreme Court, through Justice Stewart, held that setting aside, on appeal, a shorter concurrent sentence for receiving, following the wife\u2019s conviction of both stealing and receiving, did not cure any prejudice resulting from the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that it could convict the wife of either stealing or receiving but not both. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 81 S. Ct. at 730.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s language upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>majority apparently relies in the present case is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">It is now contended that setting aside the sentence on the receiving count was not enough \u2014 that the conviction on the larceny count must also be reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial. The argument is that although the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for either larceny or receiving, the judge should have instructed the jury that a guilty verdict could be returned upon either count but not both. It is urged that <em>since it is now impossible to say what verdict would have been returned by a jury so instructed, and thus impossible to know what sentence would have been imposed, a new trial is in order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">We think that the point is well taken.... We hold ... that the trial judge erred in not charging that the jury could convict of either larceny or receiving, but not of both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">. . . [Tjhere is no way of knowing whether a properly instructed jury would have found the wife guilty of larceny or of receiving (or, conceivably, of neither). Thus we cannot say that the mere setting aside of the shorter concurrent sentence sufficed to cure any prejudice resulting from the trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 81 S. Ct. at 730 (emphasis added and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>Milanovich </em>was distinguished by a unanimous Court, also through Justice Stewart, in <em>United States v. Gaddis, supra. </em>In <em>Gaddis, </em>the defendants were convicted of entering a federally insured bank with intent to rob it by force and violence, assault during the course of the robbery, and possessing funds stolen in the robbery. 424 U.S. at 545-46,96 S. Ct. at 1025. The court of appeals, relying in part on <em>Milanovich, </em>reversed and ordered a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47,96 S. Ct. at 1025-26. On certiorari, the <em>Gaddis </em>court held that: (1) the defendants, upon being convicted of robbing the bank, could not also be convicted of receiving or possessing the robbery proceeds; (2) the,error could be cured by vacating the convictions for receiving the proceeds rather than by directing a new trial on qll counts; and (3) the defendants\u2019 concurrent sentences imposed for bank robbery and entering the bank with intent to rob would be vacated, leaving the defendants under W single sentence imposed for assault during the course of the bank robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 550, 96 S. Ct. at 1027. '</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Accordingly, the <em>Gaddis </em>court reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded for imposition of sentence consistent with its opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 551-52, 96 S. Ct. at 1027. In so doing, the Court distinguished <em>Milanovich </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">The Court of Appeals was mistaken... in supposing that our decision in <em>Milanovich </em>required the ordering of a new trial as the \u201cproper appellate remedy\u201d for the District Judge\u2019s error in this case. The very unusual facts in that case were wholly different from those presented here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">In <em>Milanovich . . . </em>[t]he trial judge refused to instruct the jury that the petitioner could not be convicted for both stealing and receiving the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>currency, and she was convicted and separately sentenced on both counts. This Court held that... the jury should have been instructed that the petitioner could not be separately convicted for stealing and receiving the proceeds of the same theft. <em>Since it was impossible to say upon which count, if either, a properly instructed jury would have convicted the petitioner, </em>. . . <em>her convictions were set aside and the case was remanded for a new trial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">The present case is of a very different order.... [T]he trial judge should have dismissed Count 3 of the indictment. His error in not doing so can be fully corrected now by the simple expedient of vacating the convictions and sentences under that count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 549-50, 96 S. Ct. at 1026-27 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In my view, the reasoning of <em>Milanovich </em>and <em>Gaddis </em>controls the disposition of the present case, and <em>Briones I </em>is completely inconsistent with that reasoning. If, as we all agree, the circuit court had instructed the jury that it could reach Counts II and III of the complaint <em>only </em>if it was unable to arrive at a unanimous guilty verdict as to Count I, then neither we nor the <em>Briones I </em>court would have been faced with verdicts based on inconsistent factual findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the jury was not so instructed, and, as the majority recognizes at 457 of its opinion (and the <em>Briones I </em>court <em>should </em>have recognized), the petitioner\u2019s jury could have viewed the evidence before it as sufficient to support alternative convictions of attempted first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>murder, on the one hand, and second degree murder and attempted second degree murder, on the other. Accordingly, unlike the record before the <em>Gaddis </em>Court, but as in <em>Milanovich, </em>it is \u201cimpossible to say upon which count... a properly instructed jury would have convicted the petitioner . . . .\u201d For this reason, this court erred in <em>Briones I </em>in affirming the petitioner\u2019s attempted first degree murder conviction and remanding with instructions to dismiss the second degree murder and attempted second degree murder counts. And for the same reason, the fact that the jury actually decided Counts II and III cannot be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">I would grant the petition but would not hold that the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Ultimate responsibility for misapprehending the relationship between existing case law and the statutory scheme created by HRS \u00a7\u00a7 707-701 and 707-701.5 was this court\u2019s alone.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> I note, however, as does the majority opinion at 452 n.4, that \u201cin an incident separated in time\u201d is neither an element of second degree murder, see HRS \u00a7 707-701.5 (Supp. 1992), nor of attempted second degree murder, see <em>id. </em>and HRS \u00a7 705-500 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> [Ejvidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the case was before a judge or a jury. . . .
