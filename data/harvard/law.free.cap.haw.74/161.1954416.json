Quino (Quino) was convicted of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 712-1241(l)(a)(i) (Supp. 1991). The circuit court denied Quino\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress evidence. Subsequently, Quino was found guilty by a circuit court jury and sentenced to incarceration for a term of twenty years. On appeal before the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), Quino argued that the circuit court should have granted his motion to suppress, because the evidence recovered was the product of an illegal seizure. The ICA affirmed the conviction in a published opinion. <em>See State v. Quino, </em>No. 15239 (Haw. App. May 7, 1992). This court granted Quino\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the ICA\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Quino\u2019s petition raises five issues; however, we confine our review to the following points: (1) whether Quino was \u201cseized\u201d by the police when Officer Tanya Tano (Officer Tano) approached and questioned him in the airport terminal; and (2) assuming a seizure occurred, whether it was consensual. Because we conclude that an unlawful seizure occurred prior to Quino\u2019s flight, it is unnecessary to address the remaining issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The Honolulu Police Department\u2019s Narcotics/Vice Airport Detail (HPD) utilizes a \u201cwalk and talk\u201d drug inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>diction program in order to arrest drug, smugglers and to seize any narcotics they might be carrying on their persons or in their luggage. This \u201cwalk and talk\u201d program does not employ any type of \u201cdrug courier profile\u201d or require the officers to have a reasonable suspicion that a person may be in possession of illegal drugs, or may be engaged in criminal activity. Instead, members of the detail are trained to engage in \u201cconsensual encounters\u201d whereby airline passengers are approached and, in a \u201cconversational manner,\u201d requested to consent to a search of their luggage or person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The HPD trains its officers to approach a passenger in the following manner: (1) the officer first observes passengers arriving from an illegal drug \u201csource city\u201d; (2) the officer then approaches a passenger at random and identifies himself as a police officer; (3) the officer asks the passenger if he would agree to talk to him; (4) the officer then asks whether the passenger has disembarked from the targeted flight; (5) after receiving oral affirmation, the officer asks the passenger for his identification and airline ticket; (6) the officer asks the passenger if he is carrying any narcotics; (7) upon receiving a negative answer, the officer requests \u201cconsent\u201d to search the passenger\u2019s carry-on and check-in luggage; and, (8) if the inspection is fruitless, the officer then asks the passenger whether he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>any narcotics on his person and requests \u201cconsent\u201d to pat down the passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On the evening of April 3, 1990, Officers Tano and Harold Sumaoang (Officer Sumaoang) were assigned to observe passengers arriving on an American Airlines flight from San Jose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Quino and two friends, Henry Galinato (Galinato) and Raul Cachola (Cachola), were observed by the two officers as they exited the gate and walked single file along the concourse. Officer Tano noticed an unnatural bulge or \u201cbumpiness\u201d on Galinato\u2019s back, near his beltline.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She did not notice anything unusual about Quino or Cachola.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">After observing the three men from a distance, both officers approached and stopped them. Officer Tano identified herself as a police officer and asked permission to speak with Quino and Cachola. After they agreed, Officer Tano asked them whether they had just arrived on the American Airlines flight from San Jose; whether they had previously been to Hawaii, whether they would mind if she looked at their airline tickets, and whether they would provide identification. Meanwhile, Officer Sumaoang stopped Galinato and asked him similar questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Although Officer Tano identified herself as a police officer when she approached the men, she did not attempt to explain the purpose of the questioning. However, while she was inspecting the airline tickets, Quino asked her what the inquiry was all about. It was only then that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Officer Tano mentioned that she was investigating possible narcotics trafficking at the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Officer Tano then asked if the men were carrying narcotics. Quino said he knew nothing about narcotics: Nevertheless, Officer Tano asked if she could check Quino and Cachola\u2019s carry-on luggage. Quino obliged and showed Officer Tano the contents of his bag. No narcotics were discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">At that point, Officer Tano had no reasonable suspicion that any of the individuals was carrying contraband. Nevertheless, the possibility that she might be talking to drug couriers occurred to Officer Tano because of the \u201cbody language\u201d exhibited by both men. She testified that, \u201cI didn\u2019t have any indication, but I was starting to get, by their actions, I was beginning to think that they might have something.\u201d She, therefore, continued to \u201cinteract\u201d with Quino and Cachola.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">After Officer Tano looked into Cachola\u2019s bag, she asked if either Cachola or Quino was carrying narcotics on their person. Each responded in the negative. She then asked if she could \u201cpat them down\u201d and they said \u201cno.\u201d Around that time, Officer Tano overheard Galinato say to Officer Sumaoang, \u201cGive me a break.\u201d Immediately thereafter, the three men started running down the corridor with the officers in pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">During the chase, Officer Sumaoang observed Galinato pull a waistband-like belt and yellow and white packages from under his shirt. Galinato threw these items into potted plants as he ran towards the main airport terminal. The packages were later determined to contain illegal drugs. Officer Sumaoang also observed Quino drop a cellophane package into a potted plant as he ran. This package was later found to contain illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Defendants Cachola, Galinato, and Quino were eventually arrested and charged with promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree. Galinato and Quino both filed pre-trial motions to suppress the evidence recovered during the chase at the airport. Consolidated hearings on the motions to suppress were held on August 15, September 21, and November 2, 1990. The motions were denied because the circuit court determined that the officers\u2019 initial approach and questioning were within constitutional bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">On January 2, 1991, Quino and Galinato were convicted of the drug charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They separately appealed, and although the ICA affirmed both convictions, only Quino requested certiorari.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The ICA determined that Quino was not seized because: (1) the police officers\u2019 actions were lawful and would not have caused a reasonable person in Quino\u2019s position to believe that he was not free to leave, or that, if he started to leave, the police would attempt to physically restrain him; (2) Quino did not have the right to be advised that he could refuse to respond to the questions and simply leave the area; and (3) the circuit court\u2019s findings and legal conclusions were correct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Quino, however, argues that Officer Tano\u2019s approach and questioning of him at the airport was an unlawful and nonconsensual seizure of his person in violation of both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although no physical force was used, Quino argues that the officers\u2019 show of authority and conduct communicated to him that he was not free to leave. He further contends that the incriminating evidence obtained after he fled was inadmissible as the product of an illegal seizure. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16 (1968), the United States Supreme Court recognized that a brief detention that falls short of a traditional arrest may constitute a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the fourth amendment. The Court held that a seizure occurs when a police officer has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen by means of physical force or a show of authority. <em>Id. </em>at 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>n.16. In addition, the Court held that in order to justify the intrusion upon an individual\u2019s constitutionally protected interests, the police officer must observe unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude, in light of his experience, that criminal activity may be afoot and that \u201cthe individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous <em>...Id. </em>at 24. \u201cAnything less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result this Court has consistently refused to sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">More than a decade later in <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544 (1980), the Court established the principle that a person is seized \u201conly if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554. The test focused on whether the person questioned \u201cremains free to disregard the questions and walk away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the person is able to do so, then there is no violation of his or her constitutional rights. <em>Id.; see also Michigan v. Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. 567 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">However, in <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626-28, 111 S. Ct. 1547, 1550-51 (1991), the Court departed from previous case law by refusing to adhere to the reasonable person standard established in <em>Mendenhall. </em>The Court purported to rely on the common law definition of arrest when it held that a seizure within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>meaning of the fourth amendment requires either physical force or submission to an assertion of authority. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In analyzing seizures under article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution, this court has utilized the <em>Mendenhall </em>standard. In <em>State v. Tsukiyama, </em>56 Haw. 8, 12, 525 P.2d 1099,1102 (1974), we stated that \u201c[i]n order to determine if the defendant\u2019s liberty was restrained and he was, therefore, seized, we must evaluate the totality of the circumstances and decide whether or not a reasonably prudent person would believe he was free to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In <em>State v. Texeira, </em>50 Haw. 138, 142 n.2, 433 P.2d 593, 597 n.2 (1967), we acknowledged that \u201c[a]s long as we afford defendants the minimum protection required by federal interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, we are unrestricted in interpreting the constitution of this state to afford greater protection.\u201d Thus, we decline to adopt the definition of seizure employed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hodari D. </em>and, instead, choose to afford greater protection to our citizens by maintaining the <em>Mendenhall </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Relying on <em>Mendenhall, </em>Quino argues that a reasonable person under the circumstances would have concluded that he was not \u201cfree to leave\u201d during the police-initiated encounter. The State argues that <em>Tsukiyama </em>supports its proposition that no seizure of Quino occurred because the questioning here was similar to the \u201cfield interrogation\u201d discussed in <em>Tsukiyama. </em>There, we determined that the \u201cfield interrogation\u201d was not an unconstitutional detention because it did not deprive Tsukiyama of his freedom to move. <em>Tsukiyama, 56 </em>Haw. at 14, 525 P.2d at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In <em>Tsukiyama, </em>a police officer on routine patrol late at night came upon three vehicles parked on the street. A group of men was standing around one of the vehicles which had stalled. The officer called for backup and began to converse with Tsukiyama. In time, at least ten police officers arrived and parked around the three vehicles. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 525 P.2d at 1100-01. When one of the police officers asked Tsukiyama if he had any identification, Tsukiyama replied that it was in his glove compartment. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 525 P.2d at 1101. Without objecting, he proceeded to his vehicle. As two police officers shined their flashlights into his car, Tsukiyama opened the glove compartment, and the butt of a gun was revealed. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 525 P.2d at 1101. Recovery of the gun led to the discovery of narcotics in the glove compartment and Tsukiyama was arrested. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Prior to trial, Tsukiyama\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence was denied by the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Tsukiyama alleged that the motion to suppress had been improperly denied because he had been unconstitutionally seized prior to the officer observing the gun in the glove compartment. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 525 P.2d at 1101-02. We affirmed Tsukiyama\u2019s conviction and held that no \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cseizure\u201d had taken place. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 525 P.2d at 1105. We found the \u201cfield interrogation\u201d permissible because, given the totality of the circumstances, the officers had not restricted Tsukiyama\u2019s right to move. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 525 P.2d at 1103. We also found nothing in the record to show that Tsukiyama had been coerced into cooperating with the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17, 525 P.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Quino\u2019s situation differs substantially from <em>Tsukiyama </em>because Officers Ta\u00f1o and Sumaoang deliberately initiated their encounter with Quino and his companions for the specific purpose of investigating possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>drug trafficking by them. Utilizing questions that gradually became more intrusive, the officers sought to bootstrap their investigation into discovery of possible criminal activity by the group. By contrast, the officers in <em>Tsukiyama </em>came upon the men by happenstance. The questions asked were general, non-intrusive and limited to a request for identification. No one in the group was under investigation for specific criminal activity until the gun was observed in the glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The record establishes that Officer Tano initially approached Quino and the others by starting an apparently innocuous \u201cvoluntary conversation.\u201d This \u201cvoluntary conversation\u201d soon evolved into an interrogation, as Officer Tano\u2019s questions grew more intrusive and accusatory in nature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The questions were also pretextual, specifically designed to elicit responses that would either vindicate or implicate the men.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In a staged police-citizen encounter such as this, the police exercise complete control over the interaction. The course of the questioning and the insinuative nature of the questions are left entirely to the discretion of the officer. For example, even after Quino informed Officer Tano that he knew nothing about narcotics, she sought to inspect his carry-on bag. When she found nothing in the carry-on, Officer Tano continued her questioning. She requested a pat down search, although she lacked a single reason to suspect Quino was concealing contraband. Moreover, the circumstances beget an obligation by the citizen to reply to any and all questions, no matter how intrusive, lest the authorities deem one\u2019s conduct suspicious. Had Quino <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cooperated by producing his airline ticket and identification, but refused an inspection of his bags or a pat down search, the officer\u2019s suspicion would surely have been aroused. Thus, the police investigation is benefitted immensely by the pretextual stop and questioning process. Here, Officer Tano was able to observe Quino\u2019s body language and evaluate his responses. If Quino\u2019s behavior had provided an objective basis to suspect criminal activity, a <em>Terry </em>stop could have been effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Under these facts, we are persuaded that once the stop turned from general to inquisitive questioning, a reasonable person in Quino\u2019s position would not have believed that he was free to ignore the officer\u2019s inquiries and walk away. Although no physical force was used, given the totality of the circumstances, we hold that a seizure took place within the meaning of article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The United States Supreme Court has previously held that police questioning in an airport terminal may not be an unconstitutional seizure when there is consent. For example, in <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983) (plurality opinion), the court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">[L]aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, by putting questions to him if the person is willing to listen, or by offering in evidence in a criminal prosecution his voluntary answers to such questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Florida v. Bostick, 501 </em>U.S._, 111 S. Ct. 2382, 2384 (1991), the Court held that \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment permits police officers to approach individuals at random in airport lobbies and other public places to ask them questions and to request consent to search their luggage, so long as the reasonable person would understand that he or she could refuse to cooperate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The State argues th; t there was no constitutional violation under state and federal law because the encounter between Officer Ta\u00f1o and Quino was \u201cconsensual.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Quino, however, argues that he felt compelled to submit to Officer Tano\u2019s questions, and thus did not freely and voluntarily consent to a seizure of his person. He further contends that his alleged voluntary consent could not have been given because he was never informed that he did not have to cooperate with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Waiver of one\u2019s constitutional rights must be freely, voluntarily and intelligently undertaken. Furthermore, it is the government\u2019s burden to prove that the waiver was voluntary and uncoerced. <em>See State v. Pau\u2018u, </em>72 Haw. 505, 509, 824 P.2d 833, 835 (1992) (citations omitted). This court has previously held that an officer has no affirmative duty to inform a person approached for questioning that he is free to leave the encounter at any time; however, failure to inform is a factor to be considered in evaluating whether consent has been freely and voluntarily given. <em>Nakamoto v. Fasi, </em>64 Haw. at 21, 635 P.2d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that Quino did not voluntarily and intelligently agree to be detained. By approaching the group of men and failing to disclose that they were free to go at any time, the officers were concealing their <em>investigative </em>objective precisely to gain Quino\u2019s \u201cconsent.\u201d We note that the officers did not volunteer information that they were investigating drug trafficking at the time they announced their office. Consent, based upon such material nondisclosures, can hardly be viewed as either voluntary or intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Moreover, the State cannot rely on Quino\u2019s acquiescence to establish that he voluntarily consented to the seizure of his person. <em>See Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548-49 (1968) (footnotes omitted) (Court held that the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving that consent was freely and voluntarily given cannot be discharged by showing no more than an acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority). Here, Quino\u2019s submission to the officers\u2019 requests cannot be deemed consensual. Because the State has failed to meet its burden of proof that consent was voluntary and uncoerced, we hold that Quino\u2019s seizure was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We cannot allow the police to randomly \u201cencounter\u201d individuals without any objective basis for suspecting them of misconduct and then place them in a coercive environment in order to develop reasonable suspicion to justify their detention. This investigative technique is based on the proposition that an otherwise innocent person, who comes under police scrutiny for no good reason, is not innocent unless he or she convinces the police that he or she is. Such a procedure is anathema to our constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tional freedoms. For these reasons, we hold that the police conduct violated Quino\u2019s right to be secure against unreasonable seizures guaranteed by article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ara\">On the briefs:</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6t\"><em>Theodore Y.H.

But in light of the surreal and Orwellian world of <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491 (1983), <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 111 S. Ct. 1547 (1991), and <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. _, 111 S. Ct. 2382 (1991), in which the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution seems to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>atrophied to the condition of a vestigial organ, I believe that more needs to be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> protects people from unreasonable government intrusions into their legitimate expectations of privacy. <em>State v. Clark, </em>65 Haw. 488, 493, 654 P.2d 355, 359 (1982); see <em>also State v. Fields, </em>67 Haw. 268, 282, 686 P.2d 1379, 1390 (1984). And, as \u201cthe ultimate judicial tribunal in this state,\u201d this court has final, unreviewable authority to interpret and enforce the Hawaii Constitution. <em>Fields, </em>67 Haw. at 282, 686 P.2d at 1390.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The basic purpose . . . [of these constitutional provisions] is to safeguard the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by government officials.\u2019 <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967). The constitutional proscription . .. that the person and effects of an individuals [sic] are considered to be sacrosanct and may not be the object of unreasonable searches and seizures ... draws no distinction in its application between an individual suspected of criminal activity and one who is not.\u201d <em>Nakamoto v. Fasi, </em>64 Haw. 17, 20, 635 P.2d 946, 950 (1981) (brackets in original). Thus, article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution was \u201cdesigned to protect the individual from arbitrary, oppressive, and harassing conduct on the part of government officials.\u201d <em>Fasi, </em>64 Haw. at 23, 635 P.2d at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In <em>State v. Melear, </em>63 Haw. 488, 630 P.2d 619 (1981), this court delineated the circumstances under which the police may properly conduct an investigative stop of an individual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">It is well established that a law enforcement officer may \u201cin appropriate circumstances and in [an] appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(1968); <em>State v. Barnes, </em>58 Haw. 333, 337, 568 P.2d 1207, 1211 (1977). We stated in <em>State v. Barnes, supra, </em>at 338, 568 P.2d at 1211:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">To justify an investigative stop, short of an arrest based on probable cause, \u201cthe police officer must be able to point to <em>specific and articulable facts </em>which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d The ultimate test in these situations [is] whether [] a man of reasonable caution would be warranted in <em>believing that criminal activity was afoot </em>and that the action taken was appropriate. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">63 Haw. at 493, 630 P.2d at 624 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">It is precisely because article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution was designed, among other things, \u201c \u2018to safeguard the privacy ... of individuals against arbitrary invasions\u2019 \u201d and \u201carbitrary, oppressive, and harassing conduct\u201d by the police, <em>Fasi, </em>64 Haw. at 20, 23, 635 P.2d at 950, 952, that we have conditioned an investigative stop on the police officer\u2019s capacity \u201c \u2018to point to specific and articulable facts ...\u2019 [warranting a reasonable belief] that criminal activity [is] afoot.\u201d <em>Melear, </em>63 Haw. at 493, 630 P.2d at 624. To require otherwise would be to invite the very sort of \u201cstaged\u201d and \u201cpretextual\u201d police-citizen encounter that occurred in the present case and that the majority has described and disapproved so eloquently. Such charades do indeed permit the police to seize individuals, <em>see Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16 (1968), at random and require them to convince the officers of their innocence of wrongdoing. They also potentially permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>police to sanitize an unlawful, suspicionless \u201cencounter\u201d by construing the subject\u2019s non-cooperation as \u201csuspicious\u201d or \u201cflight\u201d and then claiming \u201cprobable cause\u201d to arrest. <em>Cf Melear, </em>63 Haw. at 494, 630 P.2d at 625; <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 66-67 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">I agree with the majority that such a state of affairs \u201cis anathema to our constitutional freedoms.\u201d According to the United States Supreme Court, the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution may not be offended, see, <em>e.g., Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at_, 111 S. Ct. at 2384, 2386, but, in my view, article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution certainly is.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\"> Article I, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">The right of the people to be <em>secure in their persons, </em>houses, papers and effects <em>against unreasonable </em>searches, <em>seizures and invasions of privacy </em>shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched <em>and the persons </em>or things <em>to be seized </em>or the communications sought to be intercepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">(Emphasis added.)

The Convention\u2019s Standing Committee Report No. 55 stated: \u201cThe proposed amendment is intended to include protection against indiscriminate wire-tapping <em>as well as undue government inquiry into and regulation of those areas of a person\u2019s life which is [sic] defined as necessary to insure \u2018man\u2019s individuality and human dignity.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\"> In <em>State v.
