(Eyecor) are lessor and lessee, respectively, of a parcel of land underlying 419A Atkinson Drive in Honolulu. Respondent-appellant Atkinson Tower, Inc. (Tower) is a cooperative housing corporation and Eyecor\u2019s sublessee. As the result of a rental dispute between Excelsior and Eyecor, an arbitration proceeding provided for in the lease agreement was held, resulting in an award in favor of Excelsior. Excelsior then moved for confirmation of the arbitration award by the circuit court. The motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Eyecor, joined by its sublessee Tower, appealed the circuit court\u2019s confirmation of the arbitration award, along with several other orders issued by the court. On appeal, Eyecor essentially claims that the arbitration award should not have been confirmed because the arbitrators had failed to apply Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) (1985), which governs the amount of lease rent payable by cooperative housing corporations (hereinafter, Eyecor\u2019s \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) claim/issue). Excelsior contends that HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) was not applicable to the dispute in issue; however, even if it were, Excelsior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>maintains that Eyecor\u2019s \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) claim was not timely raised under HRS chapter 658, the arbitration and award statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) held<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that HRS \u00a7 519 \u2014 3(a)(2) was applicable to the dispute and that Eyecor had properly raised the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) issue in its appeal. Therefore, the ICA vacated the trial court\u2019s order confirming the award and remanded the case for a determination as to whether the arbitrators had, in fact, applied the statute. We granted Excelsior\u2019s application for a writ of certiorari to review the ICA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">We conclude that Eyecor failed to timely challenge the arbitration award under the arbitration and award statute, HRS chapter 658. We also conclude that because of such failure, Eyecor was precluded from raising the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) issue in its appeal. We therefore reverse the decision of the ICA and affirm the trial court\u2019s confirmation of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Excelsior owns the land underlying 419A Atkinson Drive in Honolulu. On March 20, 1957, Excelsior and Eyecor\u2019s predecessor-in-interest entered into a written lease with a fixed rental rate for the first twenty years. The lease further provided that, following the initial twenty-year period, the rent for each subsequent ten-year period would be by agreement. If the parties were unable to agree, the lease provided that each shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqZc\">choose an appraiser and these two shall choose a third appraiser. All such appraisers shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>recognized and qualified appraisers. . . . The appraisers shall deduct from the value found by them the total amount of buildings erected by the Lessees and also any improvement assessments or charges which shall have been levied against the demised premises and paid by the Lessees or for which the Lessees are required to reimburse the Lessor under the terms of this lease. The value found by a majority of the appraisers, less said deductions, shall be deemed the \u201cappraised value\u201d for the purposes of their determining the rental [under the lease].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On October 10, 1958, Eyecor\u2019s predecessor-in-interest subleased the property to Atkinson Building, Inc. On October 10,1960, Atkinson Building assigned its sublessee interest to Tower, a cooperative housing corporation. Excelsior consented in writing to each of these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The sublease between Eyecor and Tower provided for a profit to Eyecor for the first twenty years. Following that period, the sublease provided that Tower would pay to Eyecor the amount negotiated under the master lease between Eyecor and Excelsior, and that Eyecor would then pay that amount to Excelsior. Eyecor was to make no profit on the sublease after the first twenty years. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the sublease, Eyecor irrevocably appointed Tower its agent for all subsequent rent negotiations with Excelsior on the master lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Meanwhile, in 1982, the Hawaii State legislature enacted HRS \u00a7 519-3, which, among other matters, imposed a ceiling on the amount of rent payable by a lessee or sublessee that is a cooperative housing corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">When the time for setting the rent between Excelsior and Eyecor for the period 1987-1997 arrived, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>conducted lengthy lease rent negotiations, but were unable to agree on an amount. Excelsior then attempted to invoke the arbitration procedure provided for in the master lease; however, Eyecor objected and refused to proceed through such arbitration. Therefore, Excelsior, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> moved for an order to compel arbitration according to the agreement contained in the master lease. In opposition to the motion, Eyecor<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> maintained that the rent ceiling requirement of HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) applied because of its sublessee Tower\u2019s status as a cooperative housing corporation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Excelsior, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>hand, argued that the statute did not apply to rent negotiations under the <em>lease </em>between Excelsior and <em>Eyecor </em>because Eyecor is not a cooperative housing corporation. On April 3,1990, the court granted Excelsior\u2019s motion and entered an order compelling the parties to follow the master lease arbitration procedure. Eyecor did not appeal this order, and the arbitration process went forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">A year later, on April 4, 1991, Eyecor filed a motion seeking a ruling that HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) precluded the arbitrators from setting a rental amount in excess of \u201cthe amount derived by multiplying the \u2018owner\u2019s basis\u2019 by the original percentage rate.\u201d HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2). On April 24, 1991, the trial court ruled \u201cby way of clarification and for the limited purposes of the arbitration between Excelsior Lodge and Eyecor, that [the rent ceiling requirement of] HRS \u00a7 519-3 is not applicable\u201d (hereinafter, the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">On April 26, 1991, the arbitrators awarded Excelsior an annual rent of $169,200. On that same day, Excelsior moved for an order confirming the arbitration award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 6, 1991, Eyecor filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order. Eyecor concurrently filed a notice of appeal<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> regarding the order compelling arbitration and the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order. We subsequently dismissed that appeal because: 1) the order compelling arbitration was untimely appealed;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 2) the appeal of the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order was premature because the trial court had yet to rule on Eyecor\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On June 10,1991, the trial court entered an order confirming the April 26, 1991 arbitration award (confirmation order). On June 24, 1991 Eyecor timely appealed this confirmation order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On October 1, 1991, the trial court denied Eyecor\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order (reconsideration order). On October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>15, 1991, Eyecor filed a second notice of appeal<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the following four trial court orders: 1) the order compelling arbitration; 2) the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order; 3) the confirmation order; and 4) the reconsideration order. Both appeals were consolidated and assigned to the ICA for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The ICA concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over Eyecor\u2019s first appeal, but took jurisdiction over Eyecor\u2019s second appeal<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and ruled that: 1) the order compelling arbitration was \u201cnot a final and appealable order;\u201d 2) the order denying Eyecor\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the \u00a7 519 \u2014 3(a)(2) order was within the ICA\u2019s appellate jurisdiction; 3) HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2)\u2019s rent ceiling requirement did apply to the arbitration proceeding; and 4) therefore, the order confirming the arbitration award must be vacated and the case remanded for a determination whether the arbitrators had applied HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) in arriving at their award. The ICA also stated that if the arbitrators had failed to apply HRS \u00a7 519 \u2014 3(a)(2), then Eyecor would be entitled to an order vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Excelsior filed an application for a writ of certiorari in this court seeking our review of the ICA\u2019s decision, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">A. Confirmation of the Arbitration Award</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">1. The Arbitration and Award Statute, HRS Chapter 658</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Eyecor\u2019s principal contention throughout the circuit court level proceedings and on appeal has been that the rent ceiling provision of HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) should apply to its rent dispute with Excelsior. On the other hand, Excelsior argues that Eyecor is precluded from raising its \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) claim in this appeal because any challenge to a circuit court\u2019s confirmation of an arbitration award is specifically controlled by the provisions of HRS chapter 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Excelsior points out that HRS \u00a7 658-8<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> requires that the trial court confirm an arbitration award, <em>\u201cunless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed in sections 658-9 and 658-10.\u201d </em>HRS \u00a7 658-8 (emphasis added). HRS \u00a7 658-9 provides only four specific grounds upon which an award can be vacated,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>HRS \u00a7 658-10 provides only three grounds for modifying or correcting an award.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Additionally, HRS \u00a7 658-11 provides that \u201c[njotice of a motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award [under HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-9 and 658-10], shall be served . . . upon the adverse party or the adverse party\u2019s attorney <em>within ten days after the award is made and served.\u201d </em>HRS \u00a7 658 \u2014 11 (1985) (emphasis added). Excelsior notes that Eyecor failed to timely serve either a \u00a7 658-9 motion to vacate or a \u00a7 658-10 motion to modify or correct the award in this case. Therefore, Excelsior submits that the trial court was required to confirm the award, and Eyecor now has no right to appeal the confirmation order because it failed to timely challenge the award in the only manner provided in the arbitration and award statute, HRS chapter 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The ICA, relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Gozum v. American International Adjustment Co., </em>72 Haw. 41, 805 P.2d 445 (1991), ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">[a] party who disagrees with an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrators have exceeded their powers has two opportunities to challenge it. First, the party may file an HRS \u00a7 658-9 application to vacate the award and serve it as required by HRS \u00a7 658-11. Second, the party may wait until the other party applies pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-8 to confirm the award and then challenge the confirmation motion pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\"><em>Excelsior Lodge, </em>9 Haw. App. at 365, 847 P.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The ICA\u2019s reliance on <em>Gozum </em>is misplaced. We acknowledge that one comment in dictum might suggest that a trial court could vacate, modify, or correct an award at a \u00a7 658-8 confirmation hearing. However, the specific holding in <em>Gozum </em>was that a party would not be barred from asking for a <em>clarification </em>of an arbitrator\u2019s award at a \u00a7 658-8 confirmation hearing, even though that party had failed to bring a timely motion under either HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-9 or 658-10. <em>Gozum, </em>72 Haw. at 45-46, 805 P.2d at 447. Moreover, we pointed out that the notice provision of HRS \u00a7 658-11 applied when a party wished to change the substance or the amount of an award, but not when a party merely asked for clarification of an ambiguous award. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 805 P.2d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">In <em>Association of Apartment Owners of Tropicana Manor v. Jeffers, </em>73 Haw. 201, 830 P.2d 503 (1992), this court, citing <em>Gozum, </em>again ruled that a request for clarification of an arbitration award, which did not seek to change the substance or amount of that award, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>could avoid the ten-day service requirement of HRS \u00a7 658-11. In <em>Jeffers, </em>the parties on one side of an arbitrated dispute who had not moved to vacate, modify, or correct an award sought to re-open the arbitration process for what they termed a \u201cclarification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 830 P.2d at 510. However, this court concluded that the parties were actually seeking a modification or correction of the award \u201cin the guise of a clarification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212-14, 830 P.2d at 510-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We reiterated in <em>Jeffers </em>that in order to change an award under HRS chapter 658, a party must timely move either to vacate the award under HRS \u00a7 658-9 or to modify or correct it under HRS \u00a7 658-10. <em>Id. </em>at 213, 830 P.2d at 510. We also noted that \u201c[i]n <em>Gozum, </em>we distinguished an arbitrator\u2019s clarification of an ambiguous award from a court\u2019s vacation, modification, or correction of an award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We specifically stated, in <em>Jeffers, </em>that \u201c[implicit in our decision in <em>Gozum </em>to allow the arbitrator\u2019s clarification was the understanding that the total amount the insureds could recover would remain [the same amount] which appeared on the face of the award. <em>Clearly, the clarification would not have changed the amount of the award.\u201d Id. </em>at 214, 830 P.2d at 511 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In this case, Eyecor is seeking a substantial change in the arbitration award. According to Eyecor\u2019s position, the annual rent, which the arbitrators determined to be $169,200, would not have exceeded $82,500 had the statutory formula prescribed in HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) been applied. It is obvious that Eyecor is seeking more than a mere \u201cclarification,\u201d as that term is used in <em>Gozum </em>and <em>Jeffers, </em>but rather a substantive change of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Thus, we conclude that because Eyecor failed to timely bring either a \u00a7 658-9 motion to vacate or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u00a7 658 \u2014 10 motion to modify or correct the award and because it is seeking more than a mere clarification, Eyecor is precluded from challenging the trial court\u2019s confirmation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">2. HRS \u00a7658-15</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In addition to relying on <em>Gozum </em>for authority to vacate the trial court\u2019s confirmation order, the ICA specifically cites to HRS \u00a7 658-15 (1985), seemingly in the context of its authority to review the trial court\u2019s April 3,1990 order to compel arbitration, despite Eyecor\u2019s failure to timely appeal that order. <em>Excelsior Lodge, </em>9 Haw. App. at 363-64, 847 P.2d at 672. Although the precise purpose for citing to HRS \u00a7 658-15 is unclear, we believe that the reference implies that HRS \u00a7 658-15 somehow confers upon appellate courts general authority to review trial court orders under HRS chapter 658, including the confirmation order, even though Eyecor failed to timely bring either a \u00a7 658-9 or a \u00a7 658-10 motion. Assuming we apprehend the ICA\u2019s implication correctly, we believe it is necessary to discuss this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">HRS \u00a7 658 \u2014 15 provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]nless the agreement for award provides that no appeal may be taken[,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] <em>an appeal may be taken </em>from an order vacating an award, or <em>from a judgment entered upon an award, as from an order or judgment in an actionf.f </em>HRS \u00a7 658-15 (1985) (emphasis added). Under HRS \u00a7 658-12, the filing of an order confirming an arbitration award \u201cshall constitute the entry of judgment.\u201d HRS \u00a7 658-12 (1985). \u201cThe judgment entered in accordance with section 658-12 has the same force and effect, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>all respects as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in an action[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 658-14 (1985). Therefore, an order by the trial court granting a motion to confirm an award can arguably be appealed in the same manner as any other \u201corder or judgment in an action,\u201d pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-12, 658-14, and 658-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">However, this court has set strict limits to the authority of an appellate court reviewing a confirmation order under HRS \u00a7 658-15. In <em>Mars Constructors, Inc. v. Tropical Enterprises, Ltd., </em>51 Haw. 332, 460 P.2d 317 (1969), Tropical Enterprises, Ltd. (Tropical) moved to have an arbitration award modified or corrected pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-10. After a hearing, the trial court implicitly denied the motion, ruling instead that the award be confirmed. The trial court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">the award of the arbitrators would be confirmed even though they \u201cmay have erred in the determination of fact and even the application of the law,\u201d because under the provision of HRS \u00a7 658 \u2014 10, the court\u2019s power to review and correct or modify arbitration awards is limited and the grounds urged by the appellant for modifying or correcting the arbitration award were neither of the three grounds provided for by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Id. at 334,460 P.2d at 318. Tropical appealed pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-15. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Tropical pointed out that HRS \u00a7 658-15 gives a party the right to appeal an arbitration award unless the arbitration agreement provided that no appeal could be taken, which was not the case in <em>Mars. </em>Tropical also noted that HRS \u00a7 641-2 generally authorizes this court to affirm, reverse, or modify a trial court judgment, and \u201cto correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>any error appearing on the record.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Tropical concluded that this court\u2019s authority under HRS \u00a7 658-15 must be co-extensive with its general authority under HRS \u00a7 641-2. Implicit in Tropical\u2019s claim was the contention that because HRS \u00a7 658-15 apparently allows a party to appeal an arbitration award \u201cas from an order or judgment in an action,\u201d this court must have the same general authority to review an award under HRS \u00a7 658-15 that it does under HRS \u00a7 641-2 to review any other \u201cjudgment, order, or decree of a circuit court... in a civil matter.\u201d HRS \u00a7 641-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This court responded to Tropical\u2019s argument by summarizing in detail the policy underlying the Arbitration and Award Statute, HRS chapter 658, and the reasons for strictly constraining judicial review of arbitration awards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aro\">It is generally considered that parties resort to arbitration to settle disputes more expeditiously and inexpensively than by a court action ----[I]t must be deemed that the primary purpose of arbitration is to avoid litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">In furtherance of this objective, our legislature enacted the Arbitration and Awards statute, HRS, Ch. 658. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>. . . This court has decided to confine judicial review [of awards under the statute] to the strictest possible limits. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">... [W]e believe an extensive judicial review of arbitration awards would frustrate the intent of the parties to avoid litigation and would also nullify the legislative objective in the enactment of the Arbitration and Awards statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 460 P.2d at 318-19 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The <em>Mars </em>court then directly confronted Tropical\u2019s contention that HRS \u00a7 658-15, in tandem with HRS \u00a7 641 \u2014 2, gives this court authority to review a confirmation award to the same extent as any other judgment and concluded that it does not. Instead, the court held that appellate courts reviewing a \u00a7 658-8 confirmation award under HRS \u00a7 658-15 are restricted to a consideration of the seven specific grounds included in HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-9 and 658-10:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">We believe that the legislative intent in \u00a7 658-9 and \u00a7 658-10 was to restrict and curtail all judicial review of arbitration awards and not only review by circuit courts, and we hold that \u00a7 658-9 and \u00a7 658-10 also restrict the authority of this court to review judgments entered by circuit courts confirming the arbitration awards pursuant to the provisions of the Arbitration and Awards statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 336, 460 P.2d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The <em>Mars </em>court held that, even if the arbitrators had made mistakes in the determination of fact or in the application of law, the trial court\u2019s review was necessarily limited by the three specific grounds provided by HRS \u00a7 658-10, and none of those grounds was at issue. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>Mars </em>court thus refused to review the trial court\u2019s judgment even though Tropical had timely served a \u00a7 658-10 motion prior to its appeal of the arbitration award under HRS \u00a7 658-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In the present case, the ICA considered one of Eyecor\u2019s substantive arguments, despite its failure to bring a motion under either \u00a7\u00a7 658-9 or 658-10. We believe the policy reasons for strict constraints over judicial review of arbitration awards, which led to this court\u2019s refusal in <em>Mars </em>to review the trial court\u2019s confirmation order, compel us to refuse to consider Eyecor\u2019s appeal of the confirmation order in this case, where, unlike the appellant in <em>Mars, </em>Eyecor has completely failed to avail itself of the proper statutory mechanisms for challenging the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We now expressly hold that a party who seeks to change an arbitration award, but fails to follow the specific statutory provisions for challenging the award by timely bringing a motion under either \u00a7\u00a7 658-9 or 658-10, is foreclosed from subsequently appealing a \u00a7 658-8 confirmation order under HRS \u00a7 658-15.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To allow a party a second chance at litigation after it has conspicuously failed to comply with the specific statutory provisions available for challenging an award would frustrate the clear policy of facilitating the legislative objectives behind the arbitration and award statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that the ICA erred in utilizing Eyecor\u2019s \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) claim to vacate the trial court\u2019s order granting Excelsior\u2019s \u00a7 658-8 motion to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">B. Eyecor\u2019s \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Eyecor has also appealed both the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order and the order denying Eyecor\u2019s motion for reconsideration of that ruling. As stated previously, Eyecor\u2019s principal contention has been that HRS \u00a7 519 \u2014 3(a)(2) should apply to its rent dispute with Excelsior.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> According to the ICA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">HRS \u00a7 519-3[(a)(2)] imposes a ceiling on the amount of the [s]ublease rent legally due from [Tower] to [Eyecor]. The question is whether HRS \u00a7 519-3[(a)(2)] imposes an identical ceiling on the amount of the [l]ease rent legally due from [Eyecor] to [Excelsior]. If it does not, [Eyecor] may be legally obligated to pay [Excelsior] more [l]ease rent than the [s]ublease rent it is legally entitled to collect from [Tower].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Excelsior Lodge, </em>9 Haw. App. at 366, 847 P.2d at 673. However, Excelsior argues that Eyecor\u2019s appeal of this issue has essentially been mooted by the trial court\u2019s order confirming the arbitration award. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We have determined that because Eyecor failed to timely challenge the arbitration award, the trial court was required to grant Excelsior\u2019s \u00a7 658-8 motion to confirm. Additionally, we have concluded that Eyecor is foreclosed from attempting to change the award by appealing the confirmation order under HRS \u00a7 658-15. Eyecor has no remaining avenue by which it can challenge the trial court\u2019s confirmation order. Even if it were to prevail on its appeal of the \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) order, or on its appeal of the order denying its motion for reconsideration of that ruling, Eyecor could not use that decision to challenge the award itself. Therefore, Eyecor\u2019s appeals of both orders are moot. However, we believe it is necessary to point out that the ICA\u2019s interpretation of HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) and its applicability to this case should not be understood as stating the law on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The ICA held that the language of HRS \u00a7 519 \u2014 3(a)(2) unambiguously</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">imposes a ceiling on the amount of the rent legally due <em>all along the entire strata or chain from the sublessee cooperative housing corporation to the lessor. </em>It imposes a ceiling on the amount of the sublease rent legally due from the sublesseecooperative housing corporation to the lesseesublessor and it imposes the same ceiling on the lease rent legally due from the lessee-sublessor to the lessor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>Excelsior Lodge, </em>9 Haw. App. at 366, 847 P.2d at 673 (emphasis added). By its express language, HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u00a7 519-3(a)(2) is clearly meant to govern circumstances in which a lease or a sublease provides for renegotiations of lease rent terms, and a cooperative housing corporation is either the lessee under the lease, or the sublessee under the sublease. However, the plain language of the statute does <em>not </em>expressly provide for the situation in the case at bar, where the renegotiation is pursuant to a master lease between a lessor, Excelsior, and a lessee, Eyecor, which does not itself come under HRS \u00a7 519-3, but whose <em>agent </em>for the lease rent renegotiations, Tower, happens to be a cooperative housing corporation. Neither does the plain language of HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) provide that a <em>sublessee\u2019s </em>status as a cooperative housing corporation will automatically apply to lease rent negotiations under <em>a master lease </em>between a lessee who is not a cooperative housing corporation and the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Furthermore, we believe the ICA\u2019s interpretation of HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) arguably raises constitutional issues. According to the ICA, the amount of lease rent payable by Eyecor to Excelsior could be reduced by more than one-half of the arbitration award or could be limited to less than one-half of the award, thereby resulting in the possible taking of Excelsior\u2019s property without due process and/or the denial of equal protection under the law. Without resolving these constitutional questions, we conclude the ICA failed to adequately demonstrate that HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) should have been applied to the arbitration proceedings in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">C. The Order Compelling Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Eyecor has also appealed the trial court\u2019s order compelling arbitration in this case pursuant to HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u00a7 658-3.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As previously noted, the ICA held that the order to compel arbitration was not final and thus was not an appealable order. <em>Excelsior Lodge, </em>9 Haw. App. at 363-64, 847 P.2d at 672. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In <em>Association of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., </em>68 Haw. 98, 705 P.2d 28 (1985), this court held that orders compelling arbitration under HRS \u00a7 658-3 are appealable orders within the contemplation of HRS \u00a7 641-1(a) (appeals in civil actions). The <em>Swinerton </em>court determined that there exists a small class of orders, including those under HRS \u00a7 658-3, which \u201cfinally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 705 P.2d at 34 (citation omitted); <em>see also Koolau Radiology, Inc. v. Queen\u2019s Medical Ctr., </em>73 Haw. 433, 834 P.2d 1294 (1992); <em>Westin Hotel Co. v. Universal Inv., Inc., </em>72 Haw. 178, 179-80, 811 P.2d 467, 468 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Eyecor contends that it can validly appeal the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 658-3 order in the present case according to the ICA\u2019s decision in <em>Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird &amp; Co., </em>7 Haw. App. 598, 789 P.2d 501, <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>denied, </em>71 Haw. 668, 833 P.2d 900 (1990), where the ICA held that an unappealed \u2014 though independently appealable \u2014 collateral order, such as one under HRS \u00a7 658-3, can be considered by an appellate court reviewing a final judgment in the same case. In <em>Kukui Nuts, </em>the appellant argued that although it had failed to timely appeal certain independently appealable collateral orders, the ICA could still review them on an appeal from the final judgment in the same case. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 789 P.2d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The ICA noted that the authorities are split on the propriety of allowing the review of unappealed collateral orders from a final judgment. The ICA then cited with favor the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">Any rule that requires forfeiture of appellate opportunities for guessing wrong about an unclear rule would greatly increase the costs of the collateral order doctrine by forcing protective appeals in many situations of doubtful appealability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 617, 789 P.2d at 514 (citing 15 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, <em>Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 3911 at 498-99 (1976)). The ICA proceeded to hold that \u201cwhere relief can be afforded from the terms of a collateral order upon appeal from the final judgment, the collateral order may be reviewed at that time, and the right to appeal the collateral order is not forfeited because it was not appealed from when it was entered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">However, in this case, Eyecor is foreclosed from appealing the trial court\u2019s order compelling arbitration because it had appealed that decision once before. On May 6,1991, Eyecor filed a notice of appeal,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the propriety of the trial court\u2019s April 3, 1990 order compelling arbitration. This court subsequently dismissed that appeal as untimely because Eyecor had waited until well beyond the thirty-day limit mandated by Hawaii Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) to bring its appeal. Therefore, because the ICA\u2019s ruling in <em>Kukui Nuts </em>specifically addressed collateral orders that were not originally appealed, Eyecor\u2019s reliance on that ruling to appeal the order compelling arbitration is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We now take this occasion to restrict the broad authority seemingly conferred on reviewing courts by the ICA\u2019s ruling in <em>Kukui Nuts. </em>In the present case, the rationale of <em>Kukui Nuts </em>may have justified appellate review of a hypothetical collateral order on appeal from a final judgment on the basis that not to do so would tend to \u201cforc[e] protective appeals in many situations of <em>doubtful </em>appealability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). However, as the foregoing discussion of <em>Swinerton </em>demonstrates, there is nothing doubtful in this jurisdiction about the appealability of \u00a7 658-3 orders to compel arbitration. Indeed, Eyecor itself appealed the April 3, 1990 order, albeit more than a year late. The policies that have moved this court to constrain judicial review of arbitration awards within the strictest possible limits likewise militate against giving a party who has failed to appeal a \u00a7 658-3 order a second chance to attack it on an appeal of a confirmation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Given its principal claim that the provisions of HRS \u00a7 519-3(a)(2) apply to the instant arbitration, Eyecor should have immediately appealed the trial court\u2019s initial decision to compel arbitration in order to have the issue settled at the most opportune time in the dispute. Instead, Eyecor in effect sat on its hands and allowed the arbitration process to proceed for more than a year before it again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>decided to challenge the process on the same grounds it had argued to the trial court prior to the \u00a7 658-3 order to compel arbitration.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ac8\">On the briefs:</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AT\"><em>G. Stephen Elisha, Philip L. Lahne, </em>and <em>Richard S. Ekimoto </em>(Dinman, Nakamura, Elisha &amp; Lahne) for Respondents-Appellants Eyecor, Ltd. and Atkinson Tower, Inc.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Apz\"><em>Rosemary T. Fazio </em>and <em>Keith Yonamine </em>(Ashford &amp; Wriston) for Applicant-Appellee Excelsior Lodge Number One, Independent Order of Odd Fellows.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">This court will not countenance procedures that allow parties to frustrate the policies and legislative objectives behind the arbitration and award statute. We therefore hold that a reviewing court shall not consider an unappealed \u00a7 658-3 order compelling arbitration on an appeal from a final judgment in the same case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Based on the foregoing, we reverse the ICA\u2019s decision and affirm the circuit court\u2019s June 10,1991 order granting Excelsior\u2019s motion for confirmation of the April 26, 1991 award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\"> <em>See Excelsior Lodge v.

We also note that although the parties were unable to agree on a renegotiated lease rent and although there was a disagreement regarding the arbitrator designated by Eyecor, Eyecor did not raise subsection b\u2019s requirement that the dispute be arbitrated by \u201cthe housing finance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>development corporation or its designee,\u201d <em>id., </em>at the trial level or on appeal. However, in its supplemental brief in opposition to Excelsior\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, Eyecor contends that the arbitrators \u201cdid not have subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute\u201d because \u201cthe legislature granted exclusive jurisdiction to arbitrate the amount of lease rent pursuant to a statutory formula to the Hawaii Housing Authority and later to the housing finance and development corporation.\u201d Eyecor\u2019s assertion that HRS \u00a7 519-3 applied to the dispute at the trial level and on appeal has been limited to the statute\u2019s rental ceiling requirement. Consistent with its position, Eyecor participated in the selection of private arbitrators in accordance with the master lease\u2019s arbitration clause. Moreover, we believe that the legislature did not intend that parties subject to HRS \u00a7 519-3 could not voluntarily agree to utilize arbitrators of their choice. We view the requirement of HRS \u00a7 519 \u2014 3(b) to apply in situations where the parties have not previously agreed to an arbitrator selection procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> HRS \u00a7 658-8 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">At any time within one year after the award is made and served, any party to the arbitration may apply to the circuit court specified in the agreement, or if none is specified, to the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the arbitration was had, for an order confirming the award.
