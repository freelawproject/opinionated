Moses Akiona, Ltd., </em>45 Haw. 440, 369 P.2d 114 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Defendant-Appellee\u2019s motion for reconsideration, or, in the alternative, for clarification, and suggestion of the appropriateness of rebriefing and reargument having been filed in the above-captioned matter on May 17,1993, the motion is hereby granted in part, and the mandate on remand is hereby clarified as follows:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AW-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>Robert A. Marks, </em>Attorney General, and <em>Sonia Faust, </em>Deputy Attorney General, for appellee John C. Lewin.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">Because, for the reasons stated in the plurality opinion filed in the above-captioned matter on May 5,1993, the circuit court erroneously granted Lewin\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the circuit court\u2019s order and judgment are vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the plurality opinion. On remand, in accordance with the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard, the burden will rest on Lewin to overcome the presumption that HRS \u00a7 572-1 is unconstitutional by demonstrating that it furthers compelling state interests and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights. <em>See Nagle v. Board of Educ., </em>63 Haw. 389, 392, 629 P.2d 109, 111 (1981 <em>); Holdman v. Olim, </em>59 Haw. 346, 349, 581 P.2d 1164, 1167 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoY\">Defendant-Appellee\u2019s motion is denied in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Intermediate Court of Appeals Judge Heen, having filed a dissenting opinion in this matter, does not concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\">CONCURRING OPINION BY</p>\n<author id=\"An1\">CHIEF JUDGE BURNS</author>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">There are three opinions in this case: (1) LevinsonMoon; (2) Burns; and (3) Heen-Hayashi. Appellee Lewin disagrees with the Levinson \u2014 Moon and Burns opinions and seeks reconsideration of both. With respect to the Levinson-Moon opinion, I concur with the decision by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Justice Levinson and Chief Justice Moon to grant the motion in part. With respect to the Bums opinion, I deny the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Alternatively, appellee Lewin seeks clarification of this court\u2019s mandate. The only agreement by a majority of this court is that this case involves genuine issues of material fact. In my view, that is this court\u2019s mandate. Thus far, there is no majority agreement as to what these issues are or which side has the burden to prove them. Presented with this chance to write more than I have already written in the Bums opinion about these issues and burdens, I choose to wait for the next appeal. At that time, hopefully, there will be: a complete record of a trial in which the parties have presented their evidence and arguments and the trial court has made its decisions of fact and law; and opening, answering and reply briefs fully discussing the issues and the applicable law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
