(AIG) does not require AIG to defend and indemnify the defendants limar Godinez (Godinez) and/or Emanuel Vilamor (Vilamor) for bodily injury claims (the tort claim) arising out of the August 6, 1989 death of Nelson Caraang (Nelson).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment declaring that AIG does not have a duty to defend and indemnify Godinez under the policy and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the Caraangs and against AIG. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The facts of the present c\u00e1se are undisputed. On the night of August 6,1989, Godinez drove Vilamor to a party in a 1986 Ford Ranger Pickup (the truck) owned by Godinez\u2019s father (Bonifacio) and stepmother (Cathy). The truck was a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the policy. Pursuant to the policy, which provides bodily injury liability coverage (liability coverage) of $35,000.00 per person, AIG agreed to pay compensatory damages for bodily injury for which any \u201ccovered person\u201d becomes legally responsible because of an \u201cauto accident.\u201d The policy defines a \u201ccovered person\u201d to include the \u201cnamed insureds\u201d \u2014 Bonifacio and Cathy \u2014 and any \u201cfamily member\u201d for the \u201cownership, maintenance or use of any auto\u201d and \u201c[a]ny person using [a named insured\u2019s] covered auto with [a named insured\u2019s] permission.\u201d The policy contains an intentional act exclusion that denies liability coverage to \u201cany person who intentionally causes bodily injury . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">After remaining at the party for about ten minutes, Godinez drove Vilamor to the house of a friend. While at the house, Vilamor \u201cdid drugs.\u201d Following a telephone call, Vilamor asked Godinez to drive him to the Fernandez Fun Factory in Waikiki in order to meet the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">After leaving the Fernandez Fun Factory, Godinez drove Vilamor through Waikiki. While doing so, Godinez and Vilamor observed Nelson driving on Kuhio Avenue. There was a great deal of animosity between Vilamor and Nelson because Sherry Baclaan, Vilamor\u2019s former girl friend, had \u201cbroken up\u201d with him in order to \u201cgo with\u201d Nelson. About a week before the night of the incident, a dispute had taken place at Sherry Baclaan\u2019s home, during which Vilamor had \u201cpulled\u201d a small gun on Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>As Godinez and Vilamor passed Nelson\u2019s vehicle, Nelson began to follow the truck and yell at them. Nelson shouted taunts peppered with profanity at Vilamor, proclaiming that he had a bigger gun than Vilamor and daring Vilamor to have a \u201cshoot out.\u201d Vilamor instructed Godinez to keep driving; although Godinez attempted to elude Nelson, traffic was too heavy for him to do so. Meanwhile, Nelson repeatedly pulled alongside the truck as the two vehicles departed Waikiki onto the H-l Freeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">While on the H-l, Nelson tried to \u201ccut off\u2019 the truck and force it to pull over. Hoping to evade Nelson, Godinez drove the truck onto the Pali Highway exit with Nelson\u2019s vehicle in hot pursuit. Proceeding up the Pali Highway, the truck was in the left-hand lane and Nelson\u2019s vehicle was in the right-hand lane. Nelson continued his exhortations regarding a \u201cshoot out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">As the truck approached the Pali Tunnel, Godinez heard a loud \u201cpop\u201d sounding like a firecracker, turned his head toward Vilamor, and saw him standing on the passenger\u2019s seat with the upper half of his body protruding out of the window. Although Godinez knew that Vilamor owned a gun, Godinez did not know that he had it in his possession until Godinez heard the \u201cpop.\u201d After the \u201cpop,\u201d Vilamor sat down and was silent until Godinez drove the truck back toward Honolulu on the Likelike Highway. Vilamor then informed Godinez that he had shot Nelson. Nelson died as a result of the gunshot wound inflicted by Vilamor.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">On October 13, 1989, AIG filed a complaint for declaratory relief in response to the tort claim asserted by the Caraangs against Godinez and Vilamor for the bodily injury to and death of Nelson. In the complaint, AIG denied any contractual duty to defend or indemnify Godinez and Vilamor on the grounds that: (1) the shooting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>was not an \u201cauto accident\u201d and the policy excluded coverage for any person who intentionally caused bodily injury; and (2) the shooting did not arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">A jury-waived trial was conducted in the circuit court on August 12, 1991. The trial court subsequently rendered the following conclusions of law (COL):<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">1. An insurance company\u2019s obligation to defend and/or indemnify an insured is a purely contractual obligation and consequently depends on the language contained in the applicable insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">2. The terms of the insurance policy should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary and accepted sense in common speech in line with the objectively determined reasonable expectations of a lay person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">3. The shooting death of Nelson . . . did not arise out of an auto accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">4. The shooting death of Nelson . . . did not arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of [the truck].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">5. By shooting Nelson..., defendant Vilamor intentionally caused bodily injury to Nelson ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">6. An automobile insurance carrier\u2019s duty to defend an insured against claims made in the complaint arises when allegations of the complaint raise a \u201cpotentiality\u201d for indemnification of the insured under the terms of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>7.

Because the shooting of Nelson ... did not arise out of an auto accident, defendant Vilamor would not be owed a defense and/or indemnification under [the policy] against claims made against him in [the tort claim] filed by [the Caraangs] for damages that arose out of the shooting death of Nelson ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">11.

The Caraangs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">On appeal, the Caraangs challenge COL Nos. 3 through 13. Specifically, the Caraangs urge that AIG has a duty to defend and indemnify Godinez and Vilamor because: (1) Nelson\u2019s death was accidental; and (2) Nelson\u2019s death arose out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is freely reviewable for its correctness.... A COL that is supported by the trial court\u2019s [find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ings of fact] and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned____However, a COL that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because \u201cthe court\u2019s conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\"><em>Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., </em>74 Haw. 85, 119, 839 P.2d 10, 28-29, <em>reconsideration denied, </em>74 Haw. 650, 843 P.2d 144 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">III. DISCUSSION A. Godinez</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">1. Godinez is a covered person under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Under Part A of the policy, liability coverage extends only to \u201ccovered persons.\u201d Part A defines a \u201ccovered person\u201d in relevant part to include (1) \u201cnamed\u201d insureds (in this case, Bonifacio and Cathy) and \u201cany family member for the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto\u201d and (2) \u201cany person using [the] covered auto with [a named insured\u2019s] permission.\u201d Although the question whether Godinez is a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the policy was never expressly addressed by either the trial court or the parties, it is nevertheless foundational to determining whether AIG has a duty to defend and indemnify Godinez with respect to the tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The policy defines a \u201cfamily member\u201d to include \u201ca person related to [the named insureds] by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of [the named insureds\u2019] household, including a ward or foster child.\u201d It is apparent from the record that Godinez does not qualify as a covered person under this definition. The record reflects that Godinez is related by blood to Bonifacio; however, at the time of the shooting, Godinez was living with his natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>mother, Daylinda Ginelsa, aka Daylinda Godinez (Daylinda). It is uncontroverted that, on August 6,1989, Daylinda was neither a named insured nor related to a named insured by blood, marriage, or adoption and residing in the same household. Therefore, Godinez was not a family member of a named insured at the time of the shooting and cannot qualify as a \u201ccovered person\u201d on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Regarding the question whether Godinez qualifies as a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the policy on the basis that he was \u201cusing\u201d the truck with a named insured\u2019s permission, we note that \u201cuse\u201d is not defined in Part A \u2014 the liability coverage section \u2014 of the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have stated, however, that an insurance contract is construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy. <em>Methven-Abreu v. Hawaiian Ins. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>73 Haw. 385, 390, 834 P.2d 279, <em>283, reconsideration denied, </em>73 Haw. 625, 838 P.2d 860 (1992); <em>see also </em>HRS \u00a7 431:100-237 (1987 Spec. Pamphlet). In this connection, Part G of the policy, the \u201cState of Hawaii Basic No-Fault Endorsement\u201d providing coverage as required under Hawaii\u2019s no-fault law, is instructive. Under Part G, \u201coperation, maintenance, or <em>use </em>. . . with respect to a motor vehicle\u201d is defined to include \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle. (Emphasis added.) <em>Cf </em>HRS \u00a7 431:100-103(13) (1987 Spec. Pamphlet). Construing the policy as a whole, this definition clarifies the meaning of \u201cuse\u201d as employed in Part A to include \u201coccupying\u201d the truck \u2014 a \u201ccovered auto\u201d listed on the declarations page of the policy. Part A further defines the term \u201coccupying\u201d to mean \u201cin, upon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>getting in, on, out or off.\u201d Thus, any person in, upon, getting in, on, out, or off the truck with Bonifacio\u2019s permission on the night of the shooting was a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">It is undisputed that Godinez was driving the truck on the night of August 6,1989. Accordingly, he was \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle and therefore \u201cusing\u201d it. Furthermore, the record clearly indicates that Godinez had permission from Bonifacio to drive the truck.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that Godinez was a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the terms of the policy on August 6, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">2. From Godinez\u2019s viewpoint or perspective, the shooting death of Nelson was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Regarding the events of August 6, 1989, the trial court, <em>inter alia, </em>entered the following unchallenged findings of fact (FOF):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">9. Vilamor told . . . Godinez to keep driving and although . . . <em>Godinez tried to get away from </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>the vehicle driven by Nelson </em>. . . , traffic was too heavy for him to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">10. Nelson . . . kept pulling up along side the [truck] driven by . . . Godinez during which time . . . Godinez was driving out of Waikiki on to the H-l Freeway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">11. While on the freeway, Nelson . . . tried to \u201ccut off\u201d the vehicle driven by... Godinez so as to force . . . Godinez\u2019s vehicle to \u201cpull over.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">12. At that time, . . . <em>Godinez saw the turn for the Pali Highway and took it in the hope of losing . </em>. . <em>Nelson </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">13. Nelson . . . managed to get across the divider and also get on the Pali Highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">14. As the two vehicles proceeded up the Pali Highway, . . . Godinez was in the left-hand lane with Nelsonfs]... vehicle in the right-hand lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">15. As the vehicles proceeded up the Pali Highway, Nelson . . . continued to shout about a \u201cshoot out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">16. As ... Godinez drove toward the Pali Tunnel, he heard a loud \u201cpop\u201d like a firecracker, turned his head and saw... Vilamor standing on a bench seat with the upper half of his body outside the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">17. <em>Godinez </em>knew . . . Vilamor [owned] a gun, but <em>did not </em>know... <em>Vilamor had the gun with him that night until after he heard the . </em>. . <em>\u201cpop.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-14\">18. After the . . . \u201cpop\u201d, . . . Vilamor sat down and said nothing to . . . Godinez until they were proceeding back to Honolulu on the Likelike Highway at which time . . . Vilamor told . . . Godinez that he had shot Nelson ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">It is therefore uncontroverted that: (1) throughout the events preceding the shooting, Godinez was attempting to evade Nelson\u2019s vehicle but failed to do so because of traffic conditions and Nelson\u2019s persistent hot pursuit of the truck; and (2) Godinez was unaware that Vilamor was in possession of a gun until after Vilamor fired it at Nelson and therefore could not possibly have foreseen the shooting or done anything to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Nevertheless, pursuant to COL Nos. 3 and 9, the trial court concluded as a matter of law with respect to Godinez that the shooting death of Nelson did not arise out of an auto accident and, therefore, AIG owed Godinez no duty under the policy to defend or indemnify him in connection with the tort claim. But because the trial court\u2019s undisputed FOF, on which its conclusions of law depend, do not support COL Nos. 3 and 9 regarding Godinez, we hold that these conclusions are clearly erroneous. <em>See Amfac, Inc., </em>74 Haw. at 119, 839 P.2d at 28-29; <em>Coll v. McCarthy, </em>72 Haw. 20, 28, 804 P.2d 881, 886 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We begin our analysis with the observation that \u201c \u2018[insurance policies are governed by statutory requirements in force and effect at the time such policies are written. .. . Such provisions are read into each policy issued thereunder, and become a part of the contract with full binding effect upon each party.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. v.

And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 790 P.2d at 913 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">With respect to bodily injury liability insurance coverage, the policy at issue in the present case is governed by those provisions of the Hawaii Insurance Code, HRS ch. 431 (1987 Spec. Pamphlet and Supp. 1992), that were in effect as of the policy\u2019s effective date. HRS \u00a7 431:10C-104(a) (1987 Spec.

Co. v. Blanco, </em>72 Haw. 9, 16, 804 P.2d 876, 880 (1990); <em>Ganiron v. Hawaii Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>69 Haw. 432, 435, 744 P.2d 1210, 1212 (1987); <em>Hawaiian Ins. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Brooks, </em>67 Haw. 285, 292, 686 P.2d 23, 27-28 (1984). In this connection we have ruled that \u201cif the insured did something or . . . failed to do something, and the insured\u2019s expected result of the act or omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>was the injury, then the injury was not caused by an accident and therefore not... within the coverage of the policy . . . .\u201d <em>Blanco, </em>72 Haw. at 16, 804 P.2d at 880 (insured fired rifle in victim\u2019s direction, intending to frighten but instead injuring him; injury held to be reasonably foreseeable and therefore not accidental from insured\u2019s viewpoint; consequently, insurer had no duty to defend); <em>see also Brooks, </em>67 Haw. at 292, 686 P.2d at 27-28 (from perspective of insured truck driver, sexual assault of hitchhiker in rear section of vehicle by insured\u2019s coworker not accidental where insured aware of attack but chose not to do anything to prevent or mitigate harm to victim, thereby facilitating commission of act; insurer held to have no duty to defend or indemnify).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">On the other hand, we have held that a gunshot injury sustained by the occupant of one motor vehicle at the hand of the occupant of another can constitute \u201caccidental harm,\u201d thus giving rise to coverage, where there is a territorial \u201cnexus\u201d between the injury and \u201cthe operation, maintenance, or use of the vehicles in question.\u201d <em>Ganiron, </em>69 Haw. at 434-35, 744 P.2d at 1212. The teaching of <em>Blanco </em>and <em>Brooks, </em>however, is that, in order for the insurer to owe a duty to defend or indemnify, the injury cannot be the expected or reasonably foreseeable result of the insured\u2019s own intentional acts or omissions. The analysis thus comes full circle; whether an injury is caused by a motor vehicle \u201caccident\u201d or by an insured\u2019s intentional act is determined from the viewpoint or perspective of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s unchallenged FOF simply do not support its conclusion that, as to Godinez, Nelson\u2019s death did not arise out of a motor vehicle accident. On the contrary, the FOF unequivocally establish that: (1) from Godinez\u2019s perspective, the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>was not the expected or anticipated result of any intentional act or omission on his part; (2) Godinez, being unaware the shooting was taking place, obviously made no decision to refrain from preventing Nelson\u2019s death or otherwise mitigating the harm; and (3) Godinez did nothing to facilitate the shooting. In fact, it appears that Godinez\u2019s constant effort was to elude Nelson via the instrumentality of the truck, and he was wholly unaware that Vilamor was in possession of a firearm until after the shooting occurred. Accordingly, from Godinez\u2019s viewpoint or perspective Nelson\u2019s death was accidental. That being the case, we hold that the trial court erred in concluding that AIG does not owe Godinez a duty to defend or indemnify on the basis that the shooting did not arise out of a motor vehicle \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">3. Nelson\u2019s death arose out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Pursuant to COL Nos. 4 and 11, the trial court concluded that AIG did not have a duty under the policy to defend and/or indemnify Godinez because the shooting death of Nelson did not arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the truck. Inasmuch as these COL present mixed questions of fact and law, we review them under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Amfac, Inc., </em>74 Haw. at 119, 839 P.2d at 28-29; <em>Coll v. McCarthy, </em>72 Haw. at 28, 804 P.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The basic insurance agreement regarding liability coverage, as set forth in Part A of the policy, obligates AIG to \u201cpay compensatory damages for bodily injury ... for which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an <em>auto </em>accident.\u201d (Emphasis in original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>deleted and additional emphasis added.) The term \u201cauto accident\u201d is nowhere defined in the policy. However, as noted above, the policy defines the term \u201ccovered auto\u201d to include the truck. Moreover, Part G of the policy defines \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d to include \u201can accident arising out of the <em>operation, maintenance, or use </em>of a <em>motor vehicle </em>....\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The same part defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to mean \u201cany vehicle of a type required to be registered under Chapter 286 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes . . . .\u201d HRS \u00a7 286-41(a) (Supp. 1992) requires \u201c[e]veiy owner of a motor vehicle which is to be operated upon the public highways ... [to] apply.,. for the registration thereof.\u201d HRS \u00a7 286-2 (1986) defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to include \u201cevery vehicle [except mopeds] which is self-propelled ....\u201d The same section defines \u201cvehicle\u201d to include \u201cevery device ... by which any person or property is or may be transported . . . upon a highway,\u201d excluding \u201cdevices moved by human power\u201d (such as bicycles), devices used exclusively on rails or tracks, and mopeds. Thus, construing the policy according to the entirety of its terms and conditions, <em>see Methven-Abreu, </em>73 Haw. at 390, 834 P.2d at 283, and its plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech, <em>see Hawaiian Ins. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Financial Sec. Ins. Co., </em>72 Haw. 80, 87, 807 P.2d 1256, 1260, <em>reconsideration denied, </em>72 Haw. 616, 841 P.2d 1074 (1991), it is apparent that the truck is an \u201cauto\u201d and that a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d is an \u201cauto accident\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We have already established that Godinez was \u201cusing\u201d the truck on the night of the shooting and that, from his viewpoint or perspective, Nelson\u2019s death was an \u201caccident.\u201d Thus, the \u201ccritical question\u201d becomes whether the death \u201carose out of\u2019 that use. <em>Cf. Ganiron, </em>69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Haw. at 434, 744 P.2d at 1212. Urging that bodily injury flowing from <em>Vilamor\u2019s </em>intentional conduct cannot \u201carise out of\u201d the use of a motor vehicle, AIG argues that: (1) Nelson\u2019s death did not arise out of the use of the truck; and, therefore, (2) AIG has no duty to defend and/or indemnify Godinez with respect to the tort claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In <em>Brooks, </em>we acknowledged that the sexual assault victim\u2019s injuries \u201cmay have arisen from the use\u201d of the insured vehicle. 67 Haw. at 292, 686 P.2d at 27. Nevertheless, we affirmed the summary judgment entered by the circuit court in favor of the insurer in that case, not because the sexual assault did not arise from the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured vehicle, but because, viewed from the perspective of both the rapist and the driver, the injuries were not accidental. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 686 P.2d at 27-28. Accordingly, the <em>Brooks </em>decision does not foreclose the possibility of an insurer\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify an insured notwithstanding the intentional or even criminal conduct of a third person. Implicit in our holding in <em>Brooks </em>was the potentiality that the insured driver would have been eligible for coverage if his conduct had been innocent or merely negligent, <em>i.e., </em>if viewed from his perspective the injuries suffered by the victim had been an accident. That being the case, it follows that an intentional act does not necessarily sever bodily injury caused thereby from the \u201cuse\u201d of an insured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Any ambiguity in this regard was eliminated by <em>Ganiron, </em>in which we expressly held that gunshot injuries intentionally inflicted on one motor vehicle operator by another constituted a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d within the meaning of the statutory predecessor to HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u00a7 431:100-103(9), precisely because \u201cit occurred because of the operation, maintenance, or use of the vehicles in question.\u201d 69 Haw. at 435-36, 744 P.2d at 1212. The fact that eligibility for \u201cfirst-party\u201d no \u2014 fault and uninsured motorist insurance coverage was at issue in <em>Ganiron </em>whereas eligibility for \u201cthird-party\u201d liability insurance coverage is at issue in the present case in no way diminishes the applicability of <em>Ganiron </em>to our analysis. <em>See, e.g., Continental Western Ins. Co. v. Klug, </em>415 N.W.2d 876, 877-79 (Minn. 1987) (on facts similar to <em>Ganiron, </em>insurer sought declaratory judgment that it had no liability under <em>no-fault </em>and <em>uninsured motorist </em>provisions of auto policy; court held that insured\u2019s gunshot injuries arose out of use of uninsured motorist\u2019s auto where (1) extent of causation between auto and injury made auto \u201cactive accessory\u201d in causing injury, (2) no act of independent significance occurred breaking causal link between \u201cuse\u201d of auto and injuries inflicted, and (3) injuries resulted from use of auto for transportation purposes); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Davis, </em>937 F.2d 1415, 1416, 1419-22 (9th Cir. 1991) (on facts similar to <em>Ganiron, </em>auto insurer sought declaratory judgment that its <em>liability </em>policy did not cover highway shooting carried out by insured while passenger in own vehicle; citing <em>Klug </em>with approval, court held that shooting resulted from ownership, maintenance, or use of insured\u2019s auto where use of insured auto had more than \u201cminimal causal connection\u201d with incident leading to victim\u2019s injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The trial court\u2019s own uncontroverted FOF clearly establish that the use of the truck had more than a \u201cminimal causal connection\u201d with Nelson\u2019s shooting death; indeed, they confirm that: (1) the extent of causation between the truck and the death rendered the truck an \u201cactive accessory\u201d; (2) no act of independent significance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>occurred such as to break the causal link; and (3) the death resulted from the use of the truck for transportation purposes. Godinez was transporting Vilamor from the Fernandez Fun Factory in Waikiki when they first encountered Nelson driving his vehicle (FOF Nos. 3 and 4). As Godinez maneuvered the truck past Nelson\u2019s vehicle, Nelson first began to follow the truck, yelling all the while (FOF No. 7). Nelson repeatedly directed profane taunts at Vilamor, challenging the latter to have a \u201cshoot out\u201d (FOF No. 8). Vilamor expressly directed Godinez to keep driving, motivating Godinez to escape Nelson\u2019s vehicle (FOF No. 9). Godinez was unsuccessful in his effort to elude Nelson due to traffic congestion (FOF No. 9). Nelson persisted in pulling his vehicle alongside the truck and at one point attempted to cut off the truck on the H-l Freeway so as to force the truck to come to a halt (FOF Nos. 10 and 11). Nelson\u2019s persistent aggression prompted Godinez to turn onto the Pali Highway in the hope of \u201closing\u201d Nelson\u2019s vehicle (FOF No. 12). Nelson crossed a traffic divider in order to pursue the truck, continuing to provoke Vilamor as the two vehicles traveled abreast of one another up the Pali Highway (FOF Nos. 13, 14, and 15). Finally, unbeknownst to Godinez, Vilamor fired his gun at Nelson and said nothing about it until Godinez had proceeded to the windward side of Oahu and directed the truck back to Honolulu on the Likelike Highway (FOF Nos. 16, 17, and 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Inasmuch as bodily injury resulting from an intentional act can, and in the present case did, arise out of the use of a motor vehicle, we hold that the trial court was clearly erroneous in concluding that Nelson\u2019s death did not arise out of Godinez\u2019s ownership, maintenance, or use of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>4. AIG has a duty to defend and indemnify Godinez regarding the tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Because (1) Godinez is a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the policy, (2) from Godinez\u2019s viewpoint or perspective, the shooting death was accidental, and (3) the shooting arose out of Godinez\u2019s use of the truck, we hold, as a matter of law, that AIG has a duty to defend and indemnify Godinez. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of AIG and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the Caraangs.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">B. AIG Has No Duty to Defend and Indemnify Vilamor Regarding the Tort Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Pursuant to COL Nos. 3, 5,10, and 13, the trial court concluded as a matter of law that AIG owed no duty under the policy to defend and/or indemnify Vilamor in connection with the tort claim because the shooting death of Nelson was not accidental, but rather the result of Vilamor\u2019s intentional conduct. Inasmuch as these COL are overwhelmingly supported by the trial court\u2019s FOF, at least from the viewpoint or perspective of Vilamor, we will not disturb them. <em>Amfac, Inc., </em>74 Haw. at 119, 839 P.2d at 29 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Not surprisingly, the Caraangs do not contest the trial court\u2019s FOF that Vilamor shot Nelson and that Nelson died as a result thereof (FOF Nos. 16, 18, and 19). The Caraangs, however, refer in their amended opening brief to deposition testimony (which was received in evidence at trial) that, after the incident, Vilamor told a police detective that he had fired his gun in an effort to stop or deter Nelson from following the truck and continuing his taunts; specifically, Vilamor claimed that he merely intended to frighten Nelson by striking his vehicle. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>even assuming that the trial court accepted the hearsay at face value, \u201cwe do not see how it can logically be said that . . . the injury to [Nelson] was the result of an accident.\u201d <em>See Blanco, </em>72 Haw. at 18, 804 P.2d at 881. Granting, <em>arguendo, </em>that Vilamor fired the gun in Nelson\u2019s direction intending to frighten him, \u201c[t]hat physical injury might result from such an action is certainly something which a reasonable man in [Vilamor\u2019s] position should have anticipated and expected.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We hold that the trial court was correct in concluding, from Vilamor\u2019s viewpoint or perspective, that the shooting death of Nelson did not arise out of an auto accident, but rather was intentionally caused. We have recognized in the past that the objectively reasonable expectations of policyholders and intended beneficiaries regarding terms of insurance policies will be honored. <em>See, e.g., Blanco, </em>72 Haw. at 18, 804 P.2d at 881; <em>Brooks, </em>67 Haw. at 290-91, 686 P.2d at 27. Thus, assuming that Vilamor was otherwise a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the policy (an issue we need not reach in this opinion), and in light of the exclusion from liability coverage of any person who intentionally causes bodily injury, Vilamor \u201ccould not reasonably expect to be covered or defended\u201d with respect to Nelson\u2019s death. <em>See Blanco, </em>72 Haw. at 11, 15, 18-19, 804 P.2d at 878-79, 881. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court was correct in concluding as a matter of law that AIG owes Vilamor no duty to defend and indemnify with respect to the tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">We reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s November 7, 1991 judgment declaring that the policy does not require AIG to defend and/or indemnify Godinez regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tort claim and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the Caraangs and against AIG consistent with this opinion.
