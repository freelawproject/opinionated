On appeal, Valera does not contest his convictions; rather, he argues that the sentencing judge improperly considered and relied upon his suppressed statements when determining his sentence. We conclude it was error for the sentencing judge to have relied on statements obtained in violation of Valera\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination when determining Valera\u2019s sentence. We therefore vacate Valera\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">On the night of March 24, 1990, Valera shot and killed his wife, Arcelie Valera and her alleged lover, Carlito Fernandez. Valera was arrested that night by Hawaii County Police Officer Kamakawiwoole (Kamakawiwoole). Valera, however, received inadequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">While in a holding cell awaiting processing, Valera stated that he had shot his wife and her lover. Kamakawiwoole asked Valera, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d In response, Valera recounted the sequence of events leading up to the killings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Valera was also asked where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>had obtained the gun and replied that he had gotten the gun from a person in Kawaihae.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Valera was initially charged with murder in the first degree for the killings, acquiring a firearm without a permit, and carrying a firearm without a license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 1, 1990, the State moved to determine the voluntariness of several statements Valera made to various people and to the police on the night of the killings. The statements include Valera\u2019s March 24, 1990 declaration that he had just shot his wife and her lover. Valera moved to suppress all of his statements, claiming that they were obtained in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel as guaranteed by article I, sections 10 and 14 of the Hawaii Constitution, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The circuit court granted Valera\u2019s motion to suppress the statements he had made in response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Kamakawiwoole\u2019s question, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d and his statements regarding where he had obtained the gun used in the killings. The circuit court specifically determined that these statements were the product of custodial interrogation in which Valera had been given inadequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that Valera had not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his rights to silence and to counsel under article I, sections 10 and 14 of the Hawaii Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The circuit court ruled Valera\u2019s suppressed statements could not be introduced at trial, in any manner, by the State. We affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling in <em>State v. Valera, </em>No. 14702 (Haw. April 30, 1991) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Valera was found guilty, after a jury trial, of two counts of manslaughter (Counts I and II) and of the other offenses as charged. The State subsequently filed three motions regarding sentencing: (1) a Motion for Extended Term Sentencing, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 706-661 (1985); (2) a Motion for Mandatory Minimum Sentencing, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 706-660.1 (Supp. 1991); and (3) a Motion to Impose Consecutive Sentencing, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 706-668.5 (Supp. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel objected to a reference made to Valera\u2019s suppressed statements in the pre-sentence investigation report and requested that the reference be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The sentencing judge, by implication, overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection and implicitly denied the defense\u2019s motion to strike, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>As far as this matter goes, there are [sic] certain evidence, which the jury could not hear but which is in the minds of all those who sat through the trial including defense counsel and prosecutor, I cannot dismiss from my mind. I think it is clear from Mr. Valera\u2019s statement is they [sic] went to Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, followed his wife from the Beach Hotel all the way to Honokaa. Although it\u2019s not explicit in the statement, I think it\u2019s implicit that he had this illegally obtained .357 Magnum in his car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">When he saw his wife meet with Mr. Fernandez, he then approached the vehicle[s] with his vehicle, parked behind his [sic] vehicle, went out with his weapon, and shot Mrs. Valera as she fled the car. Then he chased Mr. Fernandez down to Honokaa club, quite a distance of about three football lengths, I believe it was, the testimony, and finished him off at the Honokaa Club.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">I think if the jury had heard the evidence which had to be barred because of the way the police questioned Mr. Valera, a different result would have occurred. I think in sentencing, the Court can consider that [sic] those items which had to be barred. I think in this case, Mr. Valera acted as an executioner. He stalked his victim [sic] and shot them one after the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The sentencing judge also denied the State\u2019s motions for extended term and mandatory minimum term sentencing, but granted its motion for consecutive sentences with respect to Valera\u2019s manslaughter convictions. Valera was sentenced to serve: (a) two ten-year consecutive terms of imprisonment for Counts I and II; (b) a five-year concurrent term of imprisonment for Count III; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>(c) a one-year concurrent term of imprisonment for Count IV. Judgment was entered and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Valera argues on appeal that the sentencing judge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> violated his constitutional rights to due process and to counsel, and his privilege against self-incrimination as guaranteed by article I, sections 5, 14 and 10 of the Hawaii Constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by relying almost exclusively upon his suppressed statements in determining his sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Valera, therefore, asks this court to extend the <em>Santiago </em>rule prohibiting the use of illegally obtained confessions as evidence at trial to the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The State counters that the exclusionary rule should not apply at sentencing proceedings; however, should this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>court determine that the rule does apply, any error by the sentencing judge in considering Valera\u2019s suppressed statements was harmless, because most of the substantive content of Valera\u2019s statements was elicited during trial either through testimony or physical evidence. Thus, the State argues, Valera\u2019s sentence was supported by the totality of the trial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The dispositive issue we must decide is whether a sentencing judge may take into consideration and rely upon statements obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, as guaranteed by article I, section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution, when determining the sentence to be imposed on that defendant. For the reasons stated below, we hold that a sentencing judge may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), the United States Supreme Court held that the prosecution could not use a defendant\u2019s statements obtained through custodial interrogation against that defendant in a criminal prosecution unless the prosecution could demonstrate that procedural safeguards were used to inform the defendant of his constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 478-79. These safeguards, more commonly known today as the <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings,\u201d were required to protect a defendant's federal fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The United States Supreme Court further held that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were an absolute constitutional prerequisite to admitting a defendant\u2019s statement, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, into evidence at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 476 (\u201cthe warnings required ... are prerequisites to the admissibility of any statement made by a defendant.\u201d). \u201cThis [bright line rule was required] because without the right to cut off police questioning, the inherently compelling pressures of in-custody interrogation operate to over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>bear [sic] free choice, the foundation of the privilege, and statements elicited after its invocation cannot be other than the product of compulsion.\u201d <em>State v. Uganiza, </em>68 Haw. 28, 30-31, 702 P.2d 1352, 1354 (1985) (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 474).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Hawaii has adopted this \u201cbright line rule.\u201d <em>See id.; State v. Kaahanui, </em>69 Haw. 473, 477-78, 747 P.2d 1276, 1279 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>67 Haw. 126, 132-33, 681 P.2d 553, 559 (1984), <em>appeal after remand, </em>69 Haw. 72, 734 P.2d 156 (1987). Additionally this court has held that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings have an independent source in the Hawaii Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See State v. Santiago, </em>53 Haw. 254, 266, 492 P.2d 657, 664 (1971), <em>appeal after remand, </em>55 Haw. 162, 516 P.2d 1256 (1973). In fact, we have consistently provided criminal defendants with greater protection under Hawaii\u2019s version of the privilege against self-incrimination (article I, section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution) than is otherwise ensured by the federal courts under <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny. <em>See, e.g., Santiago, </em>53 Haw. at 265, 492 P.2d at 664; <em>State v. Russo, </em>67 Haw. at 132, 681 P.2d at 558; <em>State v. Nelson, </em>69 Haw. 461, 468, 748 P.2d 365, 369 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">For example, in <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222 (1971), the United States Supreme Court held that a statement obtained in violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights could be used by the prosecution to impeach that defendant\u2019s trial testimony, even though such statements could not be used by the prosecution in its case in chief. <em>Id. </em>at 224-26. Significantly, this court declined to follow this interpretation of the privilege against self-incrimination under the Hawaii Constitution, holding instead that \u201cunless [the <em>Miranda </em>warnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>are given], statements made by the accused may not be used either as direct evidence in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief or to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility during rebuttal or cross-examination.\u201d <em>Santiago, 53 </em>Haw. at 266, 492 P.2d at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In <em>Santiago, </em>we also recognized that society has a valid policy of convicting and punishing persons convicted of criminal offenses. <em>Id. </em>However, when we prohibited the use of a defendant\u2019s constitutionally infirm statements against him, even for impeachment purposes, we in effect recognized that every accused has the right to be informed of his freedom to choose whether to incriminate himself. <em>Id. </em>at 267, 492 P.2d at 665. This court stated the policy that a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination \u201cmust be maintained, even though it necessitates that a certain number of criminals must go free in order to preserve the rights of all persons accused of crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Valera now asks this court to extend the <em>Santiago </em>rule to the sentencing stage of the criminal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">We note first that the sentencing phase is considered a critical stage of the criminal process. <em>See Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 358 (1977). A sentencing judge generally has \u201cbroad discretion in imposing a sentence,\u201d <em>State v. Nunes, </em>72 Haw. 521, 524, 824 P.2d 837, 840 (1992), and the sentence thus imposed should be tailored to the particular circumstances of a defendant\u2019s case. <em>State v. Nobriga, </em>56 Haw. 75, 83, 527 P.2d 1269, 1274 (1974) (citation omitted). To achieve this end, there is a legitimate need to provide a sentencing judge with complete information about the defendant. Id.; <em>see also State v. Murphy, </em>59 Haw. 1, 21, 575 P.2d 448, 461 (1978). Indeed, a sentencing judge is required to consider specific statutory factors in determining the sentence to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>imposed. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 706-606 (Supp. 1992).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the scope of a sentencing judge\u2019s inquiry into a defendant\u2019s background is very broad and limitations on the kind and/or source of information the court may consider are not lightly imposed. <em>Verdugo v. United States, </em>402 F.2d 599, 611 (9th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 925 (1970), <em>and cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 961 (1971). <em>See also Murphy, </em>59 Haw. at 21, 575 P.2d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">This is not to say, however, that a sentencing judge\u2019s discretion is without limits. A sentencing judge is still required to impose a \u201cfair, proper, and just sentence,\u201d <em>Nobriga, </em>56 Haw. at 77, 527 P.2d at 1271 (citation omitted), based upon the crime of which the defendant was convicted. The conviction, in turn, is predicated upon the evidence presented at trial. Thus, because suppressed statements are by definition not admitted at trial, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>be anomalous to allow a sentencing judge to take them into consideration when imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">While a defendant is not entitled to the full panoply of due process protections at sentencing, <em>State v. Ortez, </em>60 Haw. 107, 120, 588 P.2d 898, 907 (1978), a defendant is entitled at the very least to the minimal procedural protections afforded by the due process clause. <em>Id. </em>Here the sentencing judge\u2019s use of Valera\u2019s suppressed statements at the sentencing hearing violated Valera\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Our review of the record reveals that the sentencing judge made it clear that he considered and relied upon Valera\u2019s suppressed statements in determining Valera\u2019s sentence by stating: 1) he could not dismiss the suppressed evidence from his mind; 2) he believed that if the jury had heard the evidence it would have convicted Valera of murder, rather than manslaughter; and 3) he possessed the authority to consider the suppressed evidence in determining the sentence to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The State argues, however, that even if the sentencing judge committed error in considering Valera\u2019s suppressed statements, the error was harmless because most of the information contained in Valera\u2019s statements was established either by testimonial or physical evidence at trial. The State, however, failed to make the trial transcripts part of the record on appeal and, consequently, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In light of the views and policies we expressed in <em>Santiago </em>and our discussion of the countervailing policies at issue, we firmly believe that information contained in a defendant\u2019s suppressed statements, which were not considered at trial by the jury when reaching a verdict, should be strictly prohibited from use by a sentencing judge when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>considering and formulating that defendant\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we extend <em>Santiago </em>to the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings and hold that the use at sentencing of statements previously obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination violates that defendant\u2019s privilege against self \u2014 incrimination and right to due process, as guaranteed by the Hawaii Constitution. This holding is consistent with federal law. <em>See, e.g., Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 469 (1981) (statements obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s fifth amendment rights may not be used against that defendant, even at the penalty phase of the proceedings); <em>Pens v. Bail, </em>902 F.2d 1464, 1466 (9th Cir. 1990) (unwarned statements about other offenses cannot be used to enhance sentence); <em>Jones v. Cardwell, </em>686 F.2d 754, 756 (9th Cir. 1982) (\u201ca sentencing judge\u2019s broad discretion to consider information in imposing sentence does not extend to consideration of information obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Brown v. Bundle, </em>417 F.2d 282, 284 (3d Cir. 1969) (due process is violated when sentencing court considers inadmissible evidence); <em>United States ex rel. Rivers v. Myers, </em>384 F.2d 737, 743 (3d Cir. 1967) (inadmissible written confession cannot be used to determine degree of murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Valera also argues that the sentencing judge punished him for the commission of criminal offenses, murders in the second degree, of which he was acquitted. Valera argues that imposition of two ten-year consecutive terms of imprisonment for the manslaughter convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tions was essentially a finding, contrary to the jury verdict, that Valera acted intentionally and knowingly and was not suffering extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In support of his argument, Valera points to particular language employed by the judge at the sentencing hearing which characterized him as \u201can executioner\u201d who \u201cstalked his victim [sic] and shot them one after the other.\u201d The judge, as noted, also expressed his belief that \u201cif the jury had heard the evidence which had to be barred ... a different result would have occurred.\u201d The State argues that Valera\u2019s sentence is \u201cwell within statutory guidelines\u201d and therefore any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The authority of a trial court to select and determine the severity of a penalty is normally undisturbed on review in the absence of an apparent abuse of discretion or unless applicable statutory or constitutional commands have not been observed. <em>State v. Murray, </em>63 Haw. 12, 25, 621 P.2d 334, 342 (1980). We must ignore errors which do not affect substantial rights. Rule 52(a), Hawaii Rides of Penal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In <em>State v. Tachibana, </em>67 Haw. 573, 698 P.2d 287 (1985), this court held that a trial court could not enhance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>a defendant\u2019s sentence based on an aggravating factor not established by the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 580, 698 P.2d at 293. More recently, in <em>State v. Nunes, </em>72 Haw. 521, 824 P.2d 837 (1992), we held that a judge cannot punish a defendant for an uncharged crime in the belief that it too deserves punishment. An adjudication of guilt is required before a sentence may be imposed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 32(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In this case, the sentences imposed were within the statutory guidelines. However, based on this sentencing judge\u2019s statements, a strong inference arises that he improperly relied on Valera\u2019s suppressed statements in determining Valera\u2019s sentence. Thus, despite the fact that Valera\u2019s sentence falls within the range prescribed by statute, we cannot say that a judge considering the offenses of which Valera stands convicted and not considering inadmissible evidence would impose the sentences imposed here: Consequently, we cannot find the sentencing judge\u2019s statements to the effect that \u201cif the jury had heard the evidence which had to be barred ... a different result would have occurred\u201d and that \u201cin sentencing, the Court can consider ... those items that had to be barred\u201d were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate Valera\u2019s sentences, including the concurrent sentences imposed for his two firearm convictions, and remand this case to the Third Circuit Court for re-sentencing by a different judge. On remand and prior to re-sentencing, the reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>to Valera\u2019s suppressed statements in the pre-sentence investigation report shall be stricken from said report.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVJ\"><em>Joyce K.

Davidson, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\"> Kamakawiwoole informed Valera that \u201che had the right to remain silent; that anything he say [sic] may be used against him in a court of law; and that he had the right to have an attorney if he wished a \u2014 a\u2014 he needed one.\u201d According to the circuit court, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, as given, were constitutionally inadequate because they did not convey to Valera the Ml panoply of his rights, i.e., Valera was not told that if he could not afford an attorney one would be appointed for him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\"> The substance of Valera\u2019s response is as follows: Valera suspected his wife of \u201cfooling around.\u201d On the night of the killings, Valera drove to the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, where his wife worked, and followed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>after she finished her shift that evening. His wife eventually parked her car at the Honokaa Sports Complex next to another car. Valera waited a while before approaching the other two vehicles, because if his wife and her alleged lover were going to make love, he wanted to catch them in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Valera then drove his car up behind the other two vehicles and parked it so that neither of the other vehicles could drive away. He went up to the passenger side door of one of the vehicles, looked inside and discovered a man in the vehicle with his pants undone. Valera proceeded to fire gunshots into the car. He then chased his wife, who had fled from the car, and shot her while she was fleeing and again when he caught up with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Valera then went after the man (who was later identified as Carlito Fernandez) who was heading towards the Honokaa Club. Valera followed Fernandez into the club and shot and killed him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-11\"> On August 27, 1991, after this court affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision to suppress Valera\u2019s statements, the State amended counts I and II of its complaint from Murder in the First Degree to Murder in the Second Degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"> The circuit court, therefore, granted in part and denied in part the State\u2019s motion to determine voluntariness. Specifically, the circuit court determined that all of Valera\u2019s incriminating statements, except for those made in response to Kamakawiwoole\u2019s questions at the Honokaa police station, were admissible against him at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\"> In the Hawaii circuit courts, the sentencing judge is generally also the trial judge, as was the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> Article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law .. . .\u201d Haw.
