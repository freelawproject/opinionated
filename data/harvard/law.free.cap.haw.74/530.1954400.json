Lewin (Lewin), in his official capacity as Director of the Department of Health (DOH), State of Hawaii, for judgment on the pleadings, resulting in the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 action with prejudice for failure to state a claim against Lewin upon which relief can be granted. Because, for purposes of Lewin\u2019s motion, it is our duty to view the factual allegations of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in a light most favorable to them (i.e., because we must deem such allegations as true) and because it does <em>not </em>appear beyond doubt that the plaintiffs cannot prove any set of facts in support of their claim that would entitle them to the relief they seek, we hold that the circuit court erroneously dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s order and judgment and remand this matter to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">On May 1, 1991, the plaintiffs filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawaii, seeking, <em>inter </em>alia: (1) a declaration that Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 572-1 (1985)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014 the section of the Hawaii Marriage Law enumerating the [requisites of [a] valid marriage contract\u201d \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>is unconstitutional insofar as it is construed and applied by the DOH to justify refusing to issue a marriage license on the <em>sole </em>basis that the applicant couple is of the same sex; and (2) preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the future withholding of marriage licenses on that sole basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In addition to the necessary jurisdictional and venue-related averments, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>following facts: (1) on or about December 17,1990, Baehr/ Dancel, Rodrigues/Pregil, and Lagon/Melilio (collectively \u201cthe applicant couples\u201d) filed applications for marriage licenses with the DOH, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 572-6 (Supp. 1992);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the DOH denied the applicant couples\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>marriage license applications solely on the ground that the applicant couples were of the same sex;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) the applicant couples have complied with all marriage contract requirements and provisions under HRS ch. 572, except that each applicant couple is of the same sex; (4) the applicant couples are otherwise eligible to secure marriage licenses from the DOH, absent the statutory prohibition or construction of HRS \u00a7 572-1 excluding couples of the same sex from securing marriage licenses; and (5) in denying the applicant couples\u2019 marriage license applications, the DOH was acting in its official capacity and under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Based on the foregoing factual allegations, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint avers that: (1) the DOH\u2019s interpretation and application of HRS \u00a7 572-1 to deny same-sex couples access to marriage licenses violates the plaintiffs\u2019 right to privacy, as guaranteed by article I, section 6 of the Hawaii</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as to the equal protection of the laws and due process of law, as guaranteed by article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) the plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or complete remedy at law to redress their alleged injuries; and (3) the plaintiffs are presently suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable injury from the DOH\u2019s acts, policies, and practices in the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On June 7, 1991, Lewin filed an amended answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. In his amended answer, Lewin asserted the defenses of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, sovereign immunity, qualified immunity, and abstention in favor of legislative action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations, Lewin admitted: (1) his residency and status as the director of the DOH; (2) that on or about December 17, 1990, the applicant couples personally appeared before an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>authorized agent of the DOH and applied for marriage licenses; (3) that the applicant couples\u2019 marriage license applications were denied on the ground that each couple was of the same sex; and (4) that the DOH did not address the issue of the premarital examination required by HRS \u00a7 572-7(a) (Supp. 1992)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cupon being advised\u201d that the applicant couples were of the same sex. Lewin denied all of the remaining allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On July 9,1991, Lewin filed his motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 12(h)(2) (1990)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 12(c) (1990),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, pursuant to HRCP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>12(b)(6) (1990),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and memorandum in support thereof in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the circuit court. The memorandum was unsupported by and contained no references to any affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions on file. Indeed, the record in this case suggests that the parties have not conducted any formal discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In his memorandum, Lewin urged that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted for the following reasons: (1) the state\u2019s marriage laws \u201ccontemplate marriage as a union between a man and a woman\u201d; (2) because the only legally recognized right to marry \u201cis the right to enter a heterosexual marriage, [the] plaintiffs do not have a cognizable right, fundamental or otherwise, to enter into state-licensed homosexual marriages\u201d;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (3) the state\u2019s marriage laws do not \u201cburden, penalize, infringe, or interfere in any way with the [plaintiffs\u2019] private relationships\u201d; (4) the state is under no obligation \u201cto take affirmative steps to provide homosexual unions with its official approval\u201d; (5) the state\u2019s marriage laws \u201cprotect and foster and may help to perpetuate the basic family unit, regarded as vital to society, that provides status and a nurturing environment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>children born to married persons\u201d and, in addition, \u201cconstitute a statement of the moral values of the community in a manner that is not burdensome to [the] plaintiffs\u201d; (6) assuming the plaintiffs are homosexuals (a fact not pleaded in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> they \u201care neither a suspect nor a quasi-suspect class and do not require heightened judicial solicitude\u201d; and (7) even if heightened judicial solicitude is warranted, the state\u2019s marriage laws \u201care so removed from penalizing, burdening, harming, or otherwise interfering with [the] plaintiffs and their relationships and perform such a critical function in society that they must be sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to Lewin\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on August 29, 1991. Citing <em>Au v. Au, </em>63 Haw. 210, 626 P.2d 173 (1981), and <em>Midkiff v. Castle &amp; Cooke, Inc., </em>45 Haw. 409, 368 P.2d 887 (1962), they argued that, for purposes of Lewin\u2019s motion, the circuit court was bound to accept all of the facts alleged in their complaint as true and that the complaint therefore could not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appeared beyond doubt that they could prove no set of facts that would entitle them to the relief sought. Proclaiming their homosexuality and asserting a fundamental constitutional right to sexual orientation, the plaintiffs reiterated their position that the DOH\u2019s refusal to issue marriage licenses to the applicant couples violated their rights to privacy, equal protection of the laws, and due process of law under article I, sections 5 and 6 of the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The circuit court heard Lewin\u2019s motion on September 3, 1991, and, on October 1, 1991, filed its order granting Lewin\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that Lewin was \u201centitled to judgment in his favor as a matter of law\u201d and dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">II. JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS WAS ERRONEOUSLY GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. <em>Ravelo v. County of Hawaii, </em>66 Haw. 194, 198, 658 P.2d 883, 886 (1983) (quoting <em>Midkiff, </em>45 Haw. at 414, 368 P.2d at 890); <em>Marsland v. Pang, </em>5 Haw. App. 463, 474, 701 P.2d 175, 185-86, <em>cert. denied, </em>67 Haw. 686, 744 P.2d 781 (1985). We must therefore view a plaintiffs complaint in a light most favorable to him or her in order to determine whether the allegations contained therein could warrant relief under any alternative theory. <em>Ravelo, </em>66 Haw. at 199, 658 P.2d at 886. For this reason, in reviewing the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in this case, our consideration is strictly limited to the allegations of the complaint, and we must deem those allegations to be true. <em>Au, </em>63 Haw. at 214, 626 P.2d at 177 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">An HRCP 12(c) motion serves much the same purpose as an HRCP 12(b)(6) motion, except that it is made after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the pleadings are closed. <em>Marsland, </em>5 Haw. App. at 474, 701 P.2d at 186. \u201c \u2018A Rule 12(c) motion ... for a judgment on the pleadings only has utility when all material allegations of fact are admitted in the pleadings and only questions of law remain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475, 701 P.2d at 186 (citing 5 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1357 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Based on the foregoing authority, it is apparent that an order granting an HRCP 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings must be based solely on the contents of the pleadings. A claim that is evidentiary in nature and requires findings of fact to resolve cannot properly be disposed of under the rubric of HRCP 12(c). <em>Cf. Nawahie v. Goo Wan Hoy, </em>26 Haw. 111 (1921) (\u201cOnly such facts as were properly before the court below at the time of the rendition of the decree appealed from and which appear in the record ... on appeal will be considered. All other matters will be treated as surplusage and of course will be disregarded.\u201d) We have recognized that consideration of matters outside the pleadings transforms a motion seeking dismissal of a complaint into an HRCP 56 motion for summary judgment. <em>See Au, </em>63 Haw. at 213, 626 P.2d at 176; <em>Del Rosario v. Kohanuinui, </em>52 Haw. 583, 483 P.2d 181 (1971); HRCP 12(b) (1990); <em>cf. </em>HRCP 12(c) (1990). But resort to matters outside the record, by way of \u201c[ujnverified statements of fact in counsel\u2019s memorandum or representations made in oral argument\u201d or otherwise, cannot accomplish such a transformation. <em>See Au, </em>63 Haw. at 213, 626 P.2d at 177; <em>cf. Asada v. Sunn, </em>66 Haw. 454, 455, 666 P.2d 584, 585 (1983); <em>Mizoguchi v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>66 Haw. 373, 381-82, 663 P.2d 1071, 1076-77 (1983); HRCP 56(e) (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>A. The Circuit Court Made Evidentiary Findings of Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Notwithstanding the absence of any evidentiary record before it, the circuit court\u2019s October 1, 1991 order granting Lewin\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings contained a variety of findings of fact. For example, the circuit court \u201cfound\u201d that: (1) HRS \u00a7 572-1 \u201cdoes not infringe upon a person\u2019s individuality or lifestyle decisions, <em>and none of the plaintiffs has provided testimony to the </em>contrary(2) HRS \u00a7 572-1 \u201cdoes not. . . restrict [or] burden . .. the exercise of the right to engage in a homosexual lifestyle\u201d; (3) Hawaii has exhibited a \u201chistory of tolerance for all peoples and their cultures\u201d; (4) <em>\u201cthe plaintiffs have failed to show </em>that they have been ostracized or oppressed in Hawaii and have opted instead to rely on a general statement of historic problems encountered by homosexuals which may not be relevant to Hawaii\u201d; (5) \u201chomosexuals in Hawaii have not been relegated to a position of \u2018political powerlessness.\u2019 ... <em>[TJhere is no evidence </em>that homosexuals and the homosexual legislative agenda have failed to gain legislative support in Hawaii\u201d; (6) <em>the u[p]laintiffs have failed to show </em>that homosexuals constitute a suspect class for equal protection analysis under [a]rticle I, [s]ection 5 of the Hawaii State Constitution;\u201d (7) \u201cthe issue of whether homosexuality constitutes an immutable trait has generated much dispute in the relevant scientific community\u201d;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (8) HRS \u00a7 572-1 \u201cis obviously designed to promote the general welfare interests of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>community by sanctioning traditional man-woman family units and procreation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Although not expressly denominated as such, the circuit court\u2019s order also contained a number of conclusions of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These included: (1) \u201c[t]he right to enter into a homosexual marriage is not a fundamental right protected by [a]rticle I, [sjection 6 of the Hawaii State Constitution\u201d; (2) the right to be free from the denial of a person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>civil rights or from discrimination in the exercise thereof because of \u201csexual orientation [is] . . . covered under [a]rticle I, [s]ection 5 of the State Constitution\u201d; (3) HRS \u00a7 572-1 \u201cpermits heterosexual marriages but not homosexual marriages\u201d and \u201cdoes not violate the due process clause of [a]rticle I, [s]ection 5 of the Hawaii State Constitution\u201d; (4) HRS \u00a7 572-1 \u201crepresents a legislative decision to extend the benefits of lawful marriage only to traditional family units which consist of male and female partners\u201d; (5) \u201c[b]ecause [entering into a] homosexual marriage [is not] a fundamental [constitutional] right..., the provisions of section 572-1 do not violate the due process clause of [a]rticle I, [s]ection 5 of the Hawaii State Constitution\u201d; (6) \u201c[h]omosexuals do not constitute a \u2018suspect class\u2019 for purposes of equal protection analysis under [a]rticle I, [s]ection 5 of the Hawaii State Constitution\u201d; (7) \u201ca group must have been subject to purposeful, unequal treatment or have been relegated to a position of political powerlessness in order to be considered a \u2018suspect class\u2019 for the purposes of constitutional analysis\u201d; (8) \u201c[a] law which classifies on the basis of race deserves the utmost judicial scrutiny because race clearly qualifies as a suspect classification. The same cannot be convincingly said with respect to homosexuals as a group\u201d; (9) \u201cthe classification created by section 572-1 must meet only the rational relationship test\u201d; (10) \u201c[t]he classification of section 572-1 meets the rational relationship test\u201d; (11) \u201c[s]ection 572-1 is clearly a rational, legislative effort to advance the general welfare of the community by permitting only heterosexual couples to legally many\u201d; and, finally, (12) Lewin \u201cis entitled to judgment in his favor as a matter of law[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In reviewing the circuit court\u2019s order on appeal, as noted above, we must deem all of <em>the factual </em>allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as true or admitted, <em>see Au, </em>63 Haw. at 214, 626 P.2d at 177; <em>Marsland, </em>5 Haw. App. at 475, 701 P.2d at 186, and, in the absence of an evidentiary record, ignore all of the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>See Au, </em>63 Haw. at 213, 626 P.2d at 177; <em>Marsland, </em>5 Haw. App. at 475, 701 P.2d at 186; <em>cf. Asada, </em>66 Haw. at 455, 666 P.2d at 585; <em>Mizoguchi, </em>66 Haw. at 381-82, 663 P.2d at 1076-77; <em>Nawahie, </em>26 Haw. at 111; HRCP 12(c) and 56(e). Ultimately, our task on appeal is to determine whether the circuit court\u2019s order, stripped of its improper factual findings, supports its conclusion that Lewin is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and, by implication, that it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their claim that would entitle them to relief under any alternative theory. <em>See Ravelo, </em>66 Haw. at 198\u201499; <em>Au, </em>63 Haw. at 214, 626 P.2d at 177; <em>Marsland, </em>5 Haw. App. at 474-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">We conclude that the circuit court\u2019s order runs aground on the shoals of the Hawaii Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause and that, on the record before us, unresolved factual questions preclude entry of judgment, as a matter of law, in favor of Lewin and against the plaintiffs. Before we address the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim, however, it is necessary as a threshold matter to consider their allegations regarding the right to privacy (and, derivatively, due process of law) within the context of the record in its present embryonic form.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">B. The Right to Privacy Does Not Include a Fundamental Right to Same-Sex Marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">It is now well established that \u201c \u2018a right to personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy,\u2019 is implicit in the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Mueller, </em>66 Haw. 616, 618, 671 P.2d 1351, 1353 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>(1983) (quoting Roe <em>v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 152, 93 S. Ct. 705, 726, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973)). And article I, section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution expressly states that \u201c[t]he right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d Haw. Const, art. I, \u00a7 6 (1978). The framers of the Hawaii Constitution declared that the \u201cprivacy concept\u201d embodied in article I, section 6 is to be \u201ctreated as a fundamental right[.]\u201d <em>State v. Kam, </em>69 Haw. 483, 493, 748 P.2d 372, 378 (1988) (citing Comm. Whole Rep. No. 15, in 1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978, at 1024 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When article I, section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution was being adopted, the 1978 Hawaii Constitutional Convention, acting as a committee of the whole, clearly articulated the rationale for its adoption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">By amending the Constitution to include a separate and distinct privacy right, it is the intent of your Committee to insure that privacy is treated as a fundamental right for purposes of constitutional analysis____This right is similar to the privacy right discussed in cases such as <em>Gris-wold v. Connecticut, </em>[381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)], <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird, </em>[405 U.S. 438, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 31 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1972)], <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>etc. It is a right that, though unstated in the federal Constitution, emanates from the penumbra of several guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Because of this, there has been some confusion as to the source of the right and the importance of it. As such, it is treated as a fundamental right subject to interference only when a compelling state interest is demonstrated. By inserting clear and specific language regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>this right into the Constitution, your Committee intends to alleviate any possible confusion over the source of the right and the existence of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Comm. Whole Rep. No. 15, 1 Proceedings, at 1024. This court cited the same passage in <em>Mueller, </em>66 Haw. at 625-26, 671 P.2d at 1357-58, in an attempt to determine the \u201cintended scope of privacy protected by the Hawaii Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626,671 P.2d at 1358. We ultimately concluded in <em>Mueller </em>that the federal cases cited by the Convention\u2019s committee of the whole should guide our construction of the intended scope of article I, section 6. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Accordingly, there is no doubt that, at a minimum, article I, section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution encompasses all of the fundamental rights expressly recognized as being subsumed within the privacy protections of the United States Constitution. In this connection, the United States Supreme Court has declared that \u201cthe right to marry is part of the fundamental \u2018right of privacy implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 384, 98 S. Ct. 673, 680, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1978). The issue in the present case is, therefore, whether the \u201cright to many\u201d protected by article I, section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution extends to same-sex couples. Because article I, section 6 was expressly derived from the general right to privacy under the United States Constitution and because there are no Hawaii cases that have delineated the fundamental right to marry, this court, as we did in <em>Mueller, </em>looks to federal cases for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The United States Supreme Court first characterized the right of marriage as fundamental in <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, </em>316 U.S. 535, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L. Ed. 1655(1942). In <em>Skinner, </em>the right to marry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>was inextricably linked to the right of procreation. The dispute before the court arose out of an Oklahoma statute that allowed the state to sterilize \u201chabitual criminals\u201d without their consent. In striking down the statute, the <em>Skinner </em>court indicated that it was \u201cdealing... with legislation which involve[d] <em>one of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\u201d Id. </em>at 541,62 S. Ct. at 1113 (emphasis added). Whetherthe court viewed marriage and procreation as a single indivisible right, the least that can be said is that it was obviously contemplating unions between men and women when it ruled that the right to marry was fundamental. This is hardly surprising inasmuch as none of the United States sanctioned any other marriage configuration at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The United States Supreme Court has set forth its most detailed discussion of the fundamental right to marry in <em>Zablocki, supra, </em>which involved a Wisconsin statute that prohibited any resident of the state with minor children \u201cnot in his custody and which he is under obligation to support\u201d from obtaining a marriage license until the resident demonstrated to a court that he was in compliance with his child support obligations. 434 U.S. at 376,98 S. Ct. at 675. The <em>Zablocki </em>court held that the statute burdened the fundamental right to marry; applying the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard to the statute, the court invalidated it as violative of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 390-91,98 S. Ct. at 683. In so doing, the <em>Zablocki </em>court delineated its view of the evolution of the federally recognized fundamental right of marriage as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">Long ago, in <em>Maynard v. Hill, </em>125 U.S. 190[, 8 S. Ct. 723, 31 L. Ed. 654] (1888), the Court characterized marriage as \u201cthe most important relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in life,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 205, [8 S. Ct., at 726,] and as \u201cthe foundation of the family and of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 211[, 8 S. Ct., at 729]. In <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390[, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042] (1923), the Court recognized that the right \u201cto marry, establish a home and bring up children\u201d is a central part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, <em>id., </em>at 399, [43 S. Ct., at 626,] and in <em>Skinner u. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, supra, </em>marriage was described as \u201cfundamental to the very existence and survival of the race,\u201d 316 U.S., at 541[, 62 S. Ct., at 1113].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">It is not surprising that the decision to marry has been placed on the same level of importance as decisions relating to procreation, childbirth, child rearing, and family relationships. As the facts of this case illustrate, it would make little sense to recognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of family life and not with respect to the decision to enter the relationship that is the foundation of the family in our society. The woman whom appellee desired to marry had a fundamental right to seek an abortion of their expected child, <em>see Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>or to bring the child into life to suffer the myriad social, if not economic, disabilities that the status of illegitimacy brings .... Surely, a decision to marry and raise the child in a traditional family setting must receive equivalent protection. And, if appellee\u2019s right to procreate means anything at all, it must imply some right to enter the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>relationship in which the State of Wisconsin allows sexual relations legally to take place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 384-86, 98 S. Ct. at 680-81 (citations and footnote omitted). Implicit in the <em>Zablocki </em>court\u2019s link between the right to marry, on the one hand, and the fundamental rights of procreation, childbirth, abortion, and child rearing, on the other, is the assumption that the one is simply the logical predicate of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The foregoing case law demonstrates that the federal construct of the fundamental right to marry \u2014 subsumed within the right to privacy implicitly protected by the United States Constitution \u2014 presently contemplates unions between men and women. (Once again, this is hardly surprising inasmuch as such unions are the only state-sanctioned marriages currently acknowledged in this country.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Therefore, the precise question facing this court is whether we will extend the <em>present </em>boundaries of the fundamental right of marriage to include same-sex couples, or, put another way, whether we will hold that same-sex couples possess a fundamental right to marry. In effect, as the applicant couples frankly admit, we are being asked to recognize a new fundamental right. There is no doubt that \u201c[a]s the ultimate judicial tribunal with final, unreviewable authority to interpret and enforce the Hawaii Constitution, we are free to give broader privacy protection [under article I, section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution] than that given by the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Kant, </em>69 Haw. at 491, 748 P.2d at 377 (citations omitted). However, we have also held that the privacy right found in article I, section 6 is similar to the federal right and that no \u201cpurpose to lend talismanic effect\u201d to abstract phrases such as \u201cintimate decision\u201d or \u201cpersonal autonomy\u201d can \u201cbe inferred from [article I, section 6], any more than ... from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the federal decisions.\u201d <em>Mueller, </em>66 Haw. at 630, 671 P.2d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In <em>Mueller, </em>this court, in attempting to circumscribe the scope of article I, section 6, found itself ultimately \u201cled back to\u201d the landmark United States Supreme Court cases \u201cin [its] search for guidance\u201d on the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 626, 671 P.2d at 1358. In the case that first recognized a fundamental right to privacy, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678 (1965), the court declared that it was \u201cdeal[ing] with a right . . . older than the Bill of Rights!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 85 S. Ct. at 1682. And in a concurring opinion, Justice Goldberg observed that judges \u201cdetermining which rights are fundamental\u201d must look not to \u201cpersonal and private notions,\u201d but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">to the \u201ctraditions and [collective] conscience of our people\u201d to determine whether a principle is \u201cso rooted [there]... as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d .. . The inquiry is whether a right involved \u201cis of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those \u2018fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions\u2019. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 493, 85 S. Ct. at 1686-87 (Goldberg, J., concurring) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Applying the foregoing standards to the present case, we do not believe that a right to same-sex marriage is so rooted in the traditions and collective conscience of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>people that failure to recognize it would violate the fundamental principles of liberty and justice that lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions. Neither do we believe that a right to same-sex marriage is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if it were sacrificed. Accordingly, we hold that the applicant couples do not have a fundamental constitutional right to same-sex marriage arising out of the right to privacy or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Our holding, however, does not leave the applicant couples without a potential remedy in this case. As we will discuss below, the applicant couples are free to press their equal protection claim. If they are successful, the State of Hawaii will no longer be permitted to refuse marriage licenses to couples merely on the basis that they are of the same sex. But there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples under article I, section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">C. Inasmuch as the Applicant Couples Claim That the Express Terms of HRS \u00a7 572-1, which Discriminates against Same-Sex Marriages, Violate Their Rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Hawaii Constitution, the Applicant Couples Are Entitled to an Evidentiary Hearing to Determine Whether Lewin Can Demonstrate that HRS \u00a7 572-1 Furthers Compelling State Interests and Is Narrowly Drawn to Avoid Unnecessary Abridgments of Constitutional Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In addition to the alleged violation of their constitutional rights to privacy and due process of law, the applicant couples contend that they have been denied the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by artr \u2019 <em>\u00bf </em>section 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>of the Hawaii Constitution. On appeal, the plaintiffs urge and, on the state of the bare record before us, we agree that the circuit court erred when it concluded, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that: (1) homosexuals do not constitute a \u201csuspect class\u201d for purposes of equal protection analysis under article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (2) the classification created by HRS \u00a7 572-1 is not subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d but must satisfy only the \u201crational relationship\u201d test; and (3) HRS \u00a7 572-1 satisfies the rational relationship test because the legislature \u201cobviously designed [it] to promote the general welfare interests of the community by sanctioning traditional man-woman family units and procreation.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">1. Marriage is a state-conferred, legal partnership status, the existence of which gives rise to a multiplicity of rights and benefits reserved exclusively to that particular relation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The power to regulate marriage is a sovereign function reserved exclusively to the respective states. <em>Salisbury v. List, </em>501 F. Supp. 105, 107 (D. Nev. 1980); <em>see O\u2019Neill v. Dent, </em>364 F. Supp. 565 (E.D.N.Y. 1973). By its very nature, the power to regulate the marriage relation includes the power to determine the requisites of a valid marriage contract and to control the qualifications of the contracting parties, the forms and procedures necessary to solemnize the marriage, the duties and obligations it creates, its effect upon property and other rights, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>grounds for marital dissolution. Id.; <em>see also Maynard v. Hill, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In other words, marriage is a state-conferred legal status, the existence of which gives rise to rights and benefits reserved exclusively to that particular relationship. This court construes marriage as \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>partnership to which both partners bring their financial resources as well as their individual energies and efforts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gussin v. Gussin, </em>73 Haw. 470, 483, 836 P.2d 484, 491 (1992) (citation omitted); <em>Myers v.

So zealously has this court guarded the state\u2019s role as the exclusive progenitor of the marital partnership that it declared, over seventy years ago, that \u201ccommon law\u201d marriages \u2014 i.e., \u201cmarital\u201d unions existing in the absence of a state-issued license and not performed by a person or society possessing governmental authority to solemnize marriages \u2014 would no longer be recognized in the Territory of Hawaii. <em>Parke v.

HRS \u00a7 572-1(7), descended from an 1872 statute of the Hawaiian Kingdom, conditions a valid marriage contract on \u201c[t]he marriage ceremony be[ing] performed in the State by a person or society with a valid license to solemnize marriages[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 572-11 (1985) accords the DOH sole authority to grant licenses to solemnize marriages, and HRS \u00a7 572-12 (1985) restricts the issuance of such licenses to clergy, representatives of religious societies (such as the Society of Friends) not having clergy but providing solemnization by custom, and judicial officers. Finally, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 572-5 and 572-6 vest the DOH with exclusive authority to issue licenses to marriage applicants and to ensure that the general requisites and procedures prescribed by HRS chapter 572 are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The applicant couples correctly contend that the DOH\u2019s refusal to allow them to marry on the basis that they are members of the same sex deprives them of access to a multiplicity of rights and benefits that are contingent upon that status. Although it is unnecessary in this opinion to engage in an encyclopedic recitation of all of them, a number of the most salient marital rights and benefits are worthy of note. They include: (1) a variety of state income tax advantages, including deductions, credits, rates, exemptions, and estimates, under HRS chapter 235 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (2) public assistance from and exemptions relating to the Department of Human Services under HRS chapter 346 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (3) control, division, acquisition, and disposition of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>munity property under HRS chapter 510 (1985); (4) rights relating to dower, curtesy, and inheritance under HRS chapter 533 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (5) rights to notice, protection, benefits, and inheritance under the Uniform Probate Code, HRS chapter 560 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (6) award of child custody and support payments in divorce proceedings under HRS chapter 571 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (7) the right to spousal support pursuant to HRS \u00a7 572-24 (1985); (8) the right to enter into premarital agreements under HRS chapter 572D (Supp. 1992); (9) the right to change of name pursuant to HRS \u00a7 574-5(a)(3) (Supp. 1992); (10) the right to file a nonsupport action under HRS chapter 575 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (11) post-divorce rights relating to support and property division under HRS chapter 580 (1985 and Supp. 1992); (12) the benefit of the spousal privilege and confidential marital communications pursuant to Rule 505 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence (1985); (13) the benefit of the exemption of real property from attachment or execution under HRS chapter 651 (1985); and (14) the right to bring a wrongful death action under HRS chapter 663 (1985 and Supp. 1992). For present purposes, it is not disputed that the applicant couples would be entitled to all of these marital rights and benefits, but for the fact that they are denied access to the state-conferred legal status of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">2. HRS \u00a7 572-1, on its face, discriminates based on sex against the applicant couples in the exercise of the civil right of marriage, thereby implicating the equal protection clause of article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Notwithstanding the state\u2019s acknowledged stewardship over the institution of marriage, the extent of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>missible state regulation of the right of access to the marital relationship is subject to constitutional limitations or constraints. <em>See, e.g., Zablocki, </em>435 U.S. at 388-91, 98 S.

The fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution somewhat concisely provides, in relevant part, that a state may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Hawaii\u2019s counterpart is more elaborate. Article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person shall... be denied the equal protection of the laws, <em>nor be denied the enjoyment of the person\u2019s civil rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of </em>race, religion, <em>sex, </em>or ancestry.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, by its plain language, the Hawaii Constitution prohibits state-sanctioned discrimination against any person in the exercise of his or her civil rights on the basis of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u201cThe freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>pursuit of happiness by free [people].\u201d <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 12, 87 S.

It is the state\u2019s regulation of access to the status of married persons, on the basis of the applicants\u2019 sex, that gives rise to the question whether the applicant couples have been denied the equal protection of the laws in violation of article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Relying primarily on four decisions construing the law of other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Lewin contends that \u201cthe fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>homosexual [sic \u2014 actually, same-sex]<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> partners cannot form a state-licensed marriage is not the product of impermissible discrimination\u201d implicating equal protection considerations, but rather \u201ca function of their biologic inability as a couple to satisfy the definition of the status to which they aspire.\u201d Lewin\u2019s answering brief at 21. Put differently, Lewin proposes that \u201cthe right of persons of the same sex to marry one another does not exist because marriage, by definition and usage, means a special relationship between a man and a woman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. We believe Lewin\u2019s argument to be circular and unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Two of the decisions upon which Lewin relies are demonstrably inapposite to the appellant couples\u2019 claim. In <em>Baker v. Nelson, </em>291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. 37, 34 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1972), the questions for decision were whether a marriage of two persons of the same sex was authorized by state statutes and, if not, whether state authorization was compelled by various provisions of the United States Constitution, including the fourteenth amendment. Regarding the first question, the <em>Baker </em>court arrived at the same conclusion as have we with respect to HRS \u00a7 572-1: by their plain language, the Minnesota marriage statutes precluded same-sex marriages. Regarding the second question, however, the court merely held that the United States Constitution was not offended; apparently, no state constitutional questions were raised and none were addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\"><em>De Santo v. Barnsley, </em>328 Pa. Super. 181, 476 A.2d 952 (1984), is also distinguishable. In <em>De Santo, </em>the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>held only that common law same-sex marriage did not exist in Pennsylvania, a result irrelevant to the present case. The appellants sought to assert that denial of same-sex common law marriages violated the state\u2019s equal rights amendment, but the appellate court expressly declined to reach the issue because it had not been raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Jones v.

In <em>Jones, </em>the appellants, both females, sought review of a judgment that held that they were not entitled to have a marriage license issued to them, contending that refusal to issue the license deprived them of the basic constitutional rights to marry, associate, and exercise religion freely.

Analogously to Lewin\u2019s argument and the rationale of the <em>Jones </em>court, the Virginia courts declared that interracial marriage simply could not exist because the Deity had deemed such a union intrinsically unnatural, 388 U.S. at 3, 87 S. Ct. at 1819, and, in effect, because it had theretofore never been the \u201ccustom\u201d of the state to recognize mixed marriages, marriage \u201calways\u201d having been construed to presuppose a different configuration. With all due respect to the Virginia courts of a bygone era, we do not believe that trial judges are the ultimate authorities on the subject of Divine Will, and, as <em>Loving </em>amply demonstrates, constitutional law may mandate, like it or not, that customs change with an evolving social order.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\"><em>Singer v. Hara, </em>11 Wash. App. 247, 522 P.2d 1187, <em>review denied, </em>84 Wash. 2d 1008 (1974), suffers the same fate as does <em>Jones. </em>In <em>Singer, </em>two males appealed from a trial court\u2019s order denying their motion to show cause by which they sought to compel the county auditor to issue them a marriage license. On appeal, the unsuccessful applicants argued that: (1) the trial court erred in concluding that the Washington state marriage laws prohibited same-sex marriages; (2) the trial court\u2019s order violated the equal rights amendment to the state constitution; and (3) the trial court\u2019s order violated various provisions of the United States Constitution, including the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s order, rejecting all three of the appellants\u2019 contentions. Predictably, and for the same reasons that we have reached the identical conclusion regarding HRS \u00a7 572-1, the <em>Singer </em>court determined that it was \u201capparent from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>plain reading of our marriage statutes that the legislature has not authorized same-sex marriages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 522 P.2d at 1189. Regarding the appellants\u2019 federal and state claims, the court specifically \u201c[did] not take exception to the proposition that <em>the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict judicial scrutiny of legislative attempts at sexual discrimination.\u201d Id. </em>at 261, 522 P.2d at 1196 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the <em>Singer </em>court found no defect in the state\u2019s marriage laws, under either the United States Constitution or the state constitution\u2019s equal rights amendment, based upon the rationale of <em>Jones: </em>\u201c[a]ppellants were not denied a marriage license because of their sex; rather, they were denied a marriage license because of the nature of marriage itself.\u201d <em>Id.

Equal Protection Analysis under Article I, Section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\u201cWhenever a denial of equal protection of the laws is alleged, as a rule our initial inquiry has been whether the legislation in question should be subjected to \u2018strict scrutiny\u2019 or to a \u2018rational basis\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Nakano v. Matayoshi, </em>68 Haw. 140, 151, 706 P.2d 814, 821 (1985) (citing <em>Nagle v. Board of Educ., </em>63 Haw. 389, 392, 629 P.2d 109, 111 (1981)). This court has applied \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d analysis to \u201c \u2018laws classifying on the basis of suspect categories or impinging upon fundamental rights expressly or impliedly granted by the [constitution,\u2019 \u201d in which case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the laws are \u201c \u2018presumed to be unconstitutional<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> unless the state shows compelling state interests which justify such classifications,\u2019 \u201d <em>Holdman v. Olim, </em>59 Haw. 346, 349, 581 P.2d 1164, 1167 (1978) (citing <em>Nelson v. Miwa, </em>56 Haw. 601, 605 n.4,546 P.2d 1005,1008 n.4 (1976)), and that the laws are \u201cnarrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Nagle, </em>63 Haw. at 392, 629 P.2d at 111 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">By contrast, \u201c[wjhere \u2018suspect\u2019 classifications or fundamental rights are not at issue, this court has traditionally employed the rational basis test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393,629 P.2d at 112. \u201cUnder the rational basis test, we inquire as to whether a statute rationally furthers a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Estate of Coates v. Pacific Engineering, </em>71 Haw. 358, 364, 791 P.2d 1257, 1260 (1990). \u201cOur inquiry seeks only to determine whether any reasonable justification can be found for the legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\"><em>As </em>we have indicated, HRS \u00a7 572-1, on its face and as applied, regulates access to the marital status and its concomitant rights and benefits on the basis of the applicants\u2019 sex. <em>See supra </em>at 563-64. As such, HRS \u00a7 572-1 establishes a sex-based classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">HRS \u00a7 572-1 is not the first sex-based classification with which this court has been confronted. In <em>Holdman v. Olim, supra, </em>a woman prison visitor (Holdman) brought an action against prison officials seeking injunctive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>monetary, and declaratory relief arising from a prison matron\u2019s refusal to admit Holdman entry when she was not wearing a brassiere. The matron\u2019s refusal derived from a directive, promulgated by the Acting Prison Administrator, that \u201cvisitors will be properly dressed. <em>Women </em>visitors are asked to be fully clothed, including undergarments. Provocative attire is discouraged.\u201d 59 Haw. at 347-48, 581 P.2d at 1166 (emphasis added). Holdman proceeded to trial, and the circuit court dismissed her action at the close of her case in chief. <em>Id. </em>at 347, 581 P.2d at 1165-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On appeal, this court affirmed the dismissal of Holdman\u2019s complaint. The significance of <em>Holdman </em>for present purposes, however, is the rationale by which this court reached its result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">This court has not [heretofore] dealt with a sex-based classification. In <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1973), a plurality of the United States Supreme Court favored the inclusion of classifications based upon sex among those considered to be suspect for the purposes of the compelling state interest test. However, subsequent cases have made it clear that the current governing test under the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] is a standard intermediate between rational basis and strict scrutiny. \u201c[Classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.\u201d <em>Craig v. Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190,197[, 97 S. Ct. 451, 457, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397] (1976). <em>Also see Califano v. Goldfarb, </em>430 U.S. 199, 2[10 n.8, 97 S. Ct. 1021, 1028, n.8, 51 L. Ed. 2d 270] (1977) and <em>Califano </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>v. Webster, </em>430 U.S. 313, 316-17[, 97 S. Ct. 1192, 1194, 51 L. Ed. 2d 360] (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Dress standards are intimately related to sexual attitudes. . . . The dress restrictions imposed upon women visitors by the directive derived their relation to prison security out of the assumption that these attitudes were present among the residents. Whether or not this assumption was correct, it is manifest that the directive was substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental objective of prison security and met the test under the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">[Holdman\u2019s] challenge to the directive under the state constitution requires separate consideration. Article I, Section 4<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> of the Hawaii Constitution declares that no person shall be \u201cdenied the equal protection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment of [the person\u2019s] civil rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of race, religion, sex or ancestry.\u201d Article I, Section 21<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> provides: \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the State on account of sex.\u201d We are presented with two questions, either of which might be dispositive of the present case. We must first inquire whether the treatment [Holdman] received denied to her the equal protection of the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>guaranteed by the Hawaii Constitution under a more stringent test than that applicable under the Fourteenth Amendment. If the more general guarantee of equal protection does not sustain [Holdman\u2019s] claims, we must then inquire whether the specific guarantee of equality of rights under the law contained in Article I, Section 21, has been infringed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\"><em>It is open to this court, of course, to apply the more stringent test of compelling state interest to sex-based classifications in assessing their validity under the equal protection clause of the state constitution. State v. Kaluna, 55 </em>Haw. 361, 520 P.2d 51 (1974). [Holdman] urges that we do so, arguing both from <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, </em>and from the presence of sex with race, religion and ancestry as a category specifically named in Article I, Section 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>We need not deal finally with that issue, and reserve it for future consideration, since we conclude that the compelling state interest test would be satisfied in this case if it were to be held applicable. . . .</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\"><em>Survival under the strict scrutiny test places the directive beyond [Holdman\u2019s] challenge under her asserted . . . right to equal protection </em>....

Unless we are to attempt in this case to define the standard of review required under Hawaii\u2019s ERA, no purpose will be served by analysis of the considerable body of decisions which fall short of dealing with that question. ... We <em>have concluded that the treatment of which [Holdman] complains withstands the test of strict scrutiny by reason of a compelling State interest. </em>We are not prepared to hold in this case that____a more stringent test should be applied under Article I, Section 21 ... .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 349-54, 581 P.2d at 1167-69 (emphasis added and citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Our decision in <em>Holdman </em>is key to the present case in several respects. First, we clearly and unequivocally established, for purposes of equal protection analysis under the Hawaii Constitution, that sex-based classifications are subject, as a <em>per se </em>matter, to some form of \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny, be it \u201cstrict\u201d or \u201cintermediate,\u201d rather than mere \u201crational basis\u201d analysis.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Second, we assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that such sex-based classifications were subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d Third, we reaffirmed the longstanding principle that this court is free to accord greater protections to Hawaii\u2019s citizens under the state constitution than are recognized under the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Constitution.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And fourth, we looked to the <em>then current </em>case law of the United States Supreme Court for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court cited in <em>Holdman, Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, </em>was by far the most significant. In <em>Frontiero, </em>a married woman air force officer and her husband (the Frontieros) filed suit against the Secretary of Defense seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of federal statutes governing quarters allowances and medical benefits for members of the uniformed services. The statutes provided, solely for administrative convenience, that spouses of male members were unconditionally considered dependents for purposes of obtaining such allowances and benefits, but that spouses of female members were not considered dependents unless they were in fact dependent for more than one-half of their support. The Frontieros\u2019 lawsuit was precipitated by the husband\u2019s inability to satisfy the statutory dependency standard. A three-judge district court panel denied the Frontieros\u2019 claim for relief, and they appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Noting that \u201c[u]nder these statutes, a serviceman may claim his wife as a \u2018dependent\u2019 without regard to whether she is in fact dependent upon him for any part of her support[,]\u201d but that \u201c[a] servicewoman . . . may not claim her husband as a \u2018dependent\u2019... unless he is in fact dependent upon her for over one-half of his support[,]\u201d a plurality of four, through Justice Brennan (the Brennan plurality), framed the issue on appeal as \u201cwhether this difference in treatment constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen . . . 411 U.S. at 678-79, 93 S. Ct. at 1766. By an eight-to-one majority, the court concluded that the statutes established impermissibly differential treatment between men and women and, accordingly, reversed the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The disagreement among the eight-justice majority lay in the level of judicial scrutiny applicable to instances of statutory sex-based discrimination. The Brennan plurality agreed with the Frontieros\u2019 contention that \u201cclassifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national origin, are inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to close judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682, 93 S. Ct. at 1768 (footnotes omitted). Thus, the Brennan plurality applied the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard to its review of the illegal statutes. Justice Stewart concurred in the judgment, \u201cagreeing that the statutes . . . work[ed] an invidious discrimination in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 93 S. Ct. at 1772-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Particularly noteworthy in <em>Frontiero, </em>however, was the concurring opinion of Justice Powell, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Blackmun (the Powell group). The Powell group agreed that, \u201cthe challenged statutes constitute^] an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen,\u201d but deemed it \u201cunnecessary for the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>in this case </em>to characterize sex as a suspect classification, with all of the far-reaching implications of such a holding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691-92, 93 S. Ct. at 1773 (emphasis added and citation omitted). Central to the Powell group\u2019s thinking was the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Ther\u00e9 is another . . . reason for deferring a general categorizing of sex classifications as invoking the strictest test of judicial scrutiny. <em>The Equal Rights Amendment, which if adopted will resolve the substance of this precise question, </em>has been approved by the Congress and submitted for ratification by the States. If this Amendment is duly adopted, it will represent the will of the people accomplished in the manner prescribed by the Constitution. By acting prematurely and unnecessarily, . . . the Court has assumed a decisional responsibility at the very time when state legislatures, functioning within the traditional democratic process, are debating the proposed Amendment. It seems... that this reaching out to pre-empt by judicial action a major political decision which is currently in process of resolution does not reflect appropriate respect for duly prescribed legislative processes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 692, 93 S. Ct. at 1773 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The Powell group\u2019s concurring opinion therefore permits but one inference: had the Equal Rights Amendment been incorporated into the United States Constitution, at least seven members (and probably eight) of <em>the Frontiero </em>court would have subjected statutory sex-based classifications to \u201cstrict\u201d judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">In light of the interrelationship between the reasoning of the Brennan plurality and the Powell group in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Frontiero, </em>on the one hand, and the presence of article I, section 3 \u2014 the Equal Rights Amendment \u2014 in the Hawaii Constitution, on the other, it is time to resolve once and for all the question left dangling in <em>Holdman. </em>Accordingly, we hold that sex is a \u201csuspect category\u201d for purposes of equal protection analysis under article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and that HRS \u00a7 572-1 is subject to the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test. It therefore follows, and we so hold, that (1) HRS \u00a7 572-1 is presumed to be unconstitutional (2) unless Lewin, as an agent of the State of Hawaii, can show that (a) the statute\u2019s sex-based classification is justified by compelling state interests and (b) the statute is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of the applicant couples\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">4. The dissenting opinion misconstrues the holdings and reasoning of the plurality.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We would be remiss if we did not address certain basic misconstructions of this opinion appearing in Judge Heen\u2019s dissent. First, we have <em>not </em>held, as Judge Heen seems to imply, that (1) the appellants \u201chave a \u2018civil right\u2019 to a same sex marriage[,J\u201d (2) \u201cthe civil right to marriage must be accorded to same sex couplest,]\u201d and (3) the applicant couples \u201chave a right to a same sex marriage[.]\u201d Dissenting opinion at 588-89. These conclusions would be premature. We have, however, noted that the United States Supreme Court has recognized for over fifty years that marriage is a basic civil right. <em>See supra </em>at 562-64. That proposition is relevant to the prohibition set forth in article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>discrimination in the exercise of a person\u2019s civil rights, <em>inter alia, </em>on the basis of sex. <em>See id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Second, we have <em>not </em>held, as Judge Heen also seems to imply, that HRS \u00a7 572-1 \u201cunconstitutionally discriminates against [the applicant couples] who seek a license to enter into a same sex marriage[.]\u201d Dissenting opinion at 588. Such a holding would likewise be premature at this time. What we <em>have </em>held is that, on its face and as applied, HRS \u00a7 572-1 denies same-sex couples access to the marital status and its concomitant rights and benefits, thus implicating the equal protection clause of article I, section 5. <em>See supra </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We understand that Judge Heen disagrees with our view in this regard based on his belief that \u201cHRS \u00a7 572-1 treats everyone alike and applies equally to both sexes[,]\u201d with the result that \u201c[n]either sex is <em>being granted </em>a right or benefit the other does not have, and neither sex is being <em>denied </em>a right or benefit that the other has.\u201d Dissenting opinion at 590-91 (emphasis in original). The rationale underlying Judge Heen\u2019s belief, however, was expressly considered and rejected in <em>Loving:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">Thus, the State contends that, because its miscegenation statutes punish equally both the white and the Negro participants in an interracial marriage, these statutes, despite their reliance on racial classifications do not constitute an invidious discrimination based upon race. . . . [W]e reject the notion that the mere \u201cequal application\u201d of a statute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s proscriptions of all invidious discriminations .... In the case at bar, ... we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">388 U.S. at 8, 87 S. Ct. at 1821-22. Substitution of \u201csex\u201d for \u201crace\u201d and article I, section 5 for the fourteenth amendment yields the precise case before us together with the conclusion that we have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">As a final matter, we are compelled to respond to Judge Heen\u2019s suggestion that denying the appellants access to the multitude of statutory benefits \u201cconferred upon spouses in a legal marriage ... is a matter for the legislature, which can express the will of the populace in deciding whether such benefits should be extended to persons in [the applicant couples\u2019] circumstances.\u201d Dissenting opinion at 597. In effect, we are being accused of engaging injudicial legislation. We are not. The result we reach today is in complete harmony with the <em>Loving </em>court\u2019s observation that any state\u2019s powers to regulate marriage are subject to the constraints imposed by the constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws. 388 U.S. at 7, 87 S. Ct. at 1821. If it should ultimately be determined that the marriage laws of Hawaii impermissibly discriminate against the appellants, based on the suspect category of sex, then that would be the result of the interrelation of existing legislation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">[W]hether the legislation under review is wise or unwise is a matter with which we have nothing to do. Whether it . . . work[s] well or work[s] ill presents a question entirely irrelevant to the issue. The only legitimate inquiry we can make is whether it is constitutional. If it is not, its virtues, if it have any, cannot save it; if it is, its faults cannot be invoked to accomplish its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>destruction. If the provisions of the Constitution be not upheld when they pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be abandoned.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A1E\"><em>Daniel R.

Moreover, in my view, Appellants\u2019 claim that they are being discriminatorily denied statutory benefits accorded to spouses in a legalized marriage should be addressed to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Citing <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010 (1967), the plurality holds that Appellants have a civil right to marriage. I disagree. \u201c \u2018It is axiomatic ... that a decision does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v. Superior Court, </em>8 Cal. App. 4th 688, 703, 10 Cal. Rptr. 2d 873, 881 (1992) (quoting <em>People v. Harris, </em>47 Cal. 3d 1047, 1071, 255 Cal. Rtpr. 352, 767 P.2d 619 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\"><em>Loving </em>is simply not authority for the plurality\u2019s proposition that the civil right to marriage must be accorded to same sex couples. <em>Loving </em>points out that the right to marriage occupies an extremely venerated position in our society. So does every other case discussing marriage. However, the plaintiff in <em>Loving </em>was not claiming a right to a same sex marriage. <em>Loving </em>involved a marriage between a white male and a black female whose marriage, which took place in Washington, D.C., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>was refused recognition in Virginia under that state\u2019s miscegenation laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The plurality also cites <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1978), as establishing constitutional limits on the states\u2019 right to regulate marriage. That is an undeniable principle. In <em>Zablocki </em>an application for a marriage license by a male and a female was denied because the male was not able to show, pursuant to a Wisconsin statute\u2019s requirement, that he was in compliance with all existing obligations for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"><em>Loving </em>and <em>Zablocki </em>neither establish the right to a same sex marriage nor limit a state\u2019s power to prohibit any person from entering into such a marriage. The plurality\u2019s conclusion here that Appellants have a right to a same sex marriage and, therefore, an evidentiary hearing is completely contrary to the clear import of <em>Zablocki </em>and <em>Loving.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">Although appellants suggest an analogy between the racial classification involved in <em>Loving </em>and <em>Perez </em>and the alleged sexual classification involved in the case at bar, we do not find such an analogy. The operative distinction lies in the relationship which is described by the term \u201cmarriage\u201d itself, and that relationship is the legal union of one man and one woman. Washington statutes, specifically those relating to marriage . . . and marital (community) property . . ., are clearly founded upon the presumption that marriage, as a legal relationship, may exist only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>between one man and one woman who are otherwise qualified to enter that relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">[AJppellants are not being denied entry into the marriage relationship because of their sex; rather, they are being denied entry into the marriage relationship because of the recognized definition of that relationship as one which may be entered into only by two persons who are members of the opposite sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\"><em>Singer v. Hara, </em>11 Wash. App. 247, 253-55, 522 P.2d 1187, 1191\u201492, <em>review denied, </em>84 Wash. 2d 1008 (1974) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The issue of a right to a same sex marriage has been considered by the courts in four other states. Those courts arrive at the opposite conclusion from the plurality here. <em>See Jones v. Hallahan, </em>501 S.W.2d 588 (Ky. Ct. App. 1973); <em>Baker v. Nelson, </em>291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. 37, 34 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1972); <em>De Santo v. Barnsley, </em>328 Pa. Super. 181, 476 A.2d 952 (1984); <em>Singer v. Hara, supra. </em>I do not agree with the plurality\u2019s contention that those cases are not precedent for this case. The basic issue in each of those four cases, as in this one, was whether any person has the right to legally marry another person of the same sex. Neither do I agree with the plurality that <em>Loving </em>refutes the reasoning of the courts in those four cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">HRS \u00a7 572-1 treats everyone alike and applies equally to both sexes. The effect of the statute is to prohibit same sex marriages on the part of professed or non-professed heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>asexuals, and does not effect an invidious discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws means that no person or class of persons shall be denied the same privileges and benefits under the laws that are enjoyed by other persons or other classes of persons in like circumstances. <em>Mahiai v. Suwa, </em>69 Haw. 349, 742 P.2d 359 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">HRS \u00a7 572-1 does not establish a \u201csuspect\u201d classification based on gender<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because all males and females are treated alike. A male cannot obtain a license to marry another male, and a female cannot obtain a license to marry another female. Neither sex is being <em>granted </em>a right or benefit the other does not have, and neither sex is being <em>denied </em>a right or benefit that the other has.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">My thesis is well illustrated by the case of <em>Phillips v. Wisconsin Personnel Comm\u2019n, </em>167 Wis. 2d 205, 482 N.W.2d 121 (Ct. App. 1992). In that case, the plaintiff, an unmarried female, was denied medical benefits for her unmarried female \u201cdependent\u201d lesbian companion because Phillips\u2019 state health plan defined \u201cdependent\u201d as spouse or children. Phillips appealed the commission\u2019s dismissal of her gender discrimination complaint and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, in striking down her claim, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>dependent insurance coverage is unavailable to unmarried companions of both male <em>and </em>female employees. A statute is only subject to a challenge for gender discrimination under the equal protection clause when it discriminates on its face, or in effect, between males and females.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\"><em>Id. </em>167 Wis. 2d at 227, 482 N.W.2d at 129 (emphasis in original and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Similarly, HRS \u00a7 572-1 does not discriminate on the basis of gender. The statute applies equally to <em>all </em>unmarried persons, both male and female, who desire to enter into a legally recognized marriage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, no evidentiary hearing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The cases cited by the plurality to support its holding that Appellants are a \u201csuspect class\u201d are inapposite.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unlike the instant case, the facts in both cases show government regulations preferring one gender (class) over another. In <em>Holdman v. Olim, </em>59 Haw. 346, 581 P.2d 1164 (1978), the prison regulation requiring female visitors to wear proper undergarments clearly affected only female visitors to the state prison system. Male visitors to the prison were not subject to such a regulation. The supreme court explicitly referred to the regulation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>being a sex-based classification. While the reasoning in <em>Holdman </em>is very interesting, it does not support the plurality\u2019s conclusion in this case that HRS \u00a7 572-1 creates a suspect class.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Likewise, <em>in Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1973), the federal statutes required that female members of the military service, but not male members, prove that they provided over one-half of their spouse\u2019s support in order to have the spouses classified as \u201cdependents.\u201d The statutes were clearly discriminatory, since male members of the military were favored over female members.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Since HRS \u00a7 572-1 is not invidiously discriminatory and Appellants are not members of a suspect class, this court should not require an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither should this court mandate that HRS \u00a7 572-1 be subjected to the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test. If anything, Appellants\u2019 challenge subjects the statute only to the \u201crational basis\u201d test. <em>Estate of Coates v. Pacific Engineering, </em>71 Haw. 358, 791 P.2d 1257 (1990). Thus, the issue is whether the statute rationally furthers a legitimate state interest. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>There is no question that such a rational relationship exists; therefore, the statute is a constitutional exercise of the legislature\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In my view, the purpose of HRS \u00a7 572-1 is analogous to the purpose of Washington\u2019s marriage license statute as stated in <em>Singer, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">In the instant case, it is apparent that the <em>state\u2019s refusal to grant a license allowing the appellants to marry one another is not based upon appellants\u2019 status as males, but rather it is based upon the state\u2019s recognition that our society as a whole views marriage as the appropriate and desirable forum for procreation and the rearing of children.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\"><em>. . </em>. <em>[MJarriage exists as a protected legal institution primarily because of societal values associated with the propagation of the human race. Further, it is apparent that no same-sex couple offers the possibility of the birth of children by their union. Thus the refusal of the state to authorize same sex marriage results from such impossibility of reproduction rather than from an invidious discrimination \u201con account of sex.\u201d </em>Therefore, the definition of marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman is permissible as applied to appellants, notwithstanding the prohibition contained in the ERA, because it is founded upon the unique physical characteristics of the sexes and appellants are not being discriminated against because of their status as males per se.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>Id. </em>11 Wash.

The court in <em>Singer </em>was considering the case in the light of that state\u2019s Equal Rights Amendment (identical to article I, \u00a7 3 of the Hawaii State Constitution). The Washington court\u2019s reasoning is pertinent, in my view, to Appellants\u2019 claim in the case at hand and supports the constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Furthermore, I cannot agree with the plurality that HRS \u00a7 572-1 is presumptively unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The general rule is that every statute is presumed to be constitutional, and the party challenging the law on constitutional grounds has the heavy burden of overcoming this presumption. <em>Washington v.

The statute treats everyone alike and applies equally to both sexes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\"> The plurality recognizes that the U.S. Supreme Court does not recognize sex or gender as a \u201csuspect\u201d classification, and thus gender has <em>not </em>historically been afforded the elevated \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\"> Indeed, it may be said that the statute establishes one classification: <em>unmarried persons.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> The plurality does not define \u201csuspect class.\u201d A suspect classification exists where the class of individuals formed by a statute, on its face or as administered, has been \u201csaddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S. Ct. </em>1278, 1294, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16, 40, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>411 U.S. 959, 93 S.Ct. 1919, 36 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\"> The apparent result of the plurality opinion is that Appellants do not have any burden of proof on remand. According to the plurality opinion, all Appellants need to do is appear in court and say, \u201cHere we are. The statute discriminates against us on the basis of our sex (whether male or female) and sex is a suspect class.\u201d Even in cases alleging racial discrimination (a suspect class), \u201cthe invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose^]\u201d and the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that discriminatory purpose. <em>Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 240, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 2048, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597, 607-08 (1976); <em>see State v. Tookes, </em>67 Haw. 608, 699 P.2d 983 (1985). The plurality opinion has eliminated the need for Appellants to prove purposeful discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> Since, in my view, the purpose of HRS \u00a7 572-1 is to promote and protect propagation, the concern expressed in Chief Judge Burns\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>concurring opinion as to whether the statute discriminates against persons who may be genetically impelled to homosexuality does not cause the statute to be invidiously discriminatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> In 1984, the state legislature amended HRS \u00a7 572-1 by deletingthe requirement that marriage applicants show they are not impotent or that they are not physically incapable of entering into a marriage. Act 119, \u00a7 1, 1984 Haw. Sess. Laws 238. The plurality contends that the amendment refutes my assertion that the purpose of HRS \u00a7 572-1 is to foster and protect the propagation of the human race. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">A careful reading of the senate committee report on the amendment indicates that the amendment does <em>not </em>attenuate the fundamental purpose of HRS \u00a7 572-1. The intent of the amendment was to remove any impediment that may prevent persons who are \u201cphysically handicapped, elderly, or have temporary physical limitations from entering into a valid marriage relationship.\u201d Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 570-84, in 1984 Senate Journal, at 1284. The amendment accommodates only persons with physical limitations on their productive capacities. With respect to those persons, the legislature stated that the view that the primary purpose of marriage is to bear children is \u201cnarrow and outdated.\u201d That characterization should not be expanded to include the applicants in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\"> I note that a number of municipalities across the country have adopted domestic \u2019partnership ordinances that confer such benefits on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the domestic partners as the municipalities have authority to grant.
