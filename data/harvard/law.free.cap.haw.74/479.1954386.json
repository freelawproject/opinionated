Kelekolio raises a number of substantial points of error on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but only one is outcome dispositive. Because the trial court committed plain error in failing to conduct a competency hearing regarding the complaining witness, and because we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless, we vacate Kelekolio\u2019s judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On January 6,1991, Kelekolio, a \u201cHandi-van\u201d driver, allegedly kidnapped his lone passenger (hereinafter referred to as (\u201cthe complainant\u201d)), drove the van he was operating into a parking lot, and sexually assaulted her. The complainant, who suffers from Down\u2019s Syndrome, is a mentally retarded woman and functions at the cognitive level of a four- to seven-year-old child. At the time, Kelekolio was transporting the complainant to her place of employment, Helemano Plantation, where she was receiving vocational training in food service.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">On January 16, 1991, Kelekolio was charged in a three-count indictment with (1) sexual assault in the second degree (Count I) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-731(l)(b) (Supp. 1992),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>assault in the third degree (Count II) in violation of HRS \u00a7 707-732(l)(c) (Supp. 1992),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and kidnapping (Count III) in violation of HRS \u00a7 707-720(l)(d) (Supp. 1992).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following a jury trial, Kelekolio was convicted of Counts I and III and was sentenced to two concurrent ten-year terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">A. Kelekolio\u2019s Confession 1. Voluntariness of Kelekolio\u2019s statement to Detective Earn</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The Honolulu Police Department (HPD) arrested Kelekolio on January 7, 1991, at 1:30 p.m. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Kelekolio was transferred from the Pearl City station to the Honolulu station after dinner hours, he did not receive a meal that evening. Commencing at 8:45 a.m. on January 8, 1991, HPD Detective Dennis Kim (Detective Kim) conducted a forty-five minute interview of Kelekolio. At no time during the interview did Kelekolio claim that he was tired or hungry. Nevertheless, he testified at trial<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that he had had no sleep during the night before his arrest because he had been caring for his sick children; he further testified that he could not sleep on the night of his arrest because he was worried about his family. Kelekolio also testified at trial that, although he was offered breakfast on the morning of January 8,1991, he refused to eat because he considered the food served by HPD to be \u201cslop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au2\">Before Detective Kim began the audiotaped interview, Kelekolio read and signed a standard \u201cHPD Form 81,\u201d which advises interviewees of their <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the outset, Detective Kim made it clear that Kelekolio was to receive nothing in exchange for agreeing to be interviewed. Detective Kim emphasized that Kelekolio had a right to the presence of an attorney during the interview and that he could refuse to answer questions at any time. By marking the appropriate spaces on the form, Kelekolio indicated that he understood the nature of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>constitutional rights, he did not want an attorney present during the interview, and he wanted to tell Detective Kim \u201cwhat happened.\u201d At trial, Detective Kim testified that he reviewed the HPD Form 81 three times with Kelekolio \u2014 twice before the taped interview began and a third time at the commencement of the taped interview. A full review of the audiotape reveals that Detective Kim never raised his voice or vocalized aggressively.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">While testifying at the voluntariness hearing and at trial, Detective Kim acknowledged that he made two false statements during Kelekolio\u2019s interview, namely that: (1) the police possessed physical evidence of sexual activity that incriminated Kelekolio; and (2) bruises on the complainant\u2019s arms and legs indicated that force had been used. Detective Kim further testified that the false statements were deliberate lies, prompted by his dissatisfaction with Kelekolio\u2019s inconsistent versions of the incident and designed to elicit a truthful statement from Kelekolio. Detective Kim explained that, at a seminar on interrogation techniques, he had been instructed to mislead suspects during interviews in order to extract truthful confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In Kelekolio\u2019s fourth and final version of the incident, he admitted to Detective Kim that: (1) he had stopped the Handi-van at the parking lot; (2) the complainant had taken off her clothes; (3) he had inserted his penis into the complainant\u2019s vagina; and (4) immediately thereafter, he had withdrawn and ejaculated into the complainant\u2019s hand. Following these disclosures, Kelekolio vehemently denied any use of force despite the fact that Detective Kim had maintained that there were bruises on the complainant\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">During the interview, Kelekolio claimed that the complainant had referred to sexual activities that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>purportedly engaged in with her \u201cboyfriend Tony.\u201d Detective Kim disputed both that the complainant had a boyfriend and that Tony existed at all. In these respects, Detective Kim was engaging in bald assertion, inasmuch as he had no knowledge as to whether the complainant had a boyfriend or whether there was a \u201cTony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On September 17, 1991, pursuant to a motion <em>in limine </em>filed by the prosecution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial court conducted a hearing to determine whether Kelekolio had made his statement to Detective Kim voluntarily. Following the hearing, the trial court ruled in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">At trial, Kelekolio testified that his admissions to Detective Kim during the interview, proffered in his fourth version of the incident, were lies; rather, he testified that he had admitted to having intercourse with the complainant only to satisfy Detective Kim so that he would be allowed to go home and see his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">2. Jury instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Following the evidence adduced at trial and the final arguments of the attorneys, the trial court instructed the jury as to the law of the case, giving the following jury instructions by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">Court\u2019s Instruction No. 1 provided in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACn\">You are the exclusive judges of the facts of this case. However, you must follow these instructions even though you may have opinions to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">You must consider all of the instructions as a whole and consider each instruction in the light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>all of the others. Do not single out any word, phrase, sentence or instruction and ignore the others. Do not give greater emphasis to any word, phrase, sentence or instruction simply because it is repeated in these instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">Court\u2019s Instruction No. 8 provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">While you must consider all of the evidence in determining the facts in this case, this does not mean that you are bound to give every bit of evidence the same weight. You are the sole and exclusive judges of the effect and value of the evidence and of the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">It is your exclusive right to determine whether and to what extent a witness is worthy of belief and credit and to give weight to the witness\u2019s testimony accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">Court\u2019s Instruction No. 9 provided in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">You, as jurors, are the sole judges of the credibility of all witnesses and the weight their testimony deserves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">It is your exclusive right to determine whether and to what extent a witness should be believed and to give weight to his or her testimony accordingly. In evaluating a witness, you should consider . . . the witness\u2019s apparent candor or frankness, or lack thereof;... the extent to which, if at all, the witness is either supported or contradicted by other evidence; the extent to which, if at all, the witness has made contradictory statements, whether in trial or at other times; and all other circumstances surrounding the witness and bearing upon his or her credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Court\u2019s Instruction No. 10 provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">If you find and believe from the evidence that any witness in this case has knowingly and willfully sworn falsely to any material fact in this trial or that any witness has knowingly or willfully exaggerated or suppressed any material fact or circumstance in this trial for the purpose of deceiving, misleading or imposing upon you, then you have a right to reject the testimony of such witness except insofar as the same is corroborated by other credible evidence or believed by you to be true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">State\u2019s Supplemental Instruction No. 11, which the trial court read to the jury, provided that \u201c[t]he use of deception, in and of itself, need not render a subsequent statement <em>unreliable </em>or <em>untrustworthyl,] </em>[although deception, if any, should be considered in assessing reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In addition, the trial court, <em>inter alia, </em>gave State\u2019s Supplemental Instruction No. 12 over Kelekolio\u2019s objection. State\u2019s Supplemental Instruction No. 12 provided that \u201c[t]here is nothing wrong with the use of trickery in obtaining a confession <em>as long as it is not likely to produce a false confession\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">B. Evidence of Complainant\u2019s Fantasies</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The prosecution\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>also sought, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) 412 (1992),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>preclude Kelekolio from introducing evidence relating to any of the complainant\u2019s past sexual history, including any references to \u201cTony.\u201d The motion was supported by an affidavit of the deputy prosecuting attorney (DPA) assigned to the case, which alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Kelekolio would seek to introduce evidence, through unnamed co-workers and supervisors of the complainant, that the complainant talked frequently about sex and was infatuated with Tony; (2) such evidence constituted hearsay;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) the evidence was irrelevant inasmuch as consent was not an element of the sexual offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Kelekolio\u2019s trial counsel, Victor Agmata (Agmata), did not oppose the motion <em>in limine, </em>and the trial court granted it. In the course of the hearing, however, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">MR AGMATA: Well, then there... will be testimony about what [the complainant] fantasizes about and what she imagines, it goes to the truth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>fulness and the veracity of what she talks about, her behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">They <em>[i.e., </em>the proffered witnesses] all relate ... to the extent of her mental capacity, because her mental capacity is an issue in this particular case. <em>We don\u2019t intend to prove whatever subjects she talks about as to the truthfulness of those statements, </em>it\u2019s just the extent of what she is mentally capable of talking about. And I think that is all relevant. And certainly it may be rebuttable [sic \u2014 probably rebuttal] evidence as to what she may be testifying to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">THE COURT: . . . [W]e\u2019re away from the subject matter of this motion. <em>They do not involve sexual acts.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">MR. AGMATA: No, of course \u2014 <em>we don\u2019t even have evidence of sexual acts.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">THE COURT: Then there\u2019s no basis to deny that motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">MR. AGMATA: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">THE COURT: The motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Accordingly, Agmata expressly reserved \u2014 and the trial court did not foreclose \u2014 the right to adduce otherwise admissible evidence that the complainant engaged in sexual fantasies as a function of her childlike mental state, not for the purpose of proving that she had <em>actually </em>engaged in past behavior in conformity therewith, but for the diametrically opposite purpose of proving that she had <em>not. </em>Implicit in Agmata\u2019s offer of proof was the suggestion that the complainant had fantasized her account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Kelekolio\u2019s conduct consistent with her general propensity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">When the audiotape of Detective Kim\u2019s interview of Kelekolio was received in evidence at trial, portions in which Kelekolio described the complainant\u2019s alleged accounts of her past sexual history had been inexplicably redacted. After the audiotape was played for the jury, Agmata announced that he was \u201cextremely outraged.\u201d During the ensuing bench conference, Agmata accused the prosecution of intentionally deleting portions of the interview that were beneficial to Kelekolio\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The following day, the DPA elicited from Detective Kim a recitation of a number of Kelekolio\u2019s statements that had been redacted from the audiotape. These statements consisted of the following: (1) \u201c[s]he kept telling me that she like sex\u201d; (2) \u201c[s]he kept asking me that she like sex\u201d; (3) \u201c[y]eah, she said something about \u2019em, you know, that she, she loves sex. She loves sex\u201d; and (4) \u201c[t]hen again, she asked me again if I was married. I said, oh, yes, yes, yes, I\u2019m married. Me and my wife we\u2019re getting along. We\u2019re just, you know, we\u2019re still groggy on the way our relationship going but we\u2019re working \u2019em out, you know, and then back to \u2019em, what you call, I asked her, what, what she do at her working place and she told me that she\u2019s . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">After Detective Kim\u2019s recitation, Agmata registered no further objection to the scope of the audiotape\u2019s subject matter to which the jury had been exposed, notwithstanding that there were other redacted portions in which Kelekolio recounted references by the complainant to a photograph that she had of Tony and to sexual interludes in which she claimed to have engaged with him, including one during which her parents (with whom she lived) had caught her in bed with Tony on the night of January 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>1991. No effort was ever made to establish whether Tony and the complainant had or had not ever actually engaged in sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The trial court foreclosed Agmata on hearsay grounds from cross-examining the complainant regarding whether she had told Kelekolio in the Handi-van that she had been caught by her parents in bed with Tony. On the other hand, although he had an opportunity to do so, Agmata did not advise the court that his objective was to seek to prove that the complainant had a <em>habitual </em>propensity to relate her imagined sexual escapades to others as the truth and thus to discredit the complainant\u2019s account of Kelekolio\u2019s alleged offenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Agmata pursued his \u201cfantasy\u201d theory through three additional witnesses: Anthony Lapenia (Lapenia), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>complainant\u2019s manager, supervisor, and instructor at Helemano Plantation; Darlene Waiwaiole (Waiwaiole), her assistant manager and instructor; and Debbie Yap (Yap), one of Kelekolio\u2019s fellow Handi-van drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Lapenia testified that the complainant had a photograph of him, that he had observed her showing it to her fellow trainees, and that she had a tendency to fantasize about a variety of subjects, including \u201cthat thing.\u201d Regarding the latter subject, Lapenia elaborated that \u201cas a teacher, I always tell her, stop fantasizing about that. She talks about getting married and this and that but I always tell her, it\u2019s not to be spoken here at the facility, because we\u2019re food service.\u201d Lapenia opined that \u201call special people have their fantasies.\u201d Significantly, Agmata never attempted to ask Lapenia whether he had ever heard the complainant verbalize fantasies of sexual involvement with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Waiwaiole testified that she had heard the complainant \u201csay[] that she\u2019s pregnant and we know that she\u2019s not pregnant\u201d and \u201c[tjhat she has a baby.\u201d Other than claims that \u201cher father harasses her,\u201d Waiwaiole was unaware of any additional falsehoods that the complainant had articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Before Agmata had a chance to begin his examination of Yap, the DPA requested an offer of proof at the bench. Agmata represented that Yap would testify that she was an employee of the Handi-van Company, that she had transported the complainant in the past, and that she had \u201cheard certain statements that [the complainant] has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>made .... That\u2019s all.\u201d Although the court sustained the DPA\u2019s hearsay objection to testimony of any of the complainant\u2019s statements made in Yap\u2019s hearing, Agmata failed to make any offer of proof relating to <em>habitual </em>fantasized sexual activity in order to demonstrate that the complainant had fantasized the incident in question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court subsequently barred Agmata from exploring the issue of fantasized statements, but Agmata never made an offer of proof as to why he was pursuing the matter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">C. The Complainant\u2019s Competency to Testify</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">During the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, James Lomont, Ph.D (Lomont), a clinical psychologist who had previously examined the complainant, was called to testify. Lomont opined that the complainant had an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 43 and operated at the cognitive level of a four- to seven-year-old person. On cross-examination, Lomont expressed opinions that the complainant was intellectually capable of fantasizing, changing facts to avoid punishment, and augmenting and omitting facts regarding an event she had experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The prosecution later called the complainant as a witness. Having established her diminished level of cognitive functioning through Lomont, the DPA endeavored to lay a foundation for the complainant\u2019s competency to testify<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> via the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Q. [By the DPA:] [Complainant], is telling the truth good or bad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">A. [By the complainant:] Good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">Q. Is telling a lie good or bad? Is telling a lie good or bad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">A. <em>Good.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Q. Okay. [Complainant], do you know you\u2019re testifying in court today. You know you\u2019re talking to everybody here today, right? You have to tell the truth, okay. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">A. (Witness <em>shakes </em>head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">Q. You have to answer, yes or no. You cannot nod your head, because this man that\u2019s sitting right here has to take down everything that you say, okay. You know that you have to tell the truth today, [Complainant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The DPA then began her direct examination of the complainant. The complainant was unable to identify Kelekolio, who was present in the courtroom. She told the DPA that she was \u201cvery scared.\u201d The complainant eventually testified that Kelekolio had forced her to the back of the Handi-van, penetrated her vagina with his penis, instructed her not to tell anyone, and drove her to work at the Helemano Plantation. On cross-examination, she was unable to explain the meaning of \u201ckidnapping\u201d and \u201crape\u201d \u2014 words that she had utilized in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Agmata failed to object at any time to the complainant\u2019s competence to testify, and the trial court did not engage in an independent inquiry to establish competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AyG\">A. Kelekolio\u2019s Confession</p>\n<p id=\"AAl\">1. Voluntariness</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">On appeal, Kelekolio contends that his audiotaped statement to Detective Kim was not freely and voluntarily given, but rather was \u201ccoerced.\u201d Instead of accepting his initial denial of any wrongdoing at face value, Kelekolio complains that Kim repeatedly exhorted him to tell the \u201cwhole story\u201d and wheedled a confession out of him through trickery and lies \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>Kim\u2019s misrepresentations regarding (1) evidence of sexual activity implicating Kelekolio, and (2) the presence of bruises on the complainant\u2019s arms and legs, implying the use of force. Kim\u2019s tactics, Kelekolio argues, amounted to \u201cmental or psychological\u201d coercion, thereby rendering his consequent statement involuntary and inadmissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Under the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution, \u201c[n]o person shall... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\u201d himself or herself. <em>State v. Pau\u2018u, </em>72 Haw. 505, 509, 824 P.2d 833, 835 (1992). When a confession or inculpatory statement<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is obtained in violation of either of these provisions, the prosecution will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>be permitted to use it to secure a defendant\u2019s criminal conviction. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Russo, </em>67 Haw. 126, 681 P.2d 553 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The constitutional right against self-incrimination prevents the prosecution\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s extrajudicial admissions of guilt where such admissions are the product of coercion. <em>State v. Wakinekona, </em>53 Haw. 574, 576, 499 P.2d 678, 680 (1972) (footnote and citations omitted). The basic considerations that require exclusion of confessions obtained through coercion \u201care the inherent untrustworthiness of involuntary confessions, a desire that criminal proceedings be accusatorial rather than inquisitorial and a desire that the police not become law breakers in the process of achieving society\u2019s valid law enforcement objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden is on the prosecution to show that the statement was voluntarily given and not the product of coercion. <em>Pau\u2018u, </em>72 Haw. at 509, 824 P.2d at 835 (citations omitted). The burden \u201cis particularly heavy in cases where [the defendant] is under arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Appellate review of whether a defendant\u2019s custodial statement to the police is the product of coercion requires us to \u201cexamine the entire record and make an independent determination of the ultimate issue of voluntariness\u201d based upon that review and \u201cthe totality of circumstances surrounding [the defendant\u2019s] statement.\u201d <em>State v. Villeza, </em>72 Haw. 327, 330-31, 817 P.2d 1054, 1056 (1991) (citations omitted); <em>see Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739, 89 S. Ct. 1420, 1425, 22 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>a. Kelekolio\u2019s mental and physical condition</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">A defendant\u2019s mental and physical condition can be part of the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d relevant to the issue of the voluntariness of his or her custodial statements. <em>See, e.g., State v. Smith, </em>59 Haw. 565, 567-71, 583 P.2d 347, 349-51 (1978) (medical testimony as to general psychological effects of LSD held relevant to determining whether defendant\u2019s ingestion of LSD prior to confessing impaired his mental processes or rendered him incapable of understanding purpose and consequences of confession); <em>Commonwealth v. Peterson, </em>No. 1428-92-4, 52 Cr. L. 1317 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 21,1992) (defendant\u2019s statements, obtained while being transported to hospital to be treated for injuries sustained during arrest, held involuntary and inadmissible where defendant in pain, unable due to injuries to understand what was going on around him, experiencing blurred vision, had injested cocaine, having problems breathing and chest pains, and connected to heart monitor in ambulance). However, \u201cin the absence of insanity or mental depletion, neither the voluntary character nor the admissibility of a confession is affected by the mental instability of the person making it.\u201d <em>State v. Kreps, </em>4 Haw. App. 72, 77, 661 P.2d 711, 715 (1983) (citations omitted). Rather, the person\u2019s mental state is relevant only to the weight and effect to be given to the confession by the trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 78,661 P.2d at 715 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">A confession may be rendered involuntary by \u201cimpermissible police conduct.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Amayar-Ruiz, 166 Ariz. 152, 164, 800 P.2d 1260, 1272 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>111 S.

Ed. 2d 694 (1966) (\u201c[T]he government seeking to punish an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>individual [must] produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.\u201d) (quoted with approval in <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>67 Haw. 293, 298, 687 P.2d 544, 549 (1984), and <em>State v. Russo, </em>67 Haw. at 131-32, 681 P.2d at 558). However, the record is uncontroverted that Kelekolio\u2019s alleged lack of sleep and food were not the product of any impermissible scheme on the part of the police to lower his resistance or render him susceptible to improper suggestion; by his own admission, they were self-imposed. Indeed, Kelekolio \u201ccould have slept\u201d and he was, in fact, offered breakfast prior to the commencement of his interview with Detective Kim. <em>Cf. Amayar-Ruiz, </em>166 Ariz. at 165, 800 P.2d at 1273. Moreover, at no point during his interview did Kelekolio complain to Kim that he was tired or hungry. In fact, the audiotape reveals that Kelekolio was lucid throughout the interview, as demonstrated by his tone of voice, his ability to construct multiple versions of the incident, and his vehement denial of the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">It is apparent from the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d as reflected in the record that Kelekolio\u2019s mental and physical condition at the time of his interview with Detective Kim did not render his statement involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">b. Exhortations to \u201ctell the truth\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Kelekolio complains that, instead of accepting his initial denial of sexual contact of any kind with the complainant, Detective Kim repeatedly challenged the completeness of his account and enjoined him to tell \u201cthe whole story\u201d until he finally admitted to sexual penetration. In effect, Kelekolio seeks to fault Kim for urging him to tell the truth, although he does not suggest that Kim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>exhortations were accompanied by any sort of threat or promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Kelekolio\u2019s argument is unavailing, however, because \u201c[m]ere advice from the police that it would be better for the accused to tell the truth when unaccompanied by either a threat or promise does not render a subsequent confession involuntary.\u201d <em>Amaya-Ruiz, </em>166 Ariz. at 165, 800 P.2d at 1273; <em>see also State v. Waugh, </em>238 Kan. 537, 712 P.2d 1243 (1986). This is precisely because such \u201cexhortations to tell the truth,\u201d <em>see Amaya-Ruiz, </em>166 Ariz. at 165, 800 P.2d at 1273, are calculated to enhance, rather than diminish, the trustworthiness of an accused\u2019s inculpatory statement or confession. <em>Cf. Wakinekona, </em>53 Haw. at 576,499 P.2d at 680. Accordingly, the proposition that a police interrogator\u2019s unwillingness to accept a suspect\u2019s initial version of events at face value amounts to \u201ccoercion\u201d <em>per se </em>is not only naive and disingenuous, but falls of its own weight; were we to accept it, the legitimate right of law enforcement agencies to seek voluntary confessions would be rendered nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">c. Detective Kim\u2019s use of deception</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We next consider Kelekolio\u2019s claim that Detective Kim\u2019s use of deliberate misrepresentations regarding the existence of incriminating evidence of sexual activity and bruises on the complainant\u2019s arms and legs constituted \u201ccoercion\u201d that was \u201cmental and psychological in nature,\u201d opening brief at 26-27, thereby rendering his confession involuntary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">At the outset, we note that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">[i]t is by now well established that \u201ccertain interrogation techniques, either in isolation, or as applied to the unique characteristics of a particular suspect, are so offensive to a civilized system of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>justice that they must be condemned under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">... To assure that the fruits of such techniques are never used to secure a conviction, due process also requires \u201cthat a jury [not] hear a confession unless and until the trial judge [or some other independent decisionmaker] has determined that it was freely and voluntarily given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\"><em>Crane v. </em>Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 687-88, 106 S. Ct. 2142, 2145, 90 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1986) (citations omitted and brackets in original). We therefore address the question whether, considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding Kelekolio\u2019s interview, Detective Kim\u2019s deliberate misrepresentations were of a character likely to produce an untrustworthy confession or of such a nature as to transform the investigative process into an \u201cinquisition.\u201d <em>See Wakinekona, </em>53 Haw. at 576, 499 P.2d at 680. For the reasons set forth below, we answer the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The current view of the United States Supreme Court on the subject appears to be reflected in <em>Frazier v. Cupp, supra. </em>In <em>Frazier, </em>the police, in the course of questioning the petitioner (Frazier), misrepresented to him that his co-defendant (Rawls) had already confessed to the offense with which they were charged and thereafter obtained a confession from Frazier. 394 U.S. at 737-38, 89 S. Ct. at 1424. The entire interrogation lasted slightly more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>an hour. Frazier had been \u201cgiven a somewhat abbreviated description of his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 737, 89 S. Ct. at 1424.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On habeas corpus review of Frazier\u2019s murder conviction, the Court, through Justice Marshall, ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">[Frazier]... presses the... argument that his confession was involuntary and that it should have been excluded for that reason. The trial judge, after an evidentiary hearing during which the tape recording [of Frazier\u2019s confession] was played, could not agree with this contention, and our reading of the record does not lead us to a contrary conclusion. Before [Frazier] made any incriminating statements, he received partial warnings of his constitutional rights; this is, of course, a circumstance quite relevant to a finding of voluntariness. . . . The questioning was of short duration, and [Frazier] was a mature individual of normal intelligence. <em>The fact that the police misrepresented the statements that Rawls had made is, while relevant, insufficient in our view to make this otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible. </em>These cases must be decided by viewing the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d... and on the facts of this case we can find no error in the admission of [Frazier\u2019s] confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 739,89 S. Ct. at 1425 (citations omitted and emphasis added). <em>Accord Amaya-Ruiz, </em>166 Ariz. at 165, 800 P.2d at 1273 (where, in obtaining confession, police had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>misrepresented to defendant that there were witnesses to offense, court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[standing alone, such a lie during interrogation does not render a confession involuntary. . . . [0]ur inquiry is whether the totality of the circumstances indicates that a defendant\u2019s will was overborne. The circumstances indicate that the detective\u2019s lie did not result in an involuntary confession.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The general rule regarding the interrelation between police deception and the voluntariness of a resulting confession is comprehensively articulated in Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Confession as Affected by Its Inducement through Artifice, Deception, Trickery, or Fraud, </em>99 A.L.R.2d 772 (1965 and Supp. 1992), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgY\">The relatively few cases in which [the] question was raised have unanimously held that <em>confessions induced by subterfuges are not invalid and therefore inadmissible in evidence on the ground that they were obtained by means violating the principles of due process, </em>since the means employed did not under the facts of the case amount to mental coercion. Most of the cases discussing the effect of subterfuge on the admissibility in evidence of the confession . . . base the decision on the determination of the trustworthiness of the confession obtained. In this respect all the cases support the general principle that <em>confessions obtained through the use of subterfuges are not vitiated merely because of the employment of such methods as long as the methods used are not of a type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement. </em>Since the use of subterfuge in and by itself does not render a confession inadmissible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>untrustworthy,.. . <em>cases ... in which confessions [are] held inadmissible [involve] ... a certain amount of collateral inducement which </em>in the opinion of the court <em>[is] sufficient to possibly influence the accused to make a confession regardless of his guilt.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">A perusal of all the cases in this annotation reveals that in the great majority the claim that the confession was inadmissible because of a subterfuge was based on the ground that under the circumstances the subterfuge used made the confession untrustworthy. In most instances this claim was rejected in view of the well-settled principle that <em>the use of subterfuge alone has no tendency to produce an untrue confession. </em>This being the only test applied, <em>the subterfuge employed, in order to render the confession inadmissible, must </em>therefore <em>involve ... a collateral inducement... which has a tendency to stimulate a confession irrespective of guilt even if the false representations had been true. </em>... As a matter of fact, <em>in all cases </em>in which a confession [has been] held inadmissible because not measuring up to the test of truthfulness, <em>there [has been] created in the mind of the accused the hope of some benefit... available to him only if he confessed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">99 A.L.R.2d at 777-78 (emphasis added and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Consistent with the foregoing annotation, <em>compare People v. Thompson, </em>50 Cal. 3d 134, 266 Cal. Rptr. 309, 785 P.2d 857 (interrogating officers falsely represented to defendant that (1) his car had been connected with scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of victim\u2019s death by tire tracks and soil samples, (2) physical evidence linked to victim found in his car, and (3) rope fibers found in his bedroom; confession held voluntary and admissible), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 881, 111 S. Ct. 226, 112 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1990), <em>and People v. Watkins, </em>6 Cal. App. 3d 119, 85 Cal. Rptr. 621 (1970) (defendant falsely told that his fingerprints found on getaway car; confession held voluntary and admissible on ground that deception not of type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement) <em>with State v. Nelson, </em>69 Haw. 461, 470-71, 748 P.2d 365, 371 (1987) (confession extracted from defendant through \u201cprayer[] and exorcism\u201d and reference by police to biblical suggestion that \u201cconfession can save one from the wrath of God\u201d made it \u201cdifficult to determine where... the police officer ended and the ... savior be[gan]\u201d; confession held involuntary and inadmissible) <em>and People v. Hogan, </em>31 Cal. 3d 815, 183 Cal. Rptr. 817, 647 P.2d 93 (1982) (confession held involuntary and inadmissible, not on account of false statements by police purporting to establish guilt, but because of promise of mental health treatment if defendant confessed).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The rationale underlying judicial acceptance of the very sort of police deception employed in the present case is set forth in 3 Ringel, Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions \u00a7 25.2(d)(2), at 25-21 (1991 and Supp. 1992), in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Most commonly, the police tell a suspect they have found some highly incriminating evidence which renders futile any attempt by the suspect to dissemble further. Courts have uniformly accepted this technique, apparently on the view that an innocent person would not be induced to confess by such police deception. Therefore, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>police have falsely told suspects that their fingerprints have been found at the crime scene, that they have been implicated by the victim of the crime, or that other crucial evidence has been recovered, the resulting confessions have been ruled voluntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In our view, the relevant case law and scholarly authority, including that cited above, is amenable to the formulation of a rule by which to measure the legitimacy of the use of \u201cdeception\u201d by the police in eliciting confessions or inculpatory statements from suspects and arrestees. That rule, which we now adopt, is that employment by the police of deliberate falsehoods <em>intrinsic to </em>the facts of the alleged offense in question will be treated as one of the totality of circumstances surrounding the confession or statement to be considered in assessing its voluntariness; on the other hand, deliberate falsehoods <em>extrinsic to </em>the facts of the alleged offense, which are of a type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement or to influence an accused to make a confession regardless of guilt, will be regarded as coercive <em>per se, </em>thus obviating the need for a \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d analysis of voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Although the foregoing rule will, of course, have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, some examples of <em>intrinsic </em>falsehoods would include such misrepresentations regarding the existence of incriminating evidence as (1) placement of the defendant\u2019s vehicle at the crime scene, <em>see Thompson, </em>(2) physical evidence linked to the victim found in the defendant\u2019s car, <em>see id., </em>(3) discovery of the murder weapon, <em>see Moore v. Hopper, </em>389 F. Supp. 931 (M.D. Ga. 1974), (4) a claim that the murder victim is still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>alive, <em>see State v. Cooper, </em>217 N.W.2d 589 (Iowa 1974), (5) presence of the defendant\u2019s fingerprints on the getaway car or at the crime scene, <em>see State v. Cobb, </em>115 Ariz. 484, 566 P.2d 285 (1977), <em>Watkins, </em>and <em>People v. Kashney, </em>111 Ill. 2d 454, 490 N.E.2d 688 (1986), (6) positive identification of the defendant by reliable witnesses, <em>see Amayar-Ruiz, </em>166 Ariz. at 165, 800 P.2d at 1273, and <em>Commonwealth v. Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 562-69, 387 N.E.2d 527, 533-36, <em>cert. granted, </em>444 U.S. 824, 100 S. Ct. 44, 62 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1979), <em>and cert. dismissed, </em>445 U.S. 39, 100 S. Ct. 1092, 63 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1980), and (7) discovexy of a nonexistent witness, <em>see United States ex rel. Galloway v. Fogg, </em>403 F. Supp. 248 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). Some examples of <em>extrinsic </em>falsehoods \u2014 of a type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement or to influence an accused to make a confession regardless of guilt \u2014 would include (1) assurances of divine salvation upon confession, <em>see Nelson, </em>(2) promises of mental health treatment in exchange for a confession, <em>see Hogan, </em>(3) assurances of treatment in a \u201cnice hospital\u201d (in which the defendant could have his personal belongings and be visited by his girlfriend) in lieu of incarceration, in exchange for a confession, <em>see People v. Sunset Bay, </em>76 A.D.2d 592, 430 N.Y.S.2d 601 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>54 N.Y.2d 808, 443 N.Y.S.2d 649, 427 N.E.2d 946 (1981), (4) promises of more favorable treatment in the event of a confession, <em>see Meehan, </em>(5) misrepresentations of legal principles, such as (a) suggesting that the defendant would have the bxxrden of convincing a judge and juxy at trial that he was \u201cperfectly innocent\u201d and had nothing to do with the offense, <em>see Young v. State, </em>670 P.2d 591 (Okla. 1983), (b) misrepresenting the consequences of a \u201chabitual offender\u201d conviction, <em>see State </em>v. <em>Setzer, </em>20 Wash. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>46, 579 P.2d 957, <em>petition for review denied, </em>90 Wash. 2d 1025 (1978), and (c) holding out that the defendant\u2019s confession cannot be used against him at trial, <em>see Commonwealth v. Dustin, </em>373 Mass. 612, 368 N.E.2d 1388 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 943, 98 S. Ct. 1523, 55 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1978), and (6) misrepresentations by an interrogating police officer, who is a close friend of the defendant, that the defendant\u2019s failure to confess will get the officer into trouble with his superiors and jeopardize the well-being of the officer\u2019s pregnant wife and children, <em>see Spano v. New York, </em>360 U.S. 315, 79 S. Ct. 1202, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Because Detective Kim\u2019s deliberate misrepresentations to Kelekolio were intrinsic to the facts of the present offenses and because we determine from the totality of the circumstances surrounding Kelekolio\u2019s audiotaped statement, based on our review of the entire record, that the misrepresentations were not of a type that would reasonably induce a false confession, we hold that Detective Bum\u2019s use of deception did not render Kelekolio\u2019s inculpatory statements involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Notwithstanding our holding, we emphasize that we are not purporting to enunciate a bright line <em>per se </em>rule that the use of intrinsic factual deception cannot, given the totality of circumstances surrounding any given statement, result in an involuntary confession. Rather, the rule that we formulate today merely declines to foreclose the admissibility of confessions, as a <em>per se </em>matter, procured in part through the use of this kind of deception. Such confessions remain subject to \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d analysis, <em>see Villeza, </em>72 Haw. at 330-31, 817 P.2d at 1056, and may still be the product of interrogation techniques that are \u201c \u2018so offensive to a civilized system of justice\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018they must be condemned\u2019 \u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>principles of due process, <em>see Crane, </em>476 U.S. at 687-88, 106 S. Ct. at 1245.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">2. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In light of the discussion and holding in section II. A. 1. c of this opinion, Kelekolio\u2019s contentions that the trial court committed plain error in giving State\u2019s Supplemental Instruction No. 11 and erred in giving State\u2019s Supplemental Instruction No. 12 over Kelekolio\u2019s objection are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Relying on <em>State v. Foster, </em>44 Haw. 403, 354 P.2d 960 (1960), and <em>Crane v. Kentucky, supra, </em>Kelekolio also urges, however, that the jury instructions as a whole were \u201cprejudicially insufficient\u201d because \u201cthe [trial] court never instructed the jury on the issue of the voluntariness of [his] confession,\u201d thus depriving the jury of the opportunity \u201cto make the ultimate determination of whether [his] confession was freely and voluntarily made.\u201d Opening brief at 21-22. Specifically, Kelekolio complains that \u201cthe jury was never... told that it could reject [his] confession if it found the confession to be involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading. <em>State </em>v. <em>Halemanu, </em>3 Haw. App. 300, 306, 650 P.2d 587, 592 (1982) (citing, <em>inter alia, State v. Reiger, </em>64 Haw. 510, 644 P.2d 959 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We note that Kelekolio never requested an instruction on the issue of voluntariness; he therefore alleges plain error on appeal. This court\u2019s power to deal with plain error is one to be exercised sparingly and with caution because the plain error rule represents a departure from a presupposition of the adversary system \u2014 that a party must look to his or her counsel for protection and bear the cost of counsel\u2019s mistakes. <em>State v. Fox, </em>70 Haw. 46, 55-56, 760 P.2d 670, 675-76 (1988). Nevertheless, where plain error has been committed and substantial rights have been affected thereby, the error may be noticed even though it was not brought to the attention of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 760 P.2d at 675; <em>see also State v. Grindles, </em>70 Haw. 528, 530, 777 P.2d 1187, 1189 (1989); <em>State v. Tiedemann, </em>7 Haw. App. 631, 635, 790 P.2d 340, 342 (1990); Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 52(b) (1989); Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) 103(d) (1985). Given the current confused state of Hawaii case law regarding the jury\u2019s proper role in determining the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s confession, we choose to take this opportunity to clarify the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u201cThat the jury is to pass upon the facts and the [c]ourt upon the law[] is a principle which lies at the foundation of jury trial in every country blessed with [that] institution[.]\u201d <em>Lewis v. Davis, </em>1 Haw. 248,249 (1854).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Correla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tively, the admissibility of evidence is a question of law for the trial judge to determine. <em>Territory v. Buick, </em>27 Haw. 28, 52 (1923); <em>see also </em>HRE 104(a) (1985) (\u201cPreliminary questions concerning . . . the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court\u201d). On the other hand, \u201c[t]he jury, as the trier of fact, is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses [and] the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Tamura, </em>63 Haw. 636, 637-38, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981) (citations omitted); <em>State v. Summers, </em>62 Haw. 325, 332, 614 P.2d 925, 930 (1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u201cWhether a confession is voluntary is... a mixed question of law and fact. And where [the trial judge conducts a hearing] to determine the admissibility of a confession, it becomes the duty of the [trial judge] to find the facts and to apply . . . the <em>legal tests of </em>admissibility.\u201d <em>Territory v. Young, </em>37 Haw. 189, 193 (1945) (footnote omitted and emphasis added). Accordingly, \u201c[h]earings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury.\u201d HRE 104(c) (1985). Nevertheless, a defendant retains the right to put before the jury, as the trier of fact, all evidence, including the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of his confession, \u201crelevant to weight or credibility.\u201d HRE 104(e) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The United States Supreme Court aptly consolidated the foregoing principles in <em>Crane v. Kentucky, supra, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">[T]he Court has never questioned that \u201cevidence surrounding the making of a confession bears on its credibility\u201d as well as its volunta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>riness. . . . [Bjecause <em>\u201cquestions of credibility, whether of a witness or of a confession, are for the jury,\u201d </em>the requirement that the court make a pretrial <em>voluntariness </em>[emphasis in original] determination does not undercut the defendant\u2019s traditional prerogative to challenge the confession\u2019s <em>reliability </em>[emphasis in original] during the course of the trial____Thus,... evidence about the manner in which a confession was secured will often be germane to its probative weight, a matter that is exclusively for the jury to assess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">. . . [T]he circumstances surrounding the taking of a confession can be highly relevant to <em>two separate inquiries, one legal and one factual. The manner in which a statement was extracted is, </em>of course, <em>relevant to the purely legal question of voluntariness </em>.... <em>But the </em>physical and psychological <em>environment that yielded the confession can also be of substantial relevance to the ultimate factual issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. </em>Confessions, even those that have been found to be voluntary, are not conclusive of guilt. And, as with any other part of the prosecutor\u2019s case, <em>a confession may be shown to be \u201cinsufficiently corroborated or otherwise .. .unworthy of belief.\u201d ... </em>Indeed, stripped of the power to describe to the jury the circumstances that prompted his confession, the defendant is effectively disabled from answering the one question that every rational juror needs answered: If the defendant is innocent, why did he previously admit his guilt? Accordingly,... <em>entirely independent of any question of voluntariness, a defendant\u2019s case may rise or fall on his ability to convince the jury that the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>manner in which the confession was obtained casts doubt on its credibility.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">476 U.S. at 688-89,106 S. Ct. at 2145-46 (citations omitted and additional emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Over the course of time, this court has lost sight of the distinction between the need for the trial court, as the judge of the law, to assess the manner in which a confession or inculpatory statement is extracted, for purposes of resolving the \u201cpurely legal question\u201d of <em>admissibility (i.e., </em>whether the confession or inculpatory statement was voluntarily given), and the prerogative of the jury, as the judge of the facts, to determine the <em>weight and effect </em>of the confession or inculpatory statement with regard to its <em>credibility and reliability (i.e., </em>its worthiness of belief) within the context of \u201cthe ultimate factual issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>See Crane, </em>476 U.S. at 688-89, 106 S. Ct. at 2145-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Thus, misconstruing <em>Territory v. Alcosiba, </em>36 Haw. 231, 235 (1942), this court declared in <em>Young </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">in this jurisdiction the rule has been recognized that although a court may, upon a hearing preliminary to the admission of a confession in evidence, determine that the confession was freely and voluntarily made[,] where the evidence is conflicting, the ultimate determination of its voluntary character is for the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">37 Haw. at 193. Unfortunately, we have perpetuated this legal misconstruction in subsequent cases. <em>See, e.g., State v. Foster, </em>44 Haw. 403, 419, 354 P.2d 960, 969 (1960), and <em>State v. Smith, </em>59 Haw. 565, 568, 583 P.2d 347, 350 (1978). Accordingly, as a corrective step, we now overrule <em>Young, Foster, Smith, </em>and any other Hawaii decision in accord with them, insofar as they conflict with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>rationale of <em>Crane, </em>and expressly adopt the reasoning of <em>Crane </em>cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">During the trial of the present case, Kelekolio was never precluded from adducing relevant evidence of the circumstances surrounding his interrogation, and, as noted above, he did so. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury (including those of which Kelekolio now complains) advised the members of the jury that: (1) they were the exclusive judges of the facts; (2) they were not bound to give every bit of evidence the same weight, but rather were to make their own determination of the effect and value of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses; (3) they had the exclusive right to determine whether and to what extent each witness was worthy of belief and to give weight to each witness\u2019s testimony accordingly, based, <em>inter alia, </em>on the witness\u2019s candor or frankness (or lack thereof), the extent of support or contradiction by other evidence, the extent of contradictory statements in trial or at other times, and all other circumstances surrounding the witness and bearing upon his or her credibility; and (4) the use of deception should be considered in assessing both the reliability and trustworthiness of Kelekolio\u2019s statement and the likelihood that such \u201ctrickery\u201d produced a false confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We are convinced that the jury instructions, when read and considered as a whole, did not bind the jury to accept any or all of Kelekolio\u2019s audiotaped statement to Detective Kim merely because it had been deemed legally admissible. The instructions expressly and impliedly enjoined the jurors to consider the totality of the circumstances under which the statement was made, including the conduct and statements of Detective Kim in the course of the interview. And to the extent that the totality of the circumstances diminished or cast doubt on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>trustworthiness of Kelekolio\u2019s statement, the instructions entitled the jury to reject or disregard the statement accordingly, except insofar as it was corroborated by other credible evidence or, in light of all the evidence, believed by the jury to be true. We therefore hold that the jury instructions, when read and considered as a whole, were not prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">B. Evidence of the Complainant\u2019s Fantasies</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Kelekolio next contends that the trial court erred in \u201cexcluding evidence of the complainant\u2019s fantasies during her cross-examination, Kelekolio\u2019s direct examination, and the examination of [other] witnesses.\u201d Opening brief at 17-18. \u201cEvidence of the complainant\u2019s fantasies was central to the defense case,\u201d Kelekolio legitimately argues, because \u201c[i]f the jury believed that the complainant fantasized many events in her life, then it would also be inclined to believe that she fantasized the events concerning Kelekolio.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">This court has recently concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">[Different standards of review must be applied to trial court decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence, depending on the requirements of the particular rule of evidence at issue. When application of a particular evidentiary rule can yield only one correct result, the proper standard for appellate review is the right/wrong standard. However, the traditional abuse of discretion standard should be applied in the case of those rides of evidence that require a \u201cjudgment call\u201d on the part of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Kealoha v. County of Hawaii, </em>74 Haw. 308, 319-20, 844 P.2d 670, 676 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Kelekolio is \u201cright\u201d that the complainant\u2019s alleged statements to him would not constitute hearsay if not offered for their truth, but rather to show that they were untrue and that the complainant was merely verbalizing fantasies. <em>See supra </em>at 8-14; <em>see also Kealoha, 14t </em>Haw. at 317 \u2014 18, 844 P.2d at 675. Moreover, we agree with Kelekolio that, as a threshold matter, such evidence is not barred by HRE 412, which is specifically designed to protect alleged sexual assault victims from being impeached by evidence of past sexual <em>conduct, </em>as distinguished from past sexual <em>cognition. Cf. id. </em>(\u201cBecause the only question ... is whether the specific requirements of the [evidentiary] rule were met, there can be no discretion in the trial court.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Kelekolio is mistaken, however, when he ascribes the exclusion of anticipated evidence of the complainant\u2019s habitual propensity to fantasize sexually<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to the trial court\u2019s granting of the prosecution\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Opening brief at 18. Whenever Agmata laid a proper foundation, the court recognized the distinction between \u201cfantasy\u2019 evidence and evidence of \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d properly excluded by the motion <em>in limine. </em>Any mistaken impression that Agmata was seeking to adduce evidence of the complainant\u2019s past sexual behavior could and should have been dispelled by the simple expedient of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>offer of proof.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the absence of an offer of proof, the trial court committed no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">C. The Complainant\u2019s Competency to Testify</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">As an additional point of error on appeal, Kelekolio alleges that Agmata was ineffective for failing to move for a hearing to determine the complainant\u2019s competency to testify at trial on the ground that \u201cthere was clearly an issue as to whether [she] understood the duty to tell the truth . . . and was thus competent to testify under HRE 603.1.\u201d Opening brief at 23-24.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Kelekolio\u2019s position presupposes that Agmata\u2019s silence betokened an error or omission reflecting a lack of skill, judgment, or diligence that resulted in the withdrawal or impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. <em>State v. Aplaca, </em>74 Haw. 54, 66-67, 837 P.2d 1298, 1305 (1992) (footnote and citations omitted). However, \u201c \u2018[t]he decision whether to call witnesses in a criminal trial is normally a matter within the judgment of counsel and, accordingly, will rarely be second-guessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>by judicial hindsight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 837 P.2d at 1307 (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Onishi, </em>64 Haw. 62, 64, 636 P.2d 742, 744 (1981)) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In the present case, there is, of course, no record of Agmata\u2019s thought processes. But the inference may nevertheless be drawn that Agmata made a tactical decision that, faced with Kelekolio\u2019s confession in evidence, it was the lesser of two evils for the jury to observe the complainant\u2019s demeanor and manner of testifying in order to bolster the defense that she fantasized the incident in question. Attorneys \u201crequire and are permitted broad latitude to make [such] on-the-spot strategic choices in the course of trying a case____\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>68 Haw. 304, 311, 712 P.2d 496, 501 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the reasons set forth below, we believe that the trial court, <em>sua sponte, </em>should have conducted a competency hearing prior to exposing the complainant\u2019s substantive testimony to the jury \u2014 regardless of the trial tactics of the parties \u2014 and that it was plain error for the court to have failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">We begin our analysis with the dual propositions that \u201c[e]very person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in [the HRE],\u201d HRE 601, and that \u201c[a] person is disqualified to be a witness if [s]he is ... incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth,\u201d HRE 603.1. Not surprisingly, HRE 603.1 is \u201cprimarily applicable to youthful and mentally infirm witnesses.\u201d Bowman, <em>The Hawaii Rules of Evidence, </em>2 U. Haw. L. Rev. 431, 453 (1981). In this regard, the commentary on HRE 603.1 (1985) indicates that the rule was intended to codify Hawaii\u2019s common law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">The intent of this rule... is to... <em>require </em>disqualification of witnesses whose incapacity ... to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>understand the truthtelling obligation renders their testimony valueless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">Under this rule the competency of a witness is a matter for determination by the court. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">This rule generally restates existing Hawaii law... [and reflects] a liberalization of the competency standard for children. In <em>Republic v. Ah Wong, </em>10 Haw. 524, 525 (1896), the court said: \u201cThere is no precise age within which children are excluded from testifying. Their competency is to be determined, not by their age, but by the degree of their knowledge and understanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">In <em>Territory v. Titcomb, </em>34 Haw. 499, 502 (1938), the court announced that \u201cthe proper test must always be, does the lunatic understand what he is saying, and does he understand the obligation of an oath? ... [I]f he can understand the test proposed, the jury must determine all the rest.\u201d Rule 603.1 is consistent with the <em>Ah Wong </em>and <em>Titcomb </em>decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">In light of the uncontroverted testimony that the complainant functions at the cognitive level of a four- to seven-year-old child, Professor Bowman\u2019s observations regarding \u201cfactors peculiar to young children\u201d are particularly enlightening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">There is ... a necessity that the child have <em>cognitive skills adequate to comprehend the event he or she witnessed and to communicate memories of the event in response to questions at trial. </em>If a child\u2019s view of the truth bears little resemblance to reality, it will also have little value ^o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the trier of fact. Thus, competency to testify implies some measure of competency at the time of the event witnessed as well as at the time of the trial. <em>The child must be able to organize the experience cognitively and to differentiate it from his or her other thoughts and fantasies. </em>Furthermore, the child must be able to maintain these skills under psychological stress and under pressure, real or perceived, from adult authority figures to shape his or her responses in a particular way. Thus, level of suggestibility is an important factor. Particular kinds of testimony may require further specific competencies. Most notably, testimony by children on sexual abuse may require verification of the child\u2019s comprehension of the meaning of sexual terms and behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Melton, <em>Children\u2019s Competency to Testify, 5 </em>Law <em>&amp; </em>Human Behavior 73, 75 (1981).

He concludes that \u201cthe available research in sum suggests that liberal use of children\u2019s testimony is well founded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. The best approach in borderline cases is to admit the testimony, rely on adversary presentation and cross-examination, and exercise judicial control in testing the sufficiency of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\"><em>Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual </em>\u00a7 603.1-2A, at 214 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The relevant legislative history \u201cmakes clear [that] [R]ule 603.1 is not a discretionary disqualification.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual </em>\u00a7 603.1-2, at 213; <em>see also </em>HRE 104(a) (1985) (\u201cPreliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness . . . <em>shall </em>be determined by the court____\u201d) (emphasis added)). And \u201cthe legislative intent and the language of the rule contemplate a single \u201cright/wrong\u201d review standard ....\u201d <em>Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual </em>\u00a7 603.1 \u2014 2B, at 215.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7\">Rule 603.1 disqualifies anyone incapable of expressing himself or unable to tell the truth from being a witness. The language of S.B. No. 1827-80, S.D. 1, H.D. 1 made it discretionary upon the court to qualify or disqualify a witness for such reasons. We have concluded that the mandatory language previously found in S.B. No. 1827-80, S.D. 1 is more appropriate. By such reversion in language, it is the intent that when the question is properly appealed, the appellate court should review the record to determine whether the trial court has erred in its determination and that <em>the question so raised on appeal should not be determined based on whether the trial court had abused its discretion. It was concluded that a witness is either qualified or disqualified, and it is not a matter of degrees.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 80-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 996 (emphasis added). We therefore review the trial court\u2019s failure in the present case to conduct a competency hearing as to the complainant, pursuant to HRE 603.1, under the \u201cright/wrong\u201d standard.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>In the present case, the trial court either made no finding of competency or adjudged the complainant to be competent <em>sub silentio. </em>However, our <em>de novo </em>review of the record persuades us that there was an inadequate showing of competency for the following reasons: (1) when asked whether lying was good or bad, the complainant responded, \u201cGood\u201d; (2) the complainant was unable to identify Kelekolio, who was present in court, although she repeatedly referred to him in her testimony by name; and (3) the complainant did not appear to understand the meaning of particular sexual and other terms (i.e., \u201crape\u201d and \u201ckidnap\u201d) that she employed in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We recognize that it is by no means certain that a competency determination by the trial court, pursuant to HRE 603.1, would result in the complainant\u2019s disqualification to testify. For example, the court in <em>State v. Gonsalves, 5 </em>Haw. App. 659, 706 P.2d 1333 (1985), although utilizing an improper standard of review, held that it was not error to allow a mentally retarded twenty-eight-year-old sex assault complainant, who had an IQ of 40 and functioned cognitively at the level of a three- to four-year-old child, to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 666, 706 P.2d at 1339. Therefore, the question of testimonial competency must be determined on a case by case basis. We merely hold, on the record before us, that (1) the issue of the complainant\u2019s competency to testify was reasonably called into question; and (2) the trial court committed plain error in failing to engage in an independent inquiry and make an express finding as to whether the complainant was competent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>testify before allowing her substantive testimony to be exposed to the jury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARQ\"><em>Joyce K.

In order to answer in the affirmative, we would have to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Kelekolio\u2019s inculpatory statements were such that the complainant\u2019s testimony could not have affected the jury\u2019s verdicts. <em>See Russo, </em>67 Haw. at 138-39, 681 P.2d at 562-63 (1984). Inasmuch as, standing alone, the jury may have given little weight and effect to Kelekolio\u2019s inculpatory statements (the only other direct evidence of his guilt) in light of the totality of the circumstances under which they were obtained, we cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Because we hold that the trial court committed plain error in failing to make an express determination of the complainant\u2019s competence to testify, and because we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless, we vacate Kelekolio\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-9\"> The result we reach in this appeal renders it unnecessary to address Kelekolio\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial. In connection with section II.

Moore &amp; H. Bendix, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice para. 406.02, at IV-139 (2d ed. 1988)).

R. Evid. 406 (quoted also in the 1980 commentary to Hawaii\u2019s rule 406) for the proposition that \u201cadequacy of sampling and uniformity of response\u201d are factors in determining whether a number of specific instances of conduct constitute a habit....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">To the extent that [federal case law] suggests that rule 406 is limited to reflexive, \u201cnon-volitional\u201d behavior, it misreads the FRE legislative history. The advisory committee\u2019s note recognizes that \u201cThe doing of the habitual acts may become semi-automatic,\u201d and suggests that the volitional quality of the acts mustered in support of an asserted habit is a proper factor on the question whether a number of specific instances of conduct supports the inference of \u201cinvariable regularity\u201d required for a determination of habit. The upshot is that, when the rule 406 proponent offers instances of conduct, the determinative issue is consistency and regularity, and the relevant factors are (1) the nature and quality of the behavior in issue, including its volitional character, (2) the adequacy of the proponent\u2019s sampling methodology, and (3) the sheer number of instances presented in support of the assertion of habit____What then is the proper distinction between character and habit? Character is a generalized disposition...; habit is a specific and invariable practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">How shall a habit be proved?... A witness\u2019 opinion of someone else\u2019s habit, based on personal knowledge so as to conform with rule 602 and rule 701 requirements, will constitute \u201c[e]vidence of the habit of a person\u201d in satisfaction of rule 406. If, on the other hand, the witness recounts specific instances of conduct, a question of sufficiency may be presented. The advisory committee\u2019s note to Fed. R. Evid. 406 cites approvingly <em>Whittemore v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>65 Cal. App. 2d 737, 151 P.2d 670 (1944), a case in which evidence that a decedent had, on four prior occasions, piloted planes from defendant\u2019s factory to decedent\u2019s place of employment was admitted to prove that he probably piloted a plane that crashed, killing everyone on board. The sheer number of prior instances of particular conduct is an important factor in establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ing a habit, but perhaps even more important is evidence from which an inference of consistency and invariability can be drawn.
