Norris (Norris) appeals from the final judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, which was certified as final, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b), and entered in favor of defendants-appellees Patil J. Finazzo, Howard E. Ogden, and Hatsuo Honma (collectively, defendants). Norris had filed suit against defendants alleging discharge from his employment in violation of public policy. The circuit court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss counts I and II of Norris\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that Norris\u2019 claims were preempted by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-188 (1988). We disagree with the circuit court\u2019s determination and hold that the RLA does not preempt Norris\u2019 state tort claims. Therefore, we reverse the order of the circuit court dismissing counts I and II of Norris\u2019 complaint and vacate the final judgment entered by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Defendants moved to dismiss counts I and II of Norris\u2019 complaint based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to HRCP Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(h)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, reviewable <em>de novo. McCarthy v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>States, </em>850 F.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir. 1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1052 (1989); <em>see also Moir v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth., </em>895 F.2d 266, 269 (6th Cir. 1990). Moreover, we adopt the view of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Love v. United States, </em>871 F.2d 1488 (9th Cir. 1989), <em>opinion amended on other grounds and superseded by Love v. United States, </em>915 F.2d 1242 (9th Cir. 1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">Our review [of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction] is based on the contents of the complaint, the allegations of which we accept as true and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Dismissal is improper unless \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1491 (citations omitted). However, \u201cwhen considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) the [trial] court is not restricted to the face of the pleadings, but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and testimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>McCarthy, </em>850 F.2d at 560 (citations omitted); <em>see also 5A </em>C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1350, at 213 (1990). Therefore, based on the applicable standard of review, we set forth the facts below as alleged by Norris in his complaint and in the materials presented to the trial court outside the pleadings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Norris, an aircraft mechanic licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), was employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (HAL) from February 2, 1987 to August 3,1987. Norris\u2019 FAA license carried a rating that gave him the authority to approve and return an aircraft to service after he had made, supervised, or inspected certain repairs performed on the aircraft. <em>See </em>Certification: Airmen Other Than Flight Crewmembers, 14 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 65.85, 65.87 (1987). Norris, however, was not allowed to approve and return to service any aircraft or aircraft parts to which repairs had been made that did not conform to the applicable Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Any fraudulent entry by a mechanic in any record or report required by the FAR is cause for the FAA to suspend or revoke the mechanic\u2019s FAA. license. <em>See </em>Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Rebuilding, and Alteration, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 43.12 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">On July 15, 1987,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Norris was conducting a routine preflight inspection on one of HAL\u2019s DC-9 aircraft when he noticed that one of the main landing gear tires was worn. When the tire and bearing were removed, Norris and the other mechanics present observed that the axle sleeve, which normally has a mirror-smooth surface, was scarred and grooved, with gouges and burn marks clearly visible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Norris and the other mechanics believed that the part was unsafe and should be replaced. However, Norris\u2019 supervisor, Justin Culahara (Culahara), ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>mechanics to sand the axle sleeve by hand and put a new bearing and tire over it. The repairs were performed in accordance with Culahara\u2019s orders, and the aircraft made its scheduled flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">When Norris was about to leave at the end of his shift, Culahara ordered Norris to \u201csign off\u2019 the maintenance record for the installation of the tire, which under the applicable FAR operated as a certification by Norris that the repair had been performed satisfactorily and the aircraft was fit for return to service. Norris refused, explaining that the sleeve was unsafe. He indicated that he would sign off if Culahara \u201ccould show [Norris] in the [McDonnell Douglas] manual where it said that the axle was in satisfactory condition.\u201d Culahara informed Norris that if he did not sign the maintenance record, he (Norris) would be fired. Norris refused to sign off and was immediately suspended pending a termination hearing. Norris left the premises, and when he returned home, he called the FAA to report that there was a problem with an HAL aircraft that he had serviced. The FAA official advised Norris that the FAA would look into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Following hrs^suspension, Norris invoked the grievance procedure outlined in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which governed the terms and conditions of his employment. The agreement was entered into between Norris\u2019 union, the International Association of Machinists, and HAL, pursuant to the provisions of the RLA. The CBA provides that an employee may be disciplined or discharged only for just cause. It also states that an employee\u2019s refusal to perform work in violation of health and safety law \u201cshall not warrant disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Norris\u2019 termination hearing was held on July 31, 1987, which resulted in his termination for \u201cinsubordina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tion\u201d on August 3,1987.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After he was terminated, Norris contacted the FAA and gave them the details of what happened on July 15, 1987. On August 4, 1987, the FAA seized the axle sleeve and began a comprehensive investigation into the length of time the sleeve had been on the aircraft and the number of times the sleeve had been signed off while damaged. In September 1987, the FAA broadened its investigation to include other HAL DC-9 aircraft. Defendants state in their answering brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdF\">While it is true that the FAA initially charged HAL with violation of Federal Aviation Regulations regarding the condition of the axle sleeve on August 4,1987, the FAA made no findings of fact in that charge, and the charge was ultimately dismissed by the FAA with no findings of fact or conclusions of law having been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Following his termination, Norris filed a grievance seeking reinstatement and back pay. Norris\u2019 union representative referred the grievance for a \u201cStep 3\u201d hearing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pursuant to the CBA. However, before the hearing was conducted, HAL\u2019s Vice-President of Maintenance and Engineering, Howard E. Ogden (Ogden), offered to \u201cmitigate\u201d Norris\u2019 punishment to suspension without pay for the period August 3,1987 to September 15,1987. Ogden warned Norris by letter that \u201cany further instance of failure to perform [his] duties in a responsible manner\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>could result in his being discharged. Norris did not respond to HAL regarding the reinstatement offer, but filed suit against HAL in circuit court on December 8, 1987.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">On September 20, 1989, Norris filed this action against defendants Paul Finazzo, who at the time of Norris\u2019 termination was president of HAL, Ogden, and Hatsuo Honma, HAL\u2019s Director of Base Manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Norris\u2019 complaint alleges that defendants \u201cdirected, confirmed or ratified\u201d the acts of HAL\u2019s employees resulting in his discharge in violation of public policy as articulated in the Federal Aviation Act and the FAR (count I), and in the Hawaii Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act (HWPA), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 378-61 through -69 (Supp. 1991) (count II).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On October 22, 1990, the circuit court concluded that the RLA preempted Norris\u2019 state tort claims and therefore dismissed counts I and II for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The circuit court certified the dismissals as final pursuant to HRCP 54(b), and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We first address whether the RLA preempts Norris\u2019 claims for discharge in violation of public policy. Because we conclude it does not, we next address whether the state tort claim as alleged by Norris exists under Hawaii law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">A. Preemption Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u201cPreemption occurs when Congress, in enacting a federal statute, expresses a clear intent to preempt state law, when there is outright or actual conflict between federal and state law.\u201d <em>Louisiana Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, </em>476 U.S. 355, 368 (1986). Whether a state law estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>lishing a cause of action is preempted in a given case is a question of congressional intent. <em>See Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 208 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The RLA was enacted to promote stability in labor-management relations by providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes in the railroad industry, <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Sante Fe Railway Co. v. Buell, </em>480 U.S. 557, 562 (1987), and was extended to the airline industry pursuant to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 184 (1988). The purposes of the RLA are to provide for, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">the prompt and orderly settlement of all disputes concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions [and]... the prompt and orderly settlement of all disputes growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>491 U.S. 299 (1989), was called upon to examine the \u201ctwo classes of controversy Congress had distinguished in the RLA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. These two classes of controversy were \u201cregarded traditionally as the major and the minor disputes of the railway labor world.\u201d <em>Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. Co. v. Burley, </em>325 U.S. 711, 723 (1945). However, because the Court had not previously \u201carticulated an explicit standard for differentiating between major and minor disputes[,]\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail, </em>491 U.S. at 302, the Court in <em>Consolidated Rail </em>was compelled to do so.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">A \u201cmajor\u201d dispute</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">relates to disputes over the formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them. They arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>where there is no such agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one, and therefore the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy. They look to the acquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Burley, </em>325 U.S. at 723). Parties involved in major disputes are required \u201cto undergo a lengthy process of bargaining and mediation[,] [u]ntil they have exhausted those procedures[.] . . . Once this protracted process ends and no agreement has been reached, the parties may resort to the use of economic force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302-03 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">A \u201cminor\u201d dispute, on the other hand, contemplates the existence of a collective agreement already concluded or, at any rate, a situation in which no effort is made to bring about a formal change in terms or to create a new one. The dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific situation or to an omitted case.. .. [T]he claim is to rights accrued, not merely to have new ones created for the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 303 (citing <em>Burley, </em>325 U.S. at 723). Mandatory arbitration is the exclusive remedy for claims arising from minor disputes. <em>See id. </em>at 303-04; <em>see also Andrews v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R., </em>406 U.S. 320, 322-23 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The mandatory arbitration provision of the RLA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">The disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers <em>growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, </em>including cases pending and unadjusted on June 21, 1934, shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to the appropriate division of .the Adjustment Board with a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 First (i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Although the RLA provides a compulsory and binding arbitral system comprised of a National Railroad Adjustment Board, <em>see </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 First, there is no national adjustment board in the airline industry; minor disputes are resolved by adjustment boards established by the airlines and the unions. <em>See Consolidated Rail, </em>491 U.S. at 304 n.4. The decision of an adjustment board is final and binding. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 First (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The parties in this case agree that Norris\u2019 claims do not give rise to a \u201cmajor\u201d dispute. The question then is whether Norris\u2019 claims may be deemed \u201cminor,\u201d thereby preempting his state tort action and requiring him to submit to mandatory arbitration pursuant to the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Defendants contend that Norris\u2019 claims \u201cconstitute a \u2018dispute between [a] carrier and [an] employee\u2019 within the meaning of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 First [and therefore conclude that] it shall be the duty of \u2018all carriers, <em>their officers, agents and employees </em>... to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application of [collective bargaining] agreements, or otherwise[.]\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) This court in <em>Puchert v. Agsalud, </em>67 Haw. 25, 677 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>449 (1984), <em>appeal dismissed for want of substantial federal question, </em>472 U.S. 1001 (1985), examined the scope of the RLA preemption as it applied to airline employee Puchert\u2019s complaint of discharge from employment in violation of HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) of the HWPA for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">[clases holding that state law claims are preempted by the RLA are clearly distinguishable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The complaints filed in those cases constituted state law claims that were non-existent but for the collective bargaining agreement which provided remedies for such claims, or the state law claims were identical to the contractual claims provided for in the collective bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 29, 677 P.2d at 454 (citations omitted) (footnote added). We held that Puchert\u2019s complaint was not a \u201cminor dispute\u201d subject to mandatory arbitration under the RLA because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\"><em>[t]he resolution of the dispute . . . does not hinge on the application or interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement </em>between Pan Am and Puchert\u2019s union. Puchert complains of a violation of his right not to be discharged from his employment solely because he suffered from a work injury compensable under the state\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation law. <em>This right finds its source not in the collective bargaining agreement between Pan Am and Puchert\u2019s union, but in the statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 30,677 P.2d at 454 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Although a \u201cminor\u201d dispute contemplates the existence of a CBA, the term \u201cgrievances\u201d as used in the mandatory arbitration provision of the RLA, could arguably be ambiguous and may be literally read to include disputes arising outside a CBA. However, the United States Supreme Court clearly determined otherwise in <em>Consolidated Rait.~The </em>Court stated that \u201cminor\u201d disputes, to which \u00a7 153 First (i) applies, are those that \u201cmay be conclusively resolved by interpreting the existing [collective bargaining] agreement.\u201d 491 U.S. at 305 (citation omitted). The Court also stated that \u201c[w]here an employer asserts a contractual right to take the contested action, the ensuing dispute is minor if the action is arguably justified by the terms of the parties\u2019 collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. The Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the RLA\u2019s mandatory arbitration provision demonstrates its belief that Congress intended to affect only those disputes involving contractually defined rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Moreover, the plain language of \u00a7 153 First (i) does not support preemption of disputes independent of a labor agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In determining the RLA\u2019s scope of preemption, Norris asserts that the United States Supreme Court cases reviewing preemption under the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141-188, are analogous. Defendants, on the other hand, contend that such cases are inapposite to this case because preemption under the RLA is broader than under \u00a7 301 of the LMRA. We note that although all parallels between the RLA and the LMRA must be drawn \u201cwith utmost care,\u201d <em>Chicago &amp; N.W. Railway Co. v. United Transportation Union, </em>402 U.S. 570, 579 n.11 (1971), the Supreme Court has relied upon the \u201ccommon law\u201d of labor relations developed under the LMRA for assistance in construing the RLA. <em>Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>394 U.S. 369, 383-84 (1969).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also Puchert, </em>67 Haw. at 32, 677 P.2d at 455 (\u201ccourts have [also] applied standards adopted in NLRA pre-emption cases to [Railway Labor Act] cases\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">The United States Supreme Court has stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">Of course, not every dispute concerning employment, or tangentially involving a provision of a collective-bargaining agreement, is preempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>by \u00a7 301 <em>or other provisions of the federal labor law </em>.... Such rule of law would delegate to unions and unionized employers the power to exempt themselves from whatever state labor standards they disfavored. Clearly, \u00a7 301 does not grant the parties to a collective \u2014 bargaining agreement the ability to contract for what is illegal under state law. In extending the preemptive effect of \u00a7 301 beyond suits for breach of contract, it would be inconsistent with congressional intent under that section to pre-empt state rules that proscribe conduct, or establish rights and obligations, independent of a labor contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>Allis-Chalmers Corp., </em>471 U.S. at 211-12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In <em>Lingle v. Norge Division of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399 (1988), plaintiff was injured on the job and filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Upon learning of the claim, the employer fired plaintiff for filing an allegedly false claim. Plaintiff filed a grievance, alleging that she had been discharged without just cause in violation of the CBA. While arbitration was proceeding, plaintiff filed a retaliatory discharge action in Illinois state court contending that she had been discharged for exercising her rights under Illinois\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation laws. The employer contended that the state law tort action was preempted by provisions of the CBA. The federal trial and appeal courts agreed and dismissed the action. <em>See Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>618 F. Supp. 1448 (S.D. Ill. 1985); <em>Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>823 F.2d 1031 (7th Cir. 1987). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that application of state law is preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA only if the application requires the interpretation of a CBA. Examining Illinois <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>law and the CBA at issue, the Supreme Court reasoned that in order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">to show retaliatory discharge, the plaintiff must set forth sufficient facts from which it can be inferred that (1) he was discharged or threatened with discharge and (2) the employer\u2019s motive in discharging or threatening to discharge him was to deter him from exercising his rights under [Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act or to interfere with his exercise of those rights. Each of these purely factual questions pertains to the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer. <em>Neither of the elements requires a court to interpret any term of a collective-bargaining agreement. </em>To defend against a retaliatory discharge claim, an employer must show that it had a nonretaliatory reason for the discharge; this purely factual inquiry likewise does not turn on the meaning of any provision of a collective-bargaining agreement. <em>Thus, the state-law remedy in this case is \u201cindependent\u201d of the collective-bargaining agreement in the sense of \u201cindependent\u201d that matters for [LMRA] \u00a7 301 preemption purposes: resolution of the state-law claim does not require construing the collective-bargaining agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>Lingle, </em>486 U.S. at 407 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In <em>Maher v. New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, Inc., </em>125 N.J. 455, 593 A.2d 750 (1991), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that plaintiffs claim of retaliatory discharge, based on New Jersey\u2019s Whistleblower statute, was not preempted by the RLA. In its analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the New Jersey court rejected the employer\u2019s argument that \u00a7 301 of the LMRA has \u201cless preemptive force\u201d than the RLA. <em>Id. </em>at 472,593 A.2d at 759. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">When a collective-bargaining agreement subject to the [LMRA] establishes a grievance and arbitration remedy, that remedy preempts state-law-based claims by force of section 301. That preemptive effect is no different from that granted to the arbitral remedies established by the [RLA]. Preemption becomes a dominant consideration under both statutes when the arbitration process can be disrupted or when the uniformity of national law is threatened by a state claim that must be vindicated through outside interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 472-73, 593 A.2d at 759 (citations omitted). Persuaded by the analysis of the courts in <em>Lingle </em>and <em>Maher, </em>we agree with Norris that LMRA preemption cases are analogous, and thus, may provide guidance in determining the scope of preemption under the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In <em>Lingle, </em>the Supreme Court held that application of state law is preempted by the LMRA only if the application is dependent on the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. That holding is virtually indistinguishable from the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 153 First (i) of the RLA in <em>Consolidated Rail </em>and is also consistent with this court\u2019s interpretation in <em>Puchert. </em>We conclude that Congress intended the mandatory arbitration provision of the RLA be confined to the same limits the Supreme Court applied to the LMRA in <em>Lingle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In <em>Maher, </em>defendant New Jersey Transit Rail Operations (NJT) argued, as do the defendants in this case, that <em>Consolidated Rail </em>provides that a disagreement over an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>employer\u2019s action is a minor dispute if the contested action is \u201carguably justified by the terms of the parties\u2019 [CBA].\u201d The New Jersey Supreme Court noted that this test, articulated in <em>Consolidated Rail, </em>was not controlling in <em>Maher </em>because the standard was adopted in order to determine whether a disagreement was a <em>major dispute </em>or a <em>minor dispute. </em>_______</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">The New Jersey court noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">The danger with indiscriminate use of the \u201carguably justified\u201d standard in distinguishing between minor disputes and complaints that do not implicate the Railway Labor Act is that it enables a railway \u201csimply [to] hide behind the arbitration provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to bypass [its] employees\u2019 statutory right[s].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\"><em>Maher, </em>125 N.J. at 470, 593 A.2d at 758 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">However, the New Jersey court explained that even when considering the \u201carguably justified\u201d test, Maher\u2019s whistleblower-based claim was not preempted by the RLA. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">The key to this puzzle lies in the nature of the \u201cdisputed action.\u201d. . . The nub of the disputed action, then, is not that Maher was discharged, which \u201carguably\u201d would be covered by the \u201cjust-cause\u201d provision of the collective-bargaining agreement, but that he was discharged in retaliation for having reported violations of the law. The pertinent question is whether the collective-bargaining agreement addresses NJT\u2019s alleged conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">Although NJT\u2019s burden is \u201crelatively light\u201d in showing that the agreement brings Maher\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Adjustment Boards, the employer has not met that minimal standard. NJT has not suggested (the suggestion would be \u201cobviously insubstantial\u201d) that a retaliatory discharge is \u201csanctioned\u201d or \u201cjustified\u201d by a provision in the agreement. It can point to no part of the collective-bargaining agreement that demonstrates that the carrier and the union have agreed on standards relevant to Maher\u2019s situation. Maher\u2019s claim of retaliatory discharge does not in any way turn on an interpretation of the just-cause \u2014 discharge clause or any other clause in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 470-71, 593 A.2d at 758 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In this case, defendants argue that Articles IV and XVII of the CBA require interpretation in order to determine Norris\u2019 claim of retaliatory discharge. Article IV, paragraph D. 4(a)., provides that an aircraft mechanic \u201cmay be required to sign work records in connection with the work he performs.\u201d Defendants point to Culahara\u2019s (Norris\u2019 supervisor) deposition which indicates that he told Norris that he was not asking that Norris sign off for the condition of the axle sleeve, but to sign off for the tire change in which Norris participated. On these facts, defendants assert that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Norris\u2019 \u201cwrongful discharge\u201d claim will require interpretation of Article IV of the CBA because HAL could certainly legitimately discipline Norris for refusing to sign a work record if the work record did not cover the axle sleeve and if Norris could have noted his objections to the condition of the axle sleeve on any work record tendered to him for signature. <em>See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor Execs Assn., </em>491 U.S. 299, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>307 (1989) (If an RLA employer asserts a contractual right to take an action contested by employees, the controversy is subject to the RLA\u2019s grievance/arbitration procedures if the employer\u2019s action is \u201carguably justified\u201dcby the terms of the collective bargaining agreement)[.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfP\">We disagree. As in <em>Maher, </em>Norris\u2019 retaliatory discharge claim is based on his allegation that he was terminated for reporting a violation of the law, and defendants do not suggest that a retaliatory discharge is sanctioned or justified by a provision in the agreement nor do they point to any part of the CBA which demonstrates that the carrier and union have agreed on standards relevant to Norris\u2019 situation. Although defendants\u2019 defense is that Norris was terminated for insubordination, and thus \u201cjust cause,\u201d for not signing off on the work order, the respective positions of the parties to be presented at trial are, as noted in <em>Lingle, </em>\u201cpurely factual questions [which] pertain[] to the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer. Neither of [the parties\u2019 positions] requires a court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Lingle, </em>486 U.S. at 407.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">Defendants also argue that Article XVII of the CBA which protects employees from discipline for refusing to perform work in violation of state or federal health and safety laws, would have to be interpreted to determine if HAL acted \u201cwrongfully\u201d by initiating disciplinary action against Norris for refusal to sign off the work record. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>issue of safety in the workplace is a commonplace issue for arbitrators to consider in discharge cases[.]\u201d <em>United Paper Workers International Union v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 44 n.11 (1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG\">However, the issue raised by Norris is not one of safety in the \u201cworkplace\u201d for the benefit of the employees, but is focused on the public policy of protecting the safety of the flying public. As Norris points out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">Article XVII never refers to the safety of the public, which Norris was trying to protect. Instead, it refers, for example, to physical examinations for employees, to clean and dry washroom floors, to lights, to employee lockers, to unsafe and unsanitary working conditions, to protective apparel for employees, to rain repellent garments and boots for employees, to ear muffs, and to safety goggles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">We conclude that Norris\u2019 claim for retaliatory discharge is not dependent on an interpretation of Articles IV or XVII of the CB A or any other provision of the CB A. Consequently, Norris\u2019 claims are not preempted under the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">B. Norris\u2019 State Tort Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Defendants also argue that, even if Norris\u2019 claims are not preempted under the RLA, counts I and II, which are based on violations of public policies, do not state a claim arising under Hawaii law. Initially, we note that defendants do not deny the existence of the public policies relied upon by Norris under the Federal Aviation Act, the FAR, and the HWPA. However, defendants contend that, under the holding of <em>Pamar v. Americana Hotels, Inc., </em>65 Haw. 370, 652 P.2d 625 (1982), the state tort claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>discharge in violation of public policy is limited to at-will employees and does not extend to unionized employees who are protected by a \u201cmandatory grievance/arbitration procedure and just cause standard for termination\u201d under the CBA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In <em>Parnar, </em>a non-union employee (Parnar) filed a complaint alleging retaliatory discharge against Americana Hotels, Inc., the managing partner of the Ala Moana Hotel in Honolulu, Flagship International, Inc., the operator of the hotel, and Mark E. Liquori, the hotel\u2019s controller who was Parnar\u2019s immediate supervisor. Parnar asserted that public policy was violated when she was discharged for giving truthful information about her employer\u2019s possible federal antitrust violations. We held \u201cthat an employer may be held liable in tort where his discharge of an employee violates a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Parnar, </em>65 Haw. at 380, 652 P.2d at 631. This court determined that the relevant and clear public policy arising from the federal antitrust laws is to protect the public interest in free and unrestrained competition. We stated that \u201ca retaliatory discharge in apparent furtherance of antitrust violations contravenes public policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Defendants, however, maintain that Hawaii\u2019s public policy which \u201cstrongly favors upholding arbitration agreements\u201d overrides the extension of <em>Parnar </em>to this case. Although we agree that Hawaii\u2019s public policy as reflected by our Arbitration and Award Statute, HRS chapter 658, strongly favors arbitration over litigation, the mere existence of an arbitration agreement does not mean that the parties must submit to an arbitrator disputes which are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement. <em>See Koolau </em>Radiology, <em>Inc. v. Queen\u2019s Medical Ctr., </em>73 Haw. 433, 834 P.2d 1294 (1992) (the arbitration agreement limited the scope of an arbitrator, a real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>appraiser, to determine lease values and did not extend the arbitrator\u2019s authority to decide legal issues such as the statute of frauds or the parol evidence rule as related to an alleged oral agreement).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">The arbitral forum must be authorized and competent to resolve the dispute brought before it. \u201c[Ajrbitration is a continuation of the collective-bargaining process,\u201d and the role of the arbitrator is to interpret the labor contract and to apply the agreement to the facts of a dispute. On the other hand, the arbitrator \u201cordinarily cannot consider public interest, and does not determine violations of law or public policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"><em>Maher, </em>125 N.J. at 474, 593 A.2d at 760 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">In this case, there is no question that the relevant public policy of the Federal Aviation Act and the FAR is to protect the public from shoddy repair and maintenance practices in the aviation industry which may endanger the flying public. Moreover, we view the enactment of the HWPA by our legislature following the <em>Parnar </em>decision as a \u201cclear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Parnar, </em>65 Haw. at 380, 652 P.2d at 631. The HWPA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">(1) The employee ... reports or is about to report to a public body, verbally or in writing, a violation or a suspected violation of a law or rule adopted pursuant to law of this State, a politi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>cal subdivision of this State, or the United States, unless the employee knows that the report is false[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">HRS \u00a7 378-62(1) (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Our review of the legislative history of the HWPA reveals that the legislature intended to safeguard the general public by giving certain protections to individual employees who \u201cblow the whistle\u201d for the public good. <em>See </em>Senate Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1127, 1987 Senate Journal, at 1391-92 (\u201cproviding protection to government employees and citizens who are willing to \u2018blow the whistle\u2019 when they are aware of ethical or other violations of law will help the State maintain high standards of ethical conduct.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 25, 1987 House Journal, at 1090. The legislature did not restrict such protections to at-will employees. On the contrary, it left open for the courts to further determine the development of the common law in retaliatory discharge cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">Our [s]upreme [c]ourt has recently developed a common law tort for discharging an employee contrary to public policy in <em>Pamar v. Ala Moana Americana Hotels, Inc., </em>65 Haw. 370 (1982). The scope of this newly created right, the remedies which are allowed, and the procedures which are applicable have not been judicially determined. Your Committee does not believe that the Legislature should stifle or restrict the developing common law. Therefore, <em>a new section was added to provide that the statutory rights of action created herein are not to he construed to limit the development of the common law or as a legislative preemption of the common law on practices sought to be prohibited by this Act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Furthermore, we note that the legislature contemplated the potential conflict between union and nonunion employees by specifically providing that \u201c[w]here a collective bargaining agreement provides inferior rights and remedies to those provided in [the HWPA], the provisions of [the HWPA] shall supersede and take precedence over the rights, remedies, and procedures provided in collective bargaining agreements.\u201d HRS \u00a7 378-66(b) (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Amicus<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Hawaii Employers Council (HEC) urges that there is no need to extend <em>Parnar </em>to cover unionized employees. HEC argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">Simply because the remedies in each forum may be different does not mean that an employee has lesser protection under a collective bargaining agreement. Unionized employees have equitable remedies available under their collective bargaining agreements that are not available in actions at law. Reinstatement is a remedy that is commonly awarded by arbitrators under collective bargaining agreements. Moreover, punitive damages are available in arbitration if the parties have not excluded them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">As the Superior Court of Pennsylvania has held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">[W]e are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s arguments that the wrongfully discharged at-will employee has greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>remedies available in a civil action than does a union employee under a collective bargaining agreement since a civil court could award punitive damages.* While the at-will employee may be entitled to punitive damages in a civil action, he does not have the ability to obtain some of the remedies available to union members; such as reinstatement to his position, which is a commonly provided remedy in labor agreements. Thus, we find that a difference in remedies is not enough to justify an extension of the coverage of a wrongful discharge action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">* Although punitive damages are not generally available under collective bargaining agreements, if the agreement <em>is silent as to remedies, </em>arbitra,tors can award punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApE\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">HEC\u2019s argument is without merit because the CBA in this case is <em>not </em>silent as. to remedies. Article XV of the CBA, entitled \u201cGrievance Procedure,\u201d paragraph H, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">If as a result of any hearing or appeals therefrom it is found the suspension or discharge was not justified, the employee shall be reinstated without loss of seniority and made whole for any loss of pay he suffered by reason of his suspension or discharge, and his personnel records shall be corrected or cleared of such charge. If a suspension rather than discharge results, the employee shall have that time he has been held out of service without pay credited against his period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>suspension. In determining the amount of back wages due an employee who is reinstated as a result of the procedures outlined in this Agreement, <em>the maximum liability of the Company shall be limited to the amount of normal wages he would have earned in the service of the Company had he not been discharged or suspended.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The difference between the remedies available under the CBA and the measure of damages under a state tort action are substantial. Where the CBA limits the employer\u2019s liability to reinstatement and back wages, the measure of damages under state tort actions includes a sum of money which \u201cwill restore [claimant] to the position he [or she] would be [in] if the wrong had not been committed.\u201d <em>Nobriga v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>67 Haw. 157, 162, 683 P.2d 389, 393 (citing <em>Rodrigues v. State, </em>52 Haw. 156, 167, 472 P.2d 509, 517 (1970)), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>67 Haw. 683, 744 P.2d 779 (1984). Where the evidence justifies tort recovery, it may generally include special damages, which compensate claimants for specific out of pocket financial expenses and losses, general damages for pain, suffering, and emotional distress, <em>In re Hawaii Federal Asbestos Cases, </em>734 F. Supp. 1563 (1990), and punitive damages assessed for the purpose of punishing the defendant for aggravated or outrageous misconduct and to deter defendant and others from similar conduct in the future. <em>See Masaki v. General Motors Corp., </em>71 Haw. 1, 780 P.2d 566, <em>recon. denied, </em>71 Haw. 664, 833 P.2d 899 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Therefore, we conclude that the wide disparity between the remedies available under the CBA and the damages potentially recoverable in a state tort action, coupled with the legislature\u2019s enactment of the HWPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>following <em>Parnar, </em>justifies the extension of <em>Parnar </em>to this case. We believe such extension promotes the public policies underlying the Federal Aviation Act, the FAR, and the HWPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Because we have determined that Norris\u2019 state tort claims are not dependent on any interpretation of the CBA, we must now consider \u201cwhether application of state law in this case interferes with the scheme of the RLA.\u201d <em>Puchert v. Agsalud, </em>67 Haw. at 31, 677 P.2d at 455. We are in accord with the New Jersey Supreme Court in determining that the RLA does not \u201cexpress [any] congressional limitation of the right of States to protect an employee from discharge in retaliation for reporting violations of law, nor can such limitation be inferred from the federal act\u2019s scope.\u201d <em>Maher, </em>125 N.J. at 471, 593 A.2d at 758. Moreover, we have held that Norris\u2019 claims are not subject to arbitration under the RLA, and thus, we find the defendants\u2019 argument that the intent of the RLA, which is to provide a specific arbitral forum for industrial disputes \u201cconcerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions,\u201d would be undermined is without merit. Finally, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the intent of the RLA to promote stability of labor-management relations will in any way be disrupted by not preempting Norris\u2019 state tort claims. Thus, we conclude that the application of Norris\u2019 state-based-tort claims do not interfere with the scheme of the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we reverse the order of the trial court dismissing counts I and II of Norris\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>complaint, vacate the final judgment, and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AXR\"><em>Edward deLappe Boyle (.Ernest H.

The district court found the remaining claims to be within its discretionary pendent jurisdiction, but chose not to hear the claims and remanded the case to state court. Norris\u2019 complaint against HAL, identified as Civil No. 87-3894, is not at issue on this appeal because the circuit court\u2019s order and judgment entered in that case were vacated by this court due to lack of jurisdiction following removal from federal court.
