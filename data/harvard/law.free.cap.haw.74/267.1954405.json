Takao (Takao), judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawaii, from pursuing a criminal contempt of court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>charge against Evans. In the alternative, Evans moves this court for an order transferring Evans\u2019s hearing on the charge to another judge. For the reasons set forth below, we decline to grant the petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The present petition arises out of Evans\u2019s representation of Shane Ahlo (Ahlo) in a criminal prosecution tried before Takao. Ahlo was charged with one count of burglary in the first degree and two counts of terroristic threatening in the first degree for allegedly breaking into Sherryl Santiago\u2019s (Santiago) home and threatening Santiago and Annette DeMello (DeMello) with a gun. Santiago lived a few houses away from the residence that Ahlo shared with DeMello. Ahlo\u2019s defense to the charges was that the gun allegedly used in committing the offense was not a real gun, but was rather a cigarette lighter shaped like a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">On June 30,1992, the first day of trial, Ahlo informed Takao that he wanted his current attorney to be replaced by Evans. The court acceded to Ahlo\u2019s request and trial commenced the same day by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">On July 7, 1992, Santiago testified on behalf of the prosecution. On direct examination, Santiago testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that when Ahlo entered her home, Ahlo was holding an object that appeared to her to be a gun, pointed it at DeMello and Santiago, and endeavored to convince DeMello to come home with him. When this strategy failed, Ahlo reached behind Santiago, grabbed DeMello by the hair, dragged her to the floor, and placed the object to DeMello\u2019s head. Ahlo eventually left Santiago\u2019s house with DeMello, who was crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Immediately upon completion of direct examination, Evans handed an object, enclosed in a manila envelope, to the deputy prosecuting attorney (DPA) trying the case for the State. The DPA asked to approach the bench, where, out of the jury\u2019s hearing, he noted that he had not seen the object, which Evans identified for the first time as <em>\u201ca </em>cigarette lighter.\u201d The DPA advised Takao that the defense had not produced the lighter in discovery. Evans responded that the prosecution had \u201cnever asked for it\u201d and that the DPA \u201c[knew] all along, because I said it in my opening argument.\u201d Takao sustained the DPA\u2019s \u201cobjection\u201d on the basis that the object should have been produced in discovery<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and directed Evans to proceed with his examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Evans then began his cross-examination of Santiago by asking her to examine the object. The DPA objected to Santiago being permitted to examine any object that had not been disclosed to the prosecution in discovery. Takao sustained the objection and again directed Evans to proceed with his examination. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">Q. (By Mr. Evans:) Do you recognize that object?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">A. [By Santiago] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Q. Is that the object you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">[DPA]: Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">THE COURT: Just a moment. All right, I will sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>MR. EVANS: Is that the object you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">[DPA]: Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">THE COURT: Just a moment. The objection is sustained. The Court has made its ruling, Mr. Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">MR. EVANS: Your Honor, I\u2019ve disclosed to the jury and the Court and the Prosecution on Tuesday what the object would be that this witness would identify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">THE COURT: Objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">MR. EVANS: Since that time, the Prosecution has never asked to view that object. Furthermore, Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">THE COURT: Counsel will approach the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-17\">(At the bench)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-18\">THE COURT: Mr. Evans, the Court has made its ruling. You have a continuing obligation as counsel to \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-20\">MR. EVANS: Your Honor, the remedy is not to prevent Defense from using an exhibit which is clearly relevant to this case.

EVANS: The remedy is to take a recess, and allow the Prosecution to \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-25\">THE COURT: This is a trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-26\">MR. EVANS: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-27\">THE COURT: Okay, I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-29\">MR. EVANS: Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>THE COURT: Mr. Evans, the Court has made its ruling. If you keep persisting, we\u2019re going to have to continue this case for a couple of days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">MR. EVANS: Your Honor, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking for, a recess to allow the Prosecution \u2014you\u2019re trying to prevent the defendant from having a fair trial in this case, Your Honor, and I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">[DPA]: Excuse me, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">MR. EVANS: I told the Prosecution what the object was going to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">THE COURT: Mr. Evans \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZb\">MR. EVANS: I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6q\">THE COURT: Mr. Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8L\">MR. EVANS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">THE COURT: Do not raise your voice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASY\">MR. EVANS: I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor, I cannot stand here and allow my client not to have a fair trial. That\u2019s the object the witness saw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-17\">[DPA]: Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-18\">THE COURT: Mr. Evans, I\u2019m going to hold you in contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-20\">MR. EVANS: Fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-21\">THE COURT: All right, then I will excuse the jury. The jury is excused. Just wait outside, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-23\">(The jury was excused.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-24\">THE COURT: I will excuse the witness, too. Will you step outside and wait.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-26\">(The witness was excused.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-27\">THE COURT: Mr. Evans, the Court will make the finding notwithstanding the ruling, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Court\u2019s ruling. You have raised your voice to the Court not only once, but I\u2019ve asked you to keep quiet, and you continue to raise your voice. I\u2019m going to hold you in contempt of court, direct contempt of this Court, and I\u2019m going to impose a two-day jail sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">MR. EVANS: Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">THE COURT: Call the sheriff. Mittimus to issue forthwith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Evans immediately asked for leave to retain counsel, and Takao granted leave. Evans then requested that Takao continue the contempt proceedings until the conclusion of trial. Takao replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to be imposing the sentence right now, because I cannot tolerate such behavior on your part. That\u2019s the first time that ever happened to me in my twenty-five years on the bench.\u201d Evans again requested that the contempt proceeding be delayed until after trial in order to prevent prejudice to Ahlo. Takao withdrew the sentence and postponed any further hearing until Ahlo\u2019s trial concluded. The trial proceeded to verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">On July 9, 1992, the jury found Ahlo guilty of all offenses alleged in the indictment. On the same afternoon, Takao held a further hearing on the contempt charge. Takao articulated the charge against Evans as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">Mr. Evans, you are hereby charged with violation of [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 ] 710-1077, Subsection 1, Subsection (a). In the Court\u2019s presence, you have recklessly engaged in disorderly or contemptuous behavior directly tend[ing] to interrupt proceedings or impair respect to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The Court therefore has the power to order summary conviction in its position. The charge is a petty misdemeanor, and potential penalty shall not exceed 30 days in jail and/or a $500 fine. Accordingly, there is no right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">The substance of the charge is that you engaged in the following behavior that was disruptive and disrespectful, tending to interrupt the proceedings or to impair the respect due the Court\u2019s authority. Do you understand the charge?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Matthew Chung (Chung), Evans\u2019s counsel, replied, \u2018Your Honor, we understand the charge.\u201d After Takao informed Chung that the hearing on the contempt citation would go forward immediately, Takao characterized Evans\u2019s allegedly contemptuous behavior in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">Okay, the Court has made a ruling in this case that the defendant violated discovery rules; that the defendant had a continuing objection [sic \u2014 probably \u201cobligation\u201d] to disclose this evidence to the prosecutor; and the Court has ruled that that particular piece of evidence may not be introduced in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">Notwithstanding the Court\u2019s ruling, Mr. Evans defied the Court and proceeded to show the evidence in question, and sought to elicit testimony regarding the evidence. Despite the prosecutor\u2019s repeated \u2014 the deputy prosecutor repeatedly called the Court\u2019s attention regarding the attempt made by Mr. Evans, and the Court repeatedly sustained the objection. But notwithstanding the Court\u2019s ruling, the defendant continued to question the witness regarding the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The Court called for a bench conference and reminded Mr. Evans of the Court\u2019s ruling. Mr. Evans started to respond, and the Court, realizing that his voice was getting loud, loud enough for the jury to hear, the Court asked Mr. Evans to lower his voice. Mr. Evans then started to yell, and before the bench conference was over, removed himself from the bench conference and continued to yell at the top of his voice, telling the Court that he could not accept the Court\u2019s ruling. And at that point in time, the Court had to excuse the jury and the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">Prior to Mr. Evans removing himself from the bench conference, the Court reminded Mr. Evans of the contempt powers of the Court, but he challenged the Court to use the contempt powers of the Court, and all of this occurred in the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Takao then asked Chung if he had anything to say on Evans\u2019s behalf. Chung responded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">Your Honor, I believe under the statute, what you\u2019re citing my client; one, the Court needs to state what\u2019s the order. And secondly, the Court needs to state what the supposed violation is, and the section. And I believe the hearing on whether or not there is in fact a contempt is held before a different judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Takao explained that Chung was referring to the procedure required for \u201cconstructive contempt,\u201d that this was a case of \u201ccontempt occurr[ing] directly in the presence of the Court,\u201d and that therefore \u201cthis Court has the power to dispose of that contempt promptly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Chung asked for a continuance to enable counsel to review the July 7, 1992 transcript and the statements made by the various witnesses. Takao granted the request and set the contempt hearing for August 18,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">On August 12, 1992, Evans filed the present verified petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus and for a stay of the proceedings. We temporarily granted the stay pending the disposition of the petition and issued an order to show cause. The State filed a response to the petition and Takao, pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 21(c) (1984), elected not to file a response.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 9,1992, we entered an order denying Evans\u2019s petition and dissolving the temporary stay of proceedings. We also indicated that an opinion would be filed at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In his petition, Evans urges this court, on the record before us, to rule as a matter of law that he is not guilty of contempt of court. Alternatively, Evans argues, pursuant to the due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution, that: (1) he has a right to a finding that Takao\u2019s oral charge did not provide adequate notice of the specific charges against him; (2) he is entitled to a written order to show cause particularizing his allegedly contemptuous conduct; and (3) any further hearing on the charges must be heard by a judge other than Takao.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>A writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of other means adequately to redress the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. <em>Breiner v. Takao, </em>73 Haw. 499, 502, 835 P.2d 637, 640 (1992) (citing <em>State v. Oshiro, </em>69 Haw. 438, 441, 746 P.2d 568, 570 (1987)). \u201cSuch writs, however, are not meant to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, nor are they to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 835 P.2d at 640 (citing <em>State ex rel. Marsland v. Town, </em>66 Haw. 516, 668 P.2d 25 (1983)). As a threshold matter, we must therefore determine which of Evans\u2019s claims, if any, are ripe for review at this time. <em>Cf. Breiner, supra; see </em>HRS \u00a7 710-1077(5) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">A. Was Evans in contempt of court?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">There are two types of criminal contempt in Hawaii\u2014 direct \u201csummary\u201d contempt and indirect \u201cconstructive\u201d contempt. <em>Gabriel v. Gabriel, </em>7 Haw. App. 95, 99, 746 P.2d 574, 577 (1987) (citing <em>Murray v. Murray, </em>60 Haw. 160, 587 P.2d 1220 (1978), and <em>Hawaii </em>Pub. <em>Employment Relations Bd. v. Hawaii State Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>55 Haw. 386, 520 P.2d 422 (1974)). Direct summary criminal contempt occurs when \u201cthe offense [is] committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, or under such circumstances that the court has knowledge of all of the facts constituting the offense[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 710-1077(3)(a) (1985); <em>see also In re Nam, 65 </em>Haw. 119, 648 P.2d 1101 (1982). Other contumacious offenses are deemed indirect constructive criminal contempt. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 710 \u2014 1077(3)(b) (1985); <em>State v. Ryan, </em>59 Haw. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>425, 583 P.2d 329 (1978); <em>In re Bettencourt, </em>55 Haw. 430, 521 P.2d 668 (1974); <em>Gabriel, </em>7 Haw. App. at 99, 746 P.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In the present case, Takao has charged Evans with direct summary criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS \u00a7 710-1077(l)(a) (Supp. 1991). HRS \u00a7 710-1077 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">(1) A person commits the offense of criminal contempt of court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">(a) The person recklessly engages in disorderly or contemptuous behavior, committed during the sitting of a court in its immediate view and presence, and directly tending to interrupt its proceedings or impair the respect due to its authority [.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">HRS \u00a7 710-1077(3) (1985) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The court may treat the offense under subsection (1) as a petty misdemeanor, in which case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">(a) If the offense was committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, or under such circumstances that the court has knowledge of all of the facts constituting the offense, the court may order summary conviction and disposition^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Finally, HRS \u00a7 710-1077(5) (1985) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] <em>judgment, sentence, or commitment </em>under subsection (3)(a) shall not be subject to review by appeal, but shall be subject to review in an appropriate proceeding for an extraordinary writ or in a special proceeding for review.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Takao initially proceeded to find Evans in direct summary contempt of court, sentencing him to two days in jail. However, Takao subsequently withdrew the judgment and sentence and agreed to hold a hearing. At the July 9, 1992 hearing, Evans, via Chung, requested that the hearing be further delayed, and Takao acceded to the request. Evans thereafter filed the petition now before us; accordingly, there is no \u201cjudgment, sentence, or commitment,\u201d <em>see </em>HRS \u00a7 710-1077(5), for us to review. Therefore, that portion of the petition requesting a ruling that Evans\u2019s conduct was not contemptuous is premature. Nevertheless, pursuant to this court\u2019s general supervisory powers as provided in HRS ch. 602 (1985), we will maintain jurisdiction over the other issues Evans raises in his petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">B. Did Evans receive adequate and particularized notice of the charge against him?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Due process is not a fixed concept requiring a specific procedural course in every situation. <em>Sandy Beach </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Defense Fund v. City Council of the City and County of Honolulu, 70 </em>Haw. 361, 378, 773 P.2d 250, 261 (1989); <em>cf. Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1230 (1961). Rather, due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <em>Sandy Beach Defense Fund, 70 </em>Haw. at 378, 773 P.2d at 261; <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972). The basic elements of procedural due process of law require notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. <em>Sandy Beach Defense Fund, 70 </em>Haw. at 378, 773 P.2d at 261; <em>see also Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S. Ct. 893, 902, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976); <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 601, 605-06, 95 S. Ct. 719, 722, 42 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This court has recognized that direct summary criminal contempt proceedings are \u201creserved Tor exceptional circumstances... where instant action is necessary to protect the judicial institution itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Nam, </em>65 Haw. at 125, 648 P.2d at 1105 (citing In <em>re Gustafson, </em>650 F.2d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir. 1981), and quoting <em>Harris v. United States, </em>382 U.S. 162, 165, 167 (1965)); <em>accord Miranda v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co., </em>710 F.2d 516, 522 (9th Cir. 1983). In the face of \u201can open, serious threat to orderly procedure in the case\u201d or to \u201cthe orderly administration of justice,\u201d HRS \u00a7\u00a7 710-1077(l)(a) and (3)(a) authorize a court to impose \u201cinstant and summary punishment\u201d and to dispense with \u201c \u2018due and deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>procedures \u2014\u2019\u201d <em>In re Nam, 65 </em>Haw. at 125, 127-28, 648 P.2d at 1105-07 (quoting <em>Harris, </em>382 U.S. at 165).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Nevertheless, Evans concedes too much when he suggests in his petition that \u201c[generally, <em>no procedural due process </em>is afforded a person who, in the presence of the Court, is found to be guilty of summary contempt and immediate sentence is pronounced and punishment is imposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To the contrary, \u201c[e]ven where summary punishment for contempt is imposed during trial, \u2018the contemnor has normally been given an opportunity to speak in his own behalf in the nature of a right of allocution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 498, 94 S. Ct. 2697, 2703, 41 L. Ed. 2d 897 (1974) (quoting <em>Groppi v. Leslie, </em>404 U.S. 496, 504 (1972)). And where conviction and punishment for conduct during trial are delayed until after trial, the alleged contemnor \u201cshould have reasonable notice of the specific charges and an opportunity to be heard in his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 94 S. Ct. at 2703.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Evans cites <em>Gabriel </em>and <em>Taylor </em>for the proposition that procedural due process requires that a person adjudicated guilty of direct summary criminal contempt first be served with a written order to show cause when sentence and punishment are deferred until after trial or a later date; anything less, Evans argues, deprives the alleged contemnor of adequate notice of the specific conduct with which he is charged. Contrary to Evans\u2019s contentions, neither <em>Gabriel </em>nor <em>Taylor </em>mandates <em>written </em>notice in direct summary criminal contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In <em>Gabriel, </em>the parties agreed that the alleged misconduct at issue constituted indirect constructive \u2014 rather than direct summary \u2014 criminal contempt. 7 Haw.

As we have indicated, indirect constructive criminal contempt is governed by HRS \u00a7 710 \u2014 1077(3)(b), which provides that when the offense occurs and the court elects to treat it as a petty misdemeanor, \u201cthe court shall order the defendant [i.e., the alleged contemnor] to appear before it to answer a charge of criminal contempt of court[.]\u201d The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) in <em>Gabriel </em>noted that, unlike some jurisdictions, Hawaii has no rule of court expressly authorizing \u201coral notice of the charges in a constructive contempt situation\u201d; in the absence of such a rule, the ICA expressed the \u201cview\u201d that \u201cthe order called for in HRS \u00a7 710 \u2014 1077(3)(b) should be in the form of a written order to show cause served on the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 746 P.2d at 578.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>Gabriel </em>court did not discuss what, or even if, notice was required under HRS \u00a7\u00a7 710-1077(l)(a) and (3)(a), the direct summary criminal contempt statutes under which Evans is charged in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Unlike <em>Gabriel, Taylor </em>was a direct summary criminal contempt case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Significantly, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Taylor </em>did not require <em>written </em>notice of the specific charges. The <em>Taylor </em>Court merely held that \u201cbefore an attorney is finally adjudicated in contempt and sentenced after trial for conduct during trial, he should have reasonable notice of the specific charges and opportunity to be heard in his own behalf.\u201d 418 U.S. at 498-499, 94 S. Ct. at 2703. Therefore, the proper inquiry in the present case is whether Takao accorded Evans \u201creasonable notice of the specific charges and [an] opportunity to be heard[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">When Takao initially held Evans in contempt of court on July 7,1992, he described the conduct that he believed to be contemptuous; Takao, at the request of Evans\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>attorney, subsequently agreed to withdraw sentence and continue the proceedings until after the conclusion of Ahlo\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">On July 9,1992, Takao explained once again in detail the specific charges and cited the specific statute \u2014 HRS \u00a7 710-1077(l)(a) \u2014 under which Evans was charged. Evans appeared with counsel and was given an opportunity to be heard. Evans asked for and received a further continuance of thirty days. That Evans received reasonable notice of the specific charges on July 9, 1992 is most clearly demonstrated by his own attorney\u2019s rationale for requesting the further continuance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">MR. CHUNG:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">I need more time to find out what happened based on the transcript, Judge. I bet, or I would suspect that the bench conference is a part of the transcript. <em>I would ask for simply those portions of the transcript that would relate to the facts that support the Court\u2019s charge. </em>And thereafter, we can come back with the hearing after I\u2019ve had a chance to appropriately prepare, and I can present my evidence and make a proper argument, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">So again, Your Honor, I would ask simply <em>now that we know what your charge is, </em>if we can have another date further down the road and allow me time to get discovery, and then prepare argument, look at the legal background, and then come back to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Based on the record before us, we hold that Takao\u2019s oral charge provided Evans with reasonable and adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>notice of the specific charges against him and an opportunity to be heard. And based on the existing case law, with which we agree, we hold that Evans\u2019s right to procedural due process does not entitle him to a written order to show cause as to why he should not be held in direct summary criminal contempt of court in violation of HRS \u00a7 710-1077(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">C. Should Evans\u2019s contempt hearing be conducted before a judge other than Takao?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Relying on <em>State v. Brown, </em>70 Haw. 459, 465-67, 776 P.2d 1182, 1187-88 (1989), and <em>Taylor, </em>418 U.S. at 488, 94 S. Ct. at 2705, Evans urges, consistent with his right to procedural due process, that Takao cannot preside over his continued contempt proceeding because \u201cwhere there is a possible bias of the judge that finds and charges another person with contempt, another judge should preside at the contempt proceeding to maintain a calm detachment necessary for a fair adjudication on the contempt charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Evans\u2019s argument is superficially appealing. In <em>Brown, </em>we expressed the following broad dictum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">The question is whether a judge who causes a criminal contempt proceeding to be instituted may then sit with impunity in judgment of the accused. We begin our analysis with the fundamental propositions that \u201c[c]riminal contempts are crimes, [one] accused [of criminal contempt] is entitled to the benefit of all constitutional safeguards,\u201d ... and \u201c[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">\u201cFairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cBut our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness. To this end... no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome.\u201d . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">The relevant teaching of the Supreme Court is that \u201c[e]very procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.\u201d . . . When criminal contempt is charged, it signifies that the accuser believes the defendant\u2019s conduct was contemptuous. A procedure whereby \u201cthe trial, if any, upon the charges shall be by the [judge who lodged it,] without a jury... denies the accused due process; it offers a temptation to the judge to forget that \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt shall be required for conviction.\u201d . . . Due process, in the circumstances, called for a trial before someone other than the accuser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">70 Haw. at 465-67, 776 P.2d at 1187-88 (citations and footnotes omitted) (brackets in original).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>As we have noted above, however, we recognized seven years prior to <em>Brown, </em>in <em>In re Nam, </em>that, in the face of \u201can open, serious threat to orderly procedure in the case\u201d or to \u201cthe orderly administration of justice\u201d giving rise to direct summary criminal contempt, the trial judge is empowered to impose \u201cinstant and summary punishment\u201d and to dispense with \u201c \u2018due and deliberate procedures[J \u201d 65 Haw. at 125, 127-28, 648 P.2d at 1105-07 (quoting <em>Harris, </em>382 U.S. at 165).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The apparent tension between the language of <em>Brown </em>and <em>In re Nam </em>might suggest that the former has overruled the latter <em>sub silentio. </em>But it is no coincidence that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown </em>made no mention of <em>In re Nam. </em>The two decisions addressed wholly distinct problems \u2014 indirect constructive criminal contempt in <em>Brown </em>and direct summary criminal contempt in <em>In re Nam </em>\u2014 and are therefore reconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">By its very nature, indirect constructive criminal contempt is neither \u201ccommitted in the immediate view and presence of the court [] nor under circumstances that the court has knowledge of all of the facts constituting the offense[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 710-1077(3)(b) (1985).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In such instances, the judge, as the \u201caccuser [who, by virtue of lodging the charge,] believes the defendant\u2019s conduct [to be] contemptuous[,]\u201d may indeed be tempted \u201cto forget that \u2018proof beyond a reasonable doubt [is] required for conviction\u00fc\u2019 \u201d under HRS \u00a7 710-1077(3)(b). <em>Brown, </em>70 Haw. at 467, 776 P.2d at 1187-88.
