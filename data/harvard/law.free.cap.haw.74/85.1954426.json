WBIC contends that the trial court erred in not awarding WBIC all of its claimed damages and prejudgment interest arising out of an alleged breach by the plaintiff, counterdefendant-appellant, crossappellee Amfac, Inc. (Amfac)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of an indemnification agreement. Amfac cross \u2014 appeals the circuit court\u2019s September 30, 1988 order granting partial summary judgment in favor of WBIC, ruling as a matter of law that Amfac had breached the indemnification agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Amfac also cross-appeals the circuit court\u2019s November 3, 1988 order denying Amfac\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment order and the trial court\u2019s November 8, 1990 FOFs, COLs, and final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s orders, vacate the trial court\u2019s final judgment, and remand for a determination of damages and attorney\u2019s fees consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The present case involves three Land Court registered parcels located in the Waikiki district of Honolulu. The first, Lot 30-A, fronts Kuhio Avenue; the Coral Reef Hotel is located on it. The second, Lot 54, fronts Kalakaua Avenue; the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel (WBH) is located on it. The third, Lot 29, is situated between Lots 30-A and 54, and the International Market Place is located on it. At all relevant times, the fee simple owner of the three lots was the Queen Emma Foundation, also known as the Queen\u2019s Medical Center (Queen\u2019s). The master lesseesublessor of the lots was Waikiki Development Co., Inc., also known as WDC Venture (WDC). From and after April 1, 1974, Andre Stephen Tatibouet, William W. Saunders (Saunders), Annalie Knaack Tatibouet, Martin Von Dehn McCall and Stephanie Tatibouet McCall (collectively the Group), were the sublessees of Lot 30-A and owned the Coral Reef Hotel. From March 11,1969 through January 31,1985, Amfac was the owner of the WBH and the sub-lessee of Lot 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">In 1956, in conjunction with the Land Court registration of various lots, including Lots 29 and 30-A, Easement H, also known as \u201cDuke\u2019s Lane,\u201d was created and ran from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Kuhio Avenue to Lot 4 across the ewa (west) side of Lots 29, 30-A, and 25. Easement H was a twenty-foot wide nonexclusive easement for roadway purposes to be used in common by the owners/lessees/sublessees of Lots 30-A, 29, 4, and 25; it allowed ingress and egress to and from Kuhio Avenue. In 1969, Lots 4 and 25 became part of Lot 54, and the easement rights associated with Easement H passed to the owners/lessees/sublessees of Lot 54. Additionally, from and after 1968, an easement was created <em>in favor of Lot 29 only and against Lot 30-A </em>\u201cfor the construction, repair and operation of sewers and other underground utilities along and under Easement H.\u201d In connection with this easement, WDC caused a sewer line to be placed for servicing the International Market Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Pursuant to yet another easement subject to a relocation clause granted by Consolidated Amusement Co., Ltd. (Consolidated) to the owners/lessees/sublessees of Lot 54, the WBH had been serviced by a sewer line that ran ewa to Seaside Avenue over adjacent property owned by Consolidated. In late 1979 or early 1980, Consolidated notified Amfac that it was exercising the relocation clause. Amfac obtained an oral right of entry from Queen\u2019s and WDC for the construction of the WBH\u2019s new sewer line under Easement H. <em>However, Amfac did not seek or obtain consent from the Group for construction of the WBH\u2019s sewer line under Easement H and across Lot 30-A.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Amfac constructed the new WBH sewer line to run from the ewa-mauka (northwest) corner of Lot 54 under Easement H and across the ewa edges of Lots 29 and 30-A, tying into the municipal sewer line on Kuhio Avenue. Before the WBH sewer line was completed, Saunders, on behalf of the Group, notified Amfac and WDC in a letter dated September 9, 1980 that no sewer easement rights existed in favor of the owners/lessees of Lot 54, over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>and across Lot 30-A along Easement H. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">Although we are receptive to negotiating the terms of such an easement, contingent of course upon approval of WDC Venture, as Sublessor, and The Queen Emma Foundation, as Lessor, such negotiations would <em>include at least a clarification of all easement rights and obligations regarding the access easements running between Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues and a reasonable allocation of maintenance costs. Further some study should be given to a possible allocation of present and/or future lease rentals among the users of the easements in proportion to their respective usages thereof.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">By this letter, <em>we urge that an immediate review of these matters be made since it presently appears to us that the sewer construction is proceeding without sewer easement rights </em>and, of course, if that proves to be true, <em>such construction work is being done at the peril of the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel in the unlikely event we are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement </em>on all such issues. <em>Perhaps, </em>therefore, <em>the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel should suspend any further </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>construction activities pending such agreement </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Amfac\u2019s response to the letter was that \u201cit would look into it and get back to him [Saunders].\u201d To ascertain whether Amfac had any existing sewer easement rights as to Easement H, Amfac sought advice from outside counsel, who responded, <em>inter alia, </em>in a letter dated October 3, 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">At the present time the... <em>[WBH] does not have a formal written agreement from . . . Queen\u2019s ... or WDC . . . authorizing it to use Easement H for sewer line purposes. </em>We recommend that such an agreement be prepared and entered into by and among those parties and Amfac, Inc. The document could be styled as a partial assignment or sublease of the reserved sewer line easement rights. <em>Amfac may be requested to indemnify these parties against the claims of .. . [the Group] </em>and this could also be included in the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">In December 1980, Amfac requested that Title Guaranty of Hawaii, Inc. (TGH) conduct a title search of Lot 30-A to determine whether a sewer easement running in favor of Lot 54 across Lot 30-A existed; the search revealed that <em>there was no such easement. </em>In March 1981, Amfac directed outside counsel to prepare a \u201cGrant of Nonexclusive Easement\u201d to be signed by Queen\u2019s, WDC, and the Group. However, none of these parties signed the document and <em>Amfac took no further action in securing a valid easement for its sewer line.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>On or about May 4, 1984, WBIC and Amfac entered into a purchase agreement (the WBIC Purchase Agreement) for the sale of the WBH and Amfac\u2019s subleasehold interest in Lot 54 (the WBIC Purchase). Amfac\u2019s representatives regarding the WBIC Purchase Agreement were George Fujikawa (Fujikawa) and in-house counsel Carl Tom (Tom). WBIC\u2019s representatives were James Reynolds (Reynolds) and outside counsel, Melvin Kaneshige (Kaneshige). The WBIC Purchase Agreement was mutually drafted by the parties\u2019 respective counsel and the closing date of the sale was set for January 31, 1985. Approximately five months before the closing date for the purchase, WBIC learned that no sewer easement existed in favor of Lot 54 for the WBH\u2019s sewer line. On November 27, 1984, Amfac again directed TGH to do a title search, this time for Lot 54, to determine if any sewer easement existed; <em>no sewer easement existed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Thereafter, both Amfac and WBIC met with Saunders to try to reach an agreement whereby the Group would grant Lot 54 a sewer easement across Lot 30-A for little or no consideration; no agreement was reached. On January 30, 1985, Kaneshige suggested that the sewer easement problem could be taken care of to the satisfaction of WBIC if Amfac, as the new owner of the WBH, would agree to indemnify WBIC against any claims made against WBIC as a result of the absence of any recorded sewer easement. Kaneshige drafted a preliminary Indemnification Agreement, which precipitated negotiations between Kaneshige and Tom. On January 31, 1985, the Indemnification Agreement was signed by both parties, and WBIC\u2019s purchase of Amfac\u2019s subleasehold interest in Lot 54 and of the WBH closed on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Indemnification Agreement provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>1. Indemnity. <em>[Amfac] will indemnify and hold WBIC harmless from and against any and all claims, </em>demands, judgments or causes of action arising out of or <em>in any way related to </em>the encroachments onto the [WBH] property and the location, placement, construction, maintenance, repair or replacement of <em>a sewer line </em>or lines <em>under </em>the roadway in an area commonly known as <em>\u201cDuke\u2019s Lane\u201d </em>located along the ewa boundary of the [WBH] and running from Kalakaua Avenue to Kuhio Avenue, <em>including, without limitation, claims arising because of the failure to secure a sewer easement prior to </em>the <em>construction </em>of a sewer line along Duke\u2019s Lane <em>and claims for contribution towards the costs of maintenance of the sewer line </em>and Duke\u2019s Lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">2. Sewer Easement and Encroachments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">(a) <em>[Amfac] will obtain and file of record a sewer easement (in form and content reasonably satisfactory to WBIC) granting to the owners I lessees I sublessees of the [WBH] property an easement under Duke\u2019s Lane for sewer purposes </em>and will, if reasonably required by WBIC, cause the removal of said encroachments onto the [WBH] property. <em>Any and all costs in connection with such grant </em>and removal of such encroachments, <em>including reasonable attorneys fees of WBIC, shall be borne by [Amfac], not WBIC.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">(b) <em>There shall be no continuing obligation on the part of any fee simple owner, lessee, sublessee or any person with an interest in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>[WBH] property (except for [Amfac]) to pay any amounts, either lump sum or in installments, for the grant of such easement </em>or removal of such encroachments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Between January 31, 1985 and June 21, 1985, Fujikawa investigated the possibility of building an alternative sewer line for the WBH out to Kalakaua Avenue; Amfac subsequently concluded that building such an alternative sewer line was not economically feasible. Because of Amfac\u2019s difficulty in obtaining the Group\u2019s consent to the grant of a sewer easement in favor of Lot 54 across Lot 30-A without paying monies considered \u201cunreasonable\u201d by Amfac, Fujikawa advised Reynolds that an alternative means of satisfying Amfac\u2019s obligations under the Indemnification Agreement would have to be found. WBIC\u2019s counsel, Edward Chun (Chun), drafted a letter dated April 15, 1985 (the Letter Agreement) in conjunction with Amfac\u2019s counsel, Lynn Hiatt. The Letter Agreement provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that Amfac\u2019s obligations under the Indemnification Agreement would terminate if either of two conditions were satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">Additionally, WBIC hereby agrees that <em>the Indemnification Agreement provisions relating to the sewer line </em>referred to on page 1 of this letter <em>shall terminate upon </em>the earlier of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">(1) the execution by [the Group] of an instrument unconditionally acknowledging said sewer easement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">(2) <em>verification by [TGH] (to WBIC\u2019s reasonable satisfaction) that the subleasehold interest in Lot 30-A </em>held by [the Group] <em>is subject to a pre</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>existing sewer easement in favor of Lot 54.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">(Emphasis added.) The Letter Agreement was signed by Amfac on May 3,1985; in it, Amfac not only agreed to the two alternative means of performance, but also reaffirmed its continued obligations under the Indemnification Agreement. WBIC insisted on Amfac\u2019s reaffirmation of its indemnity obligations because the Group had declined to become a party to a \"Grant of Nonexclusive Easement,\u201d which was executed by Queen\u2019s and WDC in favor of WBIC and subsequently recorded in Land Court on June 27, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Pursuant to the WBIC Purchase Agreement, Amfac was obligated to deliver an estoppel certificate from WDC to WBIC. However, WDC refused to execute the estoppel certificate as long as the sewer easement problem remained unresolved with the Group. WBIC needed the estoppel certificate because an ALTA mortgagee\u2019s title policy, a requirement imposed by WBIC\u2019s lender in connection with the financing of the WBIC Purchase Agreement, would not be issued until the sewer easement problem was rectified. Accordingly, in consideration for Amfac\u2019s agreement to indemnify TGH against any loss, Amfac induced TGH to issue an ALTA mortgagee\u2019s title policy that did not disclose the absence of a recorded sewer easement granted by the Group in favor of Lot 54. TGH\u2019s \u201cfalse\u201d policy satisfied WBIC\u2019s lender, and WBIC obtained the necessary funding to discharge its financial obligation to Amfac under the WBIC Purchase Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Thereafter, until 1987, Amfac took no further action to secure the Group\u2019s consent to a sewer easement in favor of Lot 54. In December 1986, WBIC entered into negotiations to sell the subleasehold interest in Lot 54 and the WBH to Azabu, U.S.A. Corporation (Azabu). On January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>2, 1987, the parties executed a purchase agreement (the Azabu Purchase Agreement) for the sale of the sub-leasehold interest in Lot 54 and the WBH to Azabu. By a first amendment to the Azabu Purchase Agreement, dated February 5, 1987, the closing date for the sale was set for April 30, 1987. One of WBIC\u2019s pre-closing obligations was to cause TGH to issue an ALTA owner\u2019s title policy to Azabu for Lot 54. Sometime during mid-April 1987, TGH refused to issue an ALTA owner\u2019s title policy verifying the existence of a sewer easement in favor of Lot 54 without first receiving complete indemnities from Amfac and WBIC. It was only then that WBIC discovered that Amfac had not yet obtained the easement grant from the Group and therefore that the easement did not in fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On or about April 16,1987, WBIC advised Azabu and Amfac of the continuing existence of the sewer easement problem, and on several occasions all three parties met to discuss possible solutions. On April 24, 1987, Azabu advised WBIC that it would not close the sale without a recorded sewer easement from the Group and that it would not extend the April 30, 1987 closing date. WBIC met with Saunders to discuss what the Group wanted in exchange for granting Lot 54 a sewer easement. Later that day, Reynolds personally contacted Saunders and offered $50,000.00 as reasonable compensation for the Group\u2019s granting the sewer easement. Saunders refused to compromise his previous demands, whereupon WBIC drafted an agreement (the Joinder Agreement) to secure the Group\u2019s joinder in the existing \u201cGrant of Nonexclusive Easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In a letter dated April 27, 1987, WBIC tendered the Joinder Agreement to Amfac; two days later, Amfac rejected the Joinder Agreement. Instead, as a means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>satisfying its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement, Amfac secured and tendered to WBIC a commitment from TGH to issue the same form of ALTA policy as it had previously provided to WBIC\u2019s mortgagee, i.e., a \u201cfalse\u201d ALTA title policy that would \u201cverify\u201d the preexistence of an easement in favor of Lot 54. WBIC rejected Amfac\u2019s tender of title \u201cverification\u201d because, in fact, no pre-existing sewer easement had been granted by the Group. Thereafter, WBIC, Azabu, and the Group executed the Joinder Agreement, by the terms of which the Group granted the sewer easement in consideration of WBIC\u2019s agreement to pay the Group the sum of $200,000.00 and to assume fourteen percent of the Group\u2019s future lease rent and real property tax obligations with respect to Lot 30-A through the year 2050.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">On May 15, 1987, Amfac filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against WBIC, seeking a declaration that Amfac had satisfied all of its obligations to WBIC under the Indemnification Agreement as of April 29, 1987 \u2014 the date Amfac tendered TGH\u2019s commitment to issue an ALTA owner\u2019s title policy \u201cverifying\u201d the preexistence of a recorded sewer easement in favor of Lot 54. In its answer and counterclaim, WBIC alleged that Amfac had breached its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement and that WBIC was entitled to damages resulting from the alleged breach. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court entered partial summary judgment in favor of WBIC, ruling as a matter of law that Amfac had breached its obligations to WBIC under the Indemnification Agreement. Thereafter, and further to the circuit court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment, WBIC filed a motion, in the nature of partial summary judgment, for determination of damages; the circuit court denied the motion because there was a genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>issue of material fact as to the amount of WBIC\u2019s damages. After a bench trial on the issue of damages, the trial court entered judgment in WBIC\u2019s favor in the amount of $305,163.84, consisting of $200,000.00 in damages by reason of Amfac\u2019s breach of the Indemnification Agreement and $105,163.84 for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. WBIC timely appealed and Amfac cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">II. Discussion A. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Amfac claims that it satisfactorily complied with the second condition of the Letter Agreement when, by letter dated April 29,1987, it tendered to WBIC TGH\u2019s commitment to issue an ALTA owner\u2019s title policy \u201cverifying\u201d the pre \u2014 existence of a sewer easement across Lot 30-A in favor of Lot 54.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Amfac contends that, based on the parties\u2019 understanding at the time the Letter Agreement was executed, the issuance of an ALTA policy should have constituted reasonably satisfactory \u201cverification\u201d by TGH of a pre-existing sewer easement and, therefore, Amfac\u2019s obligations under the Indemnification and Letter Agreements should be deemed to have terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">WBIC argues that Amfac partially satisfied its obligations under the Indemnification and Letter Agreements when WBIC obtained and recorded the June 21, 1985 \u201cGrant of Nonexclusive Easement\u201d from Queen\u2019s and WDC. According to WBIC, Amfac\u2019s tender of TGH\u2019s commitment to issue an ALTA policy as \u201cverification\u201d of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>pre-existing sewer easement was not \u201creasonably satisfactory\u201d performance of the second condition of the Letter Agreement because the uncontroverted fact was that the Group\u2019s subleasehold interest in Lot 30-A was never subject to any pre-existing sewer easement running in favor of Lot 54. WBIC contends that the only reason TGH was willing to issue a ALTA policy \u201cverifying\u201d the preexistence of a sewer easement was that Amfac had agreed to indemnify TGH; thus, TGH was \u201cverifying\u201d the existence of something that did not in fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We review an award of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court. <em>Gossinger v. Association of Apartment Owners of The Regency Ala Wai, </em>73 Haw. 412, 417, 835 P.2d 627, 630 (1992). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Gos-singer, </em>73 Haw. at 417, 835 P.2d at 630 (citing Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 56(c) (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">In its September 30, 1988 order granting WBIC\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the circuit court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">[TGH\u2019s] commitment to issue an [ALTA] policy in favor of Azabu effective April 30, 1987, including the sewer easement across and under Lot 30-A and in favor of Lot 54 <em>did not reasonably satisfy . . . [WBIC], because there never was a pre-existing easement. The policy could not verify what in fact never existed </em>and, therefore, Condition #2 of the [Letter Agreement] was not satisfied by .. . [Amfac].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The determination as to whether the circuit court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of WBIC turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201creasonable satisfaction\u201d as it appears in the Letter Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Although there is no Hawaii authority construing when a contracting party should be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d with a tendered performance, other jurisdictions have addressed the issue. The majority recognize that, when a contract provides for one party\u2019s performance to be rendered to the \u201csatisfaction\u201d of another, absent any express contract language modifying the term \u201csatisfaction,\u201d there are two standards that can be applied to determine satisfaction: the \u201cobjective reasonable satisfaction\u201d standard and the \u201csubjective personal satisfaction\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., Kadner v. Shields, </em>20 Cal. App. 3d 251, 259-62, 97 Cal. Rptr. 742, 748-51 (1971); <em>Indiana Tri-City Plaza Bowl, Inc. v. Estate of Glueck, </em>422 N.E.2d 670, 675 (Ind. Ct. App. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Absent express language in the contract as to which standard to apply, the majority of jurisdictions apply the \u201cobjective reasonable satisfaction\u201d standard when the contract involves commercial quality, operative fitness, or mechanical utility which knowledgeable persons are capable of judging; the \u201csubjective personal satisfaction\u201d standard is applied when the contract involves personal aesthetics, taste, or fancy. <em>See, e.g., Kennedy Associates, Inc. v. Fischer, </em>667 P.2d 174, 181-82 (Alaska 1983); <em>Meredith Corp. v. Design &amp; Lithography Center, Inc., </em>101 Idaho 391, 393, 614 P.2d 414, 416 (1980); <em>Indiana Tri-City Plaza Bowl, </em>422 N.E.2d at 675; <em>Fitzmaurice v. Van Vlaanderen Machine Co., 57 </em>N. J. 447, 449, 273 A.2d 561, 562 (1971); <em>Cranetex, Inc. v. Precision Crane &amp; Rigging, Inc., </em>760 S.W.2d 298, 301-02 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>(Tex. Ct. App. <em>1988);Haymore v. Levinson, 8 </em>Utah 2d <em>66, </em>68, 328 P.2d 307, 309 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">However, in many cases, there is no clear demarcation between which of the two standards should be applied. In the absence of specific language in the contract or a clear indication from the nature of the subject matter of the contract, many jurisdictions opt for the less arbitrary objective reasonable satisfaction standard. <em>See, e.g., Kennedy, </em>667 P.2d at 182; <em>Kadner, </em>20 Cal. App. 3d at 263, 97 Cal. Rptr. at 752. Moreover, even where the contract has explicitly stated that satisfaction relates to \u201cartistic effect,\u201d such language will not be enforced literally if the subject matter of the contract relates to commercial quality, operative fitness, or mechanical utility. <em>See Morin Bldg. Products Co. v.

Inasmuch as the term \u201creasonableness\u201d is subject to differing interpretations (i.e., is \u201crelative and not readily definable\u201d), it is inherently ambiguous.

Nevertheless, Amfac contends that, short of producing an executed Joinder Agreement, the tender of TGH\u2019s policy was the only available means of accomplishing the \u201cverification\u201d called for in the second condition of the Letter Agreement. Amfac\u2019s argument begs the question because the crux of the parties\u2019 dispute is precisely whether they could reasonably have intended, when they entered into the Letter Agreement, that a \u201cfalse\u201d ALTA policy could be <em>capable </em>of constituting \u201cverification\u201d of a non-existent easement. The term \u201cverification\u201d is unmodified in the Letter Agreement, and it is fundamental that \u201cterms of a contract should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary and accepted use in common speech, unless the contract indicates a different meaning.\u201d <em>SGM Partners v.

Title insurance and title insurers became statutorily regulated in 1965 by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 432; effective July 1, 1988, chapter 432 was extensively revised and reorganized. <em>See </em>HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 431:20-101 through 431:20-125; Acts 347, 348, 349, Vol. 2,1987 Haw. Sess. Laws at 309-16, 356-58, 384. HRS \u00a7 431:20-113 (1987 Spec. Pamphlet), entitled \u201cUnderwriting standards and record retention,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">(a) No title insurance policy may be written unless and until the title insurer has caused to be conducted a reasonable search and examination of the title, and has caused to be made a determination of insurability of title <em>in accordance with sound underwriting practices. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">(b) Except as allowed by regulations promulgated by the commissioner, no title insurer shall knowingly issue any title insurance policy or commitment to insure without showing all outstanding, enforceable recorded liens or other interests against the property title which is to be insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Contrary to what Amfac argues by implication, TGH\u2019s issuance of an ALTA policy failing to reflect the nonexistence of a necessary easement, in consideration for Amfac\u2019s agreement to indemnify TGH against any loss arising out of the false representation, is not standard practice in the industry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Standard practice in the title insurance industry has been articulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>[E]very policy ... should set forth everything that is on record on the date of the policy unless a specific decision is made by the insurer to not show something of record because a determination has been made that it does not currently burden the property.

The purpose of title insurance is to reduce or mitigate the risks associated with the purchase of real property. The practice of issuing title policies based not on the results of a title search, but rather on indemnification of the title insurer, should be discouraged because it subverts the purpose of title insurance and flatly violates the mandate of HRS \u00a7 431:20-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In any event, Amfac betrays by its own actions that, at the time the Letter Agreement was executed, it was aware that neither party considered \u201cfalse verification\u201d to be the \u201cverification \u201d called for in the Letter Agreement. On May 8,1985, twenty-three days after the execution of the Letter Agreement, Amfac caused TGH to take essentially the same action it now claims satisfies the second condition of that agreement when, for the benefit of WBIC\u2019s lender, it induced TGH to issue an ALTA mortgagee\u2019s title policy that did not include an exception for the absence of a preexisting sewer easement in favor of Lot 54. If this were the performance that both parties had agreed would satisfy Amfac\u2019s obligations under the Letter Agreement, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Amfac presumably would have tendered it as such. However, Amfac did not tender TGH\u2019s ALTA mortgagee\u2019s title policy to WBIC in May 1985 as satisfactory performance of the second condition of the Letter Agreement. Furthermore, Amfac did not raise this \u201cperformance\u201d as a defense to WBIC\u2019s 1987 assertion that Amfac was still obligated under the agreements to secure the Group\u2019s joinder in the granting of the sewer easement. Finally, at the time the Letter Agreement was executed, both Amfac and WBIC were aware that TGH had committed itself to issuing the ALTA mortgagee\u2019s title policy. If \u201cfalse verification\u201d were what the parties had intended would satisfy the second condition, then WBIC would have had no reason to insist that Amfac reaffirm in the Letter Agreement all of its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we construe \u201cverification\u201d according to its plain, ordinary, and accepted usage in common speech. At the time Amfac tendered TGH\u2019s commitment to issue an ALTA owner\u2019s title policy, the uncontroverted fact was that there was no pre-existing sewer easement that could be \u201cverified.\u201d The record is undisputed that WBIC had attempted to persuade Azabu to accept from the Group an alternative to a sewer easement in favor of Lot 54 but that Azabu refused to do so. Accordingly, we conclude that no reasonable minds could agree that \u201cfalse verification\u201d would reasonably satisfy a party in WBIC\u2019s position that, as of April 1987, Lot 30-A was subject to a pre-existing sewer easement in favor of Lot 54. We hold that the circuit court did not err in ruling as a matter of law that Amfac\u2019s tendered \u201cperformance\u201d did not satisfy the second condition of the Letter Agreement and, therefore, that Amfac breached its obligation under the Indemnification Agreement when it refused to execute the Joinder Agreement with the Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>B. Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Pursuant to HRCP 59(e) (1990),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Amfac moved for reconsideration of the circuit court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment in WBIC\u2019s favor; we review the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion according to the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gossinger v. Association of Apartment Owners of the Regency Ala </em>Wai, 73 Haw. 412, 425, 835 P.2d 627, 634 (1992) (citations omitted). Generally, to constitute an abuse of discretion a court must have clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant. <em>State v. Akina, </em>73 Haw. 75, 78, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion. <em>See, e.g., Gossinger, </em>73 Haw. at 425-27, 835 P.2d at 634-35; <em>Briggs v. Hotel Corp. of the Pacific, Inc., </em>73 Haw. 276, 287 n.7, 831 P.2d 1335, 1342 n.7 (1992) (\u201c[A] motion for reconsideration is not the time to relitigate old matters.\u201d). The only new argument that Amfac advanced in support of its motion was that the court <em>\u201cshould take judicial notice that title to real property inclusive of easements is traditionally verified in this jurisdiction and others by means of </em>. . . <em>ALTA policies.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>argument could and should have been made by Amfac in support of its motion for summary judgment. <em>See Gossinger, </em>73 Haw. at 427, 835 P.2d at 635; <em>Cochran v. Pflueger Automobiles, Inc., </em>72 Haw. 460, 461 n.l, 821 P.2d 934, 935 n.l (1991). Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Amfac\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">C. Trial Court\u2019s Final Judgment 1. Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Amfac contends that the trial court\u2019s FOF Nos. 27,29, 30, 31, 32, and 35 are clearly erroneous. In substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>these FOFs found that Amfac, represented by Fujikawa, and WBIC, represented by Kaneshige and Chun, jointly participated in a meeting with Saunders prior to January 31, 1985. At this meeting, as a condition of the Group\u2019s execution of a sewer easement, Saunders required \u201ca lump sum payment equal to a proportionate share of the Group\u2019s leasehold rental obligation to WDC and Queens from 1980 to that time, together with an assumption of a like proportionate share of the Group\u2019s future leasehold obligations through the life of the Group\u2019s leasehold estate.\u201d (FOF No. 30.) Amfac argues that these FOFs are clearly erroneous because the trial testimony of Amfac\u2019s Tom, Hiatt, and Fujikawa, and the corroborating testimony of Saunders, substantially support the fact that no meeting took place among Amfac, WBIC, and Saunders before WBIC\u2019s January 31, 1985 purchase of the WBH. WBIC counters that the five FOFs were substantially supported by the testimony of WBIC\u2019s Kaneshige and Reynolds, as well as certain deposition testimony of Amfac\u2019s Fujikawa that he later disavowed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">A FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistake has been committed. <em>State v. Batson, </em>73 Haw. 236, 246, 831 P.2d 924, 930 (1992); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>69 Haw. 461, 469, 748 P.2d 365, 370 (1987); <em>Gadd v. Kelley, </em>66 Haw. 431, 442-43, 667 P.2d 251, 259 (1983). Where there is substantial evidence, which is credible evidence of sufficient quantity and probative value to justify a reasonable person in reaching conclusions that support the FOFs, the FOFs cannot be set aside. <em>MPM Hawaiian, Inc. v. Amigos, Inc., </em>63 Haw. 485, 486-87, 630 P.2d 1075,1077(1981). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201c \u2018[a]n appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nani Koolau Co. v. K &amp; M Construction, Inc., </em>5 Haw. App. 137, 140, 681 P.2d 580, 584 (1984) (quoting <em>Shannon v. Murphy, </em>49 Haw. 661, 667, 426 P.2d 816, 820 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">A review of the trial record reveals that the witnesses\u2019 , testimony is in conflict regarding whether the meeting in question was held prior to the closing of the sale of the WBH to WBIC. At trial, Amfac\u2019s Fujikawa, Tom, and Hiatt and the Group\u2019s Saunders testified that no such meeting took place; WBIC\u2019s Kaneshige and Reynolds testified that the meeting did in fact occur. The record reflects that the trial court based its FOFs on Kaneshige and Reynolds\u2019 trial testimony and Fujikawa\u2019s deposition testimony which, although disavowed at trial, was admissible for substantive purposes. <em>See </em>Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) 613(b) and 802.1 (1985). Apparently, the trial court found Fujikawa\u2019s deposition testimony more credible than his inconsistent trial testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Keller v. La Rissa, Inc., </em>60 Haw. 1, 3-4, 586 P.2d 1017, 1019 (1978), this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>It is apparent that conflicts between appellant\u2019s testimony at the trial and in her deposition, as well as the documentary evidence, cast doubt on her credibility. We have said repeatedly that it is the province of the trial judge to pass upon issues dependent on the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and that we will not pass on such issues. <em>Lee v. Wong, </em>57 Haw. 137, 143, 552 P.2d 635, 640 (1976); <em>Ed Klein, Inc. v. Hotel Kaimana, Inc., </em>51 Haw. 268, 457 P.2d 210 (1969). We accept the findings as binding upon us in this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Accepting the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that Fujikawa\u2019s deposition testimony was the more credible, we cannot say that Fujikawa\u2019s deposition testimony in conjunction with Kaneshige and Reynolds\u2019 trial testimony is not substantial evidence sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s FOFs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Likewise, we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Accordingly, FOF Nos. 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 35 are not clearly erroneous and we will not disturb them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>2. Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is freely reviewable for its correctness. <em>See, e.g., Nani Koolau Co., </em>5 Haw.

A COL that is supported by the trial court\u2019s FOFs and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 681 P.2d at 585 (citing <em>Friedrich v. Department of Transportation, </em>60 Haw. 32, 586 P.2d 1037 (1978)). However, a COL that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because \u201cthe court\u2019s conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case.\u201d <em>Coll v. McCarthy, </em>72 Haw. 20, 28, 804 P.2d 881, 886 (1991); <em>see Cho Mark Oriental Food, Ltd. v. K &amp; K International, </em>73 Haw. 509, 515, 836 P.2d 1057, 1061 (1992).

[5 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 744 (1962)]. This is a rule of practice based on considerations of efficiency, courtesy, and comity. <em>Wong v. City and County of Honolulu, </em>66 Haw. 389, 665 P.2d 157 (1983); <em>Gallas v.

However, the doctrine is inapplicable to this case because the circuit court\u2019s interlocutory order did not address the question whether the Indemnification Agreement was also a bilateral executory contract; neither did it address the question whether \u201creasonableness\u201d was the only applicable standard for measuring damages recoverable under an indemnity contract. Therefore, the trial court did not violate the law of the case doctrine and COL No. 19 is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">b. Notification or demand as prerequisite to right of recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Amfac argues that the trial court erred in COL No. 21 when it concluded that \u201cWBIC was not required to notify Amfac or demand that it perform its obligations under paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) of . . . [the Indemnification Agreement] as a prerequisite to its right to recover damages.\u201d We disagree. As correctly noted by the trial court in COL No. 20, \u201cno notice or demand for performance is required . . . [w]here a contracting party\u2019s executory obligation to perform is complete and unconditional under the terms of the contract, and where the obligor has the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>means to perform his obligation as the party to whom performance is due ....\u201d <em>See, e.g.,Ramesbotham v. Farmers Elevator Co., </em>428 N.W.2d 542 (S.D. 1988) (citing 17 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 356 (1964)); <em>Witherell v. Lasky, </em>145 N.Y.S.2d 624, 627 (1955); <em>Cole v. Findley Tool &amp; Die Co., </em>290 Mich. 199, 204, 287 N.W. 433, 435 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Our review of paragraph 2(a) of the Indemnification Agreement confirms that Amfac\u2019s obligation to \u201cobtain and file of record a sewer easement\u201d became absolute and unconditional when WBIC closed the sale of the WBH. Amfac\u2019s obligation was not altered by the Letter Agreement because that instrument merely provided that the indemnity provisions of the Indemnification Agreement would terminate upon Amfac\u2019s performance of either of two alternatives, i.e., the Group\u2019s grant of a sewer easement in favor of Lot 54 or verification by TGH that such an easement existed. Accordingly, COL No. 21 is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">c. Assumption of risk defense</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Amfac contends the trial court erred in COL No. 23 by concluding that \u201cAmfac assumed the risk of all the obligations undertaken by WBIC to the Group under [The Joinder Agreement].\u201d We agree with Amfac. The assumption of risk defense is generally applied to claims for relief sounding in tort. <em>See </em>Annotation, <em>Contributory Negligence or Assumption of Risk as Defense to Action for Personal Injury, Death, or Property Damage Resulting From Alleged Breach of Implied Warranty, 4 </em>A.L.R.3D 501, 502 (1965);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Annotation, <em>Distinction Between Assumption of Risk and Contributory Negligence, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>82 A.L.R.2D 1218, 1221 (1962). The assumption of risk doctrine has most frequently been applied, within the context of contractual relationships, in master-servant cases or other cases involving a contract for services or other consensual relationships, such as host and guest or carrier and passenger. <em>Id. </em>at 1222-23; <em>see also Haworth v. State, 60 </em>Haw. 557, 561, 592 P.2d 820, 823 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In the present case, because WBIC\u2019s claim for damages was premised solely on Amfac\u2019s breach of the Indemnification Agreement and not on any claim that Amfac had committed a tort against WBIC, the trial court erroneously applied the assumption of risk doctrine to dispose of Amfac\u2019s argument that WBIC had made payments to the Group \u201cvoluntarily\u201d and WBIC\u2019s counter-argument that Amfac had \u201cassumed the risk\u201d of WBIC\u2019s actions when Amfac breached the Indemnification Agreement. Whether Amfac should be liable to WBIC for the amounts that WBIC paid to the Group to secure its execution of the Joinder Agreement was properly adjudicated pursuant to the contract doctrine of foreseeability of damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, although we hold that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>erred in applying the assumption of risk defense to the present case, the error was harmless because it was irrelevant to the adjudication of Amfac\u2019s liability to WBIC arising out of Amfac\u2019s breach of the Indemnification Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">d. Damages awarded for initial lump sum payment</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Pursuant to COL Nos. 24 and 25, the trial court awarded WBIC the sum of $200,000.00, being the initial lump sum payment WBIC made to the Group on April 30, 1987 as partial consideration for the Group\u2019s execution of the Joinder Agreement, \u201cas damages by reason of Amfac\u2019s breach of the Indemnification Agreement.\u201d Amfac argues that these COLs are erroneous because the contemplation of the parties to the Indemnification Agreement was that the \u201ccosts\u201d referred to in paragraph 2(a) would be \u201cdetermined judicially\u201d on the basis of \u201cfair market value considerations;\u201d from this premise Amfac urges that WBIC\u2019s execution of the Joinder Agreement (obligating WBIC, <em>inter alia, </em>to pay the Group the sum of $200,000.00) was neither foreseeable nor contemplated by the parties at the time Amfac executed the Indemnification Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Amfac supports its argument on the basis of Tom\u2019s testimony that, as co-drafter of the Indemnification Agreement, he intended that the language \u201cany and all costs\u201d would be subject to fair market valuation. Amfac\u2019s position is misplaced, however, because parol evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>regarding the parties\u2019 intent as to the language used in a contract may be considered only when the contract language is ambiguous. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>MPM Hawaiian, Inc. v. World Square, </em>4 Haw. App. 341, 345-46, 666 P.2d 622, 625 (1983) (where the contract was unambiguous, the parol evidence rule was applicable and \u201c \u2018extrinsic evidence of the stirrounding facts and circumstances existing prior to, contemporaneously with and subsequent to [its] execution\u2019 \u201d could not be considered) (citing <em>Midkiff v. Castle &amp; Cooke, Inc., </em>45 Haw. 409, 422, 368 P.2d 887, 894 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In the present case, the trial court concluded in COL No. 9 that the Indemnification Agreement was unambiguous. On appeal, Amfac has not challenged this COL and therefore we treat it as binding on this court. <em>See </em>Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)(C) (1984); <em>cf. Leibert v. Finance Factors, Ltd., </em>71 Haw. 285, 288, 788 P.2d 833, 835 (1990). Because the Indemnification Agreement is unambiguous, the parol evidence rule precludes Tom\u2019s testimony as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cany and all costs\u201d in paragraph 2(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Nevertheless, COL Nos. 24 and 25 are clearly erroneous because, according <em>to </em>the trial court\u2019s own FOFs, <em>not </em>all of WBIC\u2019s $200,000.00 lump sum payment to the Group was foreseeable. In FOF No. 30, the trial court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">At the meeting [held prior to January 31, 1985] . . . , Saunders demanded, as a condition to the Group\u2019s execution of a sewer easement for the Sewer Line, a <em>lump sum payment equal to a proportionate share of the Group\u2019s leasehold rental obligations to WDC and Queens from 1980 to that time </em>.... Saunders determined the proportionate share by dividing the total square foot area of Lot 30-A into the total square foot area of Roadway Easement \u201cH\u201d on Lot 30-A. This proportionate figure was approximately 14%. ... Testimony of Melvin Kaneshige; Deposition testimony of George Fujikawa, read and disavowed at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">(Emphasis added.) Kaneshige testified that Saunders had \u201cwanted some money for... what he considered \u2018rent\u2019 for past use of the sewer easement.\u201d However, the record reflects that the entire lump sum payment of $200,000.00 comprised more than the Group\u2019s lease rent payments from 1980 to January 31, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"AHG\">Saunders testified that he derived a lump sum rent figure of $167,713.32 based on seventy-nine months of prior use of Lot 30-A multiplied by fourteen percent of the Group\u2019s monthly lease rents to Queen\u2019s under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>master lease and to WDC under the sublease.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The difference between the lump sum of $200,000.00 and the $167,713.32 rent amount represented the proportionate figure that Saunders estimated was due and owing for real property taxes. Fourteen percent of the Group\u2019s lease rent obligations from 1980 to January 31,1985 obviously does not include real property taxes and, therefore, by the express terms of FOF No. 30, the payment of monies for such taxes would not have been foreseeable, i.e., \u201cin the contemplation of the parties\u201d at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed. <em>See Jones v. Johnson, </em>41 Haw. 389, 394, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>41 Haw. 651 (1956); <em>Bow v. Nakamura, </em>6 Haw. App. 290, 293, 719 P.2d 1103, 1106 (1986). Accordingly, we hold that COL Nos. 24 and 25 are clearly erroneous and that WBIC is not entitled to recover from Amfac that portion of the $200,000.00 lump sum payment allocable to the Group\u2019s estimated real property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">e. Damages denied for future payments</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In COL Nos. 26 and 27, the trial court ruled that WBIC was not entitled to compensation for payments that it agreed to make to the Group, under the Joinder Agreement, as partial reimbursement for the Group\u2019s future lease rent and real property tax obligations because these payments were \u201cbeyond the contemplation or foreseeability of the parties when they negotiated the Indemnification Agreement.\u201d WBIC contends that the trial court erred by misapplying the doctrine of foreseeability, thereby depriving WBIC of the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>compensation to which it was entitled as a result of Amfac\u2019s breach of the Indemnification Agreement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u201cIt is now a well established principle in the law of damages that, when one sustains a loss by breach of a contract, he is entitled to have just compensation commensurate with his loss\u201d and \u201cthat damages awarded should be in such amount as will actually or as precisely as possible compensate the injured party.\u201d <em>Ferreira v. Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Ltd., </em>44 Haw. 567, 573-74, 356 P.2d 651, 655, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>44 Haw. 581, 357 P.2d 112 (1960). The <em>Ferreira </em>rule is limited by the doctrines of legal causation and foreseeability enunciated by the court in <em>Jones </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">The general rule is that in an action for damages for breach of contract only such damages can be recovered as are the natural and proximate consequence of its breach; that the damages recoverable must be incidental to the contract and be caused by its breach; as the cases express it, \u201csuch as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">41 Haw. at 393 (citation omitted) (quoted in <em>Bow, </em>6 Haw. App. at 293, 719 P.2d at 1106).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Kaneshige testified that at the first meeting between representatives of Amfac, WBIC, and the Group, held prior to January 31,1985, Saunders took the position that the Group required partial compensation both for past \u201crent\u201d allocable to the use of the sewer easement and for \u201cfuture rent for the sewer easement so long as he and . . . [the Group] had [a] leasehold position on the property.\u201d He testified that Saunders wanted to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>amount to be paid for the Group\u2019s consent to the sewer easement based \u201con the percentage of land area that was taken by the sewer easement and he did it on a two-dimensional basis;\u201d put differently, Saunders wanted to use the ratio of the square footage of Easement H to the total square footage of Lot 30-A multiplied by the Group\u2019s total rent obligation with respect to Lot 30-A to determine the consideration to be paid by WBIC for the sewer easement. Although the exact amount of the consideration to be paid by WBIC for the sewer easement was not specifically quantified at the meeting, the arithmetic computation could readily have been performed because the Group\u2019s rent obligations were expressly fixed by the master lease and sublease governing Lot 30-A. Indeed, Saunders performed this precise computation when he derived the fourteen percent payment figure reflected in the Joinder Agreement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed, both Amfac and WBIC were aware that the Group would require lump sum consideration from WBIC representing past use of the sewer easement, as well as future monthly payments for its use. Both parties were likewise aware of the formula by which the Group would compute these amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Although the trial court correctly concluded in COL No. 17 that \u201c[f]oreseeability does not require an actual recognition by the parties at the time of contracting of the details or specifics of the injury or the damages which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>thereafter followed,\u201d it nevertheless restricted WBIC\u2019s recovery to the lump sum payment for <em>past </em>use of the sewer easement (COL Nos. 24 and 25) and did not hold Amfac liable for <em>future </em>payments to the Group for the same use (COL Nos. 26 and 27). COL Nos. 24 and 25 are logically inconsistent with COL Nos. 26 and 27 because WBIC\u2019s obligations to compensate the Group for past <em>and </em>future use of the sewer easement were equally foreseeable and contemplated by the parties at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Amfac argues that, simply because it was aware of the Group\u2019s longstanding demand that the WBH owner obtain sewer easement rights, it does not follow that Amfac \u201ccontemplated\u201d the same requirement at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed. Amfac contends that \u201cmutual assent\u201d is required for such \u201ccontemplation\u201d and that \u201cmutual assent\u201d was lacking when it expressly rejected the Group\u2019s demands after the first meeting with Saunders. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">It is well established that a court will construe the plain and unambiguous language of a contract in determining whether particular damages were reasonably within the contemplation of the parties. <em>See </em>Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ment (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 351 cmt. a &amp; b (1981); A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 1010 (1964). Moreover, \u201c[d]amages . . . which might have been prevented if the parties had acted according to the scope of the agreement are direct, and should be awarded.\u201d <em>Mortimer v. Otto, </em>206 N.Y. 89,99 N.E. 189, 190 (1912) (cited in <em>Kenford Co. v. County of Erie, </em>73 N.Y.2d 312, 319, 537 N.E.2d 176, 179, 540 N.Y.S.2d 1, 4 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Had Amfac secured a sewer easement from the Group, as paragraph 2(a) of the Indemnification Agreement obligated Amfac to do, in 1985, WBIC would not have been faced with the potential inability to close the sale of the WBH to Azabu for failure to produce marketable title resulting from the lack of a recorded sewer easement. WBIC was left with little choice but to secure the sewer easement from the Group by way of the Joinder Agreement. Without the sewer easement, WBIC risked losing a profit of $13,000,000.00<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and subjecting itself to a potential lawsuit from Azabu for damages or specific performance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, by discharging its obligation under the Indemnification Agreement, Amfac could have rescued WBIC from having to incur the cost (which included fourteen percent of the Group\u2019s past and future rent obligations to Queens, as master lessor, and WDC, as sublessor) of the Joinder Agreement. Because WBIC\u2019s counterclaim sought to recover this cost from Amfac as damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>for Amfac\u2019s breach of its contractual obligation to \u201cobtain and file of record a sewer easement\u201d in favor of Lot 54, the trial court erred in not ordering Amfac to assume WBIC\u2019s obligation to make partial future payments of lease rent under the Joinder Agreement. It therefore follows, and we so hold, that both the portion of the $200,000.00 lump sum payment attributable to past lease rent payments and the future monthly payments of lease rent required by the Joinder Agreement were \u201cwithin the contemplation of the parties\u201d at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed, and WBIC is entitled to recover these amounts from Amfac.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">However, as we have discussed, \u201clease rent\u201d does not include \u201creal property taxes\u201d; therefore, WBIC\u2019s obligation to pay fourteen percent of the Group\u2019s future real property taxes, as required by the Joinder Agreement, was not \u201cwithin the contemplation of the parties\u201d at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed. Accordingly, we hold that Amfac is not liable to WBIC for any such future payments.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">f. Attorney\u2019s fees awarded for declaratory judgment action</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In COL No. 37, the trial court concluded in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">WBIC is . . . the prevailing party as to Amfac\u2019s Complaint for Declaratory Relief, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Complaint did not seek an imposition of monetary liability, but solely an adjudication of rights. Where a party prevails on a claim which did not seek an award of monetary damages, he is entitled under \u00a7 607-17, H.R.S. to an unlimited reasonable attorney\u2019s fees [sic] for services reasonably and necessarily incurred. <em>Smothers v. Renander, </em>[2 Haw. App. 400, 406-07, 633 P.2d 556, 562-63 (1981)]; <em>Food Pantry v. Waikiki Business Plaza, </em>58 Haw. 606, 618[-21, 575 P.2d 869,878-80] (1978). WBIC is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for the claims asserted in Amfac\u2019s Complaint of $42,455.35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Amfac contends that the trial court erred in COL No. 37 by concluding that attorney\u2019s fees awardable to WBIC, as the prevailing party on Amfac\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment, were unconstrained by the twenty-five percent limit set forth in HRS \u00a7 607-17 (1985). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AWd\">HRS \u00a7 607-17 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, where an action is instituted in the district or circuit court on a promissory note or other contract in writing which provides for an attorney\u2019s fee the following rates shall prevail and shall be awarded to the successful party, whether plaintiff or defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(1) Where the note or other contract in writing provides for a fee of twenty-five per cent or more, or provides for a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, not more than twenty-five per cent shall be allowed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>provided that the fee allowed in any of the above cases shall not exceed that which is deemed reasonable by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In <em>Food Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki Business Plaza, Inc., 58 </em>Haw. 606, 575 P.2d 869 (1978), this court recognized the inequity of enforcing the twenty-five percent statutory ceiling against the prevailing party on an award of nominal damages and held that, in cases where no monetary judgment has been sought, the prevailing party is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees \u201creasonably and necessarily incurred\u201d in the action. 58 Haw. at 621, 575 P.2d at 880. The rationale of the <em>Food Pantry </em>rule is that if no money damages are sought or awarded, as in a complaint for declaratory judgment, there is no monetary amount on the basis of which to calculate the twenty-five percent statutory ceiling for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\"><em>The Food Pantry </em>rule has been followed in subsequent appellate decisions. <em>See, e.g., Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 </em>Haw. App. 256, 270, 799 P.2d 60, 68 (1990) (declaratory judgment on question of lease violation); <em>Smothers v. Renander, </em>2 Haw. App. 400, 407, 633 P.2d 556, 563 (1981) (adjudication of contract rights where no money damages at issue). In its complaint, Amfac was not seeking a monetary judgment, but rather a declaration that it had performed its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement and, therefore, had not breached the agreement. The application of the <em>Food Pantry </em>rule entitles WBIC, as the prevailing party, to attorney\u2019s fees \u201creasonably and necessarily incurred\u201d in defending against Amfac\u2019s declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Nevertheless, Amfac contends that application of the <em>Food Pantry </em>rule to this case \u201cplacets] form over substance\u201d because \u201cthe attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>of Amfac\u2019s [cjomplaint. .. are the same as those incurred in establishing the right to indemnification under the [counterclaim.\u201d However, Amfac does not challenge FOF No. 82, in which the trial court found that WBIC had incurred $42,445.35 in attorney\u2019s fees specifically attributable to Amfac\u2019s declaratory judgment action and $83,351.33 specifically attributable to WBIC\u2019s counterclaim. Alleged error in findings of fact not expressly challenged on appeal will be disregarded in the absence of plain error. <em>See </em>Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 28(b)(4)(C). Moreover, Amfac does not support its contention that WBIC\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with the complaint and counterclaim are the same with any evidence whatsoever. Finally, we note that if Amfac had prevailed on its declaratory judgment action, it most likely would be arguing that the <em>Food Pantry </em>rule should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Thus, we hold that COL No. 37 was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the twenty-five percent limit on attorney\u2019s fees set forth in HRS \u00a7 607-17 was inapplicable to Amfac\u2019s declaratory judgment action and that, under the <em>Food Pantry </em>rule, WBIC was entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees \u201creasonably and necessarily incurred\u201d in defending against Amfac\u2019s action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">g. Attorney\u2019s fees awarded for counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In COL No. 36, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 607-17, the trial court awarded WBIC attorney\u2019s fees in the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of $50,000.00 (being twenty-five percent of $200,000.00) incurred in successfully prosecuting its counterclaim.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> WBIC contends that COL No. 36 is erroneous because the trial court failed to include prejudgment interest and the monthly partial payments paid by WBIC to the Group for \u201cfuture\u201d rent and real property taxes on Lot 54, as required by the Joinder Agreement, in the judgment amount upon which the attorney\u2019s fees were calculated. We agree in part. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying WBIC prejudgment interest as part of the judgment. <em>See </em>Section II. C. 2. h., <em>infra. </em>However, in accordance with our discussion and holding in Section II. C. 2. e. of this opinion, the trial court should have considered, in calculating WBIC\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, the monthly payments made pursuant to the Joinder Agreement reflecting fourteen percent of the Group\u2019s future lease rent obligations. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded WBIC $50,000.00 for attorney\u2019s fees without taking these monthly payments into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">h.

Colbert </em>68 Haw. 472, 477-78, 718 P.2d 1080, 1084 (1986) (\u201c[T]he legislative history shows [that] the purposes of the statute were to permit more equitable results and to more speedily resolve cases.\u201d) Because there is no evidence in the record that any of Amfac\u2019s conduct unduly delayed the proceedings in this case, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying WBIC prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">i. Denial of punitive damages</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In COL Nos. 29 and 31, the trial court denied WBIC\u2019s prayer for punitive damages, concluding that WBIC\u2019s claim was \u201cnot supported by the evidence\u201d and being unable to \u201cfind any intentional or deliberate action by Amfac which [would] warrant!] or justifly]\u201d such an award. WBIC contends that these COLs are erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>because \u201cthe manifest weight of evidence supports ... an award\u201d of punitive damages. Amfac counters that the trial court correctly denied WBIC\u2019s punitive damage claim because \u201cthere is an absence of clear and convincing evidence that Amfac breached the Indemnification Agreement maliciously or wantonly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Award or denial of punitive damages is within the sound discretion of the trier of fact. <em>See, e.g., Sterling v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., </em>647 F. Supp. 303, 323 (W.D. Tenn. 1986), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>855 F.2d 1188 (1988); <em>Haskins v. Shelden, </em>558 P.2d 487, 494 (Alaska 1976); <em>Newman v. Basin Motor Co., </em>98 N.M. 39, 644 P.2d 553, 558 (N.M. Ct. App. 1982); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 908 cmt. d (1979). The trier of fact\u2019s decision to grant or deny punitive damages will be reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Haskins, </em>558 P.2d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In <em>Masaki v. General Motors Corp., </em>71 Haw. 1, 16-17, 780 P.2d 566, 575 (1989), we established the requisite standard of proof in this jurisdiction to support an award of punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">[F]or . . . punitive damage claims we adopt the clear and convincing standard of proof. The plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has acted wantonly or oppressively or with such malice as implies a spirit of mischief or criminal indifference to civil obligations, or where there has been some wilful misconduct or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of a conscious indifference to consequences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">(Citation omitted.) Upon review of the record, we conclude that there is no clear and convincing evidence that Amfac <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>wantonly, oppressively, maliciously, or wilfully breached the Indemnification and Letter Agreements such as to warrant the imposition of punitive damages.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying WBIC\u2019s punitive damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We affirm the circuit court\u2019s orders granting partial summary judgment as to liability in favor of WBIC and denying Amfac\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We vacate the trial court\u2019s final judgment and remand for a determination of damages and attorney\u2019s fees consistent with this opinion. We order the trial court to enter an order, consistent with this opinion, directing Amfac to assume WBIC\u2019s obligation to make partial future payments of lease rent under the Joinder Agreement. Finally, with the exception of COL No. 23, which was harmless error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Am\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>On the briefs:</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AbT\"><em>Dale W.

WDC expressed the view that the new WBH sewer line had replaced its old sewer line for which it had easement rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\"> In oral argument on the cross-motions for summary judgment, both sides agreed that the question whether Amfac had or had not performed as required under the Indemnification and Letter Agreements \u201cboiled down to\u201d the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the Letter Agreement and, in particular, the second condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\"> Both parties alleged that the other side was responsible for drafting the language of the second condition of the Letter Agreement and therefore that any ambiguities in the language should be construed against the drafter. However, the fundamental principle that any ambiguities in a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who has drafted the language is applicable only where a contract is open to more than one reasonable construction. <em>See, e.g., Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Daniel, </em>150 Tex. 513, 243 S.W.2d 154, 157 (1951). When the contract has been negotiated between two parties of equal sophistication and equal bargaining power, the rule of interpreting ambiguities against the drafter has been held inapplicable. <em>See Falmouth National Bank v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 920 F.2d </em>1058, 1062 (1st Cir. 1990); <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>862 F.2d 796, 800 (10th Cir. 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\"> Amfac\u2019s memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment omits deposition testimony of Walter R. Kuwaye, the TGH senior vice-president who handled the subject transactions, that would have included his negative response to the following question: \u201cIs it normal practice for Title Guaranty to issue owner\u2019s title insurance policies with no exceptions based on indemnifications provided by the party requesting such policy?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\"> HRCP 59(e) provides that \u201c[a] motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> While title insurance may have become the accepted means of \u201cverification\u201d of title in many parts of the country, including this jurisdiction, the practice has only come about because title insurance companies usually will not issue a title policy if its examination of title indicates that the title is not marketable. <em>See Attorney\u2019s Guide To Title </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>Insurance, </em>at 2-8 to 2-9 (Ill. Inst, for CLE 1980). Marketable title has been defined as \u201c \u2018a title free from encumbrances and any reasonable doubt as to its validity, and such as a reasonably intelligent person,... well informed as to the facts and legal bearings, and ready and willing to perform his contract, would be willing to accept in the exercise of ordinary business prudence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kipahulu Investment Co. v. Seltzer Partnership, </em>4 Haw. App. 625, 628, 675 P.2d 778, 781 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>67 Haw. 685, 744 P.2d 781 (1984) (quoting <em>Clarke v. Title Guaranty Co., </em>44 Haw. 261, 269, 353 P.2d 1002, 1007 (1960)). In Hawaii, \u201c[tjitle insurance has become by far the accepted and preferred method of both satisfying the buyer\u2019s requirement regarding seller\u2019s marketable title and affording the buyer (and the lender) with broader assurance of any protections as to that marketability.\u201d <em>Hawaii Commercial Real Estate Manual, </em>Vol. 1, chap. 11, \u201cTitle Insurance,\u201d at 11-7 (HICLE 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">In this case, because no facts and circumstances existed under which a valid unregistered easement on Land Court-registered land could be implied, <em>see Henmi Apartments, Inc. v. Sawyer, </em>3 Haw. App. 555, 655 P.2d 881 (1982), the only means of securing a valid sewer easement for Lot 54 across Lot 30-A was Land Court recordation of such an easement grant. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 501-82 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1991); <em>see also Packaging Products Co. v. Teruya Brothers, Ltd., </em>58 Haw. 580, 585, 574 P.2d 524, 528 (1978); <em>Honolulu Memorial Park, Inc. v. City and County, </em>50 Haw. 189, 194, 436 P.2d 207, 210 (1967). Absent the Group\u2019s joinder in the \u201cGrant of Nonexclusive Easement,\u201d title to Lot 54 was unmarketable. The \u201cfalse policy\u201d that Amfac proffered to WBIC was not based on the marketability of title, but rather on Amfac\u2019s agreement to indemnify TGH.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> At trial, Fujikawa testified that no meeting with Saunders took place prior to January 31,1985. WBIC\u2019s trial counsel then impeached his testimony based on deposition testimony wherein Fujikawa stated unequivocally that meetings with Saunders took place both before and after the sale of the WBH to WBIC. Fujikawa\u2019s testimony concerning his understanding of the purpose of the Indemnification Agreement also meandered. At trial he testified that \u201c[m]y understanding was that if there were any claims or action taken by Mr. Saunder\u2019s group regarding the lack of an easement, that we w mid then be responsible for it;\u201d at his deposition he testified that his understanding of the purpose of the Indemnification Agreement was to insure that WBIC would incur no future costs with respect to dealings with Mr. Saunders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> We note that Kaneshige\u2019s trial testimony regarding his drafting of the Indemnification Agreement was entirely consistent with the provisions therein, specifically paragraph 2(b), which provided that no party except Amfac with an interest in the WBH would have a continuing obligation \u201cto pay any amounts, either lump sum or in installments,\u201d for the granting of the sewer easement. At trial, Kaneshige testified that he had included such language \u201c[b]ecause there may be \u2014 there may have been a negotiated amount either in lump sum or installments or both which AMFAC could subsequently negotiate with the Saunders group, but I wanted to make it clear in this subparagraph that whatever was negotiated was not to be paid by WBIC or any of the other parties because the owners really laid [sic - probably \u201crelied\u201d] on AMFAC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\"> Amfac also argues that COL No. 19 is erroneous because the standard for recovery of damages for a breach of contract is \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d However, it cites no authority for this proposition. The phrase \u201cfairly and reasonably\u201d is contained in the principles enunciated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>Hadley v. Baxendale, </em>9 Exch. 341 (1854), for awarding damages for a breach of contract. In <em>Jones v. Johnson, </em>41 Haw. 389, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>41 Haw. 651 (1956), this court articulated the rule of <em>Hadley v. Baxendale </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may <em>fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally; </em>i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, <em>or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the same time they made the contract as the probable result of the breach.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\"><em>Jones, </em>41 Haw. at 393-94 (emphasis added). However, our courts have never cited Jones as authority for the first branch of the rule employing the phrase \u201cfairly and reasonably,\u201d but only for the second branch of the rule that approves the awarding of contract damages that <em>arc foreseeable, </em>i.e., \u201csuch as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into.\u201d <em>See, e.g.,Bow v. Nakamura, </em>6 Haw. App. 290, 293, 719 P.2d 1103, 1106 (1986). In contrast, the general rule of contract damages set forth by the court in <em>Ferreira v.

However, such use of the term does not mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>that the defense of assumption of risk is applicable to pure contract claims. Courts employ the term \u201cassumption of risk\u201d in the context of allocating losses between contracting parties and not as an affirmative defense to be raised by breaching parties as a shield against liability. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 351 cmt. f (1981); A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 1010 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> Even if the phrase \u201cany and all costs\u201d could be considered ambiguous within the context of paragraph 2(a) of the Indemnification Agreement, the testimony of Kaneshige, who was the principal drafter of the instrument (FOF No. 36), would support a finding that the phrase meant exactly what it said. Kaneshige testified that by employing such language he \u201cwanted to make it clear that the obligations to obtain a sewer easement was that solely of AMFAC and that <em>any cost in connection with that grant would be borne by AMFAC not WBIC.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Kaneshige\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Fujikawa\u2019s deposition testimony, which he disavowed at trial, wherein he stated that his understanding of the intent of the Indemnification Agreement was to assure WBIC that it would incur no future cost with respect to any dealings with the Group. Tom, who reviewed the document with Kaneshige before it was finalized, testified that he made only handwritten changes to the document. None of the handwritten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>changes affected the phrase \u201cany and all costs,\u201d and Tom\u2019s testimony reveals that, if he indeed had any intent concerning what the phrase meant at the time he reviewed the Indemnification Agreement with Kaneshige, he never communicated his state of mind to Kaneshige.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\"> The seventy-nine months of prior use reflected the time Amfac started construction of the WBH sewer line until April 30,1987, which was Saunders\u2019 approximation of the Joinder Agreement\u2019s execution date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> Saunders testified, in response to the question \u201cHow did you arrive at the figure of 14 percent?,\u201d that he arrived at the percentage figure \u201c[b]y dividing the square footage of the area designated as Easement H\u201d and \u201c[i]t was 4468 square feet within Easement \u2018H\u2019, but still a part of Lot 30A and I divided that by the aggregate, square feet within Lot 30A of 31,776 square feet.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\"> The language of the Indemnification Agreement itself supports the conclusion that the Group\u2019s demands were within the contemplation of the parties at the time of execution.
