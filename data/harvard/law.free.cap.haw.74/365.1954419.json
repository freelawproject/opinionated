Kaapu (Kaapu) appeals the circuit court\u2019s decision and order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants-appellees Aloha Tower Development Corporation (ATDC) and Aloha Tower Associates (ATA). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">In 1981, the Hawaii legislature found that the Hawaii downtown waterfront area \u201cbounded by piers 8,9,10, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>11 and Nimitz Highway, including the Hale Awa Ku Moku Building and Irwin Memorial Park,\u201d which it labeled the \u201cAloha Tower complex\u201d (the complex), was \u201cone of the most valuable properties in downtown Honolulu and that certain portions of this area should be redeveloped, renovated, or improved to better serve the economic, maritime, and recreational needs of the people of Hawaii.\u201d HRS \u00a7 206J-1 (1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Accordingly, the legislature promulgated HRS ch. 206J, Act 236, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3,1981 Haw. Sess. Laws 448-59, for the purpose of establishing \u201ca new public body corporate and politic, public instrumentality, and agency of the State for the purpose of undertaking the redevelopment of the ... complex\u201d in order \u201cto strengthen the international economic base of the community in trade activities, to enhance the beautification of the waterfront,... to better serve modern maritime uses, and to provide for public access and use of the waterfront property.\u201d HRS \u00a7 206J-l (Supp. 1992). \u201cProperly developed,\u201d the legislature declared, \u201cthe... complex will further serve as a stimulant to the commercial activities of the downtown business community and help transform the waterfront into a \u2018people place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Thus was created the ATDC, which, \u201cfor administrative purposes,\u201d was placed within the State of Hawaii Department of Planning and Economic Development. HRS \u00a7 206J-4(a) (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ATDC was empowered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>inter alia, </em>to adopt rules pursuant to the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA), HRS ch. 91, in order to effectuate the goals of HRS ch. 206J, to prepare a development plan for the complex, and singly or \u201cin partnership with qualified persons\u201d to develop a project relating to the complex. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 206J-5(a)(5), 206J-5(a)(7), and 206J-5(a)(9) (1985 and Supp. 1992). The ATDC was further empowered to lease all or a portion of any developed project<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cto any qualified person\u201d pursuant to terms conforming with an adopted development plan for the complex and consistent with such \u201crequirements and conditions\u201d as the ATDC established \u201crelating to the terms of [the] lease and the qualifications of any person to draw or bid for the lease.\u201d HRS \u00a7 206J-11 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In accordance with HAPA and HRS \u00a7 206J-5(a), the ATDC proposed rules establishing itself as the sole authority for selecting the developer of the complex, fashioning a \u201crequest for proposal\u201d (RFP) procedure as the mode of selection, and insuring the confidentiality of the contents of all proposals pending execution of a long-term lease between the ATDC and the selected developer. On December 1,1988, the ATDC conducted a public hearing to receive testimony regarding the proposed rules. No testimony in opposition to the proposed rules was submitted. Kaapu did not attend the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On December 22,1988, the board of directors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the ATDC formally promulgated, as Chapter 15-26, Hawaii Administrative Rules (Department of Business and Economic Development), \u201cRules of Practice and Procedure\u201d to govern the functioning of the ATDC. Sections 15-26-1 through 15-26-50, Hawaii Administrative rules (Department of Business and Economic Development)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (ATDC Rules). The ATDC Rules became effective on February 9, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">ATDC Rule 15-26-1 provides that \u201c[t]his chapter governs procedures before the [ATDC] under [HRS ch. 206J] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>and shall be construed to effectuate the purpose of the chapter and to secure the just and efficient determination of every proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">ATDC Rule 15-26-41, relating to the ATDC\u2019s \u201c[ajuthority to select developers,\u201d provides in relevant part that \u201cthe [ATDC] has sole authority to select any qualified person to be a developer-lessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">ATDC Rule 15-26-42, relating to the \u201c[selection process,\u201d provides in relevant part that the ATDC \u201cmay select qualified persons to develop a development area pursuant to a process of direct negotiation, [an RFP], a competitive bidding process, or a combination of any or all of the above. The [ATDC] shall determine the method for pursuing its objectives . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">ATDC Rule 15-26-44, relating to RFPs, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">Should the [ATDC]... determine to select a developer for a project through [an RFP], the process shall encompass a publicly advertised [RFP], an evaluation of submitted proposals, selection of a qualified person based upon its submitted proposals, and finally, direct negotiation for a development agreement. The selection process shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">(5) The RFP shall require that any party interested in being a developer-lessee of the proposed development area shall submit a detailed proposal inclusive of, but not limited to, a description of the developer, its experience and its basic development team, architecturally prepared schematic drawings, proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>footprints of the buildings, preliminary traffic studies and solutions prepared by certified engineers and designers, feasibility studies, anticipated benefit to the State of Hawaii, and timetable for construction .... Each candidate must submit market studies or other satisfactory evidence to support the financial feasibility of its proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">(6) . . . [0]nly those parties submitting responses that meet the minimum submission requirements and qualifications as set forth in \u00a7 15-26-47 below shall be considered as the potential developer-lessee of the project as described in the RFP. <em>The contents of any proposals received shall be kept confidential and shall not be distributed in any case to other parties who are participating in the RFP process until after a long term lease and development agreement are executed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">(7) The [ATDC]... shall review all responses to the RFP and may require each party who has submitted a response to make a presentation of its proposal to the [ATDC].... <em>Because responders may be required to disseminate proprietary or other confidential information during such presentations, the presentations will be limited to members of the [ATDC] board [and] officers of the [ATDC] and their counsel [ ]; and the substance of such presentations shall be kept private and confidential until after a long term lease </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>and development agreement are executed. </em>The presentations shall be exclusively for purposes of fact-finding and investigation, and in no case shall the [ATDC] board make any decisions or deliberate toward any decision regarding selection of a developer or development proposal at presentation sessions. . . . Failure to enter into a long-term lease and development agreement within six months may disqualify the selected developer, and the [ATDC] board may select developers from the remaining proposals or repeat the RFP process from the first step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">(8) As soon as practicable following the final presentation, the [ATDC] . . . shall publicly announce the selection of the developer-lessee and shall then enter into negotiations for a development agreement for development of the project and for issuance of a long-term lease for the development area. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">ATDC Rule 15-26-47, relating to \u201c[djirect negotiations,\u201d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">Should the [ATDC] . . . determine to select a developer-lessee by direct negotiation, the [ATDC] board shall prepare or cause to be prepared a development plan for [the complex] which... accommodates the plans, specifications, designs or estimates of any project the [ATDC] board finds acceptable and advisable to carry out the intent of [HRS ch. 206J],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>On May 31, 1989, the ATDC issued an RFP that invited developers to submit proposals for the development of the complex. Four developers, including ATA, submitted proposals. Kaapu alleges in an affidavit attached to his memorandum in opposition to the ATDC\u2019s motion for summary judgment (the Kaapu affidavit) that, after it submitted its proposal, one of the developers \u2014 The Hawaiian Waterfront Connection Consortium \u2014 was expanded to embrace organizations and individuals, including Kaapu, who are representative of the indigenous Hawaiian community.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On December 21,1989, the ATDC conducted an open public meeting (the public meeting), in accordance with HRS \u00a7 92-3 (1985 and Supp. 1992),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the purpose of making the final selection of a developer with which to enter into negotiations for a long-term lease of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>complex. Pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 92-3 and 92-7 (1985),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the public was given timely notice of the public meeting and invited to offer testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Prior to the public meeting, various members of the news media requested copies of the four development proposals. Kaapu was not a party to the request. The ATDC board\u2019s legal counsel requested an opinion from the Office of Information Practices (OIP)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> regarding whether disclosure was required under the Hawaii Uniform Information Practices Act (Modified), HRS ch. 92F (Supp. 1992) (UIPA). The OIP responded that \u201c[t]he development proposals may remain confidential under the \u2018frustration exemption\u2019 in [HRS \u00a7 92F-13(3) (Supp. 1992)]<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> until the ATDC has completed its selection procedure and made a final choice of a developer for the ... complex.\u201d The ATDC board therefore declined to release the proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Kaapu did not testify at the public meeting. The Kaapu affidavit alleges that Kaapu and various members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>of the public objected to the ATDC Rules mandating the confidentiality of the development proposals and \u201casked\u201d the ATDC board to postpone the final selection of a developer for the complex until \u201cinformation about the various [proposals was released to the public.\u201d This objection and request apparently consisted of a \u201cmemorandum\u201d submitted to the ATDC by \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d at an unspecified time prior to the commencement of the meeting. The memorandum, which was signed by approximately seventeen individuals, exhorted the \u201cpowers that be to provide the basic information on all proposals to develop the Aloha Tower area----\u201d Kaapu\u2019s signature nowhere appeared on the \u201cmemorandum,\u201d although his name and a telephone number were typed on the upper right-hand corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The typed name on the \u201cmemorandum\u201d is the only indication in the record of any participation by Kaapu in the proceedings of the public meeting. Following public testimony and discussion, the ATDC board selected ATA as the developer with whom the ATDC would enter into negotiations for a development agreement and long-term lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The ATDC entered into a development agreement with ATA on June 19, 1990. It appears from the record that negotiations between the ATDC and ATA regarding the terms of a long-term lease are not yet completed. Accordingly, in the event the negotiations are ultimately fruitless, the ATDC could potentially select a different developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">On March 16, 1990, Kaapu filed an initial complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the ATDC. Specifically, Kaapu prayed for a construction of ATDC Rules 15-26-42 and 15-26-44(6) and (7) and an injunction against any action based on them taken by the ATDC. The complaint alleged that the ATDC\u2019s selection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of ATA\u2019s development proposal was illegal because the ATDC refused to disclose the four submitted development proposals before making its decision, in violation of HRS chs. 92 and 92F. The complaint thus claimed that: (1) the ATDC\u2019s \u201csecrecy\u201d precluded Kaapu from obtaining information necessary to give informed testimony at the public meeting; and (2) the ATDC\u2019s action denied Kaapu procedural due process by depriving him of an opportunity to be heard at the public meeting, to be aware of the matters pending, to make an informed choice whether to acquiesce or contest, and to assert his reasons for making a choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Kaapu filed a second amended complaint on March 12, 1991, which departed substantively from the original in two material respects. First, Kaapu alleged that ATDC Rule 15-26-42 allowed selection of a developer in a manner violative of the authority conferred by HRS \u00a7 206J-l 1. Second, Kaapu abandoned his claim that the ATDC\u2019s action raised any issues implicating procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In any event, Kaapu has sued from the beginning in his <em>individual </em>capacity only. He does not claim to represent any class, group, entity, or individual \u2014 including any developer \u2014 other than himself. Kaapu makes no claim that the ATDC Rules were illegally or unfairly applied to the prospective developers.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">On April 24,1991, the ATDC filed its motion for summary judgment, in which ATA joined on May 17,1991. On November 1,1991, the circuit court entered a decision and order granting summary judgment in favor of the ATDC and ATA, ruling as a matter of law that: (1) Kaapu lacked standing to assert his claim for relief; (2) the ATDC\u2019s selection of a developer pursuant to the ATDC Rules did not violate HRS \u00a7 206J-l 1 in its original form or as amended; and (3) the ATDC\u2019s nondisclosure of the development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>proposals pending finalization of a long-term lease, pursuant to ATDC Rule 15-26-44(6) and (7), was authorized by the \u201cfrustration exemption\u201d set forth in HRS \u00a7 92F \u2014 13(3). Kaapu\u2019s timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cWe review an award of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court.\u201d <em>Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., </em>74 Haw. 85, 104, 839 P.2d 10, 22 (1992) (citing <em>Gossinger v. Association of Apartment Owners of The Regency Ala Wai, </em>73 Haw. 412, 417, 835 P.2d 627, 630 (1992)). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 56(c) (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">A. Kaapu\u2019s Standing to Challenge the ATDC\u2019s Decision to Withhold Disclosure of Development Proposals</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Kaapu contends that the plain language of HRS \u00a7 92-12 (1985) of the Sunshine Law confers standing on him to challenge the validity of the confidentiality provisions of ATDC Rule 15-26-44 as a justification for the ATDC\u2019s nondisclosure of the development proposals at the public meeting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>HRS \u00a7 92-12 provides in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">(a) The attorney general and the prosecuting attorney shall enforce this part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">(c) <em>Any person </em>may commence a suit in the circuit court of the circuit in which a prohibited act occurs for the purpose of requiring compliance with or preventing violations of this part <em>[i.e., </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 92-1 through 92-13, relating to \u201cmeetings\u201d] or to determine the applicability of this part to discussions or decisions of the public body. The court may order payment of reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in a suit brought under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Literally construed, HRS \u00a7 92-12(c) authorizes \u201cany person\u201d to file a lawsuit in circuit court to seek enforcement of the \u201copen meetings\u201d provisions of HRS \u00a7 92-3. \u201cWhere the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and explicit, the courts are not at liberty to go outside of the language to search for a meaning which does not reasonably [accord with] the terms of the statute.\u201d <em>City and County of Honolulu v. Public Utilities Comm\u2019n, 53 </em>Haw. 431, 433-34, 495 P.2d 1180, 1182 (1972) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">In effect, HRS \u00a7 92-12 gives Kaapu standing to challenge the validity of the confidentiality provisions of ATDC Rule 15-26-44 as a \u201cprivate attorney general,\u201d inasmuch as he is a \u201c \u2018person[ ] upon whom [the legislature] has conferred the right to seek judicial review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>agency action.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends v. Anderson, </em>70 Haw. 276, 285, 768 P.2d 1293, 1300 (1989) (quoting <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 737-38, 92 S. Ct. 1361, 1367, 31 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1972) (emphasis deleted)). Ordinarily, statutes require \u201ceconomic injury\u201d rather than mere concern for the \u201cpublic interest\u201d as a predicate to standing to sue as a \u201cprivate attorney general.\u201d <em>See id. </em>But in the case of HRS \u00a7 92-12, \u201cany person\u201d is expressly authorized to initiate a lawsuit, upon the allegation that \u201ca prohibited act\u201d has occurred in violation of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 92-1 through 92-13, in order to enforce compliance with or determine the applicability of the Sunshine Law to the proceedings of \u201cboards\u201d such as the ATDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Noting Kaapu\u2019s lack of meaningful participation in the public meeting, the ATDC cites <em>Mahuiki v. Planning Commission, </em>65 Haw. 506, 654 P.2d 874 (1982), <em>Jordan v. Hornada, </em>62 Haw. 444, 616 P.2d 1368 (1980), and <em>Munoz v. Commissioner of Public Lands, </em>40 Haw. 675.(1955), for the proposition that \u201cHawaii law requires one who seeks judicial review of administrative action to show that one actually participated as an adversary in the proceeding involving the disputed decision\u201d in order to have standing to seek judicial review. All three cases, however, are inapposite to the question of standing under HRS \u00a7 92-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em>Mahuiki </em>and <em>Jordan </em>involved attempts by plaintiffs claiming to be \u201cpersons aggrieved... in a contested case\u201d to obtain judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s action under HRS \u00a7 91-14(a) (1985) of the HAPA;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in each instance, this court ruled that \u201cparticipation in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>hearing as an adversary\u201d was a <em>statutory </em>prerequisite to standing. <em>Mahuiki, 65 </em>Haw. at 514-15, <em>654 </em>P.2d at 879-80; <em>Jordan, </em>62 Haw. at 449,616 P.2d at 1372. In the present matter, however, Kaapu relies on HRS \u00a7 92-12, rather than HRS \u00a7 91-14(a), as the basis for standing to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\"><em>Munoz, </em>a pre-HAPA case, stands for the. principle that a party who directly and actively participates in a judicial or other public sale or auction of property and accepts the benefits of the sale by bidding is equitably estopped from \u201cimpugning the disposition of such property.\u201d 40 Haw. at 688-89. Standing to sue, rather than equitable estoppel, is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The feature distinguishing the standing requirement under HAPA from that underlying the Sunshine Law is succinctly set forth in <em>City and County of Honolulu v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>53 Haw. at 433, 495 P.2d at 1182 (emphasis in original). Just as HRS \u00a7 91-14(a) clearly and unambiguously requires that a person aggrieved by a decision and order have participated in the contested case that produced it, so HRS \u00a7 92-12 clearly and unambiguously entitles \u201cany person\u201d to \u201ccommence a suit in the circuit court of the circuit in which a prohibited act occurs,\u201d regardless of the person\u2019s participation in any proceeding. Such a construction of HRS \u00a7 92-12 is consistent with the legislature\u2019s \u201c[declaration of policy and intent,\u201d set forth in HRS \u00a7 92-1 (1985), \u201cthat the formation and conduct of public policy \u2014 the discussions, deliberations, decisions, and action of governmental agencies \u2014 shall be conducted as openly as possible\u201d in order \u201cto protect the people\u2019s right to know . . ..\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>HRS \u00a7 91-14(a), which provides \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case ... is entitled to judicial review ...\u201d, is clear and unambiguous that the person aggrieved must have been involved in the contested case----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdH\">HRS \u00a7 91-14(a) does not provide simply that \u201cany person aggrieved by a final decision and order is entitled to judicial review.\u201d If the legislature intended to give any person aggrieved by a final decision and order, <em>regardless of whether the person participated </em>in a contested case, the right to judicial review, the legislature would have so stated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Accordingly, we hold as a matter of law that the circuit court erred in ruling that Kaapu lacked standing to challenge the validity of the confidentiality provisions of ATDC Rule 15-26-44 as a justification for the ATDC\u2019s nondisclosure of the development proposals at the public meeting. However, we further hold that the error was harmless, inasmuch as it does not alter the ultimate disposition of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">B. Alleged Violation of HRS Chapter 92 (\u201cSunshine Law\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Kaapu contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that ATDC Rule 15-26-44(6) and (7) violates the \u201cmandate\u201d of HRS \u00a7 92-3 and that the circuit court therefore erred in ruling that the ATDC was legally entitled to maintain the confidentiality of the development proposals until after both a long-term lease and development agreement were executed by the ATDC and a successful developer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The \u201cmandate\u201d of HRS \u00a7 92-3 is that: (1) meetings of state \u201cboards\u201d be open to the public; (2) all persons be permitted to attend; and (3) interested persons be afforded an opportunity to <em>submit </em>written and oral testimony and information. In other words, HRS \u00a7 92-3 ensures public access to open meetings of state agencies and an opportunity to be heard. Neither HRS \u00a7 92-3 in particular nor the Sunshine Law, HRS ch. 92, in general addresses the public\u2019s interest in disclosure of or access to government records. That is the distinct, albeit related, subject matter of the UIPA, HRS ch. 92F.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And it is precisely the public\u2019s interest in disclosure of and access to government records that Kaapu alleges is inhibited by the confidentiality provisions of ATDC Rule 15-26-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">It therefore follows, and we so hold, that ATDC Rule 15-26-44 neither conflicts with nor contradicts the \u201cmandate\u201d of either HRS \u00a7 92-3 or the Sunshine Law as a whole, and Kaapu is not entitled to disclosure of the development proposals under those statutory provisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>C. Alleged Violation of HRS Chapter 92F (UIPA)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Inasmuch as the \u201cunderlying purposes and policies\u201d of the UIPA, HRS chapter 92F, include the promotion of the public interest in disclosure of and access to government records, HRS \u00a7 92F-2(1) and (3) (Supp. 1992),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we must address the allegation raised in Kaapu\u2019s second amended complaint that the ATDC violated the \u201cmandate\u201d of the UIPA when it relied on the confidentiality provisions of ATDC Rule 15-26-44(6) and (7) in declining to release the development proposals at the public meeting.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">As we have noted, the OIP advised the ATDC board prior to the public meeting that the development proposals could lawfully remain confidential under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cfrustration exemption\u201d set forth in HRS \u00a7 92F-13(3) until the ATDC completed its selection procedure and made a final choice of a developer for the complex. HRS \u00a7 92F-11 (Supp. 1992) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">(a) All government records are open to public inspection unless access is restricted or closed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">(b) Except as provided in section 92F-13, each agency upon request by any person shall make government records available for inspection and copying during regular business hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">HRS \u00a7 92F-13 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">Government records; exceptions to general rule. This chapter shall not require disclosure of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">(3) Government records that, by their nature, must be confidential in order for the government to avoid the <em>frustration of a legitimate government function[.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">The question therefore arises whether the development proposals are government records generally open to public inspection, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 92F-ll(a), on the one hand, or government records that, by their nature, must be kept confidential in order to avoid the frustration of a legitimate government function, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 92F-13(3) and ATDC Rule 15-26-44(6) and (7), on the other. To resolve this question, we turn to fundamental principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>This court has recently reiterated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law reviewable <em>de novo. </em>When construing a statute, our foremost obligation \u201cis to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature\u201d which \u201cis to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.\u201d <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980); <em>accord Gorospe v. Matsui, </em>72 Haw. 377, 379, 819 P.2d 80, 81 (1991). We must read statutory language in the context of the entire statute and construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. <em>In re Doe Children, </em>73 Haw. 15, 20, 827 P.2d 1144, 1146 (1992). \u201cWhen there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute an ambiguity exists.\u201d <em>State v. Sylva, </em>61 Haw. 385, 388, 605 P.2d 496, 498 (1980). If the statutory language is ambiguous or doubt exists as to its meaning, \u201c[c]ourts may take legislative history into consideration in construing a statute.\u201d <em>Life of the Land v. City and County of Honolulu, </em>61 Haw. 390, 447, 606 P.2d 866, 899 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\"><em>Franks v. City and County of Honolulu, </em>74 Haw. 328, 334-35, 843 P.2d 668, 671-72 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Because there is inherent uncertainty or doubt regarding whether HRS \u00a7 92F-ll(a) or HRS \u00a7 92F-13(3) governs the public\u2019s access to the development proposals, it is necessary to take into consideration the legislative history underlying the UIPA. The Senate Government Operations Committee of the 1988 Hawaii legislature declared the following pertinent legislative intent regarding the bill that was to become the UIPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The purpose of this bill is to repeal both the current law on public access to government records (Part V of Chapter 92, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)) and the current chapter limiting access in the interest of privacy, limiting inter-agency record sharing and providing for the correction of inaccurate entries (Chapter 92E, HRS). In their place, the bill proposes a detailed and comprehensive chapter, based on the <em>Uniform Information Practices Code </em>of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">4. A new [s]ection ... is added to create four categorical exceptions to the general rule [of public access]. Rather than list specific records in the statute, at the risk of being over- or under-inclusive, your Committee prefers to categorize and rely on the developing common law. The common law is ideally suited to the task of balancing competing interests] in the grey areas and unanticipated cases, under the guidance of the legislative policy. <em>To assist the Judiciary in understanding the legislative intent, the following examples are provided. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">(b) <em>Frustration of legitimate government function. </em>The following are <em>examples of records which need not be disclosed, if disclosure would frustrate a legitimate government function. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>(3) Information which, if disclosed, would raise the cost of government procurements or give a manifestly unfair advantage to any person proposing to enter into a contract or agreement with an agency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">(6) Proprietary information, such as research methods, records and data, computer programs and software and other types of information owned by an agency or entrusted to it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">(7) Trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2580, in 1988 Senate Journal, at 1093-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The submissions required of a proposed developer by an RFP, pursuant to ATDC Rule 15-26-44(5), clearly fall within one or more of the classes of information described in the legislative history set forth above. Public disclosure of development proposals \u2014 involving proprietary and other confidential information, such as trade secrets and confidential commercial and financial data \u2014 prior to final negotiation of a long-term lease could foreseeably give an unfair competitive advantage to other developers in the event negotiations were to break down. Concern over this risk could cause developers to offer up deliberately vague plans or decline to submit development proposals altogether. The likely result would be fewer submissions and an increase in the cost of government procurements.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">In light of the above, we believe that the only reasonable construction of development proposals submitted pursuant to ATDC Rule 15-26-44 that is consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the relevant legislative history of the UIPA is that they are government records that, by their nature, must be kept confidential in order to avoid the frustration of a legitimate government function within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 92F-13(3). We therefore hold that the UIPA, HRS chapter 92F, did not require the ATDC to disclose the development proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">D. Kaapu\u2019s Standing to Challenge the ATDC\u2019s Selection of ATA as Developer of the Complex</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Kaapu asserts that the ATDC illegally selected ATA as the entity with which it would negotiate the terms of a long-term development of the complex because: (1) the selection mechanism utilized by the ATDC (i.e., the RFP), in accordance with ATDC Rule 15-26-42, violated the \u201cdraw or bid for the lease\u201d requirement of HRS \u00a7 206J-11 in its pre-amended form;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (2) any effort to invoke retroactively the \u201capply for such lease\u201d provision of HRS \u00a7 206J-11, as amended, would constitute an illegal divesting of Kaapu\u2019s property rights. Inasmuch as we agree with the circuit court that Kaapu lacks standing as a matter of law to challenge the ATDC\u2019s selection of ATA as the developer of the complex, we need not reach either of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">HRS chapter 206J is devoid of the kind of \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d provision that is contained in HRS \u00a7 92-12. Accordingly, the standard rules governing standing to sue apply to Kaapu\u2019s HRS ch. 206J claim. In this regard, \u201cthe crucial inquiry ... is \u2018whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>controversy as to warrant his invocation of... [the court\u2019s] jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court\u2019s remedial powers on his behalf.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pele Defense Fund v. Paty, </em>73 Haw. 578, 592, 837 P.2d 1247, 1257 (1992), <em>cert, denied, </em>_U.S. _, 113 S. Ct. 1277 (1993) (quoting <em>Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends, </em>70 Haw. at 281, 768 P.2d at 1298 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Kaapu claims that he has standing to sue because \u201che has suffered a financial and cultural loss\u201d as a result of the ATDC\u2019s allegedly illegal action. Kaapu\u2019s opening brief at 9. Insofar as his claim of standing is based on an alleged \u201ccultural loss,\u201d Kaapu is purporting, at least to that extent, to be suing as a member of the public. <em>See id. </em>at 593, 837 P.2d at 1257. Yet, as we have noted, Kaapu has from the inception asserted his claims in his <em>individual </em>capacity only; neither his original nor his second amended complaint alleged that he represented any class, group, entity, or individual. Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>however, that Kaapu is suing in part in the public interest, we have held that \u201c\u2018a member of the public has standing to sue to enforce the rights of the public generally, if he can show that he has suffered an injury in fact, and that the concerns of a multiplicity of suits are satisfied by any means, including a class action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 837 P.2d at 1257-58 (quoting <em>Akau v. Olohana Corp., </em>65 Haw. 383, 388-89, 652 P.2d 1130, 1134 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">\u201cA plaintiff has suffered injury in fact when (1) he or she has suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s actions, and (3) a favorable decision would likely provide relief for the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 837 P.2d at 1258; <em>see also Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends, </em>70 Haw. at 283, 768 P.2d at 1299; <em>Akau, </em>65 Haw. at 389, 652 P.2d at 1134-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The Kaapu affidavit alleges that, for historical and genealogical reasons, the geographic area encompassing the complex is of cultural significance to Kaapu. The Kaapu affidavit also alleges that the ATDC\u2019s nondisclosure of the rival development proposals impaired his economic interests as an affiliate of one of the competing developers, The Hawaiian Waterfront Connection Consortium (the Consortium). Assuming that these allegations create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Kaapu has suffered \u201can actual or threatened injury,\u201d the record before us is devoid of both a causal connection between the alleged injury and the ATDC\u2019s use of the RFP procedure and any showing that the alleged injury is \u201clikely to be remedied by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d <em>See Hawaii\u2019s Thousand Friends, </em>70 Haw. at 283, 768 P.2d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Whether or not the ATDC utilized an RFP or competitive bidding system, Kaapu was accorded a full and fair opportunity to promote the merits of the Consortium\u2019s development proposal at the public meeting, an opportunity of which Kaapu declined to take advantage. Moreover, there has been no showing that a \u201cdraw or bid\u201d procedure would have protected Kaapu\u2019s interests at the public meeting to a greater extent than the RFP system actually utilized. Kaapu claims that the failure to release the development proposals denied him the right to give informed testimony at the public meeting. Yet a \u201cdraw or bid\u201d system would have had no more utility to Kaapu than the RFP procedure inasmuch as the consummation of a long-term lease was not the subject of the public meeting, the only business before the ATDC at that time being the selection of a developer with which to enter into a development agreement based on the merits of the various development proposals. In this connection, Kaapu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>does not dispute that he had full knowledge of the Consortium\u2019s proposal. Finally, even if the \u201clease application\u201d terms of HRS \u00a7 206J-11, as amended, cannot govern the ultimate negotiation of a long-term lease of the complex \u2014 an issue we need not reach in this appeal \u2014 the fact remains that no long-term lease has been executed, and there is no certainty that ATA will ever become the developer of the complex; thus, any purported challenge of a consummated long-term lease would not be ripe for adjudication at this time.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AG_\"><em>Jack F. Schweigert </em>(Schweigert &amp; Hossellman) for plaintiff-appellant Kekoa D. Kaapu.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVe\"><em>Rick J. Eichor (.Robert A.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Because neither the Sunshine Law nor the UIPA entitle Kaapu to disclosure of the development proposals prior to the execution of a long-term lease of the complex and because Kaapu lacks standing to challenge the selection of a developer, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision and order granting summary judgment in favor of the ATDC and ATA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\"> In 1988, the legislature limited the Aloha Tower complex to the waterfront area \u201cincluding the Hale Awa Ku Moku Building and Irwin Memorial Park.\u201d Act 356, \u00a7 1,1988 Haw.
