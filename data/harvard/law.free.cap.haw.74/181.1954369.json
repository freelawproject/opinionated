However, Sifagaloa also argues that the circuit court erroneously affirmed the Trustees\u2019 denial of his claim on the basis that there was no evidence of permanent incapacitation resulting from an accident occurring while performing his duties as a city truck driver. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a788-77(d) and 91-14 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree and conclude that the circuit court erred in affirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ing the Trustees\u2019 decision. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s order and remand for entry of judgment in Sifagaloa\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Sifagaloa was involved in a motor vehicle accident on December 7, 1981, while driving a truck within the scope of his employment with the City and County of Honolulu. On October 18, 1984, he filed a claim for service-connected total disability retirement benefits pursuant to HRS \u00a7 88-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">On June 29,1987, the Medical Board of the ERS submitted its decision to the Trustees on Sifagaloa\u2019s claim, finding that Sifagaloa was permanently incapacitated, due to psychological factors, both from further performance of his duties as a truck driver and from any other gainful employment. Nevertheless, the Medical Board recommended that Sifagaloa\u2019s claim be denied because it found that there was no causal connection between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>motor vehicle accident and Sifagaloa\u2019s current <em>physical </em>impairment and, therefore, Sifagaloa\u2019s disability was \u201cnon-service connected.\u201d The Trustees accepted the Medical Board\u2019s finding and recommendation and denied Sifagaloa\u2019s claim. Sifagaloa timely appealed the Medical Board\u2019s decision to the Trustees pursuant to HRS \u00a7 88-82 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On May 5 and 17,1988, the Trustees conducted hearings regarding Sifagaloa\u2019s appeal. Hearing officer Alfred Hee (Hee) heard testimony from Sifagaloa, several medical doctors, and a psychiatrist, Dr. Edward Furukawa, who was called as a witness by the Medical Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">On direct examination, Dr. Furukawa testified that Sifagaloa suffered from a psychiatrically recognized disorder styled \u201cPsychological Factors Affecting Physical Condition.\u201d During cross-examination, Dr. Furukawa opined that the December 7, 1981 accident was the cause of Sifagaloa\u2019s condition and that the condition was psychologically disabling. Dr. Furukawa also testified that Sifagaloa was not a malingerer. On redirect examination, Dr. Furukawa testified that he would not be surprised if Sifagaloa\u2019s psychological condition persisted even if the claim were ultimately resolved in Sifagaloa\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Despite Dr. Furukawa\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, Hee found that Sifagaloa had presented no psychiatric evidence establishing that his disability was caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>December 7, 1981 accident. Hee recommended that the Medical Board\u2019s report be affirmed. In its final decision, issued on December 10,1990, the Trustees affirmed Hee\u2019s recommendation in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">On appeal to the circuit court, Sifagaloa argued that his right to due process of law was violated because the Trustees were not impartial adjudicators and should not have been permitted to determine whether he should receive retirement benefits. Sifagaloa also contended that the Trustees erred when they determined that his disability was not service-connected. The circuit court determined that the Trustees\u2019 dual statutory functions of investing retirement funds and adjudicating disability retirement cases gave rise to no appearance of impropriety. Moreover, the circuit court found no objective evidence in the record from which a determination could be made that any of the Trustees should be disqualified. Finally, the circuit court ruled that the Trustees\u2019 decision to deny Sifagaloa total disability retirement was consistent with the evidence. Accordingly, the circuit court entered an order affirming the Trustees\u2019 denial of Sifagaloa\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">II. Sifagaloa\u2019s Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">On appeal to this court, Sifagaloa argues that he was denied his constitutional right to due process of law, as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution, because the Trustees have conflicting interests \u2014 awarding retirement benefits and preserving the financial integrity of the ERS fund. In effect, Sifagaloa urges that the Trustees\u2019 alleged conflict of interest gives rise to an appearance of impropriety on the basis of which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>accordingly, Sifagaloa concludes that the Trustees should have been disqualified from adjudicating his appeal of the Medical Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">This court has articulated the conceptual framework within which we begin our analysis of Sifagaloa\u2019s due process claim. In <em>Sussel v. City and County of Honolulu Civil Service Commission, </em>71 Haw. 101, 784 P.2d 867 (1989), we declared the following propositions to which we continue to subscribe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201c[T]here are certain fundamentals of just procedure which are the same for every type of tribunal and every type of proceeding.\u201d R. Pound, <em>Administrative Law </em>75 (1942). \u201cConcededly, a \u2018fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\u2019 <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136[, 75 S. Ct. 623, 625, 99 L. Ed. 942] (1955). This applies to administrative agencies which adjudicate as well as to courts. <em>Gibson v. Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 579[, 93 S. Ct. 1689,1698, 36 L.

Of course, \u201ca biased decisionmaker [is] constitutionally unacceptable[.]\u201d Id. at 47[, 95 S. Ct. at 1464]. But \u201cno one would argue seriously that the disqualification of [decision-makers] on grounds of actual bias ... prevents unfairness in all cases.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>70 Haw. 459, 467, 776 P.2d 1182, 1187 (1989). So \u201cour system of [justice] has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness.\u201d <em>In re Murchison, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">The Supreme Court teaches us too that justice can \u201cperform its high function in the best way [only if it satisfies] \u2018the appearance of justice.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Offutt v.

Ed. 817] (Frankfurter, J. concurring) (1951). And,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201c[t]here can be little question that use of a truly independent adjudicator is essential to attainment of this goal. Indeed, if there exists any reasonable doubt about the adjudicator\u2019s impartiality at the outset of a case, provision of the most elaborate procedural safeguards will not avail to create [an] appearance of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">M. Redish &amp; L. Marshall, <em>Adjudicatory Independence and the Values of Procedural Due Process, </em>95 Yale L.J. 455, 483-84 (1986)____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">Since the fundamentals of just procedure impose a requirement of impartiality on \u201cadministrative agencies which adjudicate as well as [on] courts[,]\u201d <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. at 46[, 95 S. Ct. at 1463], we see no reason why an administrative adjudicator should be allowed to sit with impunity in a case where the circumstances fairly give rise to an appearance of impropriety and reasonably cast suspicion on his impartiality. <em>State v. Brown, </em>70 Haw. at 467 n.3, 776 P.2d at 1188 n.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>71 Haw. at 107-109, 784 P.2d at 870-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On the other hand, we have long held that: (1) legislative enactments are \u201cpresumptively constitutional;\u201d (2) \u201ca party challenging [a statutory scheme] has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt;\u201d and (3) the constitutional defect must be \u201cclear, manifest and unmistakable.\u201d <em>Blair v. </em>Cayetano, 73 Haw. 536, 542, 836 P.2d 1066, 1069 (1992); <em>Schwab v.

McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1230 (1961); <em>Wolkenstein v. Reville, </em>694 F.2d 35, 41 (2d Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1105,103 S. Ct. 2452, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1332 (1983). \u201cWhether a particular decision-making procedure is constitutionally defective for want of impartiality will depend on many factors....\u201d <em>Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 41. These factors include: the character of the decision being made, <em>see Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 238, 247-49, 100 S. Ct. 1610, 1615-16, 64 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1980); <em>Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 41; the nature of the individual and governmental interests at stake, <em>see Hortonville Joint School District No. 1 v.

Ed. 2d 1 (1976); <em>Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 41; and the feasibility of alternative procedures. <em>Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 41. An appearance of impropriety does not occur simply where there is a joinder of executive and judicial power. <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 534, 47 S. Ct. 437, 445, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927) (cited with approval in <em>Sussel, </em>71 Haw. at 108, 784 P.2d at 870-71).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Administrators serving as adjudicators are presumed to be unbiased. <em>See, e.g., Schweiker v. McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 195, 102 S. Ct. 1665, 1670, 72 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982); <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S. Ct. 1456,1464, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 421, 61 S. Ct. 999, 1004, 85 L. Ed. 1429 (1941). \u201cThe presumption can be rebutted by a showing of disqualifying interest, either pecuniary, <em>see Gibson v. Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 578-79, 93 S. Ct. 1689,1697-98, 36 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1973), or institutional, <em>see Ward </em>[v. <em>Village of Monroeville, </em>409 U.S. 57, 93 S. Ct. 80, 34 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1972)], or both, <em>see Tumey, supra.\u201d Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 42. \u201cBut the burden of establishing a disqualifying interest rests on the party making the assertion.\u201d <em>Id. (citing Schweiker, </em>456 U.S. at 195, 102 S. Ct. at 1670).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Our review of the record persuades us that Sifagaloa has failed in the present case to establish a \u201cdisqualifying interest\u201d on the part of the Trustees. The Trustees have no \u201cdirect, personal, [or] pecuniary interest\u201d in their adjudications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 42; <em>cf. Tumey, </em>273 U.S. at 519, 47 S. Ct. at 440 (village mayor derived salary directly contingent upon defendants\u2019 convictions of violations of state\u2019s prohibition act in \u201cLiquor Court\u201d over which mayor presided and therefore had direct, personal, and pecuniary interest in outcome of such adjudications). Neither does the record show that the Trustees have any interest other than \u201crunning a successful operation----It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>cannot seriously be supposed that [they] would make unjustified determinations ... to ingratiate [themselves]\u201d with the ERS membership or the general public, the latter having no financial stake in the ERS and the potential award to Sifagaloa posing no conceivable threat to the former. <em>See Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 42-43. Thus, Sifagaloa has simply failed to demonstrate that the Trustees\u2019 situation is \u201cone which would offer a possible temptation to the average [person] as a judge.\u201d <em>Tumey, </em>273 U.S. at 532, 47 S. Ct. at 444; <em>Ward, </em>409 U.S. at 60, 93 S. Ct. at 83; <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct. 623, 625, 99 L. Ed. 942 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Put succinctly, \u201c[fjairly read, neither the facts ... nor the generalized assertions made here about [the Trustees\u2019] \u2018inconsistent\u2019 responsibilities prove an interest on [their] part in the outcome of the determinations made [on Sifagaloa\u2019s claim] sufficient... to overcome the \u2018presumption of honesty and integrity\u2019 that attaches by virtue of [their] office.\u201d <em>Wolkenstein, </em>694 F.2d at 42; <em>see Withrow, </em>421 U.S. at 47, 95 S. Ct. at 1461.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore hold that Sifagaloa has failed to overcome the presumption of lack of bias by showing a disqualifying interest on the Trustees\u2019 part. That being the case, we further hold that Sifagaloa has failed to meet his burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any constitutional defect in the adjudicatory mechanism created by HRS ch. 88 for determining members\u2019 ERS disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>III. Sifagaloa\u2019s Right to Service-Connected Total Disability ERS Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Sifagaloa\u2019s second contention is that the circuit court erred in affirming the Trustees\u2019 denial of full service-connected disability retirement benefits. We reiterate that an administrative agency\u2019s factual findings are presumptively correct and cannot be set aside on appeal unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the whole record. <em>Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. v. Department of Labor &amp; Indus. Relations, </em>70 Haw. 72, 81, 762 P.2d 796, 801 (1988); <em>Mahiai v. Suwa, </em>69 Haw. 349, 358, 742 P.2d 359, 367 (1987); <em>see also Dedman v. Board of Land &amp; Natural Resources, </em>69 Haw. 255, 266, 740 P.2d 28, 35 (1987), <em>cert denied, </em>485 U.S. 1020, 108 S. Ct. 1573, 99 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1988). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Investment Co., </em>74 Haw. 85, 116, 839 P.2d 10, 27-28 (1992) (citations omitted). The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review, however, is not applicable to an agency\u2019s conclusions of law, which are freely re viewable on appeal. <em>Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, </em>70 Haw. at 81, 762 P.2d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The uncontroverted reliable, probative, and substantial testimonial evidence in this case leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that the Trustees erred in finding that although Sifagaloa is totally incapacitated from gainful employment, \u201csuch incapacity is non work related.\u201d It therefore follows that the circuit court erred in affirming the Trustees\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">HRS \u00a7 88-77 does not distinguish between physical and psychological disabilities. To qualify for service-connected total disability retirement, the statute only requires that a member of the ERS be \u201cpermanently incapacitated as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring while in the performance\u201d of some employment \u2014 related duty. The Medical Board found that Sifagaloa was permanently and totally incapacitated from further gainful employment of any kind. Nevertheless, the Medical Board determined that there was no causal connection between the accident and the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Hee\u2019s report, which was accepted by the Trustees and the circuit court, stated that no evidence was \u201csubmitted\u201d by Sifagaloa to establish that Sifagaloa\u2019s psychological condition was caused by the trauma of the December 7, 1981 accident. Hee is simply wrong. Dr. Furukawa, the Medical Board\u2019s own psychiatric expert witness, expressly testified that Sifagaloa was suffering from a recognized disorder \u2014 \u201cPsychological Factors Affecting Physical Condition.\u201d He further opined that Sifagaloa was not a malingerer and that Sifagaloa\u2019s condition would persist even if a settlement were reached in the case. Most importantly, Dr. Furukawa unequivocally testified to the causal link between Sifagaloa\u2019s condition and the December 7, 1981 accident.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Furukawa\u2019s uncontroverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>testimony was the only psychiatric evidence \u201csubmitted\u201d by either party.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AY1\"><em>Stephen K.
