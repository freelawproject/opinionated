(children).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the respondent claims that the court improperly (1) shifted the burden of proof to her on the issue of her personal rehabilitation, (2) concluded that the department of children and families (department) had made reasonable efforts to reunify her with Jason and Fernando, and (3) found that she had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of rehabilitation. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our review. The respondent was bom in Hartford in 1989. The respondent\u2019s mother had a history of substance abuse, and the respondent was raised by her grandmother. The department\u2019s involvement with the respondent began when she was a teenager. At that time, the respondent had mental health and behavioral problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Femando and Jason were bom less than one year apart in 2006 and 2007, respectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 13, 2007, the petitioner filed with the court neglect petitions and motions seeking ex parte orders of temporary custody of the children. These motions were denied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>court. On January 25, 2008, believing that the children were in imminent risk of physical harm from their surroundings and that immediate removal from such surroundings was necessary to ensure their safety, pursuantto General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g, the department removed the children from the respondent, and they have been in the petitioner\u2019s custody since that date. On January 28, 2008, the petitioner again filed motions seeking ex parte orders of temporary custody of the children, and those motions were granted by the court. On February 1, 2008, the court sustained the orders of temporary custody. On April 8, 2008, the respondent entered a plea of nolo contendere to the neglect allegations concerning each of the children, the court adjudicated each child neglected pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (9) (B) and (C), and the court committed each child to the care, custody and guardianship of the commissioner pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j). The children were placed together in a preadoptive foster home, and the children\u2019s foster mother has expressed a willingness to allow the respondent to have a relationship with the children if she is able to adopt them. The children have strong bonds with both the respondent and their foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Both prior to and after the removal of the children from the respondent\u2019s custody, the department provided the respondent with services dealing with her mental health, substance abuse, parenting education and housing issues and needs. A series of department social workers worked with the respondent to reunite the family. Additionally, after the children were removed from her care and custody, the department provided visitation services to the respondent in a variety of venues with varying degrees of supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In addition to direct services, the department offered the respondent support and services from other agencies. From August 12 until December 30, 2008, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>respondent received individual counseling at Catholic Charities. The focus of the counseling was on stabilizing the respondent and \u201ccreating a home environment that would allow reunification.\u201d This service was discontinued because the respondent \u201ccontinued to show no consistent progress. She continued exhibiting signs of being extremely overwhelmed when faced with simple requests regarding working toward reunification. . . . She poorly demonstrates her ability to take initiative in making decisions for herself or for her family on her own. She expressed that she had a low tolerance level for stress and anger. She does show that she cares for her children; however, she seemed to lack the understanding of the importance of proving that she was able to maintain the family on her own without assistance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Catholic Charities recommended that the respondent \u201caddress her mental health issues and receive assistance obtaining medical insurance so she can be able to receive individual therapy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The respondent also was prescribed medication, but she often did not take it. She stated she did not need the medication or that she could not obtain it because of insurance problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In October, 2008, the respondent participated in a court-ordered evaluation by Logan L. Green, an expert in forensic and clinical psychology. Green reported that the respondent had achieved a wide range of scores on various performance criteria. The respondent\u2019s verbal IQ was 77, which ranked at the sixth percentile and is classified as \u201cborderline.\u201d The respondent\u2019s performance IQ was 103, which ranked at the fifty-eighth percentile and is classified as \u201cnormal fimctioning.\u201d Green concluded that \u201c[a] verbal-performance difference of this size is suggestive of learning disabilities, poor academic achievement, poor reading ability, and at times left hemisphere or diffuse brain damage.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Green also noted that the respondent\u2019s \u201cexceptional guardedness and extremely idealized self-presentation prevents interpretation of her capacity for bonding. Therefore, the extent to which she is capable of offering relatively consistent parental love could not be determined.\u201d Green diagnosed the respondent with anxiety disorder with compulsive defenses, dysthymic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Green recommended that the respondent be evaluated to determine whether she had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and that she receive psychological treatment with appropriate medication therapy, academic and vocational training, rehable support from family and practical training to plan and monitor solutions to everyday problems. Green also recommended a parenting education program called Parent/Child Interactive Therapy (parenting program) in which the respondent would be observed interacting with her children through a one-way mirror while being directed by the observer through the use of an earpiece. Green, however, was not sure if the parenting program would be an available option and stated that \u201cparenting training that allows for feedback immediately after the interaction session . . . would certainly be acceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Following Green\u2019s evaluation and report, the department recommended to the respondent that she attend the intensive outpatient program at the Rushford Center, where she began receiving services in February, 2009.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The respondent was discharged from this program in March, 2009, because of poor attendance. She returned to the Rushford Center in April, 2009, where she participated in the program. She completed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>program satisfactorily and was referred to the \u201cwomen seeking safety trauma group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The department then asked that the Rushford Center prepare another intake evaluation on May 14, 2009, because of the respondent\u2019s acknowledged use of marijuana. The respondent was tested for marijuana on twenty occasions between October 3, 2008, and December 15, 2009. Five of those test results were positive and fifteen were negative. The respondent acknowledged that she had begun using marijuana when she was twelve years old and that she continues to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The respondent also attended sessions at Family Matters, a center for child visitation and clinical parenting consultation, from April 9 to May 28, 2009. Family Matters provided supervised visitation with a parent education and feedback component. Family Matters also recommended that the department follow steps \u201cto assure a safe and positive transition for Jason and Fernando to [the respondent\u2019s] home\u201d and noted the respondent\u2019s \u201csignificant progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Approximately sixteen months after the children were placed in the custody of the petitioner, on June 8, 2009, the petitioner filed petitions to terminate the parental rights of the respondent and the father as to Fernando and Jason. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j), the petitioner alleged that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify each of the children with the respondent, termination was in the best interest of each of the children and, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B), the children previously were adjudicated neglected in a prior proceeding and that the respondent had failed to achieve a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that, within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of each of the children, the respondent could assume a responsible position in their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>After the petitioner filed the termination of parental rights petitions, the department continued to provide services to the respondent. From August 7 to November 7, 2009, the respondent received services at Community Residences, Inc., a family reunification and preservation program supported by the department. Community Residences, Inc., provided the respondent with supervised visitation, parent education and feedback. Community Residences, Inc., continued to work with the respondent through February, 2010. Its final evaluation and recommendation described the respondent\u2019s \u201cmoderate improvements\u201d in utilizing parenting techniques. The respondent indicated that she felt \u201cbadly about providing consequences for inappropriate behaviors\u201d by her children because she believed the purpose of the visits was to \u201cprovide a fun and enjoyable experience for her children.\u201d The respondent believed that the children displayed inappropriate behavior because her authority was undermined by the presence of the social worker giving her directions. The social worker transitioned visits from the community to the department offices when the children\u2019s behavior became \u201cunsafe or unmanageable . . . .\u201d Community Residences, Inc., found that the children\u2019s behavior was easier to manage in a controlled environment and that it was significantly more appropriate while in the care of the foster mother. Community Residences, Inc., also noted that the respondent \u201cclearly loves her children and appropriately shows them affection during visits</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The record also reveals the following. On some occasions, the respondent chose not to participate in programs to which she was referred by the department. For individual counseling, the department referred the respondent to Community Health Center and to Path, but she did not follow up with the referrals. The respondent eventually attended Community Health Center for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>mental health treatment, but missed her initial intake appointment in July, 2009, and did not complete the intake until August, 2009. The respondent missed several of her scheduled sessions at Community Health Center. The department also referred the respondent to domestic violence programs. She was referred to Chrysalis for a support group that she never attended and to Catholic Charities for a support group that she attended briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The respondent\u2019s housing situation varied throughout the progress of this case. In January, 2008, the respondent was being evicted from her apartment. The department located a shelter for the respondent and her children, but, after a couple of days, the respondent refused to stay there with the children. Following the children\u2019s removal from her on January 28, 2008, the respondent became transient and stayed with friends. The department thereafter referred the respondent to the Supportive Housing Program. During the summer of 2008, the department paid a security deposit so the respondent could obtain an apartment. The respondent was unable to maintain this apartment and was evicted in January, 2009, for nonpayment of rent. The respondent then secured a one bedroom apartment through supportive housing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The hearing on the termination of parental rights petitions took place on March 8 and 10, 2010, approximately twenty-five months after the children were removed from the respondent and placed in foster care. On July 8, 2010, the court, <em>Baldwin, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision granting the petitions. The court found that the department \u201chas made reasonable efforts to reunite [the respondent and the children], including engagement of rehabilitation services that enhanced [the respondent]\u2019s caregiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>skills.\u201d The court stated that \u201c[a]s of the date of trial [the respondent] had not made significant progress to persuade the court by clear and convincing evidence that she had met the objectives identified by Dr. Green as important for reunification.\u201d The court found that \u201c[t]he record and exhibits also establish that [the respondent] continued to use marijuana through 2009 and into 2010. That fact continues to generate concern that [the respondent]\u2019s cognitive deficits and continued self-medication raise serious doubts about her ability to care for her two boys.\u201d However, the respondent \u201cworked to be reunited with her two boys beginning the day that [the department] invoked the ninety-six hour hold. Her relationship with [the department] has been clumsy at times, and she has resented having to meet the requirements of the reunification plan. But she actively participated in most of the required services in a constructive way. She cooperated with her psychological evaluation and testing, she acknowledged her weaknesses, and she has demonstrated that she is willing to continue to work with [the department] toward reunification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In the dispositional finding required pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (l),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court stated that the respondent did \u201cnot [establish] to the court\u2019s satisfaction that she is prepared educationally or emotionally to assume the primary care role of caring for [the children].\u201d In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>dispositional finding required pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (3); see footnote 6 of this opinion; the court found that the respondent \u201chas not fully complied with substance abuse orders of the court. Her compliance with some court orders has been difficult for her because she is cognitively compromised. She has been faithful to her visitation opportunities and has been reasonably compliant with services offered to her. However, she has not always been able to sustain her commitment to services that challenge her cognitive abilities.\u201d In the dispositional finding required pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (7); see footnote 6 of this opinion; the court further stated that the respondent has \u201ctaken full advantage of every opportunity to build and sustain a relationship with her children and has been successful in that effort. [The respondent] and [the children] would be well served by continuing contact with each other after the permanency decisions have been implemented.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On August 16, 2010, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 lili, 34a-l (b) and 63-1, the respondent filed a motion for reconsideration, reargument and/or articulation, arguing, inter alia, that the court\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018[the respondent] had not made significant progress to persuade the court by clear and convincing evidence that she had met the objectives identified by Dr. Green as important for reunification\u2019 \u201d indicates that the court improperly shifted the burden of proof on the issue of personal rehabilitation to the respondent. After oral argument on September 3, 2010, the court, on September 24, 2010, issued a written decision that denied the relief sought on reargument and reconsideration. In the decision, the court agreed with the respondent that some of the language of the memorandum of decision \u201csuggested] a shifting of the burden of proof to [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>respondent].\u201d The court stated, however, that its \u201cintention was to conclude that [the respondent] had an obligation to meet the requirements of her specific steps in order to be reunited with her two sons. Those steps included the following requirements: 1. Submit to substance abuse assessment and follow recommendations regarding treatment, including in-patient treatment if necessary, aftercare and relapse prevention; 2. Submit to random drug testing\u2014time and method of the testing shall be at the discretion of [the department]; 3. Cooperate with recommended service providers . . . substance abuse assessment/treatment; 4. Cooperate with recommended court-ordered evaluations or testing; and 5. Not engage in substance abuse. The record demonstrates her repeated resistance to full cooperation with offered [department] services to a successful conclusion. The court concluded that [the department] had proved by clear and convincing evidence that, over the period of commitment, [the respondent] had not addressed successfully her mental health issues, her substance abuse issues, her housing needs, and her ability to set limits on [the] children\u2019s behavior.\u201d This appeal was filed on October 12, 2010.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The respondent claims that the trial court erred by improperly shifting the burden of proof to her on the issue of personal rehabilitation. She further argues that, in its subsequent articulations, the court improperly departed from the reasoning contained in the memorandum of decision and that the articulations and the memorandum of decision were in contradiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\u201cWhen a party contests the burden of proof applied by the trial court, the standard of review is de novo because the matter is a question of law.\u201d <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>D'Addario, </em>268 Conn. 441, 455, 844 A.2d 836 (2004). The respondent contends that the court\u2019s separate statements that \u201c[the respondent] had not made significant progress to persuade the court by clear and convincing evidence that she had met the objectives identified by Dr. Green as important for reunification\u201d and that \u201c[the respondent] has not established to the court\u2019s satisfaction that she is prepared educationally or emotionally to assume the primary role of caring for her children\u201d indicate that the court improperly shifted the burden of proof to her on the issue of personal rehabilitation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">First, we note that, even when taken in isolation from the rest of the memorandum of decision, the statement that the respondent \u201chad not made significant progress to persuade the court by clear and convincing evidence that she had met the objectives identified by Dr. Green as important for reunification\u201d does not imply necessarily that the court shifted the burden of proof on the issue of personal rehabilitation to the respondent, or that she had to produce evidence in addition to that already in the record. Instead, the court expressed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>finding that the evidence presented by the petitioner and already in the record demonstrated that the respondent had made progress, and that she should be proud of that progress, but that the court could not find by clear and convincing evidence that she had met the objectives identified by Green as important for her reunification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The petitioner had proven that the respondent had not met those goals, although the evidence also indicated that the respondent had made some progress, but not sufficient progress to rehabilitate to the point where reunification was possible. Even if the court may have used unclear phraseology, we are not persuaded that the language employed evinces an improper shifting of the burden of proof to the respondent on the adjudicatory ground of personal rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Furthermore, reviewing the court\u2019s decision in its entirety, it is evident that the court required the petitioner to prove her case by the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. On the first page of the memorandum of decision, the court states that \u201c[i]n order to prevail on its allegations with respect to termination of [a] parent\u2019s rights, the attorney general must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>prove by clear and convincing evidence that . . . [the respondent has] failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the children, such [parent] could assume a responsible position in the life of the children . . . .\u201d The court then enumerates the services that the department offered to the respondent, the respondent\u2019s efforts to comply with the services, the respondent\u2019s deficiencies in compliance and the respondent\u2019s consequent lack of progress toward rehabilitation. The court then states that \u201c[w]ith respect to [the respondent] the court finds that [the petitioner] has proved by clear and convincing evidence that [the] [c]hildren have been found to have been neglected in a prior proceeding and [that the respondent] has failed to achieve such [a] degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time . . . she could assume a responsible position in [the] children\u2019s lives.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B). This language evinces the court\u2019s recognition that the burden of proof was on the petitioner, that it required the petitioner to meet that burden, and that the petitioner did meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Our conclusion is further guided by our decision in <em>State v. Sherbacow, </em>21 Conn. App. 474, 480-82, 574 A.2d 817, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 808, 580 A.2d 65 (1990). In <em>Sherbacow, </em>the defendant on appeal claimed that the trial court had \u201cdiluted the state\u2019s burden to prove each essential element beyond a reasonable doubt, and placed a burden on the defendant to prove some fact, hypothesis or theory consistent with innocence.\u201d Id., 481. As in the present case, the defendant in <em>Sherbacow </em>relied on \u201ctwo portions of the court\u2019s decision, the first that the court was \u2018unable reasonably to draw from that evidence any conclusion or hypothesis consistent with the innocence of this accused,\u2019 and the second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>court\u2019s reliance on <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State, </em>666 S.W.2d 130 (Tex. 1983), for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s unexplained presence at a crime scene can be used to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sherbacow, </em>supra, 481-82. This court, in reviewing the statements in the context of the entire decision, concluded that the court had (1) applied the proper burden of proof, noting that the court \u201cproperly stated the law in that portion of the transcript immediately preceding the court\u2019s statement to which the defendant excepts\u201d; id., 481; and (2) \u201cneither intended to shift, nor did it shift, the burden to the defendant, thereby requiring him to testify.\u201d Id., 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In a similar fashion, we have analyzed the memorandum of decision at issue in the present case in its entirety and conclude that the court did not shift the burden of proof onto the respondent with respect to the adjudicatory ground of failure to rehabilitate or the dispositional ground of best interests of the children.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court, quite clearly, on at least two occasions stated that the petitioner bore the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence on both grounds. The court\u2019s repeated references to the proper standard of proof demonstrates that the court was aware that the petitioner had the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent had failed to rehabilitate and that termination was in the best interests of the children. See <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Goff, </em>107 Conn. App. 552, 559-60, 945 A.2d 1017, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 920, 958 A.2d 154 (2008); <em>State v. Sherbacow, </em>supra, 21 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>App. 480-82. It seems apparent, when taken in context, that the challenged statements were intended to highlight the respondent\u2019s insufficient progress in addressing the issues that had led to the children\u2019s commitment, including the respondent\u2019s failure to fulfill all of the recommendations of Green and all of the requirements of the court-ordered specific steps. The petitioner had introduced significant evidence of the respondent\u2019s ongoing mental health issues, cognitive limitations, parenting deficiencies and substance abuse problems, inter alia, and the court commented that the evidence demonstrated that, although the respondent had made some progress in her efforts to achieve reunification with the children, the petitioner had met her burden to establish all of the relevant elements of \u00a7 17a-112 (j)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Because she recognized that the statements she challenged arguably might be susceptible to differing interpretations, the respondent requested that the court, inter alia, articulate the meaning of the language employed. \u201cIt is well established that a motion for articulation may be used to clarify the factual or legal basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Walshon v. Walshon, </em>42 Conn. App. 651, 656, 681 A.2d 376 (1996). \u201c[A]n articulation presupposes ambiguity or incompleteness in the legal reasoning of the trial court in reaching its decision. An articulation may be necessary where the trial court fails completely to state any basis for its decision ... or where the basis, although stated, is unclear.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 434, 513 A.2d 620 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In response to the respondent\u2019s request, the court, inter alia, agreed with the respondent that some of the language of the memorandum of decision \u201csuggested] a shifting of the burden of proof to [the respondent].\u201d The court stated, however, that its \u201cintention was to conclude that [the respondent] had an obligation to meet the requirements of her specific steps in order to be reunited with her two sons . . . [and that] [t]he record demonstrates her repeated resistance to full cooperation with offered [department] services to a successful conclusion. The court concluded that [the department] had proved by clear and convincing evidence that, over the period of commitment, [the respondent] had not addressed successfully her mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>issues, her substance abuse issues, her housing needs, and her ability to set limits on [the] children\u2019s behavior. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">After filing the present appeal, the respondent again asked the court to articulate whether it improperly had shifted the burden of proof to her. In response, the court again articulated that the language it had used \u201csuggests] the alleged shift of burden.\u201d It explained, however, that \u201cthe decision read in its entirety clearly articulates . . . the court\u2019s conclusion that [the department] provided [the respondent] with the opportunity and services necessary to address the issues upon which the original commitment was based, and [that the respondent] failed to take full advantage of those services or rehabilitate to a degree that reunification was appropriate. The court\u2019s decision, taken as a whole, finds that [the department] made reasonable efforts to reunite [the respondent] and the children and that termination of her parental rights was in [the] children\u2019s best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Although the respondent argues that the court\u2019s articulations were an improper revision of its memorandum of decision, we do not agree. As stated previously, read as a whole, the court\u2019s memorandum of decision clearly sets forth that the petitioner has the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence to prove the adjudicatory ground of the respondent\u2019s failure to rehabilitate and the dispositional ground that termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the child, and that the petitioner met those requirements. The articulations served to further clarify that the court had employed the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">In <em>Walshon </em>v. <em>Walshon, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 655-56, the defendant had claimed that the trial court improperly had applied the wrong standard and that it had attempted to substitute a new decision by means of its articulation. This court disagreed. Id., 656. First, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>court concluded that although the certain portions of the \u201cdecision . . . standing alone, could be interpreted as indicating that the trial court applied the wrong standard,\u201d reviewing the decision as a whole, we further concluded that \u201cthe trial court consistently expressed its underlying finding, namely, that it could not find a material change of circumstances . . . .\u201d Id., 655. We then looked at the articulation, which clearly stated the correct legal standard, and concluded that the court had not improperly substituted a new decision but, rather, had properly had clarified its original decision. Id., 656. Although the present case concerns a burden of proof rather than a standard of proof, we conclude that the method employed in <em>Walshon, </em>namely, reviewing the decision as a whole and the articulation in light thereof, is proper. In following this method, it is clear in the present case that the court required the petitioner to meet her burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The respondent also argues that the court\u2019s articulations conflict with its memorandum of decision in which it stated that the respondent \u201chas made significant efforts to comply with her court-ordered specific steps.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, she alleges conflict between that statement and the portions of the court\u2019s articulations in which it found that \u201c[t]he record demonstrates her repeated resistance to full cooperation with offered [department] services to a successful conclusion,\u201d that \u201c[the department] provided [the respondent] with the opportunity and services necessary to address the issues upon which the original commitment was based, and [that the respondent] failed to take full advantage of those services or rehabilitate to a degree that reunification was appropriate.\u201d The respondent alleges that this conflict demonstrates that the court impermissibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>substituted a new decision or changed the reasoning or basis of its original decision. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The allegedly contradictory statements in the memorandum of decision were intended to credit the respondent for showing some progress with rehabilitation efforts. However, the respondent was unable \u201cto sustain her commitment and create a welcome and secure permanent environment\u201d for the children.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In recognition of the respondent\u2019s positive but limited efforts, the court concluded that the respondent and the children \u201cwould be well served by continuing contact with each other after the permanency decisions have been implemented.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court thus recognized that the respondent made some progress with respect to her rehabilitation efforts, but such progress did not encourage the belief that she could assume responsibility for the children\u2019s care on a full-time basis.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In its articulations, the trial court, however, did not attempt to substitute a new decision nor change the reason or basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the July 8, 2010 memorandum of decision. There was nothing in the articulations that contradicted the substance of the court\u2019s decision that, although the respondent had made some progress in her rehabilitation efforts, the petitioner had demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that she had failed to rehabilitate. Accordingly, we reject the respondent\u2019s claims that the court improperly shifted the burden of proof to her to disprove that she had failed to rehabilitate and that it was in the best interest of the children for her parental rights to be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The respondent also claims that the court erred in concluding that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent and her children. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">\u201cIn order to terminate parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112 (j), the department is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it has made reasonable efforts ... to reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds . . . that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification .... [Section 17a-112] imposes on the department the duty, inter alia, to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child or children with the parents. The word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department\u2019s efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>convincing standard of proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible. . . . The trial court\u2019s determination of this issue will not be overturned on appeal unless, in light of all of the evidence in the record, it is clearly erroneous. . . . A finding is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Devon W., </em>124 Conn. App. 631, 642, 6 A.3d 100 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the court found that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite the respondent with her children. The record supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the respondent \u201cwas offered and [the department] provided services dealing with mental health, substance abuse, parenting and housing [issues].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The respondent argues that the department\u2019s efforts fell short of what was reasonable because the department did not provide her with the type of parenting program recommended by Green in his October, 2008 evaluation. Green recommended that the respondent participate in a program where an observer would take notes during the visit and review the appropriateness of her conduct and provide her with suggestions for the next visit. Green recommended a parenting program from a specific provider, in which the respondent would be observed interacting with her children through a one-way mirror while being directed by the observer through the use of an earpiece, but he also suggested that any \u201cparenting training that allows for feedback immediately after the interaction session . . . would certainly be acceptable.\u201d Green testified at trial that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u201chaving an observer who simply observed and then gave feedback at the end, allowing [the respondent] to take written notes and then going over those notes, allowing [the respondent] to do homework, essentially, by following or reviewing the notes; that would be all right.\u201d The department contacted the recommended parenting program provider and learned that the agency had a long waiting list. Rather than delay treatment, the department had Family Matters tailor the respondent\u2019s visits to fit the recommendations of Green.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently, the fact that the department did not provide the respondent with access to the specific parenting program suggested by Green because of a long waiting list does not lead us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent and her children was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The respondent also argues that the department failed to make reasonable efforts to reunify her with her children because, in his October, 2008 report, Green recommended an evaluation of the respondent to determine if she had ADHD and the evaluation was not completed until a year later.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The respondent argues that, in the absence of the evaluation, the department was unable to tailor services to the specific needs of the respondent. At trial, Green stated that he recommended the evaluation because the respondent \u201ctold me many symptoms during the interview that are associated with ADHD,\u201d and he sought to \u201cdetermine whether there was, in fact, [ADHD] so I could differentiate that from some form of mood dysregulation, to determine whether her IQ difficulties were so serious that it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>enter the realm of mental retardation, and to determine whether her adaptive behavior skills\u2014her ability to get along in the world\u2014were at such a level that she would require some form of daily aide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">We are mindful that \u201c[Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 632, 847 A.2d 883 (2004). The failure of the department to provide an evaluation that may have been beneficial does not mean necessarily that a court\u2019s finding that the department made reasonable efforts was clearly erroneous. See <em>In re Melody L., </em>290 Conn. 131, 147, 962 A.2d 81 (2009) (\u201c[e]ven if the evidence had established that additional family therapy might have been beneficial, such evidence does not render the trial court\u2019s finding clearly erroneous\u201d); <em>In re Alexander T., </em>81 Conn. App. 668, 673, 841 A.2d 274 (\u201c[i]n light <em>of </em>the entire <em>record, the </em>failure to provide the referral, while a lapse, does not make the overall efforts of the department fall below the level of what is reasonable\u201d), cert. denied, 268 Conn. 924, 848 A.2d 472 (2004); <em>In re Ebony H., </em>68 Conn.

The record reveals that the delay in the respondent\u2019s ADHD evaluation was due, in part, to the respondent\u2019s own lack of engagement in the rehabilitation process. In viewing the record in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>its entirety, we are not persuaded that the court\u2019s finding that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite the respondent and her children was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The respondent\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in finding that she failed to achieve personal rehabilitation.

The record indicates that, at the time of trial, the respondent continued, inter alia, to have difficulties with parenting the children and regulating their behavior when she was with them, with her suggested medication regimen and management, and with marijuana use. While the record suggests that the respondent, after the children were committed to the petitioner, made some progress in her ability to care for herself, \u201cin assessing rehabilitation, the critical issue is not whether the parent has improved her ability to manage her own life, but rather whether she has gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Shyliesh H., </em>56 Conn.

App. 768, 781-82, 740 A.2d 896 (1999). At trial, Green testified that the respondent had mental health problems that required extensive additional therapy. He concluded that the respondent needed to address her own mental health issues before she could be expected to be able to care for the children. He also stated that she needed to be in long-term continuous therapy in order to determine the source of the mood dysregulation she demonstrated during the evaluation. Green\u2019s opinion as to the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status was that she had not properly addressed her own barriers to reunification with the children. Green further opined that, in order to address her obsessive compulsive personality disorder and mood dysregulation, the respondent would need serious psychotherapy over a period of at least one and one-half years, and he also noted the respondent\u2019s \u201clack of engagement . . . .\u201d Green opined that the respondent had not addressed sufficiently her mental health problems, due in part to such lack of engagement in treatment and her failure to remain medication compliant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In light of the record, we conclude that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent had failed to achieve a level of rehabilitation that would encourage the belief that, within a reasonable time, considering the children\u2019s ages and needs, she could assume a responsible position in the lives of her children and, therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.

This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>held that the trial court, in finding that no clear and convincing evidence had been presented to establish that the respondent mother and the respondent father had been living together at any time after November, 2006, improperly applied an elevated <em>standard of proof </em>for that subordinate fact, on which the court had relied in finding that the petitioner had not met her burden to prove that the mother had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation. Id., 111. In <em>In re Zamora S., </em>this court decided what <em>standard of proof </em>is required for subordinate facts and did not address substantively the issue of shifting the <em>burden of proof </em>from the petitioner to the respondent. <em>In re Zamora S., </em>therefore, is distinguishable from this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\"> At Family Matters, the respondent visited with the children while a therapist observed them through a one-way mirror.

I respectfully dissent because I conclude that the trial court improperly shifted the burden of proof on the issue of personal rehabilitation to the respondent mother. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">As a preliminary matter, I take a moment to emphasize the judicial lens through which I believe we must review the court\u2019s decision. \u201cThe termination of parental rights is defined as the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent .... It is a most serious and sensitive judicial action. . . . Although that ultimate interference by the state in the parent-child relationship may be required under certain circumstances, the natural rights of parents in their children undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>181 Conn. 638, 640, 436 A.2d 290 (1980). Because termination of parental rights is one of the most drastic actions that the state may take against its citizens, we must be scrupulous in our review of a decision terminating a parent\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">It is well established that \u201c[i]n order to terminate a parent\u2019s parental rights under [General Statutes] \u00a7 17a-112, <em>the petitioner [the commissioner of children and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>families] is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, </em>that: (1) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunify the family; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (1); (2) termination is in the best interest of the child; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (2); and (3) there exists any one of the seven grounds for termination delineated in \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 628, 847 A.2d 883 (2004). \u201c[T]he statutory criteria must be <em>strictly </em>complied with before termination can be accomplished.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Amanda A., </em>58 Conn. App. 451, 455, 755 A.2d 243 (2000). The ground for termination alleged in the present case was the respondent\u2019s failure to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 Q) (3) (B) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights, the court found that \u201c[a]s of the date of trial, [the respondent] had not made significant progress <em>to persuade the court by clear and convincing evidence </em>that she had met the objectives identified by Dr. [Logan L.] Green [a court-appointed psychologist] as important for reunification.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The fulfillment by the respondent of the objectives identified by Green evidently was essential to determining whether the respondent had achieved a sufficient degree of rehabilitation, as was necessary for reunification with her children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As this was essential to the court\u2019s determination, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to demonstrate that the respondent had failed to meet the objectives. However, by requiring the respondent to prove by clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>convincing evidence that she had met Green\u2019s objectives, the court, at least in part, put the burden of proof on the respondent to demonstrate that she had achieved a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. This, of course, is improper because the petitioner always bears the burden of proof on the issue of personal rehabilitation, and this burden never shifts. Accordingly, in reaching its decision, the court acted contrary to \u00a7 17a-112 by shifting the burden of proof on the issue of personal rehabilitation to the respondent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Due to the problematic nature of the court\u2019s language, the respondent sought an articulation from the court. The court offered two articulations in an attempt to clarify the disputed language contained in its decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its first articulation, the court explained that its intention was not to require that the respondent prove by clear and convincing evidence that she had met Green\u2019s objectives, but, rather, that the respondent \u201chad an obligation to meet the requirements of her specific steps in order to be reunited with her two sons\u201d and that <em>\u201c[the petitioner] </em>had proved by clear and convincing evidence that . . . [the respondent] had not addressed successfully her [issues].\u201d (Emphasis added.) In its further articulation, the court stated that the decision, taken as whole, \u201carticulates that the court\u2019s conclusion that [the petitioner] provided [the respondent] with the opportunity and services necessary to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>issues upon which the original commitment was based, and [that the respondent] failed to take full advantage of those services or rehabilitate to a degree that reunification was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In my view, the articulations present new reasoning and a new basis to support the decision to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights, namely, that the <em>petitioner </em>carried her burden of proving that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. \u201cAn articulation is not an opportunity for a trial court to substitute a new decision nor to change the reasoning or basis of a prior decision. ... If, on appeal, this court cannot reconcile an articulation with the original decision, a remand for a new trial is the appropriate remedy.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lusa </em>v. <em>Grunberg, </em>101 Conn. App. 739, 743, 923 A.2d 795 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">I conclude, therefore, that the court improperly shifted the burden of proof on the issue of personal rehabilitation to the respondent and that the court\u2019s articulations changed the basis of the original decision. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\"> In fact, the court found Green\u2019s report to be a \u201ccompelling document.\u201d Aside from Green\u2019s report, the record indicates that, in determining whether the respondent had achieved a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation, the court also relied on the petitioner\u2019s evidence that the respondent had not fully complied with the court-ordered specific steps, including certain substance abuse orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\"> As further evidence of this burden shift, the court states in its memorandum of decision that it found that the respondent had not \u201cestablished to the court\u2019s satisfaction that she is prepared educationally or emotionally to assume the primary care role of caring for her children.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\"> It is noteworthy that in both articulations, the court acknowledged that the language that it employed suggested that the burden of proof was on the respondent regarding the issue of personal rehabilitation. In its first articulation, the court stated that it \u201cagrees that the language . . . suggests a shifting of the burden . ...\u201d In its second articulation, the court stated that it \u201cacknowledges that the specific language cited suggested the alleged shift of [the] burden.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
