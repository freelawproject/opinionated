Cote, appeals following the denial of his petition for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing of certain evidence that had been introduced by the state in his criminal trial, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-102kk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>claims that the trial court improperly concluded that he failed to establish that a reasonable probability existed that he would not have been convicted if exculpatory results obtained through DNA testing had been available at his criminal trial. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The record reveals the following facts, which are largely undisputed, as well as the pertinent procedural history. The petitioner and the victim met and began to have a romantic relationship in November, 2001. By the end of that month, the petitioner had moved into the victim\u2019s apartment where the victim resided with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>her four children. The relationship quickly deteriorated. Beginning as early as December, 2001, the petitioner and the victim had verbal disputes that escalated into physical abuse. Although the relationship ended in October, 2002, the petitioner continued to reside in the apartment and slept on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">At around 5 a.m. on the morning of December 23, 2002, the victim was asleep in her bedroom when she heard the petitioner enter the bedroom and lock the door. When the petitioner entered the room, he accused the victim of infidelity and asked her to have sex with him. The victim told the petitioner that she had to get up to go to work, and then she attempted to get out of her bed. The petitioner, however, pushed her down and pinned her to the bed with his body weight so that she could not get up. While on top of her, the petitioner pulled out a folding knife that the victim had never seen before and held it to her throat. The petitioner began to rub the blade up and down the victim\u2019s neck and behind her ear, scraping her skin and causing cuts on her neck. At some point during the incident, the victim attempted to push the knife away and cut her finger. The victim did not scream or call out for any help during the incident because she feared for her life and the safety of her children who were sleeping nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The petitioner eventually grew tired and released the pressure on the knife against the victim\u2019s neck. Shortly thereafter, the petitioner and the victim talked and cried together until the petitioner fell asleep. While the petitioner was asleep, the victim picked up the knife and left the room. The victim then drove herself and her children to her parents\u2019 house. After the victim\u2019s father arrived home and she had told him what had happened, she drove to the resident state police trooper\u2019s office in Killingly where Trooper Leonard Blanchette took a written statement, photographed the fresh injuries to her neck and finger, and seized the knife that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>brought with her. At around noon on that same day, the police located the petitioner at the victim\u2019s home and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Subsequently, the petitioner was charged with assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 25, 2003, additional charges stemming from the December, 2002 incident were filed against the petitioner, namely, attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree and sexual assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">On September 22, 2004, following the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, a jury found him guilty of assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2), threatening in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (1) and unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-95 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court, <em>Dannehy, </em>J., imposed a total effective sentence of twelve years incarceration, followed by six years of special parole, to run consecutively to a sentence that the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>was then serving. The petitioner directly appealed to this court, which affirmed his conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>101 Conn. App. 527, 922 A.2d 322, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 901, 931 A.2d 266 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">On May 21, 2009, the petitioner filed a postconviction petition for DNA testing pursuant to \u00a7 54-102kk, to have the knife tested to determine whether any of the victim\u2019s DNA was on it, in order to demonstrate his innocence with regard to his conviction of assault in the second degree. In support of his petition, the petitioner alleged that a reasonable probability existed that the requested testing of the knife would produce DNA results which would have altered the verdict, that the knife was still in existence and was capable of being subject to DNA testing, that the knife never was subjected to DNA testing and that his petition was filed in order to demonstrate his innocence. On September 8, 2009, the trial court, <em>Robaina, J., </em>held a hearing on the petition and, on December 4, 2009, denied the motion. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded: \u201c[T]here is no evidence upon which [this court] can find that testing of the knife for DNA evidence would have altered the verdict .... There is no reasonable probability that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted had the results of the DNA testing been somehow \u2018exculpatory.\u2019 \u201d In its analysis, the court emphasized the mountain of inculpatory evidence adduced at the criminal trial, noting that such evidence lessened the probability that the DNA evidence would have altered the verdict. Subsequently, the petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly concluded that he failed to establish that a reasonable probability existed that he would not have been convicted if exculpatory results obtained through DNA testing of the knife had been available at his criminal trial. Specifically, the petitioner claims that, if the results from a DNA test of the knife confirm the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>of the victim\u2019s DNA, then there is a reasonable probability that he would not have been convicted of assault in the second degree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">We begin by setting forth our standard of review and the relevant legal framework. \u201c[T]he determination of whether a reasonable probability exists that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing pursuant to \u00a7 54-102kk (b) (1) is a question of law subject to plenary review, while any underlying historical facts found by the trial court are subject to review for clear error. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">\u201c[Reasonable probability within the context of \u00a7 54-102kk (b) (1) means a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. . . . Under this standard, a showing of reasonable probability does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the [unavailable] evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal. . . . The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. . . . The United States Supreme Court also emphasized that the [relevant inquiry] ... is not a sufficiency of the evidence test. ... A defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the [unavailable] evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict. . . . Accordingly, the focus is not whether, based upon a threshold standard, the result of the trial would have been different if the evidence had been admitted. We instead concentrate on the overall fairness of the trial and whether [the unavailability] of the [exculpatory] evidence was so unfair as to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\u201cIn analyzing the effect of DNA evidence, \u00a7 54-102kk (b) (1) directs us to consider the effect of potential exculpatory results obtained through DNA testing. At this point, it is evident that the petitioner will not know with certainty what DNA testing will show. Thus, \u00a7 54-102kk (b) (1) requires the court to consider the effect of the most favorable result possible from DNA testing of the evidence . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>129 Conn. App. 833, 839-10, 21 A.3d 583 (2011). In the present case, therefore, we assume that DNA testing would reveal the absence of the victim\u2019s DNA on the knife. The petitioner contends that, had this DNA evidence been available at the original trial, it would have been less likely that the jury would have found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt the \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d element of assault in the second degree because the absence of the victim\u2019s DNA on the knife tends to show that the knife did not penetrate the victim\u2019s neck. Accordingly, the petitioner contends that this DNA evidence creates a reasonable probability that he would not have been convicted of assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">As an initial matter, we note that standing alone, this DNA evidence does little to exculpate the petitioner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>From this DNA evidence, a jury might infer at best either that: (1) the petitioner used the knife to injure the victim, causing the victim\u2019s DNA to be deposited on the knife, but for reasons unknown, the DNA no longer is detectable through DNA testing, or (2) the petitioner did not use that particular knife to injure the victim. Accordingly, this DNA evidence does not establish that the petitioner did not use a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d to injure the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Furthermore, even assuming that the DNA testing determines that the victim\u2019s DNA is not present on the knife in evidence, we must consider this evidence within the context of the entire trial. Id., 841; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>295 Conn. 74, 90, 988 A.2d 865 (2010) (reasonable probability analysis requires that court take into account totality of evidence adduced at original trial in order to determine whether absence of exculpatory DNA evidence undermines confidence in verdict). The record reveals that there was overwhelming evidence adduced at trial demonstrating that the petitioner had used the knife to cut the victim\u2019s neck. The victim testified that she observed the knife as the petitioner held it and described in detail the physical characteristics of the knife. The knife was admitted as a full exhibit without objection by the petitioner. The victim also testified that the petitioner pressed the knife on her neck and rubbed it up and down and that she could feel the blade of the knife rolling underneath her skin. The victim\u2019s son and father both testified, under the spontaneous utterance hearsay exception; see Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (2); that the victim had told them that the petitioner had held a knife to her neck in a threatening manner. Moreover, the lacerations on the victim\u2019s neck were observed directly by the victim, her son, her father and Blanchette. Additionally, Blanchette testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>that, on the day of the incident, he observed lacerations on the victim\u2019s neck that appeared to have been made by a sharp object and that he photographed the victim\u2019s injuries. Those photographs were admitted into evidence. Although the petitioner denied having used the knife to cut the petitioner\u2019s neck, he testified that he recognized the knife, that it was \u201crazor blade sharp\u201d and that it always was attached to the belt loop of his pants, which were in the bedroom when the incident occurred. Because the evidence, derived from eyewitnesses and corroborated through both testimony and physical evidence, amply supported the conclusion that the petitioner had, in fact, used the knife to injure the victim, we agree with the trial court that there was not a reasonable probability that the petitioner would not have been convicted had exculpatory evidence derived from DNA testing of the biological material been available at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-102kk provides: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing postconviction relief, any person who was convicted of a crime and sentenced to incarceration may, at any time during the term of such incarceration, file a petition with the sentencing court requesting the DNA testing of any evidence that is in the possession or control of the Division of Criminal Justice, any law enforcement agency, any laboratory or the Superior Court.

The petitioner\u2019s only claim on appeal, however, is that the court made an improper reasonable probability determination under \u00a7 54-102kk (b) (1). The petitioner does not claim that the court improperly applied \u00a7 54-102kk (c) (1), nor does he analyze independently in his brief whether the court properly applied that section. In fact, in his brief, the petitioner concedes that the present case can be decided solely under \u00a7 54-102kk (b) (1). Nevertheless, in light of our determination resolving the petitioner\u2019s claim under \u00a7 54-102kk (b), we conclude that the trial court properly denied the petition under \u00a7 54-102kk (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
