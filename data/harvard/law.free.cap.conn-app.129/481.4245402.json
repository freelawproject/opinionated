On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment (1) after finding that the plaintiffs did not toll the three year statute of limitations period in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (1), (2) because the provisions of the applicable insurance policy are invalid and unenforceable, (3) because the defendant breached its contract with the plaintiffs, and (4) because the defendant is estopped from enforcing the terms of its policy. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The plaintiffs commenced this action on February 26,2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges the following. On November 16, 2004, Dolly Romprey was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which the vehicle she was driving collided with a vehicle driven by Donna Kempton. The collision was caused by Kempton\u2019s negligence. At the time of the accident, Dolly Romprey was insured under an automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The plaintiffs sought to recover from the defendant under the uninsured/underinsured<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motorist provisions of the automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiffs. In count one of the complaint, Dolly Romprey sought compensation for her own alleged injuries, and, in count two of the complaint, Peter Romprey sought compensation for loss of spousal consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The defendant filed an answer and special defenses in which it asserted, inter alia, that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action was time barred pursuant to \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>On September 24, 2008, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs responded by objecting to the motion for summary judgment but, in the alternative, requested that the court compel arbitration in accordance with the policy of insurance. In support of their objection, the plaintiffs submitted two unauthenticated copies of letters to the defendant, which were signed by a paralegal from the office of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. The first letter, which is dated December 12, 2005, states: \u201cIn connection with the above referenced file, enclosed please find all reports and medical bills thus far. Please be advised that Ms. Romprey is having surgery and all other medical documentation will be forwarded upon receipt. Also, enclosed please find the Declaration page for Donna Kempton. Please be advised that we have exhausted Ms. Kempton\u2019s policy.\u201d The second letter, dated February 24, 2006, states: \u201cPursuant to Connecticut General Statute Section 38a-336 (g) (1), if applicable, consider this a formal demand for arbitration in the above-referenced matter. Furthermore, kindly provide this office with a copy of Ms. Romprey\u2019s automobile policy, which was in effect on the date of accident.\u201d The plaintiffs also submitted an unauthenticated document entitled \u201cSETTLEMENT STATEMENT,\u201d which indicates that the plaintiffs received a $25,000 settlement from Kempton.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>On December 4, 2009, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In the trial court, the defendant asserted that it was entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiffs did not commence their action within three years of the date of the accident as required by the policy. The plaintiffs responded in relevant part that (1) the defendant had notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim within the three year limitations period, (2) the plaintiffs tolled the three year limitations period by making a written demand for arbitration within 180 days of exhausting the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy, (3) the defendant breached the insurance contract by failing to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 demand for arbitration and by failing to provide the plaintiffs with a copy of their insurance policy, and, therefore, the three year contractual limitations period was inapplicable, and (4) there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant advised the plaintiffs that the three year period applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">With respect to the three year limitations period, the court determined that there was no genuine issue of fact that the plaintiffs commenced their action more than three years after the date of the accident. It found that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law unless there was evidence to support the application of the tolling provision. The court then stated that, under the plain language of the policy, the tolling provision applied only in the case of a claim involving an underinsured, as opposed to an uninsured, motor vehicle. It determined that for the plaintiffs to come within the policy\u2019s tolling provision, they must establish that the sum of the limits of all bodily injury liability policies applicable to Kempton\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident was less than the limit of liability for the underinsured motorist coverage under their policy. The court noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs have submitted an unauthenticated copy of a document entitled \u2018SETTLEMENT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>STATEMENT,\u2019 which appears to indicate that the plaintiffs received a $25,000 settlement from Kempton. There is no indication, however, whether this amount was paid by an insurer or, if it was, whether it represents the full amount of Kempton\u2019s liability policy limits. Without any evidence indicating whether Kempton was insured and, if so, whether her bodily injury liability limits were less than $500,000,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is impossible for the court to determine that the present claim is one \u2018involving an underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 and, in turn, that the policy\u2019s tolling provision applies.\u201d In a footnote, the court stated that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs have submitted as their exhibit A an unauthenticated letter from a paralegal in their attorney\u2019s office indicating that \u2018we have exhausted Ms. Kempton\u2019s policy.\u2019 As an out-of-court statement, however, this constitutes hearsay inadmissible to prove that Kempton had an insurance policy or, if so, whether it was exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Although the court determined that the plaintiffs had not proven that their claim involved an underinsured vehicle, and therefore summary judgment in favor of the defendant should be granted, the court then \u201cassume[d] that the present claim involve[d] an underinsured motor vehicle\u201d and determined \u201cthat the plaintiff[s] ha[d] failed to submit evidence to establish that the two prongs of the tolling provision [had] been satisfied. As the language [of the plaintiffs\u2019 insurance policy] quoted [previously] indicates, in order to toll the three year limitations period, the plaintiffs would first have to have notified the defendant \u2018prior to expiration of the three year period, in writing, of any claim the [plaintiffs] may have for [u]nderinsured [m]otorists [c]overage.\u2019 \u201d After analyzing this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dorchinsky </em>v. <em>Windsor Ins. Co., </em>90 Conn. App. 557, 877 A.2d 821 (2005), the trial court concluded as to the first prong of the tolling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>statute that \u201cnone of the documents submitted by the plaintiffs [made] any reference to an underinsured motorist claim, or any other information indicating what type of claim the claim number refers to. Like the plaintiff in <em>Dorchinsky, </em>therefore, the plaintiffs in the present action have failed to produce any evidence indicating that, within three years of the accident, they provided notice in writing of any claim for underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">With respect to the second prong of the tolling provision, the court found that the documents offered by the plaintiffs did not establish that the settlement with Kempton exhausted the limits of her policy. \u201cAccordingly, the plaintiffs have provided no evidentiary basis from which the court could conclude that a demand for arbitration was made within 180 days of exhaustion. Because the plaintiffs have failed to submit evidence indicating that they satisfied either prong of the policy\u2019s tolling provision or that Kempton\u2019s vehicle was underinsured, there is no basis for the court to conclude that the three year contractual limitations period was tolled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Additionally, the court found that the plaintiffs did not provide evidentiary support for their argument that the defendant had breached the insurance contract by failing to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 demand for arbitration and by failing to provide the plaintiffs with a copy of the insurance policy. The court further found that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant had advised the plaintiffs that the three year statute of limitations applied. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u201cThe standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is well established. [W]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>252 Conn. 193, 201, 746 A.2d 730 (2000). \u201cA material fact is a fact which will make a difference in the result of the case. . . . [I]ssue-finding, rather than issue-determination, is the key to the procedure. . . . [T]he trial court does not sit as a trier of fact when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. . . . [Its] function is not to decide issues of material fact, but rather to determine whether any such issues exist.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coss </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>126 Conn. App. 30, 40, 10 A.3d 539 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u201cThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law . . . <em>and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Mucci, </em>238 Conn. 800, 805-806, 679 A.2d 945 (1996). \u201cIt is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zielinski </em>v. <em>Kotsoris, </em>279 Conn. 312, 319, 901 A.2d 1207 (2006). \u201cSummary judgment may be granted where the claim is barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Mucci, </em>supra, 806. \u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bonington </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>297 Conn. 297, 305, 999 A.2d 700 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In the present case, the relevant language of the insurance policy states: \u201cAll claims or suits under [the uninsured and underinsured motorist provisions] of this policy must be brought within three years of the date of the accident. However, in the case of a claim involving an <em>underinsured motor vehicle, </em>the insured may toll any applicable limitation period by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201c1. Notifying us prior to expiration of the three year period, in writing, of any claim <em>the insured </em>may have for Underinsured Motorists Coverage; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c2. Commencing suit or arbitration proceedings not more than 180 days from the date of exhaustion of the limits of liability under all automobile bodily injury bonds or policies applicable at the time of the accident by settlements or final judgments after any appeals.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The motor vehicle accident involving Kempton and Dolly Romprey occurred on November 16, 2004, and this action was filed more than three years after the date of the accident. The plaintiffs had not commenced any arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment by finding that the plaintiffs had not tolled the three year statute of limitations period allowed by \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (1) and set forth in the policy. After reviewing the record in this case, we agree with the court that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the claim is one involving an underinsured motor vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The plain language of the policy provides that any action for underinsured motorist benefits commenced more than three years after the underlying accident is time barred, unless the two tolling provisions are satisfied. Under the language of the policy, an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d is defined as \u201ca land motor vehicle or trailer of any type for which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the limit of liability for this coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Therefore, in order for the policy\u2019s tolling provision to apply, the plaintiffs must first demonstrate that Kempton had an insurance policy with a certain coverage and that the limits of Kempton\u2019s coverage were exhausted by payment to the plaintiffs. \u201c[E]xhaustion of the liability limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy is a necessary precondition to the recovery of underinsured motorist benefits . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 437, 452, 664 A.2d 279 (1995), We agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs did not submit any competent evidence establishing that Kempton had an insurance policy, that it provided for coverage in a certain amount and that such coverage was exhausted by the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The \u201cSettlement Statement\u201d submitted by the plaintiffs, which was unauthenticated but which the trial court examined, does not specify whether the $25,000 paid to the plaintiffs was paid by Kempton\u2019s insurer and, if so, whether it represents the extent of Kempton\u2019s policy limits. Without evidence that Kempton had a policy that was exhausted by payment to the plaintiffs, it was impossible for the court to determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involved an underinsured motor vehicle. Therefore, it was impossible for the court to determine whether the plaintiffs raised a genuine issue of material fact about whether the contractual tolling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>provisions were applicable and were satisfied by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Furthermore, in an effort to prove that Kempton was insured and her policy of insurance was exhausted, the plaintiffs cite the December 12, 2005 letter to the defendant from a paralegal in their attorney\u2019s office that states, in relevant part: \u201cPlease be advised that we have exhausted Ms. Kempton\u2019s policy.\u201d The court described this letter as \u201cunauthenticated\u201d and as \u201cinadmissible\u201d hearsay. The plaintiffs argue that the court\u2019s rejection of the letter was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u201c[0]ur standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. ... In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. . . . We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>118 Conn.

Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 380 through 382 [now \u00a7\u00a717-45 through 17-47] set forth detailed requirements to ensure that affidavits in support of summary judgment are proper.

App. 675, 679, 874 A.2d 849 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Because our rules of practice and case law require, inter alia, that any opposition to a motion for summary judgment shall be based on authenticated documents and evidence provided in sworn affidavits, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>agree with the plaintiffs that the court abused its discretion in rejecting the unauthenticated documents offered by the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Barlow </em>v. Palmer, supra, 96 Conn. App. 92.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Without any competent evidence indicating that Kempton\u2019s policy had been exhausted and that the tolling provision of the policy was applicable, we decide that the court properly concluded that it was impossible to determine that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involved an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d and, consequently, that the provision concerning notification of an underinsured motorist claim was tolled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the defendant\u2019s policy of insurance does not conform to \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (1) and, therefore, is invalid. The plaintiffs further argue that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>because the policy is invalid, the applicable statute of limitations period is six years as prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-576.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">As permitted by \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (1), the plain language of the policy provides that any action for underinsured motorist benefits commenced more than three years after the underlying accident is time barred, unless the accident involves an underinsured motor vehicle and the tolling provisions are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The plaintiffs contest the validity of the second prong of the policy\u2019s tolling provision. The plaintiffs note that the defendant\u2019s policy requires that a plaintiff must <em>commence suit or arbitration proceedings </em>not more than 180 days from the date of exhaustion, whereas \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (1) requires that aplaintiff must <em>commence suit or demand arbitration </em>under the terms of the policy not more than 180 days from the date of exhaustion. The plaintiffs argue that the policy requirement that an underinsured policyholder must \u201ccommence arbitration\u201d is invalid because it is more restrictive than the provision in \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (1) that an underinsured policyholder may toll any applicable limitations period \u201cby commencing suit or demanding arbitration under the terms of the policy . . . .\u201d They further argue that because the contract provision is invalid, the three year limitation period that they failed to satisfy is not applicable, and the general contract six year limitation period thus applies to their claims. See <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>76 Conn. App. 329, 336, 819 A.2d 859 (2003), aff'd, 268 Conn. 281, 842 A.2d 1123 (2004). We are not persuaded by this argument, however, because, as we explained in part I of this opinion, the plaintiffs failed to present any competent evidence to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Kempton had a policy, that the policy limits existed in a specific amount, that the settlement exhausted that coverage and, therefore, that the claim was one involving an underinsured motor vehicle. Because the plaintiffs have failed to establish this threshold requirement, the tolling provision of the policy has not been implicated, and we need not address its validity or whether the plaintiffs properly demanded arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The plaintiffs additionally argue that the defendant breached its contract with the plaintiffs by failing to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 initial demand for arbitration and by failing to provide the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel with a copy of the insurance policy. The plaintiffs assert that, because of the breach, the three year contractual limitations period is inapplicable and the six year limitations period set forth in \u00a7 52-576 applies. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">First, we note, as did the trial court, that nowhere in the policy is there any provision that a six year limitations period shall apply if the defendant fails to respond to a demand for arbitration or to provide a copy of the applicable insurance policy. Second, the plaintiffs offered only assertions of fact to support their argument that the defendant failed to respond to their demand for arbitration and request for a copy of the policy. To support these assertions, the plaintiffs offered the unauthenticated February 24, 2006 letter to the defendant from a paralegal in the office of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. While it is true that, in considering a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without competent evidence to support the claims, however, the plaintiffs had not raised a genuine issue of material fact. See <em>Zielinski </em>v. <em>Kotsoris, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 319. \u201cTo establish the existence of a material fact, it is not enough for the party opposing summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>judgment merely to assert the existence of a disputed issue. . . . Such assertions are insufficient regardless of whether they are contained in a complaint or a brief.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Trotta </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>26 Conn. App. 407, 412, 601 A.2d 1036 (1992). The plaintiffs did not submit any sworn affidavits or certified or otherwise authenticated documents to establish any genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, the court properly concluded that there was no evidentiary basis to support the argument that the defendant breached its contract with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs argue that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant should be estopped from raising the defense of the time limit on suit in the policy because, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the plaintiffs reasonably believed that the defendant had waived its right to rely on that provision. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u201cEstoppel has its roots in equity and stems from the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed . . . as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse. . . . The modem estoppel in pais is of equitable origin, though of equal application in courts of law. It is much more than a rule of evidence. It establishes rights; it determines remedies. An equitable estoppel does not so much shut out the tmth as let in the tmth, and the whole tmth.

Moreover, it is the burden of the person claiming the estoppel to show that he exercised due diligence to ascertain the truth and that he not only lacked knowledge of the true state of things but had no convenient means of acquiring that knowledge.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 385-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As an exhibit to the plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental objection to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on August 7, 2009, the plaintiffs submitted an affidavit of their attorney, stating that, in 2007, she made numerous attempts to contact the insurance adjuster assigned to handle the case. She further averred that she spoke with the insurance adjuster in December, 2007, when she was not advised that the claim was being denied \u201cfor failure to prosecute according to the policy, but value was in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We conclude that the mere fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel spoke with the insurance adjuster following the expiration of the three year limitations period<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and was not advised that the claim would be denied is insufficient to sustain a claim of estoppel, as \u201csilence will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>not operate as [an] estoppel absent a duty to speak.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 387. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we conclude that the plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence to demonstrate any misleading conduct by the defendant within the limitations period on which the plaintiffs reasonably could have relied to support their belief that the limitations provision would not be enforced. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have offered no evidence that they changed their position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> The plaintiffs claim that the action was commenced on February 15, 2008. The trial court found that the marshal\u2019s return indicates that process was served on the defendant on February 26, 2008, but \u201cbecause the result of the present motion is the same regardless of which of the two dates is correct, the court need not resolve the conflict between the parties\u2019 statements and the marshal\u2019s return.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that Dolly Romprey had insurance coverage from the defendant only under the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy. However, the relevant provision of the insurance policy contains references both to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. There is no dispute that the tortfeasor had insurance coverage on her motor vehicle, and the plaintiffs alleged in pleadings other than the complaint the payment to them of some or all of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy coverage amounts in a settlement. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action against the defendant must be based on the underinsured motorist coverage provided in the policy from the defendant. The trial court analyzed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to such underinsured coverage. In this opinion, therefore, we also refer solely to the underinsured, and not to the uninsured, coverage provided in the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (g) (1) provides: \u201cNo insurance company doing business in this state may limit the time within which any suit may be brought against it or any demand for arbitration on a claim may be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>on the uninsured or undermsured motorist provisions of an automobile liability insurance policy to a period of less than three years from the date of accident, provided, in the case of an underinsured motorist claim the insured may toll any applicable limitation period (A) by notifying such insurer prior to the expiration of the applicable limitation period, in writing, of any claim which the insured may have for underinsured motorist benefits and (B) by commencing suit or demanding arbitration under the terms of the policy not more than one hundred eighty days from the date of exhaustion of the limits of liability under all automobile bodily injury liability bonds or automobile insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident by settlements or final judgments after any appeals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-5\"> Dolly Eomprey\u2019s uninsured-underinsured motorist limit was $500,000 per person and per accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\"> Because we have determined that the plaintiffs have offered no competent evidence to establish that the claim is one involving an underinsured motor vehicle, we need not address whether the plaintiffs have submitted evidence to establish whether the two prongs of the tolling provision have been satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\"> In <em>Barlow, </em>this court stated that unsworn deposition testimony \u201ccould have been admitted at trial without objection to create an evidentiary foundation for the determination that a genuine issue of material fact exists, particularly where, as here, both parties submitted uncertified deposition transcripts. Therefore, a court properly could consider such a submission without objection.\u201d <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 96 Conn. App. 92. The plaintiffs cite this case for the proposition that a court <em>may </em>consider unauthenticated evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. This court, however, ultimately affirmed the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment, stating that \u201cwe are reluctant to find that the trial court incorrectly insisted on certified transcripts to support an evidentiary finding when the rule provides that such documentation shall be supplied.\u201d Id. The plaintiffs have not cited any authority suggesting that a failure of a trial court to consider unauthenticated evidence constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> We note that in <em>DiPietro </em>v. <em>Farmington Sports Arena, LLC, </em>123 Conn. App. 583, 2 A.3d 963, cert. granted, 299 Conn. 920, 10 A.3d 1053 (2010), this court concluded that, in the course of a summary judgment proceeding, plenary review applies to a trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the admissibility of expert testimony. Id., 610-12. Following our decision, the defendants in that case requested and were granted certification to appeal to our Supreme Court on that issue.
