A shooting resulting in the death of Chaz Booth and gunshot injuries to two other persons, Terrice Kimble and Christopher Henry, occurred in the early morning hours of December 24, 2005, in Hartford. Booth, Kimble, Henry and the defendant were among a crowd of people in Papa\u2019s Pizza, which is a restaurant on Union Place in Hartford. Booth was sitting at a table near the front of the restaurant on the right side when, at approximately 2:42 a.m., the defendant raised his arm and fired several gunshots from a handgun. The defendant then moved forward, closer to Booth, and fired additional gunshots before running out the door.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ten cartridge cases were recovered from the restaurant. Booth died from a total of seven gunshot wounds, with bullet trajectories indicating that the bullets entered him from the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">When the gunshots were fired, Kimble jumped on top of a table to make his way out of the restaurant. Once he was outside, he discovered that he had been shot and had suffered wounds to his arm and torso. Henry was sitting at the table opposite from where Booth was sitting. When the gunshots were fired, Henry dropped to the floor and hid under the table. He discovered that he had been shot in the leg, so he \u201cscooted\u201d out of the restaurant without getting up from the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The defendant fled the restaurant in a red Jeep Cherokee driven by another person. A Hartford police officer responded to a report of gunshots being fired at the restaurant and learned that a red Jeep Cherokee had left the scene. On his way to the restaurant, the officer came upon a motor vehicle accident involving a red Jeep Cherokee. When the officer approached, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>fled from the vehicle on foot. The officer apprehended the defendant, arrested him and brought him to the police station. The police recovered the handgun used in the shooting from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The defendant made a statement to the police in which he confessed to the shooting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He stated that he believed that Booth had shot and killed his friend Marlon Atkinson, also known as \u201cPints,\u201d in 2004. The defendant shot Booth at the restaurant in retaliation for Atkinson\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">At trial, counsel for the defendant argued that the defendant had acted in self-defense. Two witnesses testified in support of this defense. Jaquan Leggett testified that the defendant was in a heated conversation with someone at the restaurant just prior to the shooting, and that he saw a man consistent with Booth\u2019s description with a gun in his hand. Floyd Riley testified that, sometime before the shooting, the defendant had told him that Booth had threatened him. The defendant did not mention any of these facts in his signed confession. Both surviving victims of the shooting, Kimble and Henry, testified that they did not recall seeing Booth with a gun, nor did they recall hearing any argument between the defendant and Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">At trial, the state presented evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. Specifically, it pointed to the defendant\u2019s flight from the restaurant, the defendant\u2019s flight from the red Jeep Cherokee following the collision and the arrival of the police, and the alleged effort of the defendant, in the form of certain notes seized from the cell of an inmate named Marcus Perry, to solicit testimony concerning his claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Regarding the notes, the following facts are relevant. In March, 2008, shortly before the defendant\u2019s trial, officers from the department of correction searched the cell belonging to Perry. They found two handwritten notes. The jury reasonably could have found that the first note asked Perry to testify that he was at the restaurant and witnessed the events that transpired, including that Perry saw Booth shoot first and that he and another witness saw one of Booth\u2019s \u201cboys\u201d take his gun from him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See footnote 5 of this opinion. The second handwritten note consisted of two lists, titled \u201cwhat I had on\u201d and \u201cwhat he had on,\u201d and descriptions of clothing consistent with what the defendant and Booth were wearing at the restaurant that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On occasions over the course of the defendant\u2019s incarceration, his cell also was searched for contraband, and certain letters or notes had been seized and kept by the department of correction, as was done for each inmate. One of the officers who searched Perry\u2019s cell believed that he recognized the handwriting on the two notes found as the defendant\u2019s, so the notes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>compared with \u201cknown\u201d samples of his writing from letters seized from the defendant\u2019s cell on prior occasions. The notes and \u201cknown\u201d exemplars of the defendant\u2019s handwriting were admitted as full exhibits at trial. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">On appeal, the defendant makes a number of claims concerning the court\u2019s admission of the notes seized from Perry\u2019s cell. These claims fairly can be summarized as follows: (1) the notes were not relevant; and (2) the admission of the notes was fundamentally unfair and deprived him of certain constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting the notes found in Perry\u2019s cell because they were not relevant. Specifically, he claims that they were not probative of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. He also appears to argue that because the notes and \u201cknown\u201d exemplars of his handwriting contained inflammatory language that was more prejudicial than probative, the court should not have admitted them on relevance grounds. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">We note that the state argues that these claims are unreviewable because, although the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the notes on relevance grounds at trial, his counsel conceded at trial that the jury could find that the notes related to the allegations in this case. Although counsel made such a concession, he argued against admitting the letters on relevance grounds, maintaining that they were more prejudicial than they were probative. Based on our thorough review of the record, we will review the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claims because they properly were preserved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>We begin by setting forth our standard of review and the principles that guide our analysis. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference . . . [and] will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Zillo, </em>124 Conn. App. 690, 695, 5 A.3d 996 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u201cWithin the law of evidence, relevance is a very broad concept. Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. . . . Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact <em>even to a slight degree, </em>[as] long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>299 Conn. 567, 587 n.19, 10 A.3d 1005 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The defendant first argues that the notes were not probative of his consciousness of guilt. He argues that the notes established nothing more than that he may have been discussing his case with a potential eyewitness, prompting the witness\u2019 recollection, not that he was soliciting false testimony. He argues that, because there was no evidence of money, threats, or other bases to believe that he \u201c[put] Perry up to\u201d testifying on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>behalf, there was nothing present in the notes or the surrounding circumstances to \u201cmake out a prima facie basis for an inference\u201d of consciousness of guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A discussion of consciousness of guilt evidence is helpful. \u201cEvidence that an accused has taken some kind of evasive action to avoid detection for a crime, such as flight, concealment of evidence, or a false statement, is ordinarily the basis for a [jury] charge on the inference of consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliveras, </em>210 Conn. 751, 759, 557 A.2d 534 (1989). \u201c[C]onsciousness of guilt [evidence] goes to the question of the defendant\u2019s state of mind, a determination which in turn requires an assessment of the defendant\u2019s motivations .... In seeking to introduce evidence of a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, [i]t is relevant to show the conduct of an accused ... as well as any statement made by him subsequent to an alleged criminal act, which may be inferred to have been influenced by the criminal act.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>98 Conn. App. 608, 628, 911 A.2d 753 (2006), aff'd, 286 Conn. 17, 942 A.2d 373 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u201cThe fact that evidence is susceptible of different explanations or would support various inferences does not affect its admissibility, although it obviously bears upon its weight. So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 656 n.12, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). Attempts to suborn perjury on the defendant\u2019s behalf have been held to warrant a jury instruction on consciousness of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>263 Conn. 478, 503-507, 820 A.2d 1024 (2003) (letter offering to pay for alibi); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 656 (statement \u201c \u2018get the three witnesses lined up\u2019 \u201d relevant to show attempt to fabricate alibi).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In the present case, the defendant challenges whether the notes seized from Perry\u2019s cell were probative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>his consciousness of guilt. Together, the notes contain details about the events that occurred in the restaurant on the morning of the shooting. The notes, which were found shortly before the defendant\u2019s trial was to begin, indicate that it was \u201ccrunch time\u201d and that Perry would be called \u201creal soon . . . .\u201d See footnote 5 of this opinion. Notably, the defendant does not argue that the notes were in any way ambiguous insofar as they related to the events at issue in the trial. Nor does he argue on appeal that it was in any way possible for the jury to believe that he was not the author of the notes. Rather, he argues that he was merely preparing a fact witness for trial, in much the same way that an attorney would prepare a witness for trial: by going through the details of Perry\u2019s recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The defendant\u2019s suggested interpretation of the notes is not the only reasonable interpretation, however. The notes reasonably may be construed in such a manner that it would appear that the defendant was asking Perry to testify falsely concerning the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. See footnote 5 of this opinion. The defendant disguised his identity by signing one note \u201cyou [know] who it is.\u201d The alleged facts contained in the first note supported the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense: Perry saw Booth \u201ctalking shit\u201d to the defendant; Perry saw Booth pull out a gun first; Perry and another person saw one of Booth\u2019s \u201cboys\u201d take the gun from him. The first note contained details as to how Perry purportedly came to know about the defendant\u2019s plight and implored Perry to \u201cjust go over this till they call you . . . .\u201d The second note contained details as to what the defendant and Booth were wearing. The jury reasonably could construe these statements to mean that Perry was not, in fact, at the restaurant that night, and, thus, had no personal knowledge of what the parties were wearing, or that he was at the restaurant, but he did not actually observe the details to which the defendant wanted him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>It is not for the reviewing court to determine whether the defendant\u2019s or the state\u2019s interpretation of the notes is correct. That there is a claimed ambiguity goes to the weight that the jury should afford the evidence, not to its admissibility. There is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support an inference that the defendant wrote the notes because he wanted to bolster his claim of self-defense with Perry\u2019s false testimony. This view is probative of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. Accordingly, we conclude that the notes were relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Relevant evidence may be excluded, however, if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative force. On appeal, the defendant also appears to argue that because the notes and certain \u201cknown\u201d exemplars of his handwriting contained inflammatory language that was prejudicial, the court should not have admitted them on relevance grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The following additional procedural history is necessary to understand this claim and the defendant\u2019s remaining claims. At trial, the state solicited testimony of a correction officer and a handwriting expert regarding six \u201cknown\u201d samples of the defendant\u2019s handwriting. Small exemplars taken from the \u201cknown\u201d samples were shown to the jury to provide a basis of comparison in order for the state to establish the defendant\u2019s authorship of the two notes found in Perry\u2019s cell. Outside of the jury\u2019s presence, there was an evidentiary dispute regarding whether the contents of the \u201cknown\u201d samples should be admitted as full exhibits because they contained prejudicial information. There also was a dispute concerning the expert\u2019s use of a \u201cknown\u201d exemplar containing the word \u201cnigga,\u201d a word also found in the first note. See footnote 5 of this opinion. The court ruled initially that the contents of the \u201cknown\u201d samples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>would not be admitted as full exhibits but that the handwriting expert could testify regarding the exemplars, including the challenged exemplar.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">During cross-examination of the handwriting expert, counsel for the defendant solicited testimony that the expert had been told that the \u201cknown\u201d letters were written by the defendant; he had no personal knowledge of that fact. In response, the state sought to admit the entirety of the \u201cknown\u201d samples as full exhibits to show, by their content, that the defendant had written them. Further colloquy outside of the jury\u2019s presence occurred. The court concluded that defense counsel\u2019s questioning appeared to invite the inference that the defendant was not the author of the \u201cknown\u201d letters. After some discussion, including regarding how the \u201cknown\u201d samples could be redacted, the defendant chose to stipulate that he authored the \u201cknown\u201d letters. The \u201cknowns\u201d were not admitted as full exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">On appeal, as he did at trial, the defendant argues that the admission of the notes seized from Perry\u2019s cell was unfairly prejudicial because an inflammatory word, \u201cnigga,\u201d was used in one of the notes and, because that word also appeared in the samples of \u201cknown\u201d writings, the handwriting expert used it as an exemplar from the \u201cknown\u201d writings that were shown to the jury. The court, however, gave the jury a limiting instruction regarding the purpose of the proffered evidence and how to treat the presence of words that it might find inappropriate or offensive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe jury is presumed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>have followed the court\u2019s instructions unless there is evidence to the contrary in the record.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>106 Conn. App. 97, 106, 940 A.2d 858 (2008), appeal dismissed, 291 Conn. 777, 970 A.2d 80 (2009); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 630 (limiting instruction minimized any unduly prejudicial impact of evidence of parole status); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Skidd, </em>104 Conn. App. 46, 68-69, 932 A.2d 416 (2007) (racial epithet used in state\u2019s closing argument did not unfairly prejudice defendant when word relevant to defendant\u2019s intent and used in reference to testimony of several trial witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">None of the other prejudicial material that may have been contained in the \u201cknown\u201d letters was ever shown to the jury. We conclude that, especially in light of the court\u2019s limiting instruction, the proffered evidence was not more prejudicial than it was probative of a relevant fact. Accordingly, the notes seized from Perry\u2019s cell, and, insofar as they are challenged, the exemplars of the defendant\u2019s \u201cknown\u201d writing, properly were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The defendant also claims that the admission of the notes found in Perry\u2019s cell and the circumstances under which he stipulated that he was the author of the \u201cknown\u201d letters violated certain of his rights guaranteed by the United States constitution. Some of his arguments are intertwined with the relevancy issues already discussed. We conclude that these claims, insofar as they are distinct from the issue of whether the notes and samples of \u201cknown\u201d writing were relevant, are not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The defendant concedes that his claims of constitutional error were not preserved at trial and seeks review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of his claims pursuant to the familiar four-pronged analysis set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To prevail under <em>Golding, </em>the defendant must satisfy all four of the prongs. See footnote 8 of this opinion. If the defendant fails to satisfy either of the first two prongs, his claim is not reviewable. The second prong of <em>Golding </em>requires that the alleged trial court violation be truly of constitutional magnitude and not be simply a presentation on the admissibility of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgos-Torres, </em>114 Conn. App. 112, 116-17, 968 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 293 Conn. 908, 978 A.2d 1111 (2009). \u201cThe defendant can not raise a constitutional claim by attaching a constitutional label to a purely evidentiary claim or by asserting merely that a strained connection exists between the evidentiary claim and a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>94 Conn. App. 72, 79, 891 A.2d 67, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 911, 899 A.2d 40 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">First, the defendant seeks <em>Golding </em>review of his claim that his constitutional right to a jury verdict under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution \u201cwas violated by the trial court\u2019s invitation to view his entire [claim of] self-defense, as stated in notes to Perry, as something that could provide a basis of guilt simply by his maintaining the defense.\u201d Other than the admission of the notes found in Perry\u2019s cell, which we have determined was proper, he does not cite record evidence to support his assertion that the court deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the defendant of his \u201cright to have criminal liability determined by a jury . . . .\u201d We conclude that the defendant has attempted to attach a constitutional label to what is otherwise an evidentiary claim, and, thus, his claim is not reviewable pursuant to the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Second, the defendant seeks <em>Golding </em>review of his claim that he was deprived of his right to confront witnesses guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the constitution. Specifically, he claims he was deprived a \u201c \u2018meaningful cross-examination into a legitimate area of inquiry\u2019 \u201d as part of his cross-examination of Greg Kettering, the state\u2019s expert handwriting witness. A close reading of the defendant\u2019s argument, however, belies his claim that his constitutional rights were implicated: the defendant does <em>not </em>claim that the court unduly restricted his examination of the witness. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>273 Conn. 330, 337-40, 869 A.2d 1224 (2005). Rather, his objection is to the fact that <em>after </em>his examination of Kettering, the court \u201coffered the defendant a Hobson\u2019s choice between stipulating to the authenticity of the \u2018knowns\u2019 ... or suffering their admission as a full exhibit\u201d with redactions as discussed in part IB of this opinion. Because the defendant has not alleged an action by the court that implicates a fundamental right, this claim is not reviewable pursuant to the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Finally, the defendant seeks <em>Golding </em>review of his claim that the court violated his right to due process because it \u201clost sight of its proper role\u201d and became \u201can advocate for the state\u2019s case.\u201d Again at issue is the admission of the notes found in Perry\u2019s cell. The gravamen of this claim is that the court violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights because it did not compel the state to accept the defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate to having authored the notes prior to the state\u2019s attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to put the notes into evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The result of this claimed failure was that the state put prejudicial evidence before the jury as part of its effort to establish that the defendant had authored the notes\u2014specifically, that the defendant was incarcerated and that the \u201cknown\u201d samples contained inflammatory language.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Cornelius, </em>120 Conn. App. 177, 181-83, 990 A.2d 927 (reviewing pursuant to <em>Golding </em>defendant\u2019s claim that court\u2019s comment during jury charge implicated court\u2019s neutrality), cert. denied, 296 Conn. 910, 993 A.2d 467 (2010). Based on our thorough review of the record, we conclude that this claim is not reviewable pursuant to the second prong of <em>Golding. </em>Not even a strained connection can be found to exist between the claimed action, or inaction, by the court and the claimed violation of a fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\"> The court imposed a total effective sentence of ninety years imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\"> The defendant also asks this court to exercise its supervisory authority to abandon, or strictly limit, the doctrine of consciousness of guilt under our law. Our Supreme Court has declined such invitations; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Coward, </em>292 Conn. 296, 316, 972 A.2d 691 (2009); and we, as an intermediate appellate court, are bound by such decisions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>107 Conn. App. 666, 684-85, 946 A.2d 319, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 902, 952 A.2d 811 (2008). Accordingly, we decline to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> The restaurant had a security system, which recorded a silent video from four small cameras inside.
