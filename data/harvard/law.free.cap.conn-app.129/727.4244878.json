On appeal, the respondent and the children argue that the court erred in finding that, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-175,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it could not place the children with the respondent without an approved compact study from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the permanent residence of the respondent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the respondent\u2019s and children\u2019s claims are moot and do not fall under any exceptions to the mootness doctrine, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to address their claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to these appeals. The petitioner, the commissioner of children and families, became involved with the children because on April 28 and May 19,2010, their mother<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> failed to provide adequate supervision of them. On July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>9, 2010, the mother was arrested and charged with four counts of risk of injury to a child, possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell, possession of marijuana with intent to sell, possession of a hallucinogenic with intent to sell and operating a drug factory. Also on July 9, 2010, the children were removed from the mother\u2019s home under a ninety-six hour hold pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">On July 12, 2010, the court granted the petitioner\u2019s ex parte motions for orders of temporary custody as to the children. On this date, the petitioner, for the first time, became aware of the respondent. The petitioner learned that the respondent was living in Pennsylvania and that he previously had been responsible for the children\u2019s care for extended periods of time during school holidays. The petitioner also became aware that the respondent wanted to have the children live with him after their mother had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">On July 16, 2010, a preliminary hearing was held concerning the petitioner\u2019s orders for temporary custody. At this hearing, the respondent argued that \u00a7 17a-175 did not apply to him as a noncustodial parent and requested that the court allow him to take custody of the children. The court did not rule in response to the respondent\u2019s request but, instead, scheduled oral argument on the issue of whether \u00a7 17a-175 applied to an out-of-state, noncustodial parent. On July 23, 2010, the court concluded that \u00a7 17a-175 does apply to the placement of children with out-of-state, noncustodial parents. The children and the respondent filed separate appeals from this decision on July 30 and August 5, 2010, respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>At a hearing on September 16, 2010, the court reported that it received the results of the compact study, authorizing placement of the children with the respondent in Pennsylvania on the condition that the court order six months of protective supervision. On this same date, the court adjudicated the children neglected and granted joint legal custody of the children to the respondent and the mother with physical custody in the respondent. The court also ordered protective supervision for a period of six months with the respondent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of oral argument in this court, the children were living with the respondent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Before we may address the respondent\u2019s and children\u2019s claims that \u00a7 17a-175 does not apply to out-of-state, noncustodial parents, we must first address whether we are precluded from reviewing their claims because they are moot. The issue of mootness was not addressed by the parties in their initial briefs or at oral argument. We ordered, sua sponte, the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing whether the claims were moot and, if so, whether review was still permissible under the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The parties all agree that the claims are moot; however, they also all contend that the claims ought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>reviewed because they are capable of repetition, yet evading review. See <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 382-83, 660 A.2d 323 (1995). Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 common position, we must conduct our own independent analysis. \u201c[A] subject matter jurisdictional defect may not be waived ... [or jurisdiction] conferred by the parties, explicitly or implicitly. . . . [T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law . . . and, once raised, either by a party or by the court itself, the question must be answered before the court may decide the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>D\u2019Auria </em>v. <em>Solomine, </em>107 Conn. App. 711, 714-15, 947 A.2d 345 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">\u201cMootness implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">We agree with the parties that the respondent\u2019s and children\u2019s claims are moot because the compact study, recommending placement of the children with the respondent, was completed and the court granted the respondent legal and physical custody of the minor children during the pendency of these appeals. Furthermore, as noted, the period of protective supervision ordered by the court as a result of the compact study <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>expired on March 18,2011. There is, therefore, no practical relief that we can provide to the respondent or the children. We recognize, however, that review of the claims is still possible if they meet the requirements of an exception to the mootness doctrine. The respondent and the children argue that their claims can be reviewed under the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\u201cOur cases reveal that for an otherwise moot question to qualify for review under the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 exception, it must meet three requirements. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 382-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\u201c[A] party typically satisfies [the first] prong if there exists a \u2018functionally insurmountable time [constraint]\u2019 <em>Dutkiewicz </em>v. <em>Dutkiewicz. </em>289 Conn. 362, 367, 957 A.2d 821 (2008); or \u201cthe challenged action had an intrinsically limited lifespan.\u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 383. In other words, \u201c[t]his requirement is satisfied when there is a strong likelihood that the inherently limited duration of the action will cause a substantial majority of cases raising the same issue to become moot prior to final appellate resolution.\u201d <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>299 Conn. 833, 840, 11 A.3d 658 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>We conclude that the first prong of <em>Loisel </em>is not satisfied because the challenged action here, the application of \u00a7 17a-175 to out-of-state, noncustodial parents, is not inherently limited in duration and will not cause a substantial majority of cases raising the same issue to become moot prior to final appellate resolution. An order requiring that a compact study must be completed before a child can be placed with an out-of-state, noncustodial parent has an indefinite lifespan every time the receiving state disapproves of the transfer. Compare <em>In re Fabian A., </em>106 Conn. App. 151, 155-56, 941 A.2d 411 (2008) (order extending delinquency commitment inherently limited because, by statute, extension can last no more than eighteen months).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The respondent and the children argue that the first prong of <em>Loisel </em>is satisfied because orders of temporary custody are, by their very nature, limited in duration. The respondent and the children mischaracterize the challenged action that we must review under the first prong of <em>Loisel. </em>Although the court granted the petitioner\u2019s ex parte motions for orders of temporary custody as to the children on July 12, 2010, that is not the challenged action before this court. We are being asked to address whether the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 17a-175 applies to the placement of children with out-of-state, noncustodial parents was proper. As noted, we conclude that this order does not have an inherently limited lifespan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Furthermore, the petitioner claims that there is a strong likelihood that a substantial number of cases involving the application of \u00a7 17a-175 to the placement of a child with an out-of-state, noncustodial parent will evade review. In support of this conclusion, the petitioner relies on statistics compiled by the department of children and families\u2019 interstate compacts office. These statistics, however, do not support the petitioner\u2019s claim that the challenged action here satisfies the first prong of <em>Loisel. </em>As noted, the standard is that there must be a \u201cstrong likelihood that the inherently limited duration of the action will cause a substantial majority of cases raising the same issue to become <em>moot </em>prior to final appellate resolution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 840. According to the statistics cited by the petitioner, the receiving state disapproves of the placement of a child with the noncustodial parent almost half of the time that a compact study is requested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In these situations where placement is denied, any order by the court applying \u00a7 17a-175 to out-of-state, noncustodial parents will <em>not </em>become moot. It is in these situations that an actual controversy will still exist and our appellate courts will be in the position to provide actual relief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We acknowledge the importance of this issue to out-of-state, noncustodial parents and understand the desire of the parties to obtain a judicial ruling. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>also understand that compact studies can delay the placement of a child with a biological parent. See V. Sankaran, \u201cOut of State and Out of Luck: The Treatment of Non-Custodiai Parents Under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children,\u201d 25 Yale L. &amp; Policy Rev. 63, 74 n.53 (2006) (\u201cState Compact administrators report waiting an average of three to four months for the entire home study to be completed. . . . Others have observed that the [compact] approval process can take \u2018between six months and one year and at times has exceeded one year\u2019.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). We are, however, constrained not to reach out and decide a case when we have concluded we lack subject matter jurisdiction. To do so would be to issue an advisory opinion, which we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The respondent\u2019s and children\u2019s claims do not satisfy the first prong of Loisel; they are not entitled to consideration of their appeals under the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception. The appeals, therefore, must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The appeals are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In this opinion BEACH, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-13\"> Children are parties to juvenile cases involving abdications of neglect and the termination of parental rights.

See <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>224 Conn. 749, 757, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993). In <em>Madigan, </em>the court was persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that \u201c[a] lost opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>to spend significant time with one\u2019s child cannot be replaced by a subsequent order of custody as part of an ultimate dissolution judgment,\u201d and \u201c[t]o deny immediate relief to an aggrieved parent interferes with the parent\u2019s custodial right over a significant period in a manner that cannot be redressed by a later appeal.\u201d Id., 756. The court, therefore, concluded that \u201ctemporary custody orders are immediately appealable because an immediate appeal is the only reasonable method of ensuring that the important rights surrounding the parent-child relationship are adequately protected.\u201d Id., 757. The court\u2019s decision concerning the applicability of the compact raises similar concerns and is, therefore, immediately appealable as a final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\"> This protective order has not been appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\"> In the supplemental brief submitted by the respondent, we were informed that the period of protective supervision ended on March 18, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> Although an appeal from the court\u2019s orders of temporary custody is not the issue in this case, we note that in <em>In re Forrest B., </em>109 Conn.

Although she conceded that this issue was moot, the respondent argued that her claims could be reviewed under the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine. Id., 775. The respondent, however, did not produce any evidence that orders of temporary custody are, by their very nature, of such a limited duration that there is a strong likelihood that they will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. This court concluded that \u201c[i]n failing to establish that the substantial majority of temporary custody orders evades review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the respondent has foundered on the first required criterion of the exception,\u201d and, therefore rejected the respondent\u2019s claim that the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception applies to her appeal.

Although I agree with the majority that this case is moot, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the issues on appeal are not capable of repetition, yet evading review. Accordingly, I would reach the merits of these appeals and, for the reasons set forth herein, reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">As the majority notes, \u201cto qualify for review under the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 exception, [the challenged action] must meet three requirements. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 382-83, 660 A.2d 323 (1995). I do not believe that the majority disagrees that these appeals meet the second two requirements. We diverge, however, on the first factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">At our request, the parties have briefed the issue of mootness, all agreeing not only that the issue in these appeals is moot, but also that it is capable of repetition, yet evading review. The Center for Children\u2019s Advocacy, Inc., the National Association of Counsel for Children and the Connecticut commission on child protection also filed a joint amicus brief in which they agree that the issues in these appeals are moot but capable of repetition, yet evading review. Although I agree that the parties\u2019 shared desire for a resolution of the issue on appeal cannot create jurisdiction where it does not otherwise exist, I find their reasoning cogent and persuasive. Consequently, like the parties, I believe that this case meets all three requirements for review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The majority concludes to the contrary on the basis of its reasoning that an order requiring a compact study pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-175 has an indefinite lifespan. Consequently, the majority believes that these appeals do not satisfy the <em>Loisel </em>requirement that the order is of inherently limited duration and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>likely to escape review. Respectfully, I disagree. As acknowledged by the majority, the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families, has provided statistics in a supplemental brief demonstrating that approximately 73 percent of interstate compact requests are completed prior to oral argument on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is persuasive evidence that there exists a strong likelihood that a substantial majority of cases regarding interstate compact studies will become moot prior to appellate resolution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Because the issue raised on appeal affects biological parents, a reasonably identifiable group for whom the appellant herein, the respondent father, can be said to act as a surrogate, and the issue regarding the right of a parent to the care of his minor children is of unquestionable public importance, I believe that this case meets the remaining prongs of <em>Loisel. </em>Accordingly, I believe that, although moot, the claim presented in these appeals is capable of repetition, yet evading review.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The respondent and his minor children claim on appeal that \u00a7 17a-175 does not apply to out-of-state, noncustodial parents. Specifically, they argue that article in of \u00a7 17a-175 is unambiguous and by its plain language excludes out-of-state, noncustodial parents from its reach. I agree and, accordingly, would reverse the judgments of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\u201cOur standard of review for issues of statutory interpretation is well settled. Issues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goodspeed Airport, LLC </em>v. <em>East Haddam, </em>115 Conn.

Today, \u00a7 17a-175 includes ten articles that encompass the compact and provide detailed guidelines for placing minor children out-of-state.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">According to article I of \u00a7 17a-175, the purpose of the compact is to promote cooperation among the states \u201cin the interstate placement of children to the end that: (a) Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care, (b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child, (c) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made, (d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Article III of the statute provides: \u201cNo sending state shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.\u201d Article VIII provides in relevant part: \u201cThis compact shall not apply to . . . [t]he sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>parent, stepparent, grandparent, adult brother or sister, adult uncle or aunt, or his guardian and leaving the child with any such relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">I conclude that \u00a7 17a-175 is both plain and unambiguous and that it does not apply to an out-of-state, noncustodial parent. Specifically, article III provides that no sending state shall send any child for placement in <em>foster care </em>or as a preliminary to a <em>possible adoption. </em>Although the statute does not define \u201cfoster care\u201d or \u201cadoption,\u201d I conclude that pursuant to their plain meaning, these terms do not include a noncustodial parent. These terms are not susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation; and equating persons to whom the compact applies with noncustodial parents expands the reach of the statute beyond the breaking point. Consistent with the dictates of \u00a7 l-2z, therefore, I will not consider any extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute. I conclude that the compact does not require a state that is placing children with an out-of-state, noncustodial parent to comply with its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The petitioner argues that by interpreting article III to exclude out-of-state, noncustodial parents, we would render article VIII meaningless. Moreover, the petitioner claims that article VIII defines the only situations in which the compact does not apply. I do not believe, however, that article VIII provides an exhaustive list of situations in which the compact does not apply. While article VIII specifically lists certain situations pursuant to which the compact does not apply, as noted, article HI clearly establishes, as a precondition, that the placement of children in foster care, or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, is contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">My interpretation of \u00a7 17a-175 is not at odds with article VIII. Both articles III and VIII of the compact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u201c[evince] the intent of the drafters to respect the integrity of the family and to allow parents to plan for the care of their own children unless the children were being placed in foster care or were being adopted.\u201d V. Sankaran, supra, 25 Yale L. &amp; Policy Rev. 70-71. My conclusion is consistent with this intent. Here, the respondent is seeking to care for his own children, in his home state, and is not seeking to adopt them or place them in foster care. I do not believe that the drafters intended to burden parents with the same requirements as those individuals or agencies who are seeking to adopt children or provide foster care to children to whom they are not related.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The petitioner further argues that our construction of \u00a7 17a-175 contradicts the compact\u2019s regulations. By way of background, the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children drafted model regulations for states to adopt as a supplement to the compact. Id., 71-72. Specifically, Regulation No. 3 (6) (b) provides: \u201cThe Compact does not apply whenever a court transfers the child to a noncustodial parent with respect to whom the court does not have evidence before it that such parent is unfit, does not seek such evidence, and does not retain jurisdiction over the child after the court transfers the child.\u201d Subsection (5) of this regulation also provides: \u201cThe term \u2018foster care\u2019 as used in Article III . . . means care of a child on a 24-hour a day basis away from the home of the child\u2019s parent(s). Such care may be by a relative of the child . . . .\u201d Finally, subsection (1) provides: \u201c \u2018Placement\u2019 as defined in Article II (d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>arrangement for the care of a child in the home of his parent . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The petitioner argues that pursuant to these regulations, \u00a7 17a-175 must apply to out-of-state, noncustodial parents. I conclude that the petitioner\u2019s interpretation of Regulation No. 3 is in direct conflict with \u00a7 17a-175 and, as such, the statute must control. Specifically, the petitioner\u2019s reading of the regulation expands article III to include situations that were not originally included when the compact was adopted by our legislature. This is the judicial equivalent of permitting the tail to wag the dog. \u201cA regulation cannot be upheld if it is contrary to the statute under which it was promulgated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Wambaugh, </em>934 F.2d 474, 481 (3d Cir. 1991). The regulation provides no basis upon which to elongate the language of \u00a7 17a-175 to apply to parents in the respondent\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The petitioner argues that our decision will place children at risk of harm because the compact provides the most thorough investigation possible of the proposed placement by the receiving state. I understand, and share, the petitioner\u2019s desire to assure the highest level of safety for children who are placed with an out-of-state, noncustodial parent. Expanding the meaning of \u00a7 17a-175, however, to include situations clearly not within the reach of the statute, to the detriment of noncustodial parents, is not the proper way, or the only way, to protect children who are being placed out of state. Our role as an appellate court, moreover, is not to provide alternatives to a compact study. Our role in this case simply is to determine whether the compact applies to out-of-state, noncustodial parents. I have concluded that it does not. I have confidence that the responsible authorities will be able to devise alternative approaches that safeguard children placed with noncustodial parents in other states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>In reaching this decision, I join at least five other state courts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the only federal court to address the issue of whether the compact applies to out-of-state, noncustodial parents. In <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Wambaugh, </em>supra, 934 F.2d 474, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that, in determining whether the compact applied to an out-of-state, noncustodial parent, \u201c[t]he most significant and, to our minds, determinative language is found in Article III (a) . . . .\u201d Id., 480. The court concluded that, \u201c[t]he scope of the Compact <em>is carefully limited to foster care or dispositions preliminary to an adoption. </em>Article III thus precisely reflects the articulated intention of the Council of State Governments.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>In addressing article VIII, the <em>McComb </em>court concluded that it \u201cexcludes from the scope of the Compact the sending of a child into a receiving state by certain relatives (including a parent) or his guardian and leaving the child with any such relative [including a parent]. The word guardian is not defined in the statute. Presumably if an agency has been appointed guardian, it can place a child in another state with a parent or other relative designated in the Compact without being affected by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">\u201cThe detailed draftsman\u2019s notes, supplied by the Council of State Governments, reinforce the notion that the Compact does not apply to parental placements. The notes state that Article VIII exempts certain close relatives. This was done in order to protect the social and legal rights of the family and because it is recognized that regulation is desirable only in the absence of adequate family control or in order to forestall conditions which might produce an absence of such control.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 480-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Finally, the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[w]e are persuaded that read as a whole the Compact was intended only to govern placing children in substitute arrangements for parental care. Thus, the Compact does not apply when a child is returned by the sending state to a natural parent residing in another state. The language of Article III is unambiguous . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 482. I agree with the court\u2019s interpretation of article III and join those jurisdictions that have held that the compact applies to children being placed in substitute arrangements for parental care, and does not apply to out-of-state, noncustodial parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">On the basis of the foregoing, I would reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the case with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>direction to render judgments for the respondent and the children. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> Specifically, the attorney general explained that: \u201cIn the 2005 reporting period, there were 50 home study requests by an out-of-state parent; 31 of them being completed before [the amount of time it would take for an average appeal to be ready for oral argument], or 62 [percent]. [In 2006, it was 14 out of 34 home study requests, or 41 percent]. In 2007, the number was 69 out of 88, or 78 [percent]. In 2008, the number was 75 from a total of 95 home study requests, or 79 [percent]. In 2009, [it was] 67 out of 91 home study requests ... or 74 percent. In 2010 ... [it was 83 out of 109 home study requests, or 76 percent]. Combining all six years from 2005 to 2010, 339 home study requests out of 467, or [73] percent, would have received a placement decision prior to any appeal being heard for oral argument.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> I recognize, as the majority has noted, that this court, in <em>In re Forrest B., </em>109 Conn. App. 772, 953 A.2d 887 (2008), concluded that the respondent mother failed to offer any evidence showing that \u201cmost cases challenging a temporary custody order are, by their very nature, of such a limited duration that there is a strong likelihood that they will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded.\u201d Id., 776. In the case at hand, however, the petitioner has provided statistical evidence regarding interstate compact cases leading me to believe that a substantial majority of these cases are, in fact, likely to evade review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\"> Because I agree that \u00a7 17a-175 by its own very terms does not apply to out-of-state, noncustodial parents, I would not address the respondent\u2019s claim that \u00a7 17a-175 violates aparent\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> Article II (d) of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-175 provides: \u201c \u2018Placement\u2019 means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical facility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\"> In an article, \u201cOut of State and Out of Luck: The Treatment of Noncustodial Parents Under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>dren,\u201d Vivek Sankaran discusses the use of custody hearings as a substitute for the compact when out-of-state, noncustodial parents are seeking custody of their children. The author stated that \u201c[c]hild welfare agencies routinely contract with licensed private foster care groups ... to assess potential placements, license foster parents, and monitor children in homes. Courts and states could make greater use of such arrangements to help ensure that home studies of biological parents are completed in a more timely manner. The result of this home study could be admitted into evidence at the custody hearing at which a judge, not a caseworker, would have the final authority to approve or deny the placement. . . . Courts could [also] maintain the current [compact] framework but modify its application when the interests of biological parents are implicated. For example, if an out-of-state parent requests placement of his child, the receiving state could continue to bear responsibility for conducting the home study and making an initial recommendation about the parent\u2019s suitability. But under this modified approach, the home study would have to be conducted on an expedited basis, and the court, either in the sending or receiving state, would possess the exclusive authority to make the ultimate placement decision after a hearing at which the parent could be heard.\u201d V. Sankaran, supra, 25 Yale L. &amp; Policy Rev. 88-89. Again, while I will not opine as to the appropriate replacement for the compact, I believe alternative approaches exist, and can be devised, to assure the safety of children placed with out-of-state, noncustodial parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\"> Other state cases that have found that the compact does not apply to out-of-state, noncustodial parents include <em>Arkansas Dept. of Human Services </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>347 Ark. 553, 65 S.W.3d 880 (2002); <em>Tara S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>13 Cal.
