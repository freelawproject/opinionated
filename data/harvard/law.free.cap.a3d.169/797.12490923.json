On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to convict him of robbery in the first degree; (2) the trial court abused its discretion and violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution when it permitted a detective to testify about historic cell site analysis without being qualified as an expert witness; and (3) his cumulative conviction and sentences for conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit larceny violate the double jeopardy clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. We agree with the defendant that his cumulative convictions and sentences for conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit larceny violate the double jeopardy, but we reject the defendant's other claims. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in part and affirm the judgment in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of Saturday, February 16, 2013, the defendant checked into a Comfort Inn in Naugatuck and paid the required $100 deposit in cash. Later\n   that\n   morning, at approximately 9:30 a.m., the defendant purchased a Beretta Airsoft BB gun (facsimile firearm), which looked like a Beretta style handgun, at a Walmart in Derby. Thereafter, the defendant returned to the Comfort Inn to check out. Caitlin Mitchell and an unidentified black male accompanied the defendant during the checkout process. When he was informed that he had to wait for housekeeping to check his room before his cash deposit would be refunded, the defendant became irate, insisting that he had to be somewhere and threatening to call the police if his deposit was not returned. Eventually, the hotel manager calmed the defendant down while the checkout process was completed. At approximately 11:30 a.m., after the hotel manager was informed that the defendant's room was in order, she placed the defendant's deposit on the counter beside her while she printed a receipt for the defendant. The defendant reached over the counter, grabbed the money, and left with Mitchell and the unidentified black male before the hotel manager could complete the checkout process. After exiting the hotel, all three individuals entered the defendant's green Cadillac Deville and left.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At 11:54 a.m., the defendant ran into the Webster Bank in Seymour while wearing dark blue jeans, a black ski mask, and grey gloves. He pointed his facsimile firearm at Tara Weiss, the assistant bank manager, and ordered everybody \"[to] get to the fucking floor.\" After the bank employees and customers complied with his order, the defendant jumped onto and then over the teller counter and aimed his facsimile firearm at Danielle George, a bank teller. He ordered her to open her\n   cash drawer and place the money in the bag he provided. As George complied with his order, another teller behind the counter began to move. The defendant aimed his facsimile firearm at the other teller and told her \"not to be a hero ....\" The defendant returned his attention to George. George continued to put money in the defendant's bag and managed to place a dye pack in the bag as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When George finished, the defendant took the bag and exited the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 4, 2013, the defendant was arrested for his role in the bank robbery. In the operative information, the defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and conspiracy to commit larceny in the third degree. After a trial, a jury found the defendant guilty of all counts. The defendant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of ten years of incarceration followed by four years of special parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We begin with the defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to convict him of robbery in the first degree as a principal, which was the only theory of liability the state pursued at trial\n   and on which the court instructed the jury. The state responds that, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for a jury to reasonably conclude that the defendant acted as a principal during the robbery. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. As the robber exited the bank, he ordered Weiss to count to 100. Weiss initially complied and began counting. Once the robber left the bank, however, she jumped up, ran to the doors, and locked them. Weiss then returned to her station, pressed the bank's panic alarm, and called 911. After speaking with a 911 operator, Weiss reported the robbery to Webster Bank's emergency hotline and to the branch manager, Jason Rodriguez, who was in New York. Rodriguez immediately began driving back to Connecticut from New York. State and federal law enforcement personnel arrived at the bank shortly thereafter and obtained, inter alia, surveillance footage of the robbery. Surveillance footage from inside the bank revealed that the robber wore dark blue jeans, grey gloves, and a black ski mask. Surveillance footage from outside the bank revealed that a green vehicle, which was similar in appearance to the defendant's Cadillac, entered the bank parking lot shortly before the robbery and picked up an individual on Spruce Street shortly after the robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After leaving the bank, the robber and his companion(s) initially drove north on Route 8, stopping in Beacon Falls to dispose of the discharged dye pack and the cash that was burned when the dye pack discharged. Shortly thereafter, members of law enforcement, with\n   the assistance of a pedestrian, recovered the dye pack and some of the burned and stained cash from an area near the Beacon Falls Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that day, at approximately 2 p.m., the defendant and an unidentified black male were traveling northbound on Route 8 when they stopped to dispose of a facsimile firearm by throwing it onto the embankment along the side of the highway. Unbeknownst to the defendant and his companion, Rodriguez, who was also traveling northbound on Route 8 on his way to the bank, observed this conduct. When he neared the defendant's Cadillac, he immediately noticed that it was being driven erratically. In response, he slowed down and watched as the Cadillac swerved into the breakdown lane, where he saw the driver throw an object over the roof of the Cadillac and onto the embankment. Because of the suspicious nature of this conduct and his knowledge of the recent robbery at his bank branch, Rodriguez used his cell phone to record his observations, including the vehicle's make, color, and license plate number and a brief physical description of the men in the driver's and front passenger's seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then reported\n   the incident to the police. Shortly thereafter, officers recovered a black Beretta style facsimile firearm from the Route 8 embankment near the Bridgeport-Trumbull line. Notably, the tip of the recovered facsimile firearm was covered with black electrical tape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after the incident along Route 8, the defendant purchased professional strength Goo Off and rubber cleaning gloves with cash at the Home Depot in Derby. He then proceeded to the Post Motor Inn in Milford where he rented a cabin in his own name and\n   paid for it in cash. The following morning, February 17, 2013, the defendant checked into the Super 8 Motel in Milford with Mitchell, paying for the room with cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   That evening, a patrol officer reported that she had located the Cadillac involved in the Webster Bank robbery in the Super 8 Motel parking lot. Shortly thereafter, officers investigating the bank robbery arrived. After speaking to the employees at the front desk of the motel and reviewing its surveillance footage, the officers determined that the defendant was associated with the Cadillac and that he was staying in room 206. After about fifteen minutes of knocking on the defendant's door, the defendant came to the window of his room but refused to open the door. He denied ever being in Seymour or knowing anything about the Cadillac in the parking lot, claiming that a friend had dropped him off at the motel. When the detectives asked him whether he knew anything about a bank robbery, he stated that he did not, but added that \"if [the officers] had enough information on him, [they] would be arresting him right now.\" Members of the Milford Police Department then detained the defendant and Mitchell in the lobby of the Super 8 Motel. When special agent Lisa C. McNamara of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrived, she attempted to talk to Mitchell, but the defendant kept yelling at her: \"Don't talk to them, you don't have to talk to them, your parents have to be present, you don't have to talk to them.\" As a result, McNamara brought Mitchell outside of the lobby and they sat in an unmarked police cruiser so that they could talk without the defendant hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officers subsequently seized several items from the Super 8 Motel. From the defendant and Mitchell's vacated room, they seized a hotel room key for the room that the defendant had rented at the Comfort Inn. From the hotel staff, they obtained surveillance footage, which showed the defendant arriving at the motel in\n   his Cadillac and checking into his room. Notably, during the course of check-in, the defendant could be seen removing several folded bundles of cash from his pants pockets and using that cash to pay for his room. Because the defendant paid in cash, officers further seized from the Super 8 Motel seventy dollars that was stained with red dye, which they believed that the defendant used to pay for the room. Subsequent forensic tests confirmed the presence of chemicals used in bank dye packs on the stained cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to retrieving several items from the Super 8 Motel staff, officers seized and searched the defendant's Cadillac. In the Cadillac, officers found five pairs of grey latex gloves, receipts from Walmart and Home Depot, and a roll of black electrical tape. The latex gloves that were recovered from the Cadillac's glove box were similar in appearance to the ones\n   worn by the individual who had robbed the Webster Bank. The Walmart receipt helped the officers obtain surveillance footage from Walmart, which confirmed that on the morning of the robbery the defendant, who was wearing dark blue jeans, arrived at Walmart in his Cadillac and purchased a facsimile firearm of the same make and model as the one recovered from the embankment along Route 8. Subsequent forensic tests revealed that the electrical tape found in the defendant's Cadillac was indistinguishable from the electrical tape found on the facsimile firearm recovered from the embankment along Route 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because the defendant appeared to lead a transient lifestyle in which he frequently moved from motel to motel, officers checked with hotels and motels in the area to determine whether he had stayed in them after the robbery. When they arrived at the Post Motor Inn, they learned that the defendant had checked into a cabin at 2:51 p.m. on the day of the robbery. On his registration card, the defendant had listed two people\n   in his party and had noted his vehicle's make and license plate number. The officers noticed that the sink in the defendant's cabin was tinted red and that the snow behind the cabin was stained red. They took samples of the stained snow. In the tree line near the cabin, the officers found a garbage bag, which contained, inter alia, rubber gloves similar to those the defendant had purchased at Home Depot, towels with red stains on them, and an empty bottle of soap. A Post Motor Inn employee also gave them a black ski mask that he had found in the snowbank approximately thirty feet from the defendant's cabin. Subsequent forensic tests confirmed that the gloves and towels retrieved from the garbage bag and the seized samples of stained snow contained traces of the chemicals used in bank dye packs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, at trial, Mitchell testified that on the weekend of the robbery she had seen the defendant in possession of \"a substantial amount of money\" and cleaning \"red stuff\" off his Cadillac. Mitchell also testified that the defendant had told her that he \"robbed a bank ....\" Mitchell maintained that when the defendant stated that he robbed a bank, he did so \"jokingly\" and, as a result, she did not take him seriously. She admitted, however, that the defendant was her friend and that \"I don't want to be here with this,\" i.e., \"to testify against someone that was close to me ....\" After the parties rested and presented closing arguments, the court instructed the jury. With respect to the charge of robbery in the first degree, the court instructed the jury only on principal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"We note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether\n   the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Moreover, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant's innocence.... The [finder of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Finally, [a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt ... nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [finder of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal.... On appeal, we do not ask whether\n   there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact's] verdict of guilty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crespo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%201\">\n    317 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16-17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%20447\">\n    115 A.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the defendant's conviction of robbery in the first degree. First, Mitchell testified that the defendant told her that he \"robbed a bank ....\" On the basis of this testimony, the jury could have concluded that when the defendant said that he \"robbed a bank,\" he meant that he personally had robbed a bank. The defendant, relying on the corpus delicti doctrine, argues that Mitchell's testimony cannot support his conviction because his purported confession is uncorroborated. The purpose of the corpus delicti doctrine, however, is to protect against convictions for offenses that have not in fact occurred.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Farnum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3149793\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/26/#p33\">\n    275 Conn. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33-34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=878%20A.2d%201095\">\n    878 A.2d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The corpus delicti doctrine has no bearing on the present case because it is undisputed that the Webster Bank in Seymour was robbed on February 16, 2013; indeed, it is undisputed on appeal that the defendant was one of the individuals who conspired to rob the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant further suggests that Mitchell's testimony cannot support his conviction because Mitchell testified that she did not take the defendant seriously when he said that he \"robbed a bank ....\" A jury may properly decide, however, \"what-all, none, or some-of a witness' testimony to accept or reject.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Victor C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415458\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/145/54/#p61\">\n    145 Conn.App. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20A.3d%2048\">\n    75 A.3d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20933\">\n    310 Conn. 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20859\">\n    78 A.3d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The jury in this case very well could have credited Mitchell's testimony that the defendant told her that he robbed a bank but discredited her testimony that she understood him to be\n   joking. Mitchell admitted that the defendant was her friend and that she did not want \"to testify against someone that was close to [her].\" The jury reasonably could have concluded, therefore, that Mitchell characterized the defendant's statement as a joke because of her desire to protect him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant's robbery conviction, however, is not supported solely by Mitchell's testimony. At trial, the state presented a variety of direct and circumstantial evidence creating a connection between the physical attributes and possessions of\n   the robber and the defendant. The jury had before it surveillance footage of the robbery. When determining if the defendant was the robber, the jurors could have compared surveillance footage of the robber with other surveillance footage of the defendant and their own observations of the defendant in court to determine if there was a physical resemblance between the robber and the defendant. Additionally, the bank surveillance footage and eyewitness testimony established that the robber possessed a black firearm and was wearing dark blue jeans, grey gloves, and a black ski mask. Walmart surveillance footage depicted the defendant wearing dark blue jeans on the morning of the robbery. The receipt and surveillance footage from Walmart further established that while at Walmart the defendant personally purchased a black facsimile firearm, which was the same make and model as the facsimile firearm an individual driving a Cadillac disposed of later that afternoon by throwing it onto an embankment alongside of Route 8. Five pairs of grey latex gloves similar to those worn by the robber were recovered from the Cadillac's glove compartment, and a black ski mask similar to the one worn by the robber was recovered from a snowbank approximately thirty feet from the defendant's cabin at the Post Motor Inn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although it can be argued that this evidence is not inconsistent with the defendant being the getaway\n   driver instead of the robber, \"[i]n reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim ... we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury's verdict of guilty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3958362\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/447/#p459\">\n    285 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=939%20A.2d%20581\">\n    939 A.2d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).

The defendant further contends that this evidentiary error obstructed his rights under the confrontation clause because Ditria's lack of training, education, or experience with cell phones, cellular networks, and cell site analysis prevented him from being meaningfully cross-examined on this evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant seeks\n   review of this unpreserved constitutional claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) ; see also\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (modifying third condition of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state responds that Ditria merely read from a document that was already in evidence, i.e., the defendant's cell phone records and instructions from the cellular carrier on interpreting those records, and, thus, his testimony was factual, not opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively,\n   the state argues that any error in the admission of this testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Microcells typically are used in urban or suburban settings to cover an area that is less than one mile in diameter. M. Harris, How Cell Towers Work, supra, 3. A picocell is a small base station that acts like an extension cord, extending the macrocell's or microcell's signal through high traffic or obstructed areas and covering an area of less than 250\n   yards in diameter.

An omnidirectional antenna is intended to service the entire, 360 degree area around a cell site. T. Singal, supra, p. 100; M.

Importantly, the cell site in closest proximity to these cell phones might not be the one producing the strongest, best quality signal for them. J. Beck et al., supra, 3; see A. Blank, supra, 5.

Handoffs are broadly classified as being \"hard\" or \"soft\"\n   depending on the cell phone system the cellular carrier uses. A hard, or \"break before make,\" handoff involves a definite decision by the cell phone to break its connection with its current cell site before, or as, it makes a connection with a new cell site.

As we previously stated, the threshold issue is whether the court improperly permitted lay testimony concerning historic cell site analysis. The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. At the time of the robbery, the defendant owned a cell phone serviced by Sprint-Nextel (Sprint). During the course of his investigation, Ditria subpoenaed the defendant's subscription information and call detail records from\n   Sprint, and, at trial, the state entered the materials Sprint provided into evidence as exhibit 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Exhibit 77 includes, inter alia, the defendant's call detail records, instructions on how to interpret those records, and a list of cell site locations. The call detail records are in the form of a ten column chart, which, in relevant part, has columns titled, \"First Cell,\" and, \"Last Cell.\" The \"key\" to the call detail records explains that \"First Cell\" and \"Last Cell\" refer to the specific cell site and \"sector\" through which the communication was initiated and terminated. \"The first digit [of the cell site identification number] reflects the sector. The last 3-4 digits represent the [cell] site number.... For example, if the number in the [First Cell or Last Cell] column reads 2083, the cell site is 083 and the sector is 2.\" (Emphasis omitted.) A separate, eighteen column chart provided by Sprint contains a variety of information about\n   Sprint's cell sites, including the address and azimuth of each cell site. Exhibit 77 does not define what a \"sector\" or \"azimuth\" is.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does it contain any general or specific information on cellular networks, the geographical coverage areas of Sprint's cell sites, or the operation of cell phones and cell sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At trial, Ditria explained that learning the defendant's cell phone number was \"crucial\" because he \"wanted to learn the whereabouts of [the defendant] based on\n   his phone records.\" Once he knew the defendant's cell phone number, Ditria testified, he subpoenaed the defendant's cell phone records from Sprint. Ditria identified the documents provided by Sprint, which were entered into evidence as exhibit 77 without objection. Ditria explained that although he understood the \"[b]asic incoming and outgoing phone calls\" when he received the call detail records, he needed help to understand the cell site information within them. He contacted a Sprint representative, whose job it was to assist law enforcement, \"to learn about the communication of the cell phone and the cell tower ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When Ditria began to explain his current understanding of \"the significance of a cell tower,\" defense counsel objected on foundational grounds, stating: \"I think he is giving opinion testimony here regarding, I think that's where we're going here.\" The court asked the prosecutor for a response, to which she replied: \"What he understands about cell phone records now after being educated.\" The court overruled the objection. Thereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. You were explaining what a cell phone tower is for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[Ditria]: In order for a phone call to be made, incoming or outgoing, you have to have a cell tower, and it dedicates the subscriber information, checking if it's a legitimate phone number, and with that carrier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Can you make a phone call without a cell tower?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Absolutely not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And did you also learn how close a cell phone has to be to a tower in order to receive information from it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And how far away can a phone be to bounce off the tower?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Anywhere from zero to thirty miles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: A big radius?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: So, cell phone-at thirty miles or right next to the tower?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: That's the tower that's it's going to bounce off of?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And so, did he also teach you how to read these?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. And so, I'm going to pick a random page, page number two of thirty. How can you determine from this page what cell tower you are looking for? What column are we looking at?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defense counsel objected, explaining: \"I think we're getting into the realm of expert testimony here, and I don't think that the officer has been qualified as an expert. What we're trying to do here is to educate the jury, and I think that's wholly in the purview of an expert.\" The prosecutor replied: \"The officer has indicated that he did not know how to read the records, but now he does know how to read the records and has demonstrated to the jury that he has the information in front of him.\" The court overruled the defendant's objection, stating that it found that proper foundation had been laid for the admission of exhibit 77 into evidence and that \"[i]t's part of his investigation, he learned\n   how to interpret the data. I'll allow him now to testify from the document entered into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Direct examination of Ditria continued. The prosecutor asked Ditria, \"[h]ow is this information helpful to your understanding of the case,\" and Ditria explained that it \"[b]asically, pinned down the whereabouts of [the defendant] before, during, and after the robbery of Webster Bank.\" Thereafter, Ditria explained in detail how the defendant's call detail records helped him to confirm the defendant's presence near eight areas of interest: Walmart, the Comfort Inn, the Webster Bank, Beacon Falls, Bridgeport, Home Depot, the Post Motor Inn, and the Super 8 Motel. In particular, Ditria testified as to when the defendant or the bank robbery suspect was believed to be in the area of interest, when the communication in question was made, the address of one of the cell sites used by the defendant's cell phone,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the distance from that cell site to the area of interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   After reviewing these details, the prosecutor asked\n   Ditria: \"So, after learning the proximity of the cell tower locations to the places that you believe that [the defendant] was at, what does that do for your investigation?\" Ditria responded: \"It gives us a better understanding about the whereabouts of [the defendant] during those dates and times.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to explore Ditria's understanding of cell site analysis through the following colloquy:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: And now, Sprint only operates a digital cell phone system; isn't that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"[Ditria]: I'm not sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: All right. Do you know if they operate an analog system?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"[Ditria]: I'm not sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: And the phones that we use now are all digital, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[Ditria]: (Indicating yes.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: And I think you were testifying that the cell phones connect to a particular tower, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \"[Ditria]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: And didn't they tell you that they actually connect to more than one tower simultaneously; isn't that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"[Ditria]: They did not say that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: They didn't say that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"[Ditria]: No....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Do you know that the cell phone is always looking for the strongest signal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \"[Ditria]: I don't know if it's looking for the strongest, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Now, do you know that on a digital cell phone, they can connect to multiple cell sites; did you know that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"[Ditria]: I did not know that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: They didn't tell you that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \"[Ditria]: (Indicating no.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: And the representative at Sprint, did he tell you that there's things that can get in the way of a signal from a cell tower?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"[Ditria]: He did not say that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Things like leaves, weather; did he say that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \"[Ditria]: He did not say that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: That the wind could impact the coverage of a cell site; did he say that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \"[Ditria]: He did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: And that digital cell phones have this thing called a soft handoff; did he tell you what that is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \"[Ditria]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Have you ever heard of the term triangulation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \"[Ditria]: I have not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: They didn't tell you or explain that to you over the phone?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \"[Ditria]: No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The defendant requested to make a motion outside the presence of the jury. After the jury was excused, the defendant moved to strike Ditria's testimony regarding \"the cell phone coverage\" because he was not competent to testify on that topic. The court disagreed, explaining: \"There was never any offer that he is an expert, and\n   he did not offer any opinions. He is simply interpreting or translating the data that was given to him.\" The state agreed, adding: \"[I]t just goes to the weight of his testimony.\" The court overruled defense counsel's objection, but it stated, in response to a question from defense counsel, that it was \"perfectly fine\" for defense counsel to explore the defendant's education, or lack thereof, with respect to cell phones and cellular networks on cross-examination. Thereafter, defense counsel continued his cross-examination, during which he explored Ditria's lack of education and training concerning cell phones and cellular networks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   After Ditria's testimony, both parties rested and presented closing arguments. During her opening argument, the prosecutor referred to Ditria's testimony concerning the location of the defendant's cell phone, highlighting in particular the short distance between cell sites used by the defendant's cell phone and the areas of interest. In response, defense counsel during his closing argument emphasized that Ditria \"didn't have any expertise as to how these things actually work.\" During her rebuttal argument, the prosecutor made the following relevant remarks: \"Ditria said that he had no formal education in cell phone tower mechanics, but he did have the wherewithal to call somebody who did, right? And we found out that a cell tower is\n   in a fixed location and that cell phones are mobile, mobile phones, right? So, if you know where the cell tower is, and that's in a fixed location, and a cell phone is mobile, but you know that there are these other things that are fixed locations, like Walmart; Walmart is not mobile, right? Walmart is where it is. Home Depot is where it is. The Super 8 is not moving without some significant effort, okay? So, if you have [the defendant] pinned down in those places, then you could also coordinate the fact that his cell phone is pinging off cell towers in a fixed location all within a mile. Does Ditria really need all that technological expertise to explain it to you, okay?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \"We review a trial court's decision [regarding the admission of] expert testimony for an abuse of discretion....

As we discussed\n   in part II A of this opinion, call detail records can be used to determine the approximate location of a cell phone at the time of a particular communication by determining the geographical coverage area of the cell sector used to facilitate that communication. This process of determining the actual or approximate geographical coverage area of a cell sector requires scientific and technical knowledge. Specifically, it requires an understanding of how cell sites and RF antennae operate, and knowledge of all of the internal and external factors that influence the size and shape of a cell sector. Indeed, in recognition of the scientific underpinnings of historic cell site analysis, our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   held that a court must conduct a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing prior to admitting testimonial or documentary evidence of historic cell site analysis.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489325\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/506/#p123\">\n    Id., at 132-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489325\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/506/#p123\">\n    156 A.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For these reasons, we conclude that the court abused its discretion by not requiring Ditria to be qualified as an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The state nonetheless urges that \"when Ditria's testimony is reviewed in relation to the cell phone records themselves, a document that was admitted as a full exhibit without objection, it is clear that the substance of his testimony, i.e., the particular cell tower that the defendant's cell phone connected with at particular times, did not constitute 'expert' testimony at all, but was the equivalent of Ditria merely reading from a document that was already in evidence.\" We disagree; Ditria did not merely read from exhibit 77. Ditria testified that in order to make a phone call, a cell phone must use a cell site. Ditria then explained that in order to use a cell site, a cell phone must be within thirty miles of it. Ditria further agreed with the prosecutor that, because of these principles, if a cell phone is \"at thirty miles or right next to\" a cell site, then that is the cell site that the cell phone is going to use to make or receive a call. None of this information is contained in Exhibit 77. By\n   explaining to the jury how cell phones and cellular sites operate and the geographical coverage area of Sprint's cell sites, Ditria broached the realm of expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Having concluded that the court abused its discretion by not requiring Ditria to be qualified as an expert witness, we turn to the defendant's confrontation clause claim. Because the defendant seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review of this unpreserved constitutional claim, we do not need to determine whether the court's failure to qualify Ditria as an expert witness obstructed the defendant's confrontation rights if this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

For the purposes of our analysis, we assume that this evidentiary error was of constitutional magnitude and, therefore, the burden is on the state to prove that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 425,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20A.3d%20697\">\n    121 A.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   We conclude that the admission of Ditria's testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As we discussed in part II of this opinion, the state presented\n   substantial and varied evidence of the defendant's involvement in the bank robbery, including the defendant's admission to Mitchell that he robbed a bank. Moreover, Ditria's testimony was largely cumulative evidence of the defendant's location before, during, and after the robbery. Specifically, Ditria's testimony was used to corroborate the defendant's presence near eight areas of interest: Walmart, the Comfort Inn, the Webster Bank, Beacon Falls, Bridgeport, Home Depot, the Post Motor Inn, and the Super 8 Motel. The state established the defendant's presence at all of these locations through other direct and circumstantial evidence. For example, surveillance footage established the defendant's presence at Walmart and the Super 8 Motel as well as the presence of a vehicle similar in appearance to the defendant's Cadillac at the Webster Bank during the robbery. The Walmart and Home Depot receipts recovered from the defendant's Cadillac corroborated the defendant's presence at those stores. Rodriguez' testimony and the recovered facsimile firearm, which was the same make and model as the one the defendant purchased from Walmart, established the defendant's and his Cadillac's presence on Route 8 near the Bridgeport-Trumbull line. To establish the defendant's presence at various hotels, the state admitted into evidence registration forms, in the defendant's own name, for the Comfort Inn, the Post Motor Inn, and the Super 8 Motel and presented the testimony of employees from those hotels who confirmed that guests must present a driver's license when checking into those establishments. Finally, all of the direct and circumstantial evidence of the defendant's participation in the robbery corroborates his presence in Beacon Falls, where the dye pack associated with George's cash drawer was recovered shortly after the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As a result, even though we conclude that the court abused its discretion by not requiring Ditria to be qualified as an expert witness, we also conclude that this\n   error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the defendant's constitutional claim fails under the fourth prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The defendant's final claim is that his cumulative convictions and sentences for conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit larceny violated his right against double jeopardy. The defendant seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review of this unpreserved constitutional claim. The defendant's claim is reviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error and the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , supra, 318 Conn. at 511,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20542\">\n    122 A.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the state concedes, the defendant is further entitled to reversal of one of his conspiracy convictions under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because both convictions arose out of a single agreement to rob the Webster Bank in Seymour.
