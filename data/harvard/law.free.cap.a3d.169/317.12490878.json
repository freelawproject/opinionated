Salce, Jr.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the judgment of the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Edward F. Stodolink\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, rendered in favor of the plaintiff, TD Bank, N.A. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Richard P. Gilardi\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, erred in denying his motion to dismiss by improperly placing the burden of proof on him to establish a lack of personal jurisdiction due to ineffective service of process; and (2) the court,\n   <em>\n    Radcliffe, J.\n   </em>\n   , erred in granting summary judgment as to liability in favor of the plaintiff because the defendant's second special defense was viable. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A review of the record reveals the following facts. On April 18, 2008, the parties\n   executed a revolving term\n   promissory note (note) in which the defendant promised to repay the plaintiff $500,000 with interest. The note contained default and demand provisions. In a letter dated July 11, 2014, the plaintiff stated that the defendant was in default under the terms and conditions of the note and demanded payment in full on the outstanding balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 18, 2014, the plaintiff commenced the present action with a single count complaint to recover payment, alleging that the defendant had defaulted under the terms of the note. The return of service attests that the marshal left the writ, summons, complaint, affidavit, and direction for attachment at the defendant's usual place of abode in Fairfield (Fairfield property). On the same day, the marshal left two copies of those documents with the Secretary of the State and mailed a copy of them, via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the defendant's Naples, Florida residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 13, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which was denied by Judge Gilardi on January 20, 2015. On January 27, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted as to liability only, by Judge Radcliffe on March 7, 2016. After conducting a hearing in damages on June 7, 2016, Judge Stodolink rendered judgment for the plaintiff, ordering recovery against the defendant for $548,557.79 in damages. This appeal followed. On August 31, 2016, Judge Gilardi issued an articulation on the denial of the motion to dismiss. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction due to insufficient service of process. The defendant presents two arguments in support of his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, he asserts that although he owned the real property in Fairfield at which the abode service was made, the Fairfield property was not his usual place of abode. Second, he did not receive the certified mail containing the writ, summons, complaint, affidavit, and direction for attachment at his Florida residence. The plaintiff responds that service of process was properly effectuated by service over a nonresident individual pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and by abode service pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-57(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \"A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... The motion to dismiss ... admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that\n   alone....

The marshal's affidavit states that service was\n   made upon the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 52-59b(c) on September 18, 2014, by leaving two true and attested copies of the process with the Secretary of the State and sending, via certified mail, return receipt requested, a true and attested copy of the process to the defendant's Florida address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is all that \u00a7 52-59b(c) requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nonetheless, the marshal's supplemental return included a certified mail return receipt from the delivery of the process to the defendant's Florida address. The return receipt contained a signature in the section designated for the addressee. The plaintiff also submitted a Florida property tax bill and a Florida property appraisal summary, both of which contained the defendant's name and the same Florida address. Additionally, the plaintiff's demand letter dated July 11, 2014, was sent, via certified mail, to this same Florida address, and confirmation of delivery was verified by a signed return receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his articulation, Judge Gilardi wrote, \"[t]he court finds it significant that aside from his two self-serving statements, the defendant did not submit a single affidavit or any documentary evidence in support of his claims not on the record.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the court stated, \"the plaintiff did submit competent and persuasive evidence ... in full compliance and satisfaction of the requirements of [ \u00a7 52-59b(c) ].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the court that\n   the plaintiff complied with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 52-59b(c) when the marshal left the Secretary of the State with two copies of the writ, summons, complaint, affidavit, and direction for attachment, and mailed a copy of those documents to the defendant's last known address in Florida.

The court noted in support of its conclusion that the defendant had not raised genuine issues of material fact concerning the elements of promissory estoppel or reliance, that the defendant had stopped making payments in 2011, that the settlement discussions held three years later in 2014 were \"merely a promise to negotiate, not a promise to do something concrete,\" and that \"there [was] no written document which indicate[d] that this note ever became part and parcel to any global or, perhaps more accurately, hemispheric settlement.\" In other words, the defendant had not satisfied his burden of establishing a genuine issue of material fact or that there was any disputed question of law concerning the application of promissory estoppel as set forth in his second special defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[I]t is not enough ... merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue ...
