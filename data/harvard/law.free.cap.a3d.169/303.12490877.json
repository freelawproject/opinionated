(act), provides the exclusive remedy for most workers injured in the course of their employment. This appeal arises out of an action by the plaintiff, Quintino DiNino, Jr., in which he alleges that his employer, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx) and his coworker, Ernest Hawkins, are liable for injuries that he suffered in a work related accident. The plaintiff appeals from the trial court's granting of two separate motions for summary judgment in favor of each defendant. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment because it erroneously concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding the applicability of two recognized exceptions to the exclusivity provision of the act. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party, reveals the following facts. At the time of the incident, the plaintiff was employed as a material handler by FedEx. During the course of the plaintiff's employment with FedEx, he was tasked with unloading heavy containers from the back of delivery trucks onto loading docks. The trucks were equipped with airlift roller conveyor systems meant to facilitate the transfer of the containers. The airlift roller conveyor systems made it impossible for the trucks to back up flush to the loading docks, which left a gap between the edge of the loading docks and the rear of the trucks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 18, 2011, the plaintiff was working at FedEx's loading dock in East Granby, when the last delivery truck of the night pulled into the loading dock. Hawkins, the driver of the truck in question, was returning from a trip during which he picked up materials. Hawkins parked the vehicle just short of the loading dock, leaving a larger than normal gap between the dock and the truck. The plaintiff noticed his supervisor spread his hands apart and shake his head upon noticing Hawkins' improper parking of the delivery truck, signaling that the gap was too large. The plaintiff, who was tasked with unloading that particular delivery truck, did not express concern regarding the size of the gap to any of his coworkers, and no steps were taken by the plaintiff's supervisor or Hawkins to reposition the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly thereafter, while moving a container off the truck, the plaintiff fell into the gap between the truck and the loading dock. The container subsequently rolled onto and crushed the plaintiff's right leg, fracturing his tibia and fibula. The plaintiff also suffered an extensive degloving of the soft tissue in his lower right leg, requiring skin flap replacement and skin grafting. The plaintiff subsequently received workers' compensation benefits under the act for his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff commenced the present action on April 8, 2013. The operative complaint contained two counts. In the first count, the plaintiff alleged that FedEx had been \"warned of the significant safety hazard presented by the open gaps/spaces by its own agents, servants, and/or employees,\" but nevertheless \"consciously and deliberately chose not to utilize dock boards, dock plates, dock levelers or any other appropriate safety devices to eliminate the significant safety hazard presented by the open gaps/spaces between the truck trailers and the loading dock.\" The plaintiff also alleged that FedEx's failure to follow proper safety guidelines\n   constituted a violation of the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.22 (c), and that FedEx's \"actions and/or omissions created a substantial certainty that the plaintiff would be injured ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the second count, the plaintiff alleged that Hawkins \"failed to properly position his truck in the loading dock by stopping the truck too far away from the edge of the loading dock and thereby leaving an unsafe space or gap between the rear of the truck and the loading dock ....\" The plaintiff also alleged that Hawkins \"failed to warn the material handlers, including the plaintiff, that he had stopped the truck farther away from the loading dock than was normal\" and that the plaintiff's injuries were a direct and proximate result of defendant Hawkins' negligent operation of the delivery truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 18, 2015, FedEx filed a motion for summary judgment and accompanying memorandum of law, in which it asserted, inter alia, that it is immune from liability pursuant to the exclusivity provision of the act. FedEx also denied that it intentionally had created a dangerous condition that made the plaintiff's injuries substantially certain to occur, which, if established by the plaintiff, would constitute an exception to the exclusivity provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 2, 2015, Hawkins filed a separate motion for summary judgment. In his accompanying memorandum of law, Hawkins asserted that the plaintiff's claims against him were similarly barred by the exclusivity provision of the act and, further, that the plaintiff's injuries did not arise out of Hawkins' negligent operation of a motor vehicle so as to fall within the recognized motor vehicle exception to the exclusivity provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff filed an objection and accompanying memorandum of law in response to FedEx's motion for\n   summary judgment, in which he argued that his injuries were a \"substantially certain result\" of FedEx's various \"bad choices\" regarding proper safety procedure, and, therefore, fell within a recognized exception to the exclusivity provision. The plaintiff also filed an objection and accompanying memorandum of law in response to Hawkins' motion for summary judgment, arguing that Hawkins had been operating the delivery truck when the plaintiff was injured and, therefore, could be held liable for his negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 17, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Constance L. Epstein\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, heard oral argument on Hawkins' motion for summary judgment. The court issued a memorandum of decision on December 18,\n   2015, granting Hawkins' motion and holding, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by Hawkins' negligent operation of the delivery truck because the truck's ignition had been turned off and the truck remained immobile when the incident occurred. The court, therefore, concluded that the exclusivity provision barred the plaintiff's claim against Hawkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   FedEx's motion for summary judgment was heard on September 8, 2015. The court,\n   <em>\n    Peck, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision on December 30, 2015, granting summary judgment in favor of FedEx. The court concluded that the plaintiff had not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether FedEx had intentionally created unsafe working conditions that made the plaintiff's injuries substantially certain to occur. Specifically, the court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to provide evidence, other than conclusory statements, that he had fallen into the gap previously; witnessed any of his coworkers suffer an injury after falling in the gap; or complained to his supervisor that the width of the gap was unsafe. The\n   court further held that noncompliance with OSHA standards does not give rise to employer liability in Connecticut. Thus, the court held that the exclusivity provision barred the plaintiff's action against FedEx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiff filed the present appeal, challenging both trial court judgments. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin by identifying the applicable standard of review. \"The standards governing our review of a trial court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are well established. Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49 ] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law ... and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.... A material fact ... [is] a fact which will make a difference in the result of the case.... Finally, the scope of our review of the trial court's decision to grant the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    DiPietro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Farmington Sports Arena, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20107\">\n    306 Conn. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115-16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20951\">\n    49 A.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to the act, a party injured in the course of his employment is entitled to benefits and compensation regardless of fault, and such compensation shall be the exclusive remedy of the injured employee, with no civil\n   action available against an employer. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284. General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a further provides that no civil action may be brought against an allegedly negligent coworker, by extension. These are commonly referred to as the exclusivity provisions of the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The rationale underlying the exclusivity provision is as follows: \"The purpose of the [act] ... is to provide compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, regardless of fault.... Under the statute, the employee surrenders his right to bring a common law action against the employer, thereby limiting the employer's liability to the statutory amount.... In return, the employee is compensated for his or her losses without\n   having to prove liability.... In a word, these statutes compromise an employee's right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for\n   <em>\n    relatively quick\n   </em>\n   and certain compensation.... The intention of the framers of the act was to establish\n   <em>\n    a speedy\n   </em>\n   , effective and inexpensive method for determining claims for compensation.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yale University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546891\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/252/641/#p672\">\n    252 Conn. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=748%20A.2d%20834\">\n    748 A.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There are, however, certain exceptions to the exclusivity provision. Two, in particular, are at issue in this case. The first is a statutory exception set out in \u00a7 31-293a, commonly referred to as the \"motor vehicle exception.\" Specifically, \u00a7 31-293a allows an injured employee to bring an action against a coworker if the action is \"based on the fellow employee's negligence in the\n   <em>\n    operation\n   </em>\n   of a motor vehicle as defined in section 14-1.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second exception at issue in this case is the \"substantial certainty\" exception.

Having set out the two relevant exceptions to the exclusivity provision, we now turn to the plaintiff's specific claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiff's first claim on appeal is that the court improperly determined, as a matter of law, that the motor vehicle exception to the exclusivity provision of the act did not apply and that the plaintiff's action against Hawkins, therefore, was barred. In support of his claim, the plaintiff argues that Hawkins' improper parking of the vehicle raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the plaintiff's injuries were based on Hawkins' negligent operation of the delivery truck. Hawkins maintains that he was not operating the truck within the meaning of \u00a7 31-293a, because the truck was in park and remained immobile during the incident. We agree with Hawkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The term \"operation\" is not defined by the act. Thus, we must turn to relevant precedent for guidance. Our courts have interpreted the meaning of \"operation\" in the context of the act, as well as with respect to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. We begin by addressing the case law analyzing the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Davey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pepperidge Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1951389\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/180/469/\">\n    180 Conn. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=429%20A.2d%20943\">\n    429 A.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), our Supreme Court stated, in addressing the motor vehicle exception, that \"[w]hile it is true that 'operation' is not defined in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the cases clearly indicate that operation as it refers to a motor vehicle relates to the driving or movement of the vehicle itself or a circumstance resulting from the movement of the vehicle.\" (Footnote added.)

In all four cases, the vehicle in question was immobile when the accident occurred. Here, the delivery truck was parked for minutes before the plaintiff began unloading it, and it remained parked during the unloading process. Furthermore, unlike the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Kegel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kiriaka\n   </em>\n   , Hawkins exited the vehicle before the accident occurred, making him even more removed from its operation.

In\n   <em>\n    Allison I\n   </em>\n   , the defendant temporarily parked his vehicle in the middle of his designated route. In the present case, Hawkins parked the delivery truck at the\n   <em>\n    conclusion\n   </em>\n   of his run. Furthermore, Hawkins did not park the truck in a convenient or ordinary place to park, such as a parking lot-he parked it at a loading dock. Finally, as Hawkins correctly points out, the truck was not performing the function of an ordinary motor vehicle while it was parked at the loading dock. Rather, it was serving as a storage facility for the containers that needed to be unloaded. The function that the vehicle is serving at the time of the injury is significant, because this court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   that the state's trucks were not being operated within the meaning of the waiver to sovereign immunity while they were being used as warning devices. Here, the delivery truck was similarly not performing the function of an ordinary vehicle when the plaintiff's injury occurred.\n   The plaintiff therefore has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether his injury was based on Hawkins' negligent operation of the delivery truck. Neither line of cases interpreting the meaning of \"operation\" counsels us to adopt the exceedingly broad definition that the plaintiff suggests. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the trial court granting Hawkins' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiff's second claim on appeal is that the court improperly granted FedEx's motion for summary judgment by concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether FedEx had intentionally created a dangerous working condition that made the plaintiff's injuries substantially certain to occur. The plaintiff makes a number of arguments in support of his claim, including that the cargo unloading process was inherently dangerous. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the dock upon which he was working, dock six, was unsafe. The plaintiff further argues that FedEx knowingly and deliberately subjected him to these dangerous and unsafe conditions, as evidenced by deposition testimony of the plaintiff's coworkers that the plaintiff believes tends to show that other FedEx employees had been injured by falling into the gap between the loading dock and the back of the delivery truck. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In support of his argument that the working conditions were inherently unsafe or dangerous, the plaintiff cites the differences between dock six and other loading docks in the facility. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that dock six was inherently dangerous because, unlike some of the other docks, dock six did not have an \"extension bar,\" the purpose of which is to bridge the gap between the dock and the back of the truck. Without\n   an extension bar, the dock's edge consisted of rollers, rather than stable flooring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiff submitted an affidavit from his expert witness in opposition to FedEx's motion for summary judgment, in which his expert opined that the configuration of dock six was unsafe in three ways: \"First, it did not allow for a truck to be backed up flush against the leading edge of the loading dock, as that would result in contact and binding of the horizontal steel rollers at the leading edge of the dock. ... Second, it eliminates a safe walking surface area that workers can step on while transitioning from the rear of the truck to the loading dock, and replaces that safe walking surface area with a steel roller that cannot be stepped upon safely as that would actually cause the worker's foot to be spun back into the gap .... And finally, it greatly increases the danger zone that\n   workers must negotiate while transitioning from the rear of the truck onto the loading dock ....\" The plaintiff's expert further concluded that FedEx must have modified or removed the dock extension bar from dock six, as the dock did not appear to conform to the original manufacturer's design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The plaintiff also cites deposition testimony of his coworkers regarding other workplace injuries in support of his argument that FedEx knew that the cargo unloading process was inherently dangerous. The plaintiff cites the deposition of coworker LeAnne Theilman, who testified that another coworker, Kathy Welch, stepped on a roller and fell \"luckily on the deck, not down in between,\" because had she fallen in the gap, \"she would have been killed.\" That incident, however, occurred while Welch was pulling a can off a dolly on the deck-not as a result of her falling into a gap between an unloading dock and a delivery truck. The plaintiff also cites the testimony of FedEx employee\n   Michael Smith, who stated that he once saw a coworker's foot slip and go into the gap. There was no testimony that she was injured in this incident. The plaintiff also references testimony of coworker Kevin Kelley, who said that his supervisor told him of another incident involving a FedEx employee's foot falling into the gap. Kelley could also not recall whether his supervisor told him that the employee had been injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Since\n   <em>\n    Suarez I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Suarez II\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court has clarified the limited scope of the substantial certainty exception.

Having established the limited scope of the substantial certainty standard, we now turn to the plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The plaintiff's recounting of his coworkers' deposition testimony fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether FedEx believed the plaintiff's injury was substantially certain to occur. The plaintiff has offered no facts that would tend to demonstrate that other FedEx employees had been injured in a similar manner at dock six. In fact, the plaintiff does not cite, nor did any of his coworkers testify to, even one other incident in which a FedEx employee was actually\n   <em>\n    injured\n   </em>\n   after falling into the gap between the loading dock and delivery truck. Only two of the three above-mentioned incidents involved an employee slipping into the gap between a loading dock and delivery truck specifically, and in at least one of those instances, the employee was left unharmed. The third incident, referenced by Kelley, also fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact, because Kelley did not know whether the employee in question was injured. Thus, the plaintiff has not proffered any evidence that suggests that FedEx knew of any prior injuries occurring as a result of the gap at dock six, and certainly not with such frequency that it raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether FedEx knew that the plaintiff's injury was substantially certain to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Furthermore, the plaintiff has not offered any evidence that tends to show that FedEx was aware of the potential hazard created by the gap between the truck and the loading dock on the night of the accident. Neither the plaintiff nor his coworker voiced any concerns to their supervisor, Michael Smith, regarding the gap, even though the plaintiff maintains that the gap was much larger than normal. Moreover, the plaintiff did not ask Hawkins to reposition the truck, although he had seen drivers do so in the past. Such facts, therefore, tend to demonstrate that neither the plaintiff nor FedEx understood that it was substantially certain that the plaintiff would be injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Additionally, the plaintiff's argument that FedEx purposely removed from dock six a factory designed safety feature-specifically, an extension bar that bridges the gap between the loading dock and the back of the delivery truck-similarly fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether FedEx believed the plaintiff's injury was substantially certain to occur. The plaintiff and his expert, a mechanical engineer named Brian O'Donel, concluded that FedEx must have modified dock six, because it appeared to the plaintiff's expert that the dock differed from the manufacturer's design. Even if we were to accept the plaintiff's conclusion that FedEx purposely eliminated certain safety precautions, however, this court held in\n   <em>\n    Morocco\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2219111\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/72/516/#p527\">\n    72 Conn.App. at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=805%20A.2d%20168\">\n    805 A.2d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   that \"\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   , wilful or reckless\" safety violations by the employer do not rise to the level of intent required under the substantial certainty standard.

In fact, our Supreme Court has expressly declined to apply the substantial certainty exception to cases in which the plaintiff alleges its employer violated OSHA safety standards.\n   <em>\n    Mingachos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    CBS, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"692450\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/196/91/#p100\">\n    196 Conn. at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=491%20A.2d%20368\">\n    491 A.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Our conclusion is buttressed by decisions of this court in cases raising similar claims.

The larger than normal gap complained of by the plaintiff is, therefore, more analogous to the onetime malfunctioning machine at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sorban\n   </em>\n   than a \"regularly occurring dangerous condition\" as characterized by the plaintiff.

In light of the development of the law since\n    <em>\n     Kegel\n    </em>\n    , however, it is clear to us that the plaintiff in the present case has failed to raise a genuine issue of fact concerning whether defendant Hawkins was operating a motor vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 31-293a.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Kegel involved General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 31-293a.
