We are not persuaded by the defendant's claims on appeal and, thus, affirm the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. During the early morning hours of November 12,\n   2011, the defendant, who recently had been released from prison, attended an after-hours party at a club in New London with friends, including Davion Smith. During the party, the defendant was involved in an altercation outside the club with other attendees of the party, including Todd Silva. During the fight, the defendant suffered a laceration on his finger, a black eye, and other scratches and abrasions on his face. Following the fight, the defendant was angry and in a highly agitated state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sometime around 4 a.m. that same day, the defendant and Smith forced entry into a third floor apartment at 252 Montauk Avenue in New London, where the victim, Jorge Rosa, lived. The victim also was known by his nickname \"Loc\" or \"Loke.\" At that time, Silva lived in the apartment with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Inside the apartment, the victim and his girlfriend, Gabriela Gonzales, were sleeping in his bed. The defendant and Gonzales\n   previously had been in a romantic relationship that began in high school, but that relationship had ended when Gonzales obtained a restraining order against the defendant, who shortly thereafter went to prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gonzales awoke to find the defendant and Smith standing at the foot of her bed, each pointing a gun at the victim. The defendant asked who \"Loke\" is. The defendant then fired ten shots from an automatic pistol at the victim, who died within a few minutes from numerous gunshot wounds, including several to his chest, arms, and genitalia. The defendant and Smith subsequently fled the apartment. The defendant's blood, from his lacerated finger, and DNA were subsequently found in the stairwell leading up to the victim's apartment and in various rooms inside the apartment, including the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gonzales called 911, and the police arrived a few minutes later. Although Gonzales initially stated to the police in the 911 call and at the scene that she did not know the identity of the shooter, within a short period of time and while still at the scene, she stated that the defendant had shot the victim and that Smith had accompanied him. She also described the defendant's automobile, a white \"Crown Vic,\" to assist the police in locating him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At approximately 4:45 a.m., the defendant picked up his girlfriend, Shanice Sebastian, and told her that they were going to stay in a motel. The defendant and Sebastian then checked into the Days Inn in Old Saybrook, despite the existence of numerous motels closer to their location in New London. While at the Days Inn, the defendant admitted to Sebastian that he had been looking for the kid that \"jumped him,\" that he had gone to the apartment of Gonzales' boyfriend and shot somebody, and that he had been with \"his boy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At approximately 9:30 a.m., a patrolman employed by the Old Saybrook Police Department observed the defendant's vehicle at the Days Inn. Other police units responded and located the defendant, who then attempted to flee. He was apprehended in the parking lot with the assistance of a K-9 officer. The defendant was still bleeding from his finger at the time of his arrest. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary to discuss the specific claims of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant subsequently was tried before a jury and elected to testify at trial. He denied shooting the victim but admitted that he had been in the victim's apartment with Smith and another individual, Zach Perkins, just prior to the time of the shooting in order to resolve amicably his dispute with Silva.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant\n   testified that he left the apartment after being told that Silva was not there. Defense counsel argued to the jury that Gonzales had framed the defendant for the victim's murder, which actually had been committed by Perkins, who, after the shooting, had a sexual relationship with Gonzales and fathered a child with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As previously discussed, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder, home invasion, and other charges; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and the court found the defendant guilty of the gun possession charge. The jury found the defendant not guilty of murder. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly overruled his objection to the\n   state's use of a peremptory challenge to strike an African-American prospective juror. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following facts are relevant to this claim. The defendant is of mixed race. On the first day of jury selection, defense counsel noted that the entire venire panel appeared to be \"white Caucasian\" and that every prospective juror who had completed a jury questionnaire had indicated that they were either white or Caucasian, or had not indicated a race or ethnicity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the second day of jury selection, only one prospective juror had indicated on the questionnaire that he or she was African-American. During the voir dire examination of one venireperson, W.T., he stated to defense counsel that he was African-American. W.T. indicated that he had obtained a master's degree in social work from the University of Connecticut and currently was employed by the state of Connecticut as a supervisory social worker with the Department of Children and Families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   He also disclosed that he performed volunteer work for the Department of Correction and had worked directly with inmates. When asked by defense counsel whether that work might affect him as a juror, W.T. responded: \"Because I work with, like I say, inmates, and also my work, I do-I mean, you see a lot of different things and you see a lot of sad situations. I'm sure as a professional and because I work with people who've been through a lot of stuff, you know, I'm sure I have an understanding of what they're doing. And also, just-just in the criminal justice system in general, I know how sometimes people are not, you know, given a fair trial or they may be disproportionately have to go to jail and different things of that nature. So, part of my whole experience is as an African-American, as an American and also studying these situations, I know that there's a lot of issues go on in various systems. The criminal justice system, the educational system and various systems, but people are not fairly treated, so I know that much. But I don't use that, you know, I can-I could make a professional-and I think keep my composure and do my job just like-as a professional, as I work-even as I do volunteer work, but you have to know the reality in life as well, though.\" In response to a subsequent question by defense counsel regarding whether, in light of his life experiences, he could be fair to both sides in the case, W.T. stated that he could.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the state's voir dire examination of W.T., the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Now, you've obviously had a little more dealing with the court systems than most-most people that we see in through here. Have you formulated any opinions about the criminal justice system based on your experiences? Is it too lenient, too stringent, it works, it doesn't work; any feeling about that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[W.T.]: And like I said, probably already share too much stuff about-that talk about in terms of I have seen people, have had family members had went to prison before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[W.T.]: And I just think-I think that's why I became a social worker, because I wanted to make a difference, and that's why I have been doing mentoring programs-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Yep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[W.T.]: -try to help young people so they won't get into trouble. So, I meant the system, all various systems, there's a lot of discrimination still goes out. Even today, ladies are still not getting equal pay. So, it's a lot. We've come a long way, but we have a long way to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[W.T.]: But I think I can make-I could keep the facts and be able to look at the facts of the case and judge by the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: ... We need to know how you're feeling, so we can make the appropriate assessment and you can make the appropriate assessment.... I think that it's not a perfect system, but it's improving every day, and [there are] not as many systems that I can think of that are, any-come anywhere close. One of the concerns that people may have is, jurors who are in the-using their time as a juror to try to fix the system. You indicated, and I think you said, that you would listen to the evidence and decide it on the evidence and you wouldn't let any concerns that you had filter in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[W.T.]: That's correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Fair to say?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[W.T.]: That's correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. And so, that you would sit and listen to what all the evidence is and make a decision based on the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[W.T.]: That's correct.....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. With respect to that, as much as you know about those situations, were you satisfied with the way the police reacted to your family being or friend being the victim of a crime?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Sometimes and sometimes not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[W.T.]: So-so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Fair to say that it's an individual situation and that the police have been-have acted in a way that was satisfactory toward your family members or friends, and in other situations they weren't satisfied with what the police did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[W.T.]: That's correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Had you had any interactions with the police in any respect in which you developed an-either a strong, favorable impression or an unfavorable impression about the police and the way they treated you in any situation, speeding tickets, calling up to complain about any noisy neighbor, something with work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[W.T.]: I'm, like-just growing up in this society, I fear, you know, I fear my life. I got a new car, I feared that, you know, I might get stopped, you know, for being black, you know. So, you know, that's concerning and sometimes I get afraid-even me, you know, I-when I see the police in back of me, I wonder, you know, if I'm going to be stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Now with-with respect to that, there will probably be police officers who will be\n   testifying here, and the judge will tell you that [you] can't give a police officer more credibility merely because they are a police officer. Conversely, though, they don't get less credibility merely became they are police officers. They are to be treated like anybody else. Would you have any difficulty following the judge's instructions concerning that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"[W.T.]: No, I wouldn't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. And I can appreciate what you're saying. Obviously, I haven't been in that-in your shoes. I haven't been in your situation, nor do we ask the jury to put themselves in the shoes of either the police or a particular defendant. We can't ask you to do that. But having now life's experience, is that something that you think you can put aside and decide the evidence based on everything that's presented to you, or is there some concern that you might have that you might not be able to do that.\" [W.T.]: No, I will be able to because another thing, too,\n   is, I know good police officers who are-who are good people, nice people, mentors who work in the community. So-so, yes, I'd be able to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Okay. And have you had the positive experiences with the police as well?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. So, I guess like anybody else, there are bad lawyers and there are good lawyers. There are bad social workers, there are good social workers.... But what I'm driving at is, we make an individual assessment based on what we hear and what we see and what we listen to. And that is what we're going to ask you to do if you're a juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: We want to make sure you don't carry in any preconceived notions one way or the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: No problems with that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[W.T.]: No problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. We can count on your word on that, then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"[W.T.]: That's right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. I asked about being the victim of a crime and your family member. The flip side to that, have you, any member of your family or any close personal friends ever been either accused or ever convicted of crimes?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Yes. I have family members who've been in-who served time in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. This obviously is a crime of violence. Any-any family members who have been convicted of crimes of violence?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[W.T.]: No....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: You mentioned that your family members have-have served time. With respect to that, were-did you develop any feelings about the way the police had treated your family members in those situations?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Well, I think the-like I told you earlier, my life experiences living in this world-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"[W.T.]: -you see that things are not fair. And then you-I mean, you-you experience things, you know, and you see things happen. And some things are not fair, some things not-not all people are the same, all police are not bad or, like, you know, just like you said everybody, but when you see firsthand your own family\n   members, then you experience something a little bit different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Of course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Other people who, you know, so-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Of course. And I guess it's kind of tough, because I-you know, I could ask you questions all day long and I'm not going to get to know you as well you know yourself. But there's a difference, I think, between I'm upset that my family member had to go through this versus I'm upset that the police treated my family member in such a way. Do you understand the distinction I'm trying to make, that you're not satisfied that your family member ended up in prison versus I'm not satisfied that they were treated properly by either the court system or by the police. There's a difference, and I'm not sure I'm explaining it very well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"[W.T.]: Are you saying more, like, for instance, like, someone may have gone to jail because they did something wrong-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"[W.T.]: -and they had to pay the consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Right. And you know, like that, but-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"[W.T.]: So-exactly. You have to-even if it's your family member or not, you did something wrong, you need to pay the consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"[W.T.]: You need to pay the consequences for whatever you've done wrong, you know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Following the voir dire examination, defense counsel stated that W.T. was acceptable to the defendant. The\n   state, however, exercised a peremptory challenge and asked that W.T. be excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The defendant immediately raised a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   objection to the state's use of a peremptory challenge, citing the fact that W.T. was the first African-American venireperson to be examined and that, in essence, W.T. had assured the court and the state that, regardless of his views about the criminal justice system or the police, he could be a fair and impartial juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The state then responded: \"I understand exactly where [defense counsel] is coming from, would agree with him for the most part with the exception of, I do believe that there are race neutral reasons for this. It was somewhat of a struggle for me, but I looked at some of the answers. And even though he responded favorably after further questioning, the concerns that I did have was the-the comments that-about disproportionate amount of people being sent to jail, disproportionate amount of jail time, the fact that he's had family members who have been convicted and have served time, the fact that he works to rehabilitate people. And none of this is per se bad, but I think in the context of this particular case, it's important, it's race neutral. If we had a Caucasian who was in the same situation, the exercising of a peremptory challenge would be the same, I think.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"Additionally, the fact that he did mention ... his concern about and his life's experience about driving and seeing a police officer behind him and his concern about police officers. Yes, he said that there are other police officers who are good and people can be good, but there is that life's experience that I would submit would make it difficult for him to be fair and impartial in this particular-in this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"Again, I understand exactly what [defense counsel] is saying. I believe that they are race neutral reasons, and I was exercising the peremptory based on those race neutral reasons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court then asked for argument from the defendant, and defense counsel gave the following response: \"With respect to being, as an African-American male, fearful when the police are behind you, I mean, that's just, you know, something that [the prosecutor] and I never have had to deal with it, but if this gentleman sitting next [to] me is entitled to a jury of his peers, we've picked three white people already. We've accepted them. I mean, isn't he-and that's a common complaint by African-American people, that they feel that they get pulled over too often, and there are probably studies that say it's disproportionate. So, that particular reason does seem to me to be race based .... It was [W.T.]'s view and, I mean, again, that's-he's entitled to a jury of his peers, and we get nobody who feels that way or has those thoughts is not really his peers because that's probably the experience or experiences\n   of a lot of African-Americans go through.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The prosecutor, when asked if he wanted to argue further, stated: \"Only briefly, and maybe it's a matter of semantics. I think\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   's is, oh, I see an African-American gentleman, I see an Asian-American, I see a Hispanic, I'm going to excuse them. If an African-American comes in with a distrust of the police and will not listen to a police officer and says he will not listen to a police officer, that isn't a challenge based on that person's race or ethnicity; it's a challenge based on that person's personal views.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"If a white-a Caucasian person came in and said, I don't like being followed by the cops because I see a number of cops punch friends of mine in the face, it's not because he is a Caucasian, it's because of life's\n   experiences. And I think that's what I would be arguing, that the comments that were made were not because of his ethnicity or his race, but rather his-his expressed opinions. And I think it's a distinction, I think it's a legitimate distinction, but I defer to Your Honor with respect to this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   After argument by counsel, the court orally denied the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, stating: \"I do think that in both situations it's an issue with regard to negative contact with the police and that, I believe, has been found to be a legitimate race neutral reason for exercising the peremptory challenge. So, under all the circumstances, I am going to find that the state has given a race neutral reason for exercising a peremptory challenge in this case. And I'm going to overrule the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge.\" Throughout the remainder of the voir dire process, the state asked a uniform set of questions of all jurors. Furthermore, three African-American jurors were selected to serve in this case-two as regular jurors and one as an alternate juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Following the filing of this appeal, the defendant filed with this court a motion for articulation, which was referred to the trial court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. The trial court granted the motion and in a memorandum concluded that all of the reasons set forth by the state in exercising its peremptory challenge were race neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge to the state's use of its peremptory challenge with respect to W.T. because the state's reasons were not race neutral. We are not persuaded by the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20465\">\n    314 Conn. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20A.3d%2052\">\n    102 A.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), recently reviewed Connecticut's jury selection process and the contours of\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenges to the state's use of its peremptory\n   challenges: \"Voir dire plays a critical function in assuring the criminal defendant that his [or her] [s]ixth [a]mendment right to an impartial jury will be honored.... Part of the guarantee of a defendant's right to an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify unqualified jurors....

Although the ultimate determination of whether a discriminatory intent was the basis for exercising a peremptory strike depends on \" 'an aggregate assessment of all the circumstances' \";\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hodge\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519920\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/248/207/#p231\">\n    248 Conn. at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20A.2d%20531\">\n    726 A.2d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; it is significant that, in the present case, all of the\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   factors support the court's conclusion that the state properly exercised\n   its right to use a peremptory challenge with regard to W.T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   First, the state's reasons for excluding W.T. were his stated distrust of police and the criminal justice system, which clearly related to the trial of this case because it is a criminal proceeding in which police would provide significant evidence. Second, the state did not exercise its peremptory challenge without questioning W.T., but rather engaged in a detailed discussion with W.T. about the views he had expressed in response to defense counsel's questions. Third, the defendant concedes, and our review of the record confirms, that the state asked a relatively uniform set of questions of all jurors. Accordingly, W.T. and the other African-American venirepersons were not asked questions that were not asked of other jurors or that sought to elicit a particular response. Fourth, we are unaware of any venireperson of a race different from W.T.'s, who expressed the same or similar views regarding police and the criminal justice system as those of W.T., but, nevertheless, was permitted to serve on the defendant's jury. Fifth, the state did not advance any explanation that was based on an inapplicable group trait. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the state did not use a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude African-Americans from the jury. In fact, as the defendant acknowledges, three African-Americans were selected to serve, two as regular jurors and one as an alternate. Although the racial composition of an empaneled jury certainly is not dispositive of the issue of impermissible motive for use of a peremptory strike as to a particular juror, it is among the various factors that a reviewing court can consider in evaluating whether the explanation for exercising a peremptory challenge is pretextual and, thus, constitutionally infirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hinton\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710451\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/227/301/#p327\">\n    227 Conn. at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=630%20A.2d%20593\">\n    630 A.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The primary argument advanced by the defendant in support of his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim is that distrust of the criminal justice system and fear of being stopped by police is \"a real fear among probably the majority of the African-American people\" and that if the court were to accept the expression of such concerns as a racially neutral ground for excluding venirepersons, this reason could be used as a pretext to challenge a large proportion of African-American venirepersons. The defendant urges this court to modify the holding in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   that a venireperson's expressed fear of police is a race neutral ground for exercising a peremptory challenge.

We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The following additional facts, which the jury reasonably could have found on the basis of the evidence presented, and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Detective Matthew Galante of the New London Police Department was among the\n   officers who responded to the Days Inn after learning that the defendant's vehicle had been located there. Galante arrived at about the time the defendant was being apprehended in the parking lot and placed into custody. As he approached the defendant in the parking lot, Galante noticed a female, whom he later learned was the defendant's girlfriend, Sebastian, sitting nearby with another police officer. The defendant, who recognized Galante from prior dealings, asked, \"what was up, what was going on with his ... shorty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Galante first responded by advising the defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and asking the defendant if he understood those rights, to which the defendant responded in the affirmative. Galante then asked the defendant what he was asking about his girlfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The defendant told Galante that Sebastian had had nothing to do with whatever had transpired in New London. When Galante asked what he was referring to, the defendant said he didn't know, but also volunteered that, whatever was going on in New London, he also had nothing to do with it. Shortly thereafter, the defendant asked if he could sit in his vehicle because he was cold. Galante told the defendant that the vehicle was part of an active crime scene. The defendant then stated that the police were not going to find a gun in the car, so he should be allowed to wait in there. Eventually, a police cruiser was dispatched\n   to take the defendant to the New London police headquarters. Prior to transportation, Galante advised the defendant that his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights still applied and that Galante would speak with the defendant when Galante returned to headquarters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf. According to his direct testimony, he admitted to\n   attending an after-hours party on the night of November 11, 2012. He explained that, at about 4 a.m., he had attempted to break up an altercation and \"got jumped.\" He was beaten up \"pretty badly,\" cut his finger, and was bleeding as a result. He asked his friends to take him to a hospital. He got into his car with Simmons and two other persons, Perkins and Smith. Simmons was driving. On the way to the hospital, the car made a stop at 252 Montauk Avenue. The defendant was told that Silva wanted to discuss the earlier altercation to explain that it was a mistake. The defendant claims that Perkins entered the apartment first and that he and Smith followed. Simmons stayed with the car. The defendant, Perkins and Smith made their way toward the back of the apartment looking for Silva. When the defendant asked where Silva was, he was \"[s]hooed out of the room.\" He went back outside and waited for Simmons, who had apparently left on an errand, to return with his car. When Perkins and Smith returned outside, they got into the car and the defendant told them that \"they got to get out. Enough is enough. I'm tired of running around.\" The defendant never went to a hospital, but instead called Sebastian, picked her up, and went to the Days Inn in Old Saybrook, where he eventually was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   On cross-examination by the state, the defendant acknowledged that he had listened to all of the other witnesses testify at trial and, in particular, heard the testimony that his blood was found throughout the apartment at 252 Montauk Avenue. He also acknowledged that this was the first time he had \"told anybody about this story about ... Perkins going in there ....\" He admitted that he had spoken with Galante at the Days Inn after he was given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and that he was familiar with Galante from \"prior dealings\" with him. The prosecutor asked the defendant: \"And at that point in time, you didn't tell Detective\n   Galante what you've told us here today after you've listened to all this evidence, have you?\" Defense counsel objected to the question, arguing that it came close to violating the defendant's right to remain silent. The prosecutor stated that he believed his question was proper cross-examination because it went to the credibility of the defendant's direct testimony, but that he would try to further focus his inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The prosecutor then elicited from the defendant that he had never told Galante about getting into a fight earlier in the evening, about going to 252 Montauk Avenue, or anything about Perkins' involvement in the events of that night. Defense counsel renewed his objection. Because cross-examination of the defendant had started near the end of the day, the court dismissed the jury and inquired whether counsel would like to be heard on the objection before the court adjourned for the day. Defense counsel indicated that he would like the state to cite the case that allows this type of questioning. The parties agreed to confer on that issue and suggested that the court could resume hearing argument the following morning. In the morning, however, defense counsel indicated to the court that after consulting with the prosecutor about the scope of the questions, he now \"understood his basis\" and was withdrawing his objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Cross-examination of the defendant resumed, and upon inquiry, the defendant recounted his asking Galante why Sebastian was being arrested because she had nothing to do with what was going on. He also acknowledged that he never mentioned that he had been \"jumped\" at the after-hours party or that he had been inside 252 Montauk Avenue with Perkins and Smith. Defense counsel did not object to this line of questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Despite defense counsel's expressly having raised a\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   objection at trial that he subsequently abandoned,\n   the defendant argues that he is entitled to review of his resurrected\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   claim on appeal pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As established in\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , and later modified in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), \"a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant in this case voluntarily spoke to Galante after he was in custody and after being advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. By his own admission, he did not invoke his right to remain silent until after he was transported to the police department. He chose to speak to Galante about the fact that neither he nor Sebastian had anything to do with what happened in New London and that there was no gun in his vehicle. He nevertheless admitted during cross-examination that he never told Galante that he had been in a fight in New London or that he had gone into 252 Montauk Avenue with Smith or Perkins, both facts that he testified to at trial. Rather than impermissibly attempting to impeach the defendant with his choice to remain silent after being informed of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, the state's cross-examination focused on why, having chosen to speak with Galante, the defendant never provided the same exculpatory details that he\n   later testified to at trial. We conclude that the state properly inquired about the defendant's prior inconsistent statement to Galante; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730672\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/748/#p764\">\n    283 Conn. at 764-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20198\">\n    931 A.2d 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and that the inquiry did not violate the rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   .

Especially with the recent rash of police shootings of minority populations, the defendant would urge this court to modify [the] holding in\n    <em>\n     King\n    </em>\n    concerning being afraid of the police as a nonrace neutral reason.

Although the defendant did not offer any evidence at trial regarding these facts, our review of studies conducted by reputable research firms strongly supports this understanding. For example, in a 2016 study of 4538 United States adults conducted by the Pew Research Center, \"[o]nly about a third of blacks but roughly three-quarters of whites say police in their communities do an excellent or good job in using the appropriate force on suspects, treating all racial and ethnic minorities equally and holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs.\" R.

A 2016 study that aggregated multiple Gallup polls yielded similar evidence: \"Fifty-eight percent of whites have confidence in the police, compared with 29% of blacks.\" F. Newport, Gallup, \"Public Opinion Context: Americans, Race and Police,\" (July 8, 2016), p. 1, available at http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/193586/public-opinion-context-americans-race-police.aspx (last visited August 30, 2017) (copy contained in the file of this case in the Appellate Court clerk's office). In the same study, only 28 percent of blacks rate the honesty of police officers as very high or high compared with 60 percent of whites. Id., p. 3. Thus, permitting the use of peremptory challenges with respect to potential jurors who express negative views toward the police or the justice system may well result in a disproportionate exclusion of minorities from our juries, a deeply troubling result.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Moreover, we are also cognizant that \"[p]sychological studies suggest that people readily provide a nonracial explanation of their behavior even when race is actually influencing their decision.\" J.

I especially agree with the observations expressed in footnote 5 of the majority's opinion, including\n   the admonition that trial courts must be particularly diligent in assessing the use of peremptory challenges in cases in which the opportunity for pretextual use of such challenges is present. It is my view, however, that no amount of judicial diligence and over-sight can remedy a problem that has become embedded in the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   procedure itself unless that procedure is revised. I write separately because this case brings into sharp relief a serious flaw in the way\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   has been, and can be, applied.\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   is designed to prevent lawyers from peremptorily challenging prospective jurors for manifestly improper reasons based on race, national origin, and the like. It was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   designed to permit prosecutors-and other lawyers-to challenge members of suspect classes solely because they hold widely shared beliefs within the prospective juror's community that are based on life experiences. This flaw is in plain sight for all to see and must be remedied if the jury selection process is to attain the goal of producing juries representing all of the communities in our state\n   and gaining their confidence and trust. I believe a blatant flaw that significantly disadvantages black defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and people belonging to other suspect classes-has become part of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   process itself.

In light of all of his views considered together, not having been in the courtroom to personally observe W.T., and taking the prosecutor at his word, I am unable to conclude that the use of a peremptory challenge was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Acknowledging that there is a diversity of opinion within every community, however, W.T.'s views appear to me to be by no means radical or unreasonable. On the contrary, they appear to be logical, fact-based, and understandable in light of the troubling-to use a euphemism-history of relations between minority communities, on the one hand, and the police and criminal justice system, on the other. They are particularly understandable in light of the many shootings of young black men by police around the country in recent years. One need not share W.T.'s beliefs in every respect to believe them to be rational and widely held in his community. Yet, under\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   , W.T.'s understandable beliefs provide a basis for the proper use of a peremptory challenge given the way\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   is presently administered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Justice Marshall noted in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   that \"defendants cannot attack the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges at all unless the challenges are ... flagrant ....

First, the judge must make a factual finding that the race- or gender-neutral explanation proffered by the striking attorney at\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   's second step is not, in fact, the reason for the strike but is instead 'pretextual ....' In other words, the court must find that the attorney has made a misrepresentation to the court of a material fact-a serious breach of the attorney's ethical duty of candor. Second and relatedly, the judge must find that the attorney exercised a peremptory challenge based on race or gender and accordingly violated the juror's constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Indeed, considered together, a trial court ruling in favor of a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   movant constitutes a judicial determination that an attorney, in open court, engaged in a misrepresentation of a material fact to obscure a violation of the law-an action that, in other contexts, could warrant criminal prosecution. ... Given the implications of the findings required to establish a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation, it is understandable that in all but the most extreme cases, trial courts will err on the side of crediting the reason proffered for a strike.\" (Footnotes omitted.)

Put simply, judges are reluctant to find that a\n   prosecutor's stated reasons are based on conscious, or unconscious, racist beliefs or assumptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The problem presented by this case, then, must be viewed in the context of the generally ineffectual application of\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Where does that leave things? What is to be the fate of the hypothetical black prospective juror who testifies under oath that he can be fair to both the state and the defense, but also indicates that he has concerns because he has been stopped, for no apparent, valid reason, while driving? Or because members of his family have been jailed? What about the hypothetical female prospective juror, who is being questioned in a criminal sex assault case, who swears that she can be fair to the state and the defendant, but who has formed the opinion that police sometimes do not treat the victims of sexual assault with all the seriousness and dignity to\n   which they are entitled? Or the hypothetical Japanese-American prospective juror, in a civil case in which a federal employee is the plaintiff, who swears he or she could be fair to both sides, but who recounts his or her family's suffering at the hands of the federal government when subject to internment during World War II?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   There are two things fundamentally wrong with a system that permits someone with the rational and fact-based views of these hypothetical prospective jurors to be peremptorily challenged and excluded from jury service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   First, permitting someone with the stated beliefs of these hypothetical prospective jurors to be excluded from jury service is an affront to the community with which he or she identifies and undermines the claim of the jury selection system to be fairly representative of all segments of our diverse society. The reality is that permitting the use of peremptory challenges under these circumstances\n   <em>\n    effectively excludes a significant number of people belonging to suspect classes from jury service\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   , as it has evolved, permits the elimination of certain categories of prospective jurors whose views are reasonable and widely shared in their communities. The potential for the kind of categorical exclusion that\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   permits is simply unacceptable in a system that strives to treat everyone equally. It sends a troubling message to members of minority communities who should be encouraged-not discouraged-to actively engage in, and trust, the criminal justice system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Second, permitting a peremptory challenge to be used under these circumstances is an affront to the dignity of the individual prospective juror who is excluded for honestly voicing reasonable and widely held views. It minimizes or negates his or her life experience in an insulting and degrading way. It must be remembered that one of the rationales for\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   is that the inappropriate exclusion of prospective jurors deprives the\n   <em>\n    prospective juror\n   </em>\n   of his or her constitutional right to serve on a jury-a basic right of citizenship. See\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To prohibit a significant percentage of people belonging to a suspect class from serving on a jury because they express a reasonable, fact-based, and widely held view cannot be countenanced. As Justice Powell, writing for the court, stated in\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   , \"[s]election procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Moreover, if members of a suspect class are punished for honestly voicing their widely shared views; for example, they are concerned when they see a police car behind them when they are driving because they fear being stopped for no valid reason;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the present regime creates\n   an incentive for them to give dishonest or deceitful answers, rather than honest ones. This, in and of itself, undermines a fair jury selection system, which relies on prospective jurors honestly answering the questions put to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   It is true, of course, that peremptory challenges play an important function in our system because they permit lawyers to use their intuition in the very human\n   jury selection process. Lawyers should have the opportunity to look prospective jurors in the eye, size them up, and evaluate their answers. This is a time-honored and important practice. However, as Justice Marshall noted in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   , \"the right of peremptory challenge is not of constitutional magnitude, and may be withheld altogether without impairing the constitutional guarantee of impartial jury and fair trial.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    Id., at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the use of a peremptory challenge, in cases similar to the present one, has the potential to exclude categorically large swaths of people within a suspect class, the price the system pays for maintaining that practice is too high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   This problem cannot be solved simply by urging restraint upon the lawyers selecting a jury. Their job, after all, is to win their clients' cases by selecting a jury most likely to return a verdict in their favor. The player in the system with the responsibility for ensuring that prospective jurors belonging to suspect classes are properly treated so that the system is fair, and is perceived as fair, is the judge. Our judges are tasked with making many difficult and sensitive decisions in a wide variety of contexts. Our judges decide which parent a child should live with in highly contested divorce cases; and decide what sort of a sentence to mete out when serious violent crimes are committed; and decide whether and how much punitive damages should be awarded in bitter business disputes. And judges already determine whether a prospective juror should be excused for cause. Our judges can be trusted to administer the jury selection process so as to protect all of the important societal interests involved, not only those of the state and the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   I understand Connecticut's deep and long-standing attachment to the individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, I\n   suggest an alteration in the way\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   is administered in Connecticut to ameliorate the negative effects of the present regime. I would remove some of the discretion from the lawyers selecting a jury and reallocate it to the judge supervising the process. I believe the flaw illustrated by cases of this sort could be ameliorated substantially if judges are given the discretion to disallow the use of peremptory challenges in cases\n   in which: (1) the prospective juror is part of a suspect class; (2) the prospective juror gives an unequivocal assurance, under oath, that he or she can be fair to both sides; (3) the prospective juror expresses reasonable and fact-based views, which, in the opinion of the judge, following argument by the lawyers, are widely shared in the prospective juror's particular community; and (4) the judge concludes that the prospective juror can, in fact, be fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The application of this proposed test would tend to ensure that a peremptory challenge could not exclude the previously discussed hypothetical jurors. Suppose, however, that one of these prospective jurors testifies that he or she distrusts the criminal justice system because he or she heard someone on \"talk radio\" criticize it. In this instance, the judge would permit the exercise of a peremptory challenge because the prospective juror's views, in part, would not be reasonable and based on the potential juror's life experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   I acknowledge that this approach would deprive lawyers of some degree of discretion in their use of peremptory challenges and would transfer that discretion to the judge. But I believe this reallocation of discretion from lawyers picking juries, to judges supervising the process, is needed. As cases raising these issues illustrate, the price society pays by permitting prospective\n   jurors, like W.T., to be excluded is unacceptably high. The justice system has an obligation to do everything it can to encourage participation by all segments of society, particularly those who have grown understandably suspicious of that system. I can think of no better way to accomplish this than by trusting our judges to monitor this process, keeping well in mind the lamentable history of racial discrimination that has afflicted African-American communities and other people belonging to suspect classes. The\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   problem discussed here deserves study in the interest of ensuring that Connecticut juries are fairly composed of representatives from the many diverse groups that make up our great state.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kentucky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     476 U.S. 79\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     106 S.Ct. 1712\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     90 L.Ed.2d 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1986).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Many reported\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    cases arise from criminal cases in which the prospective juror struck was African-American, and the party exercising the challenge is a prosecutor.

He posits an example in which an Asian defendant is on trial for the murder of a white victim and the prospective jurors, all white, deny harboring racial prejudice. The defendant, however, continues to harbor a hunch, an assumption, or an intuitive judgment that these white prospective jurors will be unfair to him due to racial biases.
