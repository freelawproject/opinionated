Under the Connecticut constitution, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, are all juveniles entitled to a sentencing proceeding at which the court expressly considers the youth related factors required by the United States constitution for cases involving juveniles who have been sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release?

If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative and a sentencing court does not comply with the sentencing requirements under the Connecticut constitution, does parole eligibility under General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a (f) adequately remedy any state constitutional violation?\"</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
