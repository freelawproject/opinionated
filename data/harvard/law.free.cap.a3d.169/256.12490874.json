On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the court improperly held\n   that insufficient facts were presented to support a prima facie case for\n   disability discrimination. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, taken from the materials submitted in connection with the motion for summary judgment, are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a clerical assistant from 1987 to 2013. She has suffered from severe chronic asthma since birth. Throughout her employment with the defendant, the plaintiff suffered occasional \"flare-ups\" of her condition. During these flare-ups, the plaintiff required rest for recovery and was unable to work. On several occasions the plaintiff arranged with her human resources representative, Kelly Geary, to take medical leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (2012) (FMLA). By October, 2012, however, the plaintiff was no longer eligible for FMLA leave because she had not worked the number of hours required to maintain eligibility. The plaintiff, Geary, and the plaintiff's supervisor, Louis Polzella, met to discuss how they could accommodate the plaintiff without using FMLA leave and determined that the plaintiff could use sick leave, personal leave, governor's leave, and unpaid leave when necessary to accommodate her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 30, 2013, the plaintiff notified Geary that she would need to take intermittent leave as an accommodation for her disability. The plaintiff provided Geary with a medical certificate on which the plaintiff's physician indicated that she would need \"to ... work only intermittently or on a reduced schedule as a result of the condition,\" and would be unable to work for four days per month going forward. The form left space for the plaintiff's physician to indicate when she would be able to return to work full-time, but he drew a line through the space and did not fill in a date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Early in 2013, Geary became responsible for supervising another unit, and Lisa Owens replaced Geary as the\n   plaintiff's human resources representative. On January 31 of that year, Geary sent Owens a memo informing her that the plaintiff \"[h]as had FMLA-fed intermittent for years\" and that \"last time she submitted,\" she did not have the hours required to take any additional FMLA leave. Geary also indicated that the plaintiff had mentioned that she may need to take leave soon and had requested the ability to use leave donated from a coworker, but that Geary \"advised her she could not enact it until she was out on 'long term' illness of [more than thirty] days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Approximately one week later, on February 6, 2013, the plaintiff left a note under Geary's office door indicating that she would be taking a medical leave of absence beginning the next day, February 7, 2013, and lasting for \"over thirty days depending on my lung condition as I need to get well and my lungs better.\" The plaintiff noted that she had not spoken with Polzella about taking a leave of absence. The plaintiff also provided her cell phone number and her home address, which she listed in bold type font, and asked Geary to contact her if she had any questions. The plaintiff otherwise did not speak with Geary about taking this leave of absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff also left paperwork with Geary to make claims under two short-term disability insurance policies. The paperwork left space in several places for the plaintiff and her physician to indicate when she would be returning to work. On the paperwork for one policy, the plaintiff indicated that she would be unable to work from February 7, 2013, \"[until] reevaluated.\" On the same form, the plaintiff's physician indicated that she would be unable\n   to work from \"2/7/13\" to \"ongoing,\" and that he expected \"significant improvement in the [plaintiff's] medical condition\" in one to two months. On the paperwork for her other policy, the plaintiff's physician indicated that she would be unable to work from \"2/7/13\" through \"ongoing,\" and would be able to\n   return to work \"when reevaluated,\" but did not indicate when that reevaluation would occur. The plaintiff did not provide Geary with a medical certificate sufficient to support this request for leave. On February 7, 2013, Geary sent the plaintiff's note and paperwork to Owens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 13, 2013, Owens mailed a certified letter to the plaintiff's home address notifying her that she was ineligible for FMLA leave, that she had not provided the documents necessary to support a medical leave of absence, that she was not eligible to use leave time donated by a coworker, and that she was currently on unauthorized leave. Owens also notified the plaintiff that she needed to contact her supervisor to request leave on a daily basis, and that, if she did not return to work or provide a medical certificate to support her leave by February 21, 2013, her absence \"may be deemed a resignation not in good standing.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Owens noted that she had called the plaintiff's cell phone number and left a voice-mail message on February 8, 2013, but had not received a call back. The plaintiff did not respond and did not return to work. On February 22, 2013, Owens sent the plaintiff a second letter via regular mail notifying her that she had \"been resigned not in good standing\" because she had failed to return to work and failed to provide a completed medical certificate on or before February 21, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff did not receive either of these letters until February 24, 2013, when she returned home from an approximately two week stay at her daughter's home in Hartford. The plaintiff had not been retrieving her mail from her home address while she was away. On February 25, the plaintiff began calling and leaving messages for Geary and Owens, asking whether the donated leave had been applied, requesting that the disability paperwork be completed, and seeking to \"make sure that everything [is] going in the manner that it should\n   be.\" On February 27, Owens spoke with the plaintiff on the phone and informed her that, per the letters sent to her home address, she had been deemed resigned not in good standing. On March 15, 2013, the plaintiff mailed a replica of her January 30, 2013 medical certificate to Owens with the additional notation: \"[a]sked to stay off work 2/7/13 [until] improved.\" No action was taken on the basis of that certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff commenced an action alleging that the defendant had discriminated against her on the basis of her disability and had failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1), a provision of the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 et seq. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the plaintiff had failed to present evidence sufficient to support a prima facie case of discrimination, and the trial court granted the defendant's motion. The court agreed and noted that \"the plaintiff has not produced evidence demonstrating that she was able to perform her job with or without reasonable accommodation nor has she shown that the defendant did not reasonably accommodate [her].\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin by setting forth the relevant standard of review and applicable legal principles. \"A court shall render summary judgment if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that\n   there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law....
