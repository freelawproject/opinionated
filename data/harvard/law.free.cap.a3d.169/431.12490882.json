Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), Estates &amp; Trusts (\"ET\") \u00a7 4-102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In fact, the statutory requirements for the valid execution of a will have remained virtually unchanged in Maryland for over two hundred years. In 1798, the General Assembly enacted the first testamentary statute in Maryland, which included strikingly similar language for devises:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   All devises and bequests of any lands or tenements, devisable by law, shall be in writing, and signed by the party so devising the same, or by some other person in his presence, and by his express directions, and shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said devisor, by three or four credible witnesses, or else they shall be utterly void and of none effect[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1798 Md. Laws, ch. 101, sub-ch. 1, \u00a7 4. This Court has previously traced the foundational roots of these longstanding testamentary formalities to the English Statute of Frauds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casson v. Swogell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057592\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/641/#p648\">\n    304 Md. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057592\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/641/#p648\">\n    500 A.2d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Relatively few changes have been made to the language of the 1798 statute. In 1884, the statute was amended such that\n   only \"two or more credible witnesses\" were required for attestation. 1884 Md. Laws, ch. 293. In 1943, the statute was amended to add a paragraph (b), which provided exceptions to the statutory formalities for persons serving in the armed forces located outside of the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   1943 Md. Laws, ch. 799. The current language of the statute first appeared in 1969 as Article 93, \u00a7 4-102 of the Maryland Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1969 Md. Laws, ch. 3, \u00a7 1. In 1974, the former Article 93 was recodified as the Estates and Trusts Article during Code Revision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1974 Md. Laws, ch. 11, \u00a7 2. The statute has not been substantively amended since its enactment in its current form in 1969.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   2010 Md. Laws, ch. 72, \u00a7 5 (nonsubstantive amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this appeal, we must determine whether a will admitted to probate satisfied the statutory requirements for valid execution, particularly the requirement of attestation. For the following reasons, we hold that the will at issue satisfied the statutory requirements for valid execution, and therefore the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the testator's estate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Peter Castruccio died on February 19, 2013, at the age of eighty-nine. He was survived by his wife of sixty-two years, Sadie Castruccio, who was ninety-two years old at the time of his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Drafting and Execution of the 2010 Will\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Peter signed a last will and testament on September 28, 2008, which he filed with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County for safekeeping. In September 2010, Peter asked his attorney, John Greiber, to retrieve the 2008 Will so that he could revise it. When Peter received the 2008 Will, he marked up the document in the presence of Mr. Greiber, and asked his longtime employee, Darlene Barclay, to transcribe his changes. Darlene made the requested changes and returned the draft 2010 Will to Peter, who reviewed it with Mr. Greiber on September 28, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 29, 2010, Peter signed the 2010 Will in the presence of three witnesses: Mr. Greiber, his daughter Samantha Greiber, and Darlene's daughter Kim Barclay, who had also been employed by Peter for approximately six years. Peter called the three witnesses into his office and requested that they sign the papers on his desk, which he identified as his will. Peter then signed the Will in the presence of Mr. Greiber, Samantha, and Kim. Next, each of the three witnesses signed the Will in the presence of Peter and each other. Six weeks later, on November 17, 2010, Mr. Greiber deposited the Will with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County, where it remained until one week after Peter's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Format and Substance of the 2010 Will\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The 2010 Will, which is reproduced in the appendix to this opinion, consists of six pages, which are consecutively numbered as pages 1 of 6, 2 of 6, etc. The page numbers are centered on the bottom of each page. The words \"Peter Adalbert Castruccio\" are centered in large font on the top of\n   page 1 of 6; otherwise, the font and type-size are consistent throughout the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the first paragraph on page 1 of 6 of the Will, Peter \"declare[s] this instrument\n   as his WILL IN TESTAMENT [sic].\" The second paragraph on page 1 of 6 states that, upon his death, Peter \"hereby declare[s] the following:[.]\" Following these introductory paragraphs, the 2010 Will contains eleven consecutively numbered paragraphs labeled Item 1, Item 2, etc. Some paragraphs are further subdivided into consecutively numbered subparagraphs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Item 1 names Mr. Greiber as Peter's personal representative for the administration of his estate. Item 7 leaves cash bequests of varying amounts to three specified individuals, including Darlene. Item 8 leaves \"the rest and remainder\" of Peter's estate to Sadie, \"should she one, survive [Peter] and two provided she has made and executed a Will prior to [Peter's] death.\" Item 10, entitled \"Residuary Clause,\" appearing on page 5 of 6, provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Should, at the time of my death, my beloved wife not have a valid Will filed with the Register of Wills in Anne Arundel County dated prior thereto these, I hereby give, devise and bequeath all the rest and residue of my Estate and property, whether imposition, expectancy will remainder, including all property over which I may have Power of Appointment to the following individuals share and share alike per stirpes and not per capita to DARLENE BARCLAY, [address redacted], Glen Burnie, Maryland, 21061.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Also on page 5 of 6 of the Will, below the \"Residuary Clause\" and Item 11, appears a concluding paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF\n   </strong>\n   , I, the above mentioned testator have hereunto set my hands and seals to this six page instrument, and have initial [sic] each page hereof, which instrument is intendant [sic] to be my Last Will and Testament, this\n   <em>\n    29\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of September, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (The date \"29\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   \" is handwritten above a blank line.) Contrary to this statement, none of the pages of the 2010 Will are initialed. Below this concluding paragraph, Peter signed his full name above the typewritten words \"PETER ADALBERT CASTRUCCIO[.]\" Below his signature are the words \"SIGNED, SEALED, PUBLISHED AND DECLARE [sic], BY PETER ADALBERT CASTRUCCIO.\" Another line down, the last two lines of page 5 of 6 read as follows: \"The above named individual, does declare for his Last Will and Testament this instrument, have hereunto subscribed to have witness on the date\n   <strong>\n    last mentioned above\n   </strong>\n   , and at the location, and [....]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The first two lines of the next page of the Will, page 6 of 6, appear to be a continuation of the sentence that began on the previous page: \"I do hereby attest that the testator to be of sound mind, fully able to understand this instrument, and the testator voluntarily and freely did sign same.\" Below these words are the signatures of Mr. Greiber, Kim, and Samantha, each appearing under the word \"WITNESS:\" and above a line that reads, \"Signature, residing at: [.]\" Below each signature appears the witness' address. (Mr. Greiber's address is typed consistent with the text of the document; Kim's and Samantha's addresses are handwritten in what appears to be the same handwriting\n   as their signatures.) No other text appears on page 6 of 6, other than the pagination at the bottom of the page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Petition to Caveat the 2010 Will\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On February 26, 2013, one week after Peter's death, Mr. Greiber filed a Petition for Administrative Probate with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County, requesting appointment as personal representative of Peter's estate and admission to probate of the 2010 Will. The next day, the\n   Register of Wills issued an Administrative Probate Order, appointing Mr. Greiber as personal representative of Peter's estate and admitting the 2010 Will to administrative probate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the time of Peter's death, Sadie had not filed a valid will with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County. Thus, under Mr. Greiber's interpretation of Peter's 2010 Will (and specifically the Residuary Clause), the residue of Peter's estate would pass to Darlene, not to Sadie. Seeking to avoid this result, on March 27, 2013, Sadie filed a Petition to Caveat Will in the Orphans' Court for Anne Arundel County. On July 2, 2013, Sadie petitioned the Orphans' Court to transmit issues related to the caveat to the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 1, 2013, the Orphans' Court entered an order transmitting seven issues to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for trial, designating Sadie as the plaintiff and the Estate of Peter Castruccio (\"Estate\") as the defendant. The seven issues were designated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Was the six (6) page paper writing dated September 29, 2010, captioned \"Peter Adalbert Castruccio\" (the \"Will\") executed by Peter Adalbert Castruccio (the \"Testator\")[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   B. Did the Testator execute the Will intending it to constitute his last will and testament?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   C. Are all of the pages of the Will the genuine pages the Testator believed comprised the Will he intended to execute?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   D. Was the execution of the Will procured by undue influence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   E. Was the execution of the Will procured by fraud?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   F. Was the Will actually attested and signed by credible witnesses in the presence of the Testator?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   G. Were the contents of the Will read by or to the Testator or known to him at or before the time of its purported execution?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   On September 17, 2013, the circuit court granted a motion to intervene filed by Darlene, and designated her as a defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On October 10, 2013, the Estate filed a motion for summary judgment on all seven issues. Sadie filed an opposition to the motion on October 30, 2013. The circuit court held hearings on the motion on February 21, 2014 and May 2, 2014. Meanwhile, on April 8, 2014, Sadie filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F, arguing that the 2010 Will did not satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation because the witnesses did not sign on the same page as the testator or on \"physically connected pages.\" Sadie submitted the affidavit of her attorney, who declared that he inspected the 2010 Will at the Register of Wills on March 27, 2013, and found that it \"consisted of six separate, unattached pages, without any staple holes or other evidence of having ever been physically connected together.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Sadie also submitted the deposition testimony of Mr. Greiber and his daughter Samantha, both of whom were witnesses to the 2010 Will. In his deposition, Mr. Greiber\n   recalled that the Will had been stapled when it was signed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. So he took his signature page and the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. The whole will, I think everything was stapled together I'm pretty sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. It was stapled at that time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. I think, I'm pretty sure. Again, Peter had a habit of stapling everything. I don't staple everything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. So-and this is not a will but-so if it was stapled, was it stapled like here-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Samantha also testified in her deposition that the 2010 Will was stapled at the time of signing:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. Do you remember when he gave you the will-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. And again, if you don't remember please let me know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q. But whether it was actually stapled as one unit-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q.-or whether it was just loose papers?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. Stapled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition, Samantha testified that she remembered seeing Peter initial each page of the Will:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. But you do remember seeing him sign it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. Do you remember seeing him initial each page?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [Counsel for the Estate]: Object to the question. Go ahead and answer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. Yes. Yeah. I remember him signing and then him getting up and giving the will to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on this testimony and the affidavit of her attorney, Sadie argued that summary judgment as to the remaining issues (other than Issue F) was inappropriate because there were disputed issues of material facts. Specifically, Sadie noted that the 2010 Will admitted to probate did not match the physical description of the will provided by Mr. Greiber and Samantha: The 2010 Will was not stapled nor was each page initialed, even though Mr. Greiber and Samantha stated that it was at the time of signing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E. The Lower Courts' Rulings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On September 23, 2014, the circuit court issued a memorandum decision granting the Estate's motion for summary judgment on all issues and denying Sadie's cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F. In reaching its decision, the circuit court \"proceeded ... on the assumption ... that the separate sheets of the Will were not mechanically affixed by a staple or other device and were not so affixed when deposited with the Register of Wills for safekeeping on November 17, 2010.\" The court then concluded, as to Issue F, \"that the focus should be on a more holistic inquiry about whether the document purporting to be the will holds together as the unitary document completed by the testator and signed by the witnesses rather than an inquiry that at a certain point some or all of the pages were mechanically affixed to each other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As to the remaining issues, the circuit court found that the 2010 Will contained a proper attestation clause, and therefore the presumption of due execution attached. The court also found that Sadie had not presented clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption. Finally, regarding Peter's testamentary capacity, the court found \"that while Peter was at age 84, elderly, he appears to have been fully in control of what his desires and intentions were and was not one to be lead [sic] by others or even to take advice-including\n   good advice-that he did not appreciate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On October 2, 2014, the circuit court entered an order consistent with its memorandum decision. In its order, the court found that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A. the six page paper writing dated September 29, 2010, captioned \"Peter Adalbert Castruccio\" (the \"Will\") was executed by Peter Adalbert Castruccio (the \"Testator\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   B. the Testator executed his Will with the intention that it constituted his last will and testament;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   C. all of the pages of the Will are the genuine pages the Testator believed comprised the Will he intended to execute;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   D. the Will was not procured by undue influence;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   E. the Will was not procured by fraud;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   F. the Will was actually attested and signed by credible witnesses in the presence of the testator; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   G. the contents of the Will were read by the Testator and known to him at and before the time of the execution of the Will on September 29, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On October 9, 2014, Sadie filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in a reported opinion issued on July 28, 2016. Sadie filed a motion for reconsideration, which the intermediate appellate court granted in part and denied in part. The Court of Special Appeals issued a revised opinion on September 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Castruccio v.

Sadie presents three questions for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   I. Can a Will satisfy the requirements of valid execution in Maryland if (a) the testator and the witnesses do not sign on the same page, or on physically connected pages, (b) the Will contains no proper attestation clause, and (c) the Will was not otherwise regular on its face because it expressly states the pages were initialed, but they were not?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   II. Can a presumption of due execution attach to a Will (a) executed by the testator and the witnesses on separate, loose pages, (b) containing no valid attestation clause, (c) expressly stating the pages were initialed, when they were not, and (d) lacking any other evidence that the witnesses signed in the presence of the testator, based on a common font, consecutive page numbering, and continuation of language?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   III. Can summary judgment as to a Will's validity be granted where the physical description of the Will by two of the witnesses directly contradict[s] the actual physical condition of the Will submitted for probate?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The question of whether a trial court's grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review on appeal. In reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Md. Rule 2-501, we independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact, and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Boland v.

In addition, Sadie contends that the 2010 Will is otherwise invalid because it does not contain a \"proper attestation clause,\" and because the Will \"expressly states [that] the pages were initialed, but they were not.\" In the alternative, Sadie argues that even if these deficiencies do not necessarily invalidate the 2010 Will, the circuit court nonetheless erred in finding that the presumption of due execution attached to the Will, thereby requiring Sadie to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

That section is entitled \"Attestation on a Different Paper\" and provides,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   But the attestation or subscription by witnesses must be on the same sheet of paper as that which contains the testator's own signature, or else upon some paper physically connected with that sheet. No particular mode of connection is prescribed by law; and hence the fastening by tape, by eyelets, by mucilage, or even by a pin, seems unobjectionable. Where papers are thus connected, the testator may sign on one paper and the witnesses on another, provided their intent corresponded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   But attestation or a subscription by witnesses on a piece of paper,\n   <strong>\n    detached and separated from the will\n   </strong>\n   and the testator's signature, nor affixed in his presence to the paper at the time of execution, fails of compliance with the policy of our law; we may assume it to be void, as otherwise a door would be open to much fraud and perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Schouler,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 336 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Notably, the\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   Court did not cite to the next section of Schouler, \u00a7 337, which is entitled \"Attestation where a Will is written on Several Sheets.\" That section provides,\n   [I]f the will be written on several sheets, whether fastened together or not, and the last sheet alone is attested in form, the whole will is well executed, provided all the sheets were in the room.... and unquestionably, if the several pieces of paper are connected in their provisions and form a connected series, and are brought in this shape before the attesting witnesses at the time of their subscription, a single attestation will suffice for the whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The fact that the\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   Court cited \u00a7 336, which discusses attestation \"on a piece of paper detached and separated from the will,\" but did not cite \u00a7 337, which describes a will \"written on several sheets, whether fastened together or not,\" supports the Estate's and Darlene's position that the\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   Court was only concerned with the validity of the attestation when the witnesses sign a document other than the will itself, not when the witnesses sign the will on a different piece of paper than the testator. Indeed, these were the facts in\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   : the testator signed a one-page will, while the witnesses signed on a sealed envelope containing the will. Unlike here, where the three witnesses signed\n   <em>\n    the will\n   </em>\n   on a different page than the testator, the witnesses in\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   did not sign\n   <em>\n    the will\n   </em>\n   at all. Therefore, we conclude that the \"physically connected\" rule of\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   does not apply to loose pages of a multi-page will. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that, when the witnesses sign on a piece of paper that is not part of the will itself, the paper must be physically connected to the will in order to satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As we have just determined,\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   did not address the issue presented in this case: when the witnesses sign the will on a different page than the testator, must the pages be physically connected in order to satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation? In fact, the majority of the cases cited by the parties to this Court are generally concerned with the validity of a multi-page will whose pages are not physically connected at the time of execution, rather than the validity of the attestation when it is not on the same page as the testator's signature.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Beale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8676958\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/15/546/\">\n    15 Wis.2d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20N.W.2d%20380\">\n    113 N.W.2d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Covington's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1220350\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/348/1/\">\n    348 Pa. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20A.2d%20235\">\n    33 A.2d 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Swaim's Will\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11270590\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/162/213/\">\n    162 N.C. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20S.E.%2072\">\n    78 S.E. 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1913).

Thus, Sadie does not dispute the validity of the 2010 Will merely because its pages were not physically connected. Nor does she dispute whether the page containing Peter's signature (page 5 of 6) and the page containing the witnesses' signatures (page 6 of 6) are part of the same document constituting the 2010 Will.

However, these additional facts have no bearing on whether attestation requires the witnesses to sign on the same page as the testator, or else on physically connected pages. If attestation required the witnesses to sign on the same page as the testator, or else on physically connected pages, then it would not matter that the will bore certain other indicia of its validity, such as having a valid\n   attestation clause and remaining in a sealed envelope.

In addition, \"the physical-connection rule is fraught with vagueness\n   and uncertainty. Would a paperclip or binder clip suffice?

Instead, attestation requires (1) that two or more credible witnesses sign the will in the presence of the testator, and (2) that the witnesses either observe the testator sign the will, or that the testator acknowledges his signature on the document or acknowledges that the document is his will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In this case, three credible witnesses observed Peter sign on page 5 of 6 of the 2010 Will, and Peter informed the witnesses that the document was his will. After having witnessed this, the three witnesses each signed on page 6 of 6 of the 2010 Will. Whether they were physically connected or not, all six pages of the document were in the room, together, at the time of signing. The six pages are consecutively numbered, the font and typeface are consistent throughout, and the text flows continuously from one page to the next. \"[T]hey are connected by their internal sense by coherence or adaptation of parts\" and \"the papers themselves bear intrinsic evidence that, while separate, they were tacked together in the mind of the testator.\"\n   <em>\n    Swaim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20S.E.%2072\">\n    78 S.E. at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The evidence does not reveal whether the pages were physically connected to each other at the time of signing, but this fact is immaterial to the Will's validity. Regardless of whether the last two pages (or any of the pages, for that matter) were physically connected, it is clear from \"the papers themselves\" that they were intended to form a single document constituting the 2010 Will. Attestation does not require that the witnesses sign on the same page as the testator, or on physically connected pages. Therefore, the fact that the last two pages of the 2010 Will may not have been physically connected at the time of signing does not render the Will\n   invalid, nor prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not err in denying Sadie's cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F (attestation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Imperfect Attestation Clause and the Presumption of Due Execution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Next, Sadie argues that the 2010 Will is invalid because it does not contain a \"proper attestation clause,\" and \"it expressly states [that] the pages were initialed [by Peter], but they were not.\" Alternatively, Sadie argues that even if these deficiencies do not necessarily invalidate the 2010 Will, they nonetheless should prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it. Therefore, Sadie asserts that she should not have been required to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, Sadie contends that the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate on all transmitted issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Estate and Darlene respond that these purported deficiencies do not invalidate the 2010 Will because neither a \"proper attestation clause\" nor having the testator initial each page are requirements for a valid will. Furthermore, the Estate and Darlene maintain that even if the attestation clause in the 2010 Will was itself insufficient to give rise to the presumption of due execution, the Will contained\n   other sufficient indicia of due execution such that the presumption should attach. Additionally, the Estate and Darlene assert that Sadie produced no evidence to rebut the presumption of due execution, let alone clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, the Estate and Darlene contend that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Estate on all transmitted issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Sadie is correct that page 5 of 6 of the 2010 Will states that Peter has \"initial [sic] each page hereof,\" when in fact he did not, as his initials do not appear on any pages of the Will. However, Sadie cites to no authority, and we have found none, supporting her position that this error either invalidates the\n   Will or prevents the presumption of due execution from attaching to it. We see no reason why an error such as this-stating that the pages were initialed when in fact they were not-should either invalidate an otherwise valid will or prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it, so long as the will contains sufficient other indicia of due execution. Having the testator initial each page of a multi-page will is not required by statute, and therefore we decline to impose such a requirement here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills &amp; Don.

Accordingly,\n   the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate on all transmitted issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The statutory requirements for a validly executed will are that it must be \"(1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator, or by some other person for him, in his presence and by his express direction, and (3) attested and signed by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator.\" ET \u00a7 4-102. When the testator and the witnesses sign on separate pages of a\n   multi-page will, attestation does not require that the pages be \"physically connected\" at the time of signing. Furthermore, neither a complete attestation clause nor having the testator initial each page of the will are requirements for valid execution. Therefore, the absence of these elements in a testamentary document does not serve to invalidate the will, nor prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In this case, the Estate and Darlene produced \"sufficient evidence from the document and/or surrounding circumstances to make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for execution of a will.\"\n   <em>\n    Groat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676482\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/144/#p152\">\n    213 Md.App. at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676482\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/144/#p152\">\n    73 A.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the circuit court properly found that the presumption of due execution attached to the 2010 Will, and Sadie does not argue that she produced clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption. Therefore, the circuit court correctly denied Sadie's cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F (attestation), and properly granted the Estate's motion for summary judgment on all transmitted issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

I do hereby express the desire that my Personal Representative pay my just debts, final expenses and taxes, as soon as practical after my death.

I do hereby direct that my Personal Representative pay from my Estate, primarily from the residuary clause, all government, Estate or inheritance taxes, which may be due and payable by reason of my debt, without requiring contribution from anyone, who, in the absence of this exoneration, would be liable for payment of any portion of such taxes by virtue of the inheritance of the status of beneficiary.3. I do hereby request that my Personal Representative be excused from the necessity of giving bond, unless absolutely required by law, and in that event, my Personal Representative shall give such bond in such minimum amount as would be required by law. 4. For any and all activities of my Personal Representative, I do hereby direct and request that he be relieved from the necessity of securing any previously obtained authority or subsequent ratification from any court, to perform the activities of Personal Representative.5. My Personal Representative shall not be liable for any act or omission on his part which results from mere negligence, unless such activity by the Personal Representative constitutes fraud or willful misconduct.6. My Personal Representative is hereby authorized to sell, lease, give option, or otherwise dispose of any and all property constituting a part of my Estate, whether real, personal or mix, at either public or private sale, all within the performance of the activities of the Personal Representative in the furtherance of administering my Estate.7. I do hereby direct that my Personal Representative pay the cost of any and all funeral expenses and that these cost be paid out of the funds available in my Estate.8. I do hereby authorize my Personal Representative to carry on my business for such a reasonable period of time as is necessary to bring the business to a orderly conclusion, or, if in the discretion of the Personal Representative, to continue to carry on such business for such a reasonable period of time as maybe appropriate for the eventual termination of my Estate, whereby I hereby authorize my Personal Representative to act with the same authority which I may have had in the conduct of such business.9. I hereby authorize my Personal Representative to be empowered, by sale or otherwise, to deal with any personal property in my Estate, including stocks, bonds, securities or other similar matters, including the right to cast vote on such securities, either in person or by limited general proxy.10. My Personal Representative is hereby authorized to enforce, compromise and/or litigate any claim against or in favor of my Estate.11. My Personal Representative is hereby authorized to execute such guarantees and indemnity agreements binding upon my Estate, which, in his sole discretion, are appropriate to the handling of the administration of my Estate. 12. My Personal Representative is hereby authorized to prepare, file and execute in my name, or on behalf of my Estate any and all income or other Tax Returns.13. My Personal Representative is hereby authorized to exercise any and all other powers which are reasonable and necessary for the proper handling of the administration of my Estate.14. The enumeration of the foregoing powers are given for the purpose of enumerating some of the power of my Personal Representative, and not by way of limitations; therefore, any and all other powers permitted to Personal Representatives, under the laws of the State of my residence at the time of my death are expressly granted unto my Personal Representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    ITEM 2: SURVIVAL OF BENEFICIARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   If any beneficiary or beneficiaries under this instrument, and I should die in a common disaster or accident, or under such circumstances that it is doubtful as to which of us died first, then all provisions of this Will shall be effective as though any such beneficiary or beneficiaries shall have predeceased me.
