This consolidated appeal presents us with an opportunity to answer this precise question definitively. We find that \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A) permits attorney\u2019s fees for past-due benefits after a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-22\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-23\">Donald Bergen and James R. Taylor separately filed applications with the Social Security Administration (SSA) for disability benefits. Both of their claims were denied initially and on reconsideration, and they requested an administrative hearing. After an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) determined that they were not entitled to benefits because they were not disabled, they both filed their respective complaints in the district court seeking review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-24\">Richard Culbertson, a lawyer, represented both Bergen and Taylor. Both claimants entered into a contingency fee agreement with Culbertson providing for payment of a reasonable fee not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which they would become entitled by reason of a favorable judgment rendered in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-25\">In Bergen\u2019s case, the district court reversed the Commissioner\u2019s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>on the merits pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Bergen then filed a petition for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 which was granted. Subsequently, an ALJ entered a fully favorable decision awarding Bergen disability benefits, which entitled Bergen to past-due benefits as a result of his disability. But when Culbertson then filed his petition for authorization to charge a reasonable fee for representation before the district court pursuant to \u00a7 406(b), the district court denied the petition, finding that the statute does not permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The district court also found that even if the statute permitted an award of attorney\u2019s fees, the petition was not timely filed in compliance with Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(B) and M.D. Fla. Local R. 4.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Like Bergen, Taylor\u2019s case was also remanded to the Commissioner of Social Security after the district court reversed the Commissioner\u2019s decision under sentence four of \u00a7 405(g). Taylor also filed a petition for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA but the district court denied the petition on the ground that the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified. Taylor appealed this decision to this Court, after which the parties entered into a joint stipulation providing that Taylor was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, and the appeal was dismissed. Later, an ALJ entered a favorable decision awarding Taylor past-due disability benefits. But when Culbertson filed a petition for authorization to charge a reasonable fee for representation of Taylor before the district court pursuant to \u00a7 406(b), the district court denied the petition for the same reasons given to Bergen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Bergen and Taylor then appealed the district court\u2019s denial of Culbertson\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 406(b), and we consolidated the cases for the purpose of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">To resolve this appeal, we are called upon to engage in an exercise of statutory interpretation. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute de novo. <em>Stroup v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1074, 124 S.Ct. 935, 157 L.Ed.2d 745 (2003). \u201c[I]f the statute speaks clearly to the precise question at issue, we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Barnhart v. Walton, </em>535 U.S. 212, 217-18, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 1269, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002) (internal quotations and citation omitted). However, \u201cwhere Congress has not directly addressed the question at issue, the agency\u2019s determination of the statute should be accorded considerable weight ... Courts, however need not accept an agency\u2019s interpretation that frustrates the underlying congressional policy.\u201d <em>Shoemaker v. Bowen, </em>853 F.2d 858, 861 (11th Cir.1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">The district court reasoned that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) did not provide the court authority to award attorney\u2019s fees because its prior judgment did not amount to a victory for the claimants, but simply reversed and remanded their eases to the SSA for further consideration. As the district court literally reads the statute, an award of attorney\u2019s fees is unavailable unless its judgment entitles the claimant to an award of past-due benefits and includes an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 406(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">Whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this sub-chapter who is represented before the court by an attorney, the court may determine and allow as part of its judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>ment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment, and the Commissioner of Social Security may ... certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMEG\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\">Although we have never addressed the precise issue of whether \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A) authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees where the district court\u2019s judgment remanding the case to the Commissioner does not explicitly mention attorney\u2019s fees, we have noted that the congressional intent behind \u00a7 406(b) is, in part, \u201cto encourage effective legal representation of claimants by insuring lawyers that they will receive reasonable fees directly through certification by the Secretary.\u201d <em>Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir.1970) (holding that a district court may not authorize an attorney to charge fees for representation in Court when the Commissioner has already authorized that attorney to charge fees for representation in administrative proceedings, and declining to reach the Secretary\u2019s contention that \u00a7 406(b) does not allow a Court to authorize attorney\u2019s fees unless it renders a judgment on the merits favorable to the claimant). We have also noted that one of \u00a7 406(b)\u2019s goals is to protect claimants by limiting the amount attorneys may collect. <em>See Shoemaker, </em>853 F.2d at 860-61 (holding that a district court may consider interim benefits received pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(g) in awarding attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 406(b)). Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that a remand from the district court to the SSA under sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), as happened here, is a favorable judgment for the claimant. <em>See Shalala v. Schaefer, </em>509 U.S. 292, 301-02, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 2631-32, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Other circuits considering similar cases have unanimously held that \u00a7 406(b) allows a district court to authorize attorney\u2019s fees following a claimant\u2019s success on a sentence four remand to the SSA. <em>See Rohrich v. Bowen, </em>796 F.2d 1030, 1031, (8th Cir.1986). The 7th Circuit has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsZ\">a court cannot usually \u201cdetermine\u201d the amount of the fee award at the time of the judgment or within ten days. Reading the statute as a whole, we do not believe that Congress meant that the only time at which fees could be awarded is the time of the judgment. By authorizing the attorney to be paid directly out of the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits, Congress intended to make it easier, not harder for attorneys to collect their fees. A more appropriate reading of \u00a7 406(b)(1) is that a judgment favorable to the claimant is merely a prerequisite to a fee award under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\"><em>Smith v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 1152, 1155 (7th Cir.1987) (per curiam). <em>Contra McGraw v. Barnhart, </em>370 F.Supp.2d 1141, 1144 (N.D.Okla.2005) (\u201cA judgment which merely remands the action for further proceedings by the Social Security Administration does not equate to a claimant being entitled to past due benefits \u2018by reason of the Court\u2019s judgment.\u201d); <em>but see McPeak v. Barnhart, </em>388 F.Supp.2d 742, 745-46 n. 2 (S.D.W.Va.2005) (\u201c[The <em>McGraw </em>court is] reading [\u00a7 406(b)] too narrowly without considering the sorts of judgments which Congress has allowed Courts to make in social security cases.\u201d). Like the 7th Circuit, the 4th Circuit has held that \u00a7 406(b)(1) permits an award of attorney\u2019s fees when a remand results in an administrative award of benefits. <em>Conner v. Gardner, </em>381 F.2d 497, 500 (4th Cir.1967) (\u201cTo permit counsel to receive a reasonable fee for [services rendered in the district court] will not defeat [\u00a7 406(b)\u2019s] purpose, but will serve to advance it.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>We agree with our sister circuits\u2019 interpretation of the statute. Reading \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A) literally, as did the district court, would frustrate the underlying congressional policy of \u201cencourag[ing] effective legal representation of claimants by insuring lawyers that they will receive reasonable fees directly through certification by the Secretary.\u201d <em>Dawson, </em>425 F.2d at 1195; <em>see also Shoemaker, </em>853 F.2d at 860-61. Limiting \u00a7 406(b) fees to cases in which the Court itself awards past-due benefits would also discourage counsel from requesting a remand in cases where it is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Moreover, we, along with the other circuits, have generally assumed without addressing the issue that fees are available under \u00a7 406(b) because past-due benefits have been conspicuously awarded without objection by the SSA. <em>See, e.g., McGuire v. Sullivan, </em>873 F.2d 974, 975 (7th Cir.1989); St<em>raw v. Bowen, </em>866 F.2d 1167, 1168-69 (9th Cir.1989); <em>Shoemaker, </em>853 F.2d at 859-61; <em>MacDonald v. Weinberger, </em>512 F.2d 144, 145-46 (9th Cir.1975). Under the weight of this authority, the SSA, in its brief on this appeal, does not oppose an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 406(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">The district court also reasoned that the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful claimant under the subsequently enacted EAJA makes \u00a7 406(b) attorney\u2019s fees unnecessary. But EAJA fees are available only when the government\u2019s position is not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d Thus, EAJA fees are not available every time a claimant prevails \u2014 only when the Commissioner\u2019s position lacks \u201ca reasonable basis in law and fact.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 566 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). In deciding the question before us, we are bound to consider the intent of Congress at the time that the statute was enacted and we note that Congress has not substantively amended \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A) since the EAJA was enacted in 1965. The Supreme Court concluded that Congress harmonized awards for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA with awards under \u00a7 406(b) by requiring the claimant\u2019s attorney \u201cto refun[d] to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.\u201d <em>Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, </em>535 U.S. 789, 796, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 1822, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002) (internal quotation and citations omitted, brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">We find that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees where the district court remands the case to the Commissioner of Social Security for further proceedings, and the Commissioner on remand awards the claimant past-due benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-14\">The district court alternatively found that even if \u00a7 406(b) permitted authorization of attorney\u2019s fees, Culbertson\u2019s petitions would not be granted because they were untimely filed pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(B) and M.D. Fla. Local R. 4.18(a). We agree with the Fifth Circuit that Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2) applies to a \u00a7 406(b) attorney\u2019s fee claim. <em>Pierce v. Barnhart, </em>440 F.3d 657, 663-64 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To determine whether the petitions were timely requires deciding when the 14 day period for filing the petitions provided in the rules begins to run for a \u00a7 406(b) petition. Because the Commissioner has not objected to the timeliness of the attorney\u2019s fee petitions, we do not address this issue in this case and merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>hold that the petitions were timely. <em>Shepherd v. Apfel, </em>981 F.Supp. 1188, 1190 (S.D.Iowa 1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">We join the unanimous view of the Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue to find that \u00a7 406(b) authorizes attorney\u2019s fees where a district court orders a remand to the Commissioner of Social Security for further proceedings, and the Commissioner awards benefits on remand. We further find that Culbertson\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees was timely. Therefore, we vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">. We disagree with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Smith v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 1152, 1156 (7th Cir.1987) (per curiam) that only a \"reasonable\u201d time limit should apply, because this holding was based on a prior version of Fed.R.Civ.P. 54 that did not contain the 14 day time limit. <em>McGraw v.
