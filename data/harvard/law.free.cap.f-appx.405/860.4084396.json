The evidence showed that Green purchased five Beretta pistols in McAllen, Texas,- which she then smuggled into Mexico for her common-law spouse, Gabriel Gardea, and a man identified in the presentence report as FNU LNU.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-18\">Green contends that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2010). Although Green has completed her sentence of 12 months and a day, her case is not moot because she presently is serving her two-year supervised release term. <em>See United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 355 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">Under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), a four-level enhancement is applied if the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-20\">(i) transported, transferred, or otherwise disposed of two or more firearms to another individual, or received two or more firearms with the intent to transport, transfer, or oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>erwise dispose of firearms to another individual; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">(ii) knew or had reason to believe that such conduct would result in the transport, transfer, or disposal of a firearm to an individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-5\">(1) whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">(II) who intended to use or dispose of the firearm unlawfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">\u00a7 2K2.1, 2006 amend, cmt. n. 13(A). The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1 provides that an individual whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful \u201cmeans an individual who (i) has a prior conviction for a crime of violence, a controlled substance offense, or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence; or (ii) at the time of the offense was under a criminal justice sentence. ...\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1, 2006 amend, cmt. n. 13(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. CisnerosGutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). This court upholds a district court\u2019s factual finding on clear error review so long as the enhancement is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 584 (5th Cir.2006). The Government must prove sentencing enhancements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d 353, 357 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Here, the Government concedes that the district court erred by imposing the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement because there was no evidence that either Gardea or FNU LNU had a relevant criminal conviction or was under a criminal justice sentence at the time of the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, 2006 amend, cmt. n. 13(B). But for this error, Green would have faced a Guideline imprisonment range of only 6 to 12 months in prison. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, sentencing table (2010). The Government admits that there is no evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence of 12 months and a day but for the misapplication of the Guideline. Without proof that, but for the error, the district court would have imposed the same sentence, the Government cannot meet its burden to prove that the error is harmless. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753-54 (5th Cir.2009). For the foregoing reasons, Green\u2019s sentence is vacated and we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b887-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
