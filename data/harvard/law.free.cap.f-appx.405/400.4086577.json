After a careful review of the record in this case and the briefs filed on appeal, we conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of these motions was without reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-23\">After a trial on appellants\u2019 negligence claim against the defendant, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of appellants and awarded each of them damages in the amount of $5,000. Appellants assert that these awards were entirely disproportionate to their injury, relying on a case that holds that the amount of damages must be at least as high as the uncontradicted special damages, as well as an amount sufficient to make any compensation for p\u00e1in and suffering. <em>See Brown v. Foster, </em>636 So.2d 468, 469 (Ala.Civ.App.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-24\">In denying appellants\u2019 post-trial motions, however, the district court held that the evidence at trial as to the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>appellants injuries and the amount of their damages was conflicting. Therefore, he concluded that the amount of special damages was not \u201cuncontradicted.\u201d Our review of the record supports this conclusion. The opinion testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses as to special damages including the extent of their injuries, causation of their medical conditions, and other claims was vigorously questioned on cross-examination. The jury was not required to credit all that was opined.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Accordingly, the <em>Brown </em>case is inapposite and the district court\u2019s conclusion that the motions for new trial or for additur should be denied was not error. <em>See Hawkes v. Ayers, </em>537 F.2d 836, 837 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Accordingly, the denial of the motions for new trial or for additur is</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
