This court\u2019s inquiry into good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-20\">We may not review the government\u2019s refusal to file a rule 35(b) motion unless its refusal is premised on an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion, or the government has bargained away its discretion. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>493 F.3d 464, 467-68 (5th Cir.2007). Benitez has not contended in the district court or on appeal that the government\u2019s failure to file was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See id. </em>at 467. She contends instead that the failure was arbitrary and without a rational basis. That contention is without merit. An \u201cunadorned allegation of general arbitrariness\u201d does not demonstrate that the government had an unconstitutional motive. <em>United States v. Urbani, </em>967 F.2d 106, 110 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-21\">Benitez asserts that she would not have agreed to cooperate without the government\u2019s agreement to file a rule 35(b) motion. She contends that during post-conviction meetings among her attorney, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and case agents, the government promised to file the motion and that an evidentiary hearing is necessary to develop those facts. Benitez\u2019s contentions are not supported by the documents she filed in support of her motion. <em>See Grant, </em>493 F.3d at 467-68; <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir.2006) (stating that a movant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>seeking an evidentiary hearing must present independent indicia of the likely merit of his claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">For the first time on appeal, Benitez contends that her attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to reduce the cooperation agreement to writing and in advising her improperly about rule 35 practice. There is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel during rule 35(b) proceedings. <em>United States v. Palomo, </em>80 F.3d 138, 140-42 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Because Benitez has not shown that her appeal will present a nonfrivolous issue, leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
