Morton argues that her sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Morton\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court considered the sentencing factors and explained that Morton\u2019s \u201cabsolutely appalling\u201d criminal record required an upward variance. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court stated that a variance of 50 months was necessary to punish Morton adequately for her \u201cserious[ ] ... offenses,\u201d promote respect for the law, protect the public from future similar crimes, and also to address her \u201cconduct in [the] past ... 25 years,\u201d her \u201clack of conscience\u201d as evidenced by her stealing her minor son\u2019s identity and defrauding an elderly cancer patient, her lack of remorse for her crimes, and her need for education and rehabilitation. The brevity of previous sentences militated in favor of a sentence above the range provided in the Guidelines to remedy Morton\u2019s unrepentant recidivism and disregard for the law. We will not disturb a sentence unless \u201cwe \u2018are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)). Morton has been convicted of 54 crimes involving fraud and has amassed 39 criminal history points, three times the amount required for a VI classification. Morton\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">We AFFIRM Morton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
