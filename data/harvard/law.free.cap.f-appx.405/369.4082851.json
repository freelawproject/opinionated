He now appeals his conviction, raising one issue: whether, following a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, i.e., the gun that led to appellant\u2019s conviction, the district court clearly erred in crediting the testimony of Detective Gonzalez that appellant possessed a gun in his waistband and in denying the motion to suppress based on that testimony. Appellant contends that, because Gonzalez did not have reasonable suspicion, the district court should have suppressed the gun and ammunition found during the pat-down search. Appellant contends, moreover, that court clearly erred in its implicit decision not to credit consistent testimony from a second detective, Mazzola, and from appellant\u2019s friend, Bien-Aime, which contradicted the officer\u2019s testimony. Appellant says that Gonzalez stopped him based on a mere \u201chunch.\u201d Accordingly, the court erred in denying the motion to suppress, and the conviction should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">In determining whether the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Epps, </em>613 F.3d 1093, 1097 (11th Cir.2010). The district court\u2019s credibility determinations are among the factual findings that we must accept unless they are \u201cso inconsistent or improbable on their face that no reasonable factfinder could accept them.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>593 F.3d 1199, 1203 (11th Cir.2010) (citation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">We analyze the legality of pat-down searches according to the principles of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), \u201cunder which the police may stop and briefly detain a person to investigate a reasonable suspicion that he is involved in criminal activity, even though probable cause is lacking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202 (quotation omitted). A <em>Terry </em>stop is justified when the officer has a \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion based on objective facts that the person has engaged in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, an officer may proceed with a pat-down search of a person he has detained \u201cif he has reason to believe that his own safety or the safety of others is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[t]he officer need not be <em>absolutely certain </em>that the individual is armed\u201d in order to justify a pat-down search. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883) (emphasis in original). Rather, the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in believing that his safety or the safety of others was in danger. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In this case, the district court\u2019s determination that Detective Gonzalez\u2019s testimony was credible was not clearly erroneous. Nothing in the record shows the testimony \u201cso inconsistent or improbable on [its] face that no reasonable factfinder could accept\u201d it. The court considered the credibility of the witnesses, and even though it found that Bien-Aime was a credible witness \u201cin a lot of respects[,]\u201d its decision to credit Gonzalez\u2019s testimony, to the extent that it differed from Bien-Aime\u2019s, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
