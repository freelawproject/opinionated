The district court dismissed Carter\u2019s motion as untimely and granted Carter a certificate of appealability. We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-26\">Carter was eonvicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute over five grams of cocaine base and sentenced as a career offender to 360 months of imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. Carter moved to vacate or set aside his conviction or sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court dismissed as untimely. This Court affirmed and agreed that Carter\u2019s motion was \u201cplainly barred by \u00a7 2255\u2019s statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Carter v. United States, </em>No. 04-12044 (11th Cir. Aug. 16, 2004). Carter later moved to reduce his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), and that motion is pending in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Carter moved a second time to vacate or set aside his conviction or sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The government moved to dismiss the motion because Carter had failed to obtain leave to file a second or successive motion. A magistrate judge denied the motion to dismiss on the ground that Carter sought to reduce his sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), and recommended that the district court deny the motion as untimely and, in the alternative, as lacking merit. Carter objected to the recommendation and argued that he had moved to vacate his sentence under section 2255 and his motion was timely. The district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Although neither party challenges our jurisdiction, \u201cwe are obligated to address jurisdictional questions <em>sua sponte.\u201d Thomas v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>594 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Frulla v. CRA Holdings, Inc., </em>543 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2008)). \u201cAn appellate court \u2018must satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also of that of the lower courts in a cause under review.\u2019\u201d <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 409 (11th Cir.1999)). \u201c[Tjhis requirement involves the court\u2019s competency to consider a given type of case, [and] it cannot be waived or otherwise conferred upon the court by the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Carter\u2019s second motion to vacate. Because Carter \u201cis collaterally attacking his sentence as violating the United States Constitution, the proper avenue of relief is [section] 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005). The district court dismissed Carter\u2019s first motion to vacate as untimely, that dismissal constituted a dismissal with prejudice, and Carter has not sought permission from this Court to file a successive motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h); <em>see Jordan v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>485 F.3d 1351, 1353 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cWithout authorization, the district court laek[ed] jurisdiction to consider [Carter\u2019s] second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">We VACATE the dismissal of Carter\u2019s motion to vacate and REMAND for the district court to dismiss the motion for a lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
