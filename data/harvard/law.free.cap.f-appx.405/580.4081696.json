For the following reasons, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">Pickering-George alleges that he submitted a petition to the District Court in July 2010, but that the \u201ccourt clerk\u2019s office did not respond with a civil docket number nor the status of the case.\u201d Significantly, however, a search of the District Court\u2019s electronic docket indicates that Pickering-George\u2019s action was filed on July 16, 2010. <em>See Pickering-George v. Dowdye, et al., </em>No. lO-cv-00079. Therefore, to the extent Pickering-George seeks an order directing the District Court clerk to docket his petition, we will deny the mandamus petition as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">We recognize that, along with the complaint, Pickering George filed in the District Court an application to proceed without prepaying fees or costs. He submitted another such application in November 2010, along with requests for a docket number and a status report. Although the District Court has not addressed any of Pickering-George\u2019s filings, we are confident that it will take appropriate action in the case expeditiously.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-16\">.
