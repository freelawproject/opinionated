He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines governing crack cocaine. He contends that the district court erred in determining that he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He also contends that the applicability of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) entitled him to a reconsideration of the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the application of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-22\">Because Mack was subject to a mandatory statutory minimum, the district court lacked authority to grant a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 579-81 (5th Cir.2010). Additionally, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings, and the principles of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Thus, Mack\u2019s arguments are unavailing. Furthermore, to the extent Mack seeks to rely on Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines as a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Amendment 709 does not provide a basis for such relief because it is not one of the eligible amendments covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s.; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
