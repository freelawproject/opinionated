After agreeing to a plea agreement that included an appeal waiver and an agreement by the Government not to oppose an offense-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Corral-Marrufo changed his mind, and the case was set for trial. On the morning of trial, Corral-Marrufo again changed his mind and accepted the plea agreement. As a result of this circumstance, the Government did oppose the acceptance of responsibility reduction, but it does not seek to enforce the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, we will consider this appeal despite the initially agreed waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">Corral-Marrufo argues that the district court erred in denying a minor role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. His role was central to housing and transporting the aliens within Mexico and was clearly \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001). He brought the aliens to meet two unknown guides, advised them how to crawl through the brush and how to cross the American Canal and fencing, provided cash to pay an unknown individual for transportation after they crossed the border, and assured one of the aliens, Fritman Cardenas-Reyna, that the water in the river was only knee deep. Cardenas-Reyna later drowned while crossing the river. Even if Corral-Marrufo did not perform as many acts as his codefendants, his activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>ties were not peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005). The district court did not clearly err in finding he was not a minor participant. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Corral-Marrufo argues that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because he did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)(listing the factors involved in plain error review). The district court asked Corral-Marrufo\u2019s counsel to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; counsel argued that the court should consider the need to avoid sentencing disparity; Corral-Marrufo\u2019s humanitarian actions of transporting, feeding, and providing money to the aliens; and the inhuman conditions he suffered during his eight-month imprisonment in Mexico. The district court also considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, in particular the death of one of the aliens, and CorralMarrufo\u2019s history and characteristics. We will \u201cinfer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence\u201d because the district court imposed a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>587 F.3d 682, 688 (5th Cir.2009)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Corral-Marrufo has not shown that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, he has not shown that the district court committed any error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
