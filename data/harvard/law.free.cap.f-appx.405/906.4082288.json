Jennings contends that her \u00a7 2254 petition was timely in light of <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>555 U.S. 113, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-21\">A one-year limitations period applies to state prisoners filing federal habeas petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). In most cases, the limitations period runs from the date that the conviction being challenged became final through \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Under <em>Jimenez, </em>when a habeas petitioner is granted the right to file an out-of-time appeal, \u201c\u2018the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u2019 must reflect the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of that appeal.\u201d <em>Jimenez, </em>129 S.Ct. at 686-87 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-22\">Accordingly, Jennings\u2019 one-year limitation period began to run upon expiration of the 90-day period for seeking a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court following the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial, on direct review, of her writ application. <em>See </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13.1. In view of the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-23\">Jennings also argues the merits of her constitutional claims. Because a COA was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>not granted as to these issues, we will not consider them in this appeal. <em>See Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
