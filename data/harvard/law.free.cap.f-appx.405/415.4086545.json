Gomez\u2019s offense and criminal history resulted in an applicable guidelines range of 46 to 57 months. The statutory maximum sentence was 20 years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">Even though Gomez received a final sentence below the guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum, he contends it is substantively unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that he had not committed any crimes for the last 12 years and that he did not need deterrence, rehabilitation, or removal as a danger to the public. He further argues that the district court violated the \u201cparsimony principle\u201d by refusing to vary downward from the guidelines range more than it already had.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). Our reasonableness review is guided by the factors provided by Congress in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). That includes the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>cal care. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3558(a)(2). The district court must also consider among other factors the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), (6). The district court need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging that sentence. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">As an initial matter, we have disapproved of the use of the phrase \u201cparsimony principle\u201d to describe the \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d requirement of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1196-97 (11th Cir.2010). That phrase reflects only half of the congressional command \u2014 that the sentence not be too long. <em>Id. </em>at 1197. It leaves out the other, equally important half \u2014 that the sentence not be too short. <em>See id. </em>Under \u00a7 3553(a), Congress requires sentences to be neither too long nor too short. <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201c[a] more accurate term ... might be \u2018the Goldilocks principle\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Semantics aside, Gomez contends that his recent non-criminal conduct warranted a downward variance greater than the 8-month reduction already meted out by the district court. He argues that a greater reduction is required because he has managed to stay out of trouble since his arrest for transporting cocaine 12 years ago. Gomez also asserts that he was minding his own business and keeping his nose clean when law enforcement officers mistakenly arrested him, believing Gomez to be his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Gomez\u2019s argument, however, misses a key point: when he illegally reentered the United States after his last deportation, he broke the law every day he remained here. After he was caught for that illegal conduct, he continued to break the law by lying to law enforcement officers about his name and handing over false identification documents. At the sentence hearing, the district court expressly considered Gomez\u2019s recent good conduct, his recent bad conduct, his serious criminal history, his time already served for the related false identification crimes, sentences imposed on other defendants for similar crimes in the district, and the need to deter Gomez from illegally reentering the United States yet again. After weighing those factors, the district court imposed a sentence below the applicable guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of 20 years. That sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
