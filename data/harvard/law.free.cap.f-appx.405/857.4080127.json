Musar was sentenced to concurrent terms of three years of probation, a $5,000 fine on count one, and a $100 special assessment on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">DEA agents questioned Musar, the owner of the Homeport storage facility, regarding whether Mitchell Block, an employee, was growing marijuana there. The Government alleged Musar falsely stated that Block only had access to a storage area for supplies and had no keys to the facility. At trial, it was undisputed that Block had lived in an apartment at the facility and had a key to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">Musar contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence of Block\u2019s marijuana growing activities and the drug-related items found in his apartment as well as evidence that Musar stated he would have known if someone was growing marijuana at the facility because he would have noticed a change in the electricity bill. Evidence of Block\u2019s marijuana cultivation was relevant to whether the investigation was a matter within the jurisdiction of the DEA, an element of the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1001(a)(2); <em>United States v. Najera Jimenez, </em>593 F.3d 391, 399 (5th Cir.2010). The evidence had little probative value because the element was established by other evidence. However, even if the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, we are not convinced \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that the improperly admitted evidence contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Sumlin, </em>489 F.3d 683, 688 (5th Cir.2007). Therefore, the error in admitting the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>dence was harmless. <em>See id.; </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The evidence regarding Musar\u2019s familiarity with indoor marijuana cultivation was irrelevant. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401. However, because there is no indication that the evidence contributed to the verdict, the error was harmless. <em>See Sumlin, </em>489 F.3d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Musar also contends there was insufficient evidence the statement alleged in count one of the indictment, that the only part of the Homeport storage facility to which Block had access was a supply area, was false. Musar argues his interpretation of the \u201cHomeport storage facility\u201d as including only storage areas was as reasonable as the Government\u2019s intended meaning that it included all areas of the facility regardless of their use. However, a reasonable jury could have found that Musar understood he was being asked about Block\u2019s access to the entire facility and his statement that Block only had access to a supply area was false. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>459 F.3d 509, 529 (5th Cir.2006) (analyzing a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a)); <em>cf. United States v. Bell, </em>623 F.2d 1132, 1137 (5th Cir.1980) (same). Therefore, the conviction as to count one is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Finally, Musar contends there was insufficient evidence he told agents that Block had no keys that would provide him access to the Homeport storage facility as alleged in count two of the indictment. The agents testified that Musar told them Block had keys to a supply area and the facility\u2019s office. However, the agents did not testify that Musar told them Block had no keys to the facility, and Musar denied making such a statement. Therefore, the jury could not have found the essential elements of the offense in count two beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Shum, </em>496 F.3d 390, 391 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the conviction as to count two is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The conviction as to count one is AFFIRMED. The conviction as to count two is VACATED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is MODIFIED to impose only a $100 special assessment. Any money paid by Musar in excess of $100 toward the erroneous special assessment should be refunded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b884-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
