The case appears to stem from a dispute over the custody of two minor children, S.J. and T.J. Both children were subject to writs of attachment in Texas state court naming the TDFPS as their temporary managing conservator. The Appellants claimed in their lawsuit that the various defendants conspired to fabricate false allegations against the Appellants in order to terminate the Appellants\u2019 custodial rights over S.J. and T.J. The complaint included allegations that the defendants violated the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and sought relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Appellants requested damages in the amount of $100 million, as well as the possession of S.J. and T.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-21\">The State Defendants moved for dismissal of the Appellants\u2019 suit, and the district court dismissed the case, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), after it determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the district court concluded that the Appellants\u2019 suit was an attempt to modify the terms of state-court child custody orders, and that both the <em>Rooker-Feld</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number><em>man </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applied to limit the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Appellants, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">We consider at the outset whether the Appellants have abandoned all issues on appeal. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure require that an appellant\u2019s brief contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cFailure adequately to brief an issue on appeal constitutes waiver of that argument.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[although <em>pro se </em>briefs are to be liberally construed, <em>pro se </em>litigants have no general immunity from the rule that issues and arguments not briefed on appeal are abandoned.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In their brief, the Appellants simply provide a list of the rights that they claim have been violated in their case, as well as a list of citations to cases addressing whether qualified immunity is available for state officials who commit constitutional violations when removing children from the custody of their parents. The district court did not dismiss the Appellants\u2019 suit on qualified immunity grounds, however, and the Appellants utterly fail to address the district court\u2019s decision to apply the <em>Rooker-Felchnan </em>doctrine and the domestic relations exception to this case. Because the Appellants point to no specific error in the district court\u2019s order, we hold that the Appellants have abandoned all issues on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
