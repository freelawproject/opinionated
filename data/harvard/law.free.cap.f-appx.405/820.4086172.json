For the following reasons, we reject Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s challenges and DISMISS the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Senior Rehabilitation is a nursing home that participates in the Medicare program. On July 12, 2008, a designated state surveying agency completed an incident and complaint investigation of Senior Rehabilitation on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS concluded that Senior Rehabilitation was not in substantial compliance with certain Medicaid and Medicare regulations and imposed a civil monetary penalty of $800 per day for a period of 44 days, totaling $35,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Senior Rehabilitation requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) regarding CMS\u2019s determination of substantial noncompliance. CMS moved for summary judgment, which the ALJ granted, upholding the $35,200 fine. The ALJ found that (1) Senior Rehabilitation had not substantially complied with the physician consultation requirement in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.10(b)(ll) because it failed to consult a resident\u2019s physician immediately after she experienced a significant change in health status and (2) with respect to the same resident, Senior Rehabilitation had not substantially complied with the quality of care standard for pressure sores set forth in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(c)(2). Senior Rehabilitation appealed the ALJ\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the DAB, and the DAB affirmed. Senior Rehabilitation now seeks review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AQn\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">This court has jurisdiction to review the grant of summary judgment and imposition of a civil monetary penalty against Senior Rehabilitation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e). Review is conducted according to the deferential standards of the Administrative Procedures Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), which authorizes the court to \u201cset aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be,\u201d in relevant part, \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law,\u201d or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A),(E); <em>Cedar Lake Nursing Home v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>619 F.3d 453, 457 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cThe findings of the Secretary with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence in the record, shall be conclusive.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a responsible mind might accept to support a conclusion. It is more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Harris v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 413, 417 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA finding of no substantial evidence is appropriate only if no credible evidentiary choices or medical findings support the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">i. <em>Physician Consultation, 1$ C.F.R. \u00a7 m.l0(b)(ll)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The ALJ determined that Senior Rehabilitation was not in substantial compliance with the physician consultation requirement in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.10(b)(ll), which requires a nursing facility to immediately consult with a resident\u2019s physician following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">[a] significant change in the resident\u2019s physical, mental, or psychosocial status (i.e., a deterioration in health, mental, or psychosocial status in either life-threatening conditions or clinical complications); [or] [a] need to alter treatment significantly (i.e., a need to discontinue an existing form of treatment due to adverse consequences, or to commence a new form of treatment).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.10(b)(ll)(i)(B)-(C). A facility substantially complies with a participation requirement where \u201cany identified deficiencies pose no greater risk to resident health or safety than the potential for causing minimal harm.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The undisputed evidence shows that Resident 26 (\u201cR 26\u201d) was a 72-year-old woman diagnosed with organic brain stroke, dysphagia, hypertension, and a history of stroke. She was unable to speak and was completely dependent on staff for all activities of daily living. Between March and April 2008, R 26 experienced a weight loss of nearly ten percent of her body weight \u2014 from 93.6 lbs to 84.6 lbs. In an April 2008 progress note, Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s consultant dietician described R 26 as \u201cat risk\u201d because of her significant weight loss and observed that R 26 had a pressure sore on her back and a stage IV coccyx wound. The dietician made several recommendations, including an increase in R 26\u2019s nutritional intake. Senior Rehabilitation waited over three weeks before informing R 26\u2019s physician of the change in R 26\u2019s health status and the dietician\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Relying upon the foregoing facts, the DAB concluded that Senior Rehabilitation was not in substantial compliance because the undisputed facts established that the facility did not immediately consult R 26\u2019s attending physician following a significant change in her condition and that this deficiency posed a greater than minimal risk to R 26\u2019s health.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">On appeal, Senior Rehabilitation does not assert that R 26 did not experience a significant change in her health status or that it consulted her physician immediately. Instead, Senior Rehabilitation argues that a sworn statement by William George, M.D. (\u201cDr. George\u201d), R 26\u2019s treating physician, that the \u201cfacility in [his] opinion ... kept [him] reasonably and timely informed about [R 26\u2019s] care needs and changes in health condition\u201d creates an issue of material fact. Accepting this statement as true, the DAB held that Dr. George\u2019s statements were \u201cconclusions reflecting the doctor\u2019s individual opinion, not evidence of material facts under the governing regulation,\u201d because they were not relevant to whether R 26\u2019s substantial weight loss amounted to a significant change in her health status or to whether Senior Rehabilitation immediately consulted R 26\u2019s physician regarding this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">Senior Rehabilitation also contends that statements in affidavits by Dr. George and by Dana Banks, R.N., the director of nursing at Senior Rehabilitation, that R 26 was receiving adequate nutrition show that Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s failure to immediately consult Dr. George did not impact R 26\u2019s physical condition. The DAB accepted these assertions as true but held that they were not probative because \u201cthe issue of substantial compliance here is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>whether Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s] failure to increase R 26\u2019s feedings posed more than minimal harm, but whether the facility\u2019s failure to immediately consult with the physician, as required, had that potential given the resident\u2019s medical history and identified clinical risks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The findings and conclusions of the DAB with regard to Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s substantial compliance with the physician consultation requirement in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.10(b)(ll)(i) are not arbitrary, capricious, in violation of the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">ii. <em>Pressure Sores, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(c)(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Senior Rehabilitation also appeals the DAB\u2019s determination that it did not substantially comply with the requirement regarding pressure sores. This requirement is part of the quality of care standards in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25, which compels a facility to \u201cprovide the necessary care and services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being, in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care.\u201d The subsection on pressure sores states, in pertinent part, \u201c[b]ased on the comprehensive assessment of a resident, the facility must ensure that ... [a] resident having pressure sores receives necessary treatment and services to promote healing, prevent infection and prevent new sores from developing.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The undisputed evidence shows that R 26 was at \u201chigh risk\u201d for pressure sores. When R 26 was re-admitted to the facility after a hospital stay in January 2008, she had pressure sores on her coccyx and left inner knee. Between January and June 2008, the coccyx pressure sore worsened, and R 26 developed additional pressure sores. After a detailed and painstaking review of the record, the DAB concluded that Senior Rehabilitation had not substantially complied with the pressure sore requirement. Specifically, the DAB determined that Senior Rehabilitation (1) failed to conduct daily assessments of the pressure sores on R 26\u2019s coccyx and back as required by her care plan; (2) permitted R 26 to lie on a \u201cwet incontinent pad with a drying brown ring and a foul urine odor\u201d which violated R 26\u2019s care plan and the facility\u2019s own policies; and (3) did not ensure that R 26\u2019s catheter was functioning which violated R 26\u2019s care plan and the facility\u2019s policies. Based on this evidence, the DAB determined that Senior Rehabilitation did not \u201censure\u201d that R 26 \u201creceive[d] necessary treatment and services to promote healing, prevent infection and prevent new sores from developing\u201d and that this deficiency posed a greater than minimal risk to R 26\u2019s health.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Rather than offer argument or cite legal authority with respect the pressure sore requirement, Senior Rehabilitation merely copied and pasted portions of various affidavits previously submitted to the ALJ and the DAB into its brief to this court. However, the DAB carefully parsed each affidavit, accepted the statements as true, and arrived at the conclusion that Senior Rehabilitation was not in substantial compliance. This decision was not arbitrary, capricious, in violation of the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">iii. <em>Activities of Daily Living, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(a) (iii)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Senior Rehabilitation contests CMS\u2019s determination of substantial noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(a)(iii) for failure to provide timely incontinent care to several residents, including R 26. Having found that the Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s substantial noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.10(b)(ll)(B) and 42 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>\u00a7 483.25(c)(2) was sufficient to support the imposition of the civil monetary penalty, the ALJ did not review this deficiency. Because Senior Rehabilitation identified no error by the ALJ, the DAB did not address this issue. The DAB\u2019s decision not to review this issue was not arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Claiborne-Hughes Health Ctr. v. Sebelius, </em>609 F.3d 839, 847 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">iv. <em>Civil Monetary Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">According to Senior Rehabilitation, the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of $800 per day, for a total of $35,200, was unreasonable. \u201cPenalties in the range of $50-$3,000 per day are imposed for deficiencies that do not constitute immediate jeopardy, but either caused actual harm, or caused no actual harm, but have the potential for more than minimal harm.\u201d 42 CFR \u00a7 488.438(a)(l)(ii). In determining a penalty, CMS considers the following factors: (1) the facility\u2019s history of noncompliance, including repeated deficiencies; (2) the facility\u2019s financial condition; (3) the factors specified in [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 488.404; and (4) the facility\u2019s degree of culpability. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 488.438(f). The factors in 42 CFR \u00a7 488.404 include the seriousness of the deficiency, the relationship among the deficiencies resulting in the noncompliance, and the facility\u2019s history of noncompliance in general and specifically with respect to the cited deficiencies. 42 CFR \u00a7 488.404.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The ALJ determined that a $800 per day civil monetary penalty was reasonable based on the facility\u2019s history of noncompliance and culpability. The ALJ relied upon undisputed evidence that Senior Rehabilitation was in its \u201csixth noncompliance cycle\u201d and had previously failed to comply with the physician consultation requirement. The ALJ also assessed the facility\u2019s culpability based on the undisputed facts supporting the findings of noncompliance under \u00a7 483.10(b)(ll) and \u00a7 483.25(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The DAB adopted the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s history of noncompliance and culpability justified the $800 per day penalty. It also rejected Senior Rehabilitation\u2019s challenge to the duration of the penalty period \u2014 from June 2, 2008 through July 15, 2008 \u2014 because Senior Rehabilitation had \u201cnot presented evidence that, prior to July 16, 2008, it implemented all of the measures necessary to ensure that similar violations of the participation requirements would not recur.\u201d In its brief before this court, Senior Rehabilitation merely recites the same arguments rejected by the DAB. The DAB\u2019s determination as to the reasonableness of the civil monetary penalty was not arbitrary, capricious, in violation of the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b847-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\">. Although Senior Rehabilitation argues that this court\u2019s review is <em>de novo </em>because it appeals a grant of summary judgment, this court applies the same heightened deference standard to an appeal from an entry of summary judgment. <em>Cedar Lake, </em>619 F.3d at 457.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
