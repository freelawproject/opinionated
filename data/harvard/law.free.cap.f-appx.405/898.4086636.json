Marquez was sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines imprisonment range to a 57-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release. Marquez gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Marquez contends that he did not enter a guilty plea to count 5 of the indictment. He contends, in the alternative, that the factual basis for his plea was inadequate. We have reviewed these contentions, which were not raised in the trial court, for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Marquez has not shown that his substantial rights were affected by any error of the magistrate judge during the rearraignment hearing or that the district court plainly erred in accepting his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <em>see also United States v. Shum, </em>496 F.3d 390, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">Marquez contends that his sentence must be vacated in light of <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010). This error was not raised below and is therefore reviewed for plain error. <em>See Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043. Marquez\u2019s argument is based on an extension of <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>and, therefore, cannot involve a clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 319 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">Marquez argues that the district court erred by increasing his guidelines offense level, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b), because of a number of various specific offense characteristics. \u201cAlthough ... the [Sentencing] Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory guidelines sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 362 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-19\">Marquez\u2019s overriding complaint is that the district court relied improperly on mul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>tiple layers of unreliable hearsay evidence in increasing his offense level based on the various offense characteristics. Marquez notes that the presentence report (PSR) was prepared and that a Government witness, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent John Flores, testified at the sentencing hearing on the basis of the material witness statements and of the statement of Marquez\u2019s codefendant, Santiago Cisneros Diaz (Cisneros). Marquez contends in conclusional fashion that the witness statements are unreliable on their face. He notes also that the statements were taken in Spanish and were transcribed in English. If the witnesses could not understand English, he contends, they could not have understood what they were doing when they certified that the representations in the written statements were true and correct. These contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Ordinarily, this court reviews a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d at 362. To the extent that Marquez did not object to the district court\u2019s guidelines calculation, review is for plain error. <em>See id. </em>In his reply brief, Marquez contends that his written objections to the sentencing enhancements and his hearsay objection were sufficient to preserve error.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Marquez did assert a hearsay objection to Flores\u2019s testimony, but it was not predicated on the unreliability of the evidence. Instead, it was based on a denial of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Marquez did adopt generally the arguments of one of his codefendants, Leonardo Juarez-Torres (Juarez). Although Juarez argued that the evidence considered by the probation officer was unreliable, his argument differed from the argument asserted by Marquez in this appeal. Therefore, we' have reviewed for plain error the question whether the district court erred in considering unreliable hearsay evidence at sentencing. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">At sentencing, a district court may consider any information, including hearsay, that bears sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy, and a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights at sentencing are severely restricted. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>271 F.3d 611, 612-13 (5th Cir.2001). The PSR is considered to be reliable and may be considered by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 613. The defendant bears the burden of proving that the district court should not rely on the PSR. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 248 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIf no relevant affidavits or other evidence is submitted to rebut the information contained in the PSR, the court is free to adopt its findings without further inquiry or explanation.\u201d <em>United States v. Reasor, </em>541 F.3d 366, 369 (5th Cir.2008). Marquez and his codefendants offered no evidence to rebut the facts in the PSR and made no attempt to demonstrate that those facts were materially untrue or unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Consequently, those facts were properly considered by the district court in applying the Guidelines. <em>See Ramirez, </em>271 F.3d at 612-13. We note also that the district court properly held Marquez responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>for the reasonably foreseeable acts of Cisneros, Juarez, and others involved in the smuggling and harboring scheme. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">For those reasons, the district court did not err in finding that Marquez harbored an unaccompanied minor (\u00a7 2L1.1(b)(4)) or in finding that a dangerous weapon was brandished or otherwise used during the offense (\u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(B)). <em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 504-07 (5th Cir.) (recognizing that a BB gun is a dangerous weapon that is capable of inflicting serious bodily injury), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2450, 174 L.Ed.2d 240 (2009); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(C)) (definition of \u201cbrandishment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Nor did the district court err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), as Marquez is responsible for the reasonably foreseeable acts of Cisneros in pointing a dangerous weapon at the heads of the undocumented aliens. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). We have little difficulty in determining that these actions created a substantial risk of death of serious bodily injury. <em>See Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d at 507. Contrary to Marquez\u2019s argument, the guidelines enhancement is not limited to cases involving transportation of undocumented aliens. <em>See United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir.2005); \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5). Assuming arguendo that the district court plainly erred by imposing the (b)(6) enhancement based on the same conduct it considered in imposing the (b)(5) enhancement, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2L1.1, comment. (n.5), a challenge Marquez raises for the first time on appeal, such error did not affect Marquez\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 413, 416-17 (5th Cir.2010). The record does not reflect that the district court would have given Marquez a lower sentence if it had sentenced Marquez pursuant to the \u201ccorrect\u201d sentencing range. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Likewise, the district court did not err in imposing the two-level increase under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7)(A) because the undocumented aliens sustained cuts on their knees during the offense. <em>See United States v. Eubanks, </em>593 F.3d 645, 651-52 (7th Cir.2010). Nor did it err in applying \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(8)(A) because the undocumented aliens were forced to pay an additional $500 if they wanted to leave the residence, or they would be returned to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Finally, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2) because the offense involved 12 undocumented aliens. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d at 362. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. Marquez invoked <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 50-59, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (holding that the Confrontation Clause prohibits admission of an out-of-court testimonial statement unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross examination). Because the rule in <em>Crawford </em>does not apply in sentencing proceedings, the issue asserted in the district court is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Beydoun, </em>469 F.3d 102, 108 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Fields, </em>483 F.3d 313, 331-32 &amp; n. 20 (5th Cir.2007). It is not asserted on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
