The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, dismissed Roberts\u2019s claims, and denied her request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. She now moves to proceed IFP in this court. We DENY IFP status, DISMISS the appeal as frivolous, and DENY all other motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Roberts began working for Unitrin on September 8, 2003, as a marketing manager; shortly after she arrived at Unitrin, James Dickey became her supervisor. In April or May 2004, Roberts was assigned to correct problems with the \u201cTexas Contract Project,\u201d which was an ongoing, highly visible project that had been rife with problems. Roberts contends that her supervisors blamed her for the failure of the project, although she allegedly was not responsible for its continued failures. On April 15, 2004, Cliff Shumway, a sales manager, allegedly \u201cverbally assaulted\u201d her; she reported the incident to Dan Maloney, vice president of human resources, on April 29, 2004. On May 24, 2004, Shumway again allegedly verbally attacked her. On May 29, 2004, Dickey allegedly transferred 50% of Roberts\u2019s job duties to Mike Bascue; Roberts did not suffer any loss of pay as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Roberts further alleges that on June 4 and 15, 2004, Roberts injured her back at work. At some point in early June 2004, Dickey removed a project from Roberts, and Roberts heard Shumway say he won a bet that the project would be removed from her. On June 21, 2004, Roberts sent an email to Maloney complaining about the work environment. On June 23, 2004, Dickey, Larry Kufel, and Shumway made a presentation to management blaming Roberts, and Dickey interrogated her and brought her to tears. On July 7, 2004, Dickey issued a disciplinary action notice to Roberts, requiring her to complete seven large projects by July 30, 2004, or be terminated. Roberts worked from home due to pain on July 23, 2004, and never returned to work. She began receiving short-term disability benefits on July 26, 2004, and thereafter her ability to check voicemail and emails was cut off, her telephone extension was deleted, and her direct reports were transferred. In January 2005, Unitrin notified Roberts that her short-term leave would expire on January 21, 2005, and that she was required to return to work by January 24, 2005, or she would be terminated. Roberts did not return to work and produced a doctor\u2019s note to the effect that she was unable to return to work. Unitrin contends that she was terminated on January 31, 2005 for failure to comply with its return to work policy following a period of short-term disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">Roberts\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Thus, her request \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">This court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). Under the version of Rule 56 in effect at the time of the district court\u2019s judgment, summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">A. Title VII Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">1. Time Bar and Continuing Violations Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Roberts first claims that the district court erred in determining that conduct that occurred prior to June 18, 2004, was time barred because it occurred greater than 300 days from the date that Roberts filed her complaint with the EEOC. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 109, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002); <em>see also Huckabay v. Moore, </em>142 F.3d 233, 238 (5th Cir.1998). She alleges that that conduct is not time barred based on the continuing violations doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">The continuing violations doctrine is an equitable doctrine that extends the limitations period on otherwise time-barred claims when the unlawful employment practice in question \u201cmanifests itself over time, rather than as a series of discrete acts.\u201d <em>Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 279 (5th Cir.2004). This court has noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">the core idea [of the continuing violation theory] is that equitable considerations may very well require that the filing periods not begin to run until facts supportive of a Title VII charge or civil rights action are or should be apparent to a reasonably prudent person similarly situated. The focus is on what event, in fairness and logic, should have alerted the average lay person to act to protect his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-13\"><em>Glass v. Petro-Tex Chem. Corp., </em>757 F.2d 1554, 1560-61 (5th Cir.1985) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">The parties dispute here whether Roberts raised that argument in the district court. Regardless of whether it was properly raised in the district court, the continuing violations doctrine is not applicable here because Roberts acknowledged that she was aware of her Title VII rights on July 26, 2004, when she signed a document entitled \u201cDecision Not to File or to Drop Issues\u201d after being interviewed by an EEOC investigator. Thus, defendants\u2019 alleged discriminatory practices did not manifest themselves over time, and the continuing violations theory is therefore not relevant here. <em>See Pegram, </em>361 F.3d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-15\">Roberts\u2019s remaining Title VII discrimination claims are without merit because she has failed to set forth a prima face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>case of discrimination with respect to all conduct other than her termination, and with respect to her termination, she has failed to show that defendants\u2019 reason for her discharge, her failure to return to work after her short-term leave expired, was a pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">2. Absence of Evidence That Reason for Termination Was Pretextual</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment decisions on the basis of \u201crace, color, religion, sex or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Absent direct proof of discrimination, a plaintiff may assemble proof via circumstantial evidence using the framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). \u201cFirst, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, the employer must respond with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. This burden on the employer is only one of production, not persuasion, involving no credibility assessments.\u201d <em>Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture, </em>235 F.3d 219, 222 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If the employer meets its burden of production, the plaintiff must then offer evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext or is only one of the reasons for the employer\u2019s conduct and the plaintiffs protected characteristic is another motivating factor. <em>Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, Inc., </em>482 F.3d 408, 412 (5th Cir.2007). A reason is pretextual if it is false, \u201cunworthy of credence,\u201d or otherwise unpersuasive. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, a plaintiff must show that she is a member of a protected class; is qualified for the job; suffered an adverse employment action by the employer; and was either replaced by someone outside her protected group or received less favorable treatment than a similarly situated individual outside the protected group. <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">With respect to conduct other than her termination, Roberts has failed to show that she suffered an adverse employment action because none of the post-June 18, 2004 conduct constituted an \u201cultimate employment decision,\u201d which includes hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, or compensating. <em>See Burger v. Cent. Apartment Mgmt., Inc., </em>168 F.3d 875, 878 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also Hernandez v. Crawford Bldg. Material Co., </em>321 F.3d 528, 532 n. 2 (5th Cir.2003) (noting that \u201cremoval of employee\u2019s name from letterhead, ostracism by coworkers, and loss of some job duties\u201d are not ultimate employment decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">With respect to her termination, assuming for the sake of argument that Roberts has set forth a prima facie case of sex discrimination,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Roberts has not shown that Unitrin\u2019s reason for her termination was a pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Specifically, the record reflects that Unitrin\u2019s policy was to terminate any employee who did not return to work after his or her qualified leave had expired and that it consistently enforced that policy. The record also reflects that Roberts was terminated because she failed to return to work after her short-term disability leave expired and that Roberts admitted that she was unable to return to work after her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>leave expired. Roberts has set forth no evidence that Unitrin\u2019s reason for her termination was false, unworthy of credence, or otherwise unpersuasive, <em>see Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097, or that her sex was a motivating factor in her termination. <em>See Burrell, </em>482 F.3d at 412.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">3. Constructive Discharge and Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Roberts\u2019s constructive discharge claim is without merit because she was terminated; she did not resign. <em>See Brown v. Bunge Corp. </em>207 F.3d 776, 782 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cWhen an employee resigns, he may satisfy the discharge requirement by proving constructive discharge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Roberts\u2019s Title VII retaliation claims also fail. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, \u201ca plaintiff must show that (1) she participated in a Title VII protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action by her employer, and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Miss. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>586 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir.2009). With respect to the third element, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant knew about her protected activity. <em>See Manning v. Chevron Chem. Co., </em>332 F.3d 874, 884 (5th Cir.2003). The causation element may be proved by temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action when they occur \u201cvery close\u201d in time. <em>Washburn v. Harvey, </em>504 F.3d 505, 511 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">An adverse employment action is one that \u201ca reasonable employee would have found ... [to be] materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (quotation marks omitted). A Title VII retaliation case is also subject to the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas. LeMaire v. Louisiana, </em>480 F.3d 383, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">The only adverse employment action that Roberts has identified is her termination; the transfer of some of her job duties to Bascue is not an adverse employment action under these circumstances, particularly in light of the fact that Roberts acknowledges that she was overworked prior to the transfer. <em>Cf. Stewart, </em>586 F.3d at 332-33 (evaluating whether allegedly retaliatory acts were \u201cadverse\u201d in light of surrounding facts and noting that \u201c \u2018the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances\u2019 \u201d) (citing and quoting <em>White, </em>548 U.S. at 69, 71, 126 S.Ct. 2405). Assuming for the sake of argument that she engaged in protected activity (1) when she reported Shumway\u2019s assault to Maloney on April 29, 2004; (2) when she reported Shumway\u2019s assault to Maloney on June 21, 2004, (3) when she reported her back injury to Dickey on June 23, 2004, and (4) when she reported to Dickey regarding Shumway\u2019s bet about her, she has failed to establish a causal connection between the protected activities and her termination. The record reveals that Roberts was terminated on January 31, 2005. Thus, she was terminated approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>nine months after she alleges that she first complained about Shumway and approximately eight months after she alleges that she next complained about Shumway, complained to Dickey regarding her back injury, and complained about Shumway\u2019s bet. The several-month spans between the alleged protected activities and her termination negate any argument that a causal connection existed between the activities and the termination. <em>See Washburn, </em>504 F.3d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">4. Hostile Work Environment</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Roberts\u2019s claims that she was subjected to a hostile work environment when Dickey allegedly stated that the marketing department would be better off without females; when Dickey hired Bascue to replace her; when Shumway verbally attacked her twice and acted violent toward other females; when Dickey and Shumway referred to her as \u201cpoor Traci\u201d; when Dickey, Shumway, and Kufel blamed her for the problems with the Texas Contract Project; and when Dickey gave her \u201cphysically demanding workloads\u201d and threatened to fire her are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">To prevail on a hostile work environment claim, Roberts must establish that: \u201c(1) [she] belongs to a protected class; (2) was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment was based on [her] sex; (4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of [her] employment; and (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take remedial action.\u201d <em>Mota v. Univ. of Tex. Hous. Health Sci. Ctr., </em>261 F.3d 512, 523 (5th Cir.2001). To affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment, the harassing conduct \u201c \u2018must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the victim\u2019s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meritor Sav. Bank FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">At the very least, Roberts has failed to establish that any harassment was based on her sex. <em>See Mota, </em>261 F.3d at 523. She has established nothing more than \u201csimple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents\u201d that do not rise to the level of actionable harassment. <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">B. ADA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">Roberts has not shouldered her burden with respect to her ADA claims. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish the following: (1) she suffers from a disability; (2) she is qualified for the job despite the disability; (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action due to the disability; and (4) she was treated less favorably than non-disabled employees. <em>McInnis v. Alamo Cmty. Coll. Dist., </em>207 F.3d 276, 279-80 (5th Cir.2000). However, even assuming that one has a disability, to be a qualified individual with a disability, the plaintiff must be \u201can individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Under the ADA, a covered employer must provide \u201creasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the employer] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The record in the instant case reflects that Roberts has not established that she is a qualified individual with a disability because she has not shown that she can perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodations. On January 10, 2005, her doctor stated that she was \u201cunable to function at work,\u201d and \u201cwhen she can return to work is unknown-certainly not for another 4 to 6 weeks probably.\u201d Moreover, on January 20, 2005, Roberts conceded that she could not return to work. Roberts has produced no evidence showing that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job as marketing manager with or without reasonable accommodations; thus, even if she had a disability, she has not shown that she is a qualified individual with a disability. <em>See, e.g., Rogers v. Int\u2019l Marine Terminals, Inc., </em>87 F.3d 755, 759 (5th Cir.1996) (noting that the ability to appear for work is an essential element of any job and that a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d does not require an employer to wait an indefinite period of time for the employee\u2019s medical condition to improve).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Roberts\u2019s ADA retaliation claim is likewise without merit. To make a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, Roberts must demonstrate that: (1) she engaged in protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action occurred, and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Even if Roberts has satisfied the first and second elements of her prima facie case of ADA retaliation, her claim fails because the record establishes that Roberts was terminated for her failure to return to work after her leave expired. Thus, she cannot show a causal connection between her participation in a protected activity and her termination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">C. FMLA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Roberts alleged that her FMLA rights were violated because she was denied FMLA leave after she was eligible for and requested it. The FMLA entitles eligible employees to 12 workweeks of leave in any 12-month period for various qualifying events, including a \u201cserious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions\u201d of her position. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). An employee is \u201celigible\u201d for FMLA leave if the employee has been employed \u201c(i) for at least 12 months by the employer ... and (ii) for at least 1,250 hours of service with such employer during the previous 12-month period.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The record reveals that when Roberts first took leave on July 26, 2004, she had only been employed by Unitrin for 11 months; thus, she was not eligible for FMLA leave. <em>See id. </em>When Roberts allegedly requested FMLA leave in December 2004, she was eligible for FMLA leave, <em>see id., </em>but she had already been on leave for greater than 12 weeks, or for approximately 20 weeks. Thus, she was not entitled to additional FMLA leave at that point. <em>Cf. Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, </em>535 U.S. 81, 96, 122 S.Ct. 1155, 152 L.Ed.2d 167 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">Roberts\u2019s FMLA retaliation claim likewise fails. Retaliation claims under the FMLA are analyzed using the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, </em>277 F.3d 757, 768 (5th Cir.2001). To make a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under the FMLA, the plaintiff must show that: \u201c(1) she was protected under the FMLA; (2) she suffered an adverse employment deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>sion; and either (3a) that she was treated less favorably than an employee who had not required leave under the FMLA; or (3b) the adverse decision was made because she took FMLA leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Once the plaintiff makes a <em>prima facie </em>showing, the burden shifts to the defendant \u201cto articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory or nonretaliatory reason for the employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the defendant makes such a showing, the plaintiff \u201cmust show by a preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant\u2019s] reason is a pretext for retaliation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Roberts\u2019s FMLA retaliation claims are without merit because, as shown above, at the very least, she has failed to show that she was entitled to FMLA leave. <em>See id. </em>Thus, she has failed to establish a prima facie case for FMLA retaliation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">D. ERISA,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> HIPAA,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and COBRA<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Roberts claims that her ERISA, HI-PAA, and COBRA rights were violated because Unitrin retaliated against her by cancelling her COBRA benefits after Unitrin \u201cwas served with\u201d her EEOC charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">\u201cTo establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under ERISA, a plaintiff must establish that his employer [discriminated against him] in retaliation for exercising an ERISA right or to prevent attainment of benefits to which he would have become entitled under an employee benefit plan.\u201d <em>Holtzclaw v. DSC Commc\u2019ns Corp., </em>255 F.3d 254, 260 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cAn essential element of a [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140] claim is proof of [the] defendant\u2019s specific discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Hines v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>43 F.3d 207, 209 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Roberts cannot prevail on this claim because she has failed to establish that defendants acted with specific discriminatory intent. When her benefits were cancelled in June and July 2005, she was no longer employed at Unitrin, and her benefits were promptly reinstated. Moreover, Roberts has not shown any causal connection between defendants\u2019 alleged receipt of her EEOC charge and the cancellation of her benefits because she has failed to show that the person who cancelled her benefits had knowledge of her EEOC charge. <em>See Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co., </em>238 F.3d 674, 684 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that a plaintiff can establish a causal link by showing that \u201cthe employer\u2019s decision ... was based in part on knowledge of the employee\u2019s protected activity\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">Roberts\u2019s HIPAA claims are without merit because HIPAA does not provide her with a private cause of action. <em>Acara v. Banks, </em>470 F.3d 569, 572 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">E. Motion to Reconsider and Motion for Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">A review of the record establishes that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Roberts\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which attached copies of \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence or evidence that she inadvertently failed to attach to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>her opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, because she failed to demonstrate that \u201c(1) the facts discovered are of such a nature that they would probably change the outcome; (2) the facts alleged are actually newly discovered and could not have been discovered earlier by proper diligence; and (3) the facts are not merely cumulative or impeaching.\u201d <em>See Infusion Res., Inc. v. Minimed, Inc., </em>351 F.3d 688, 696-97 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Roberts\u2019s complaint that the district court improperly sanctioned her because she was punished for a mistake \u201cthat had no ill intent\u201d regarding the incorrect date stamp on one of her filings in the district court is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">A district court\u2019s sua sponte imposition of sanctions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Goldin v. Bartholow, </em>166 F.3d 710, 722 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cGenerally, an abuse of discretion only occurs where no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.\u201d <em>Friends for Am. Free Enter. Ass\u2019n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>284 F.3d 575, 578 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The district court sanctioned Roberts after hearing live testimony that one of Roberts\u2019s filings in the district court was date stamped June 13, 2008 (a filing deadline imposed by the district court), but that that document was not found in the court\u2019s drop box until June 17, 2008. Roberts explained that the date stamp did not correspond with the date that the filing was placed in the drop box because after date stamping the document on June 13, 2008, Roberts\u2019s sister discovered that Roberts had not signed the pleading; her sister therefore did not drop the pleading in the drop box until June 17, 2008, after Roberts signed it. Based on this testimony, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">F. Other Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Roberts has failed to present any argument in support of her claims that the district court erred in denying her motion for a continuance of the summary judgment hearing, her motion requesting pretrial discovery management, and the agreed motion to continue and to modify the scheduling order; she has therefore failed to adequately brief these arguments. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">With respect to Roberts\u2019s motion to compel discovery, she has failed to show that the district court, which denied her discovery motion because defendants had not been properly served with the discovery, abused its discretion. <em>See Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>392 F.3d 812, 817 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s discovery rulings, including the denial of a motion to compel, for abuse of discretion. We will affirm such decisions unless they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable.\u201d (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted)). Likewise, with respect to Roberts\u2019s motion to modify the scheduling order, she has failed to show that good cause existed for modifying that order; accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying that motion. <em>See S &amp; W Enters., L.L.C. v. SouthTrust Bank of Ala., </em>315 F.3d 533, 535-36 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Roberts\u2019s appeal does not involve legal points that are arguable on the merits, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220, and her IFP motion is therefore denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 197. Because the resolution of Roberts\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s certification order requires resolution of the merits of her appeal, the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See id.; see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Roberts\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, for a stay of the sanctions order, for free transcripts, and for referral to the appellate mediation program are denied. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b902-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

Unitrin argues that Roberts was not replaced with someone outside the protected class. Because we conclude that Roberts failed to establish that Unitrin\u2019s proffered reason for discharging her was pretextual, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-9\">. Roberts cites a remote-in-time statement by Dickey that he liked to have men in managerial positions as support for her claim of sex discrimination. However, because Roberts was ultimately terminated by the human resources department for failing to return to work, rather than by Dickey for her performance deficiencies, we need not address whether this alleged statement provides evidence of Dickey\u2019s discriminatory intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">.
