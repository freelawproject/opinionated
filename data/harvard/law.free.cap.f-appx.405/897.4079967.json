The district court recharacterized Calderon\u2019s petition as a petition for a writ of mandamus because Calderon was requesting that the district court issue an order directing a Florida state court in- the performance of its duties. Because Calderon did not challenge the manner in which his federal sentence was being executed, the district court did not err in recharacterizing Calderon\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a petition for a writ of mandamus. <em>See Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 694 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cSection 2241 ... is the proper habeas remedy for challenging the execution of a sentence.\u201d). Nor did the district court err in dismissing it. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, De Kalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1275-76 (5th Cir.1973) (\u201c[A] federal court lacks the general power to issue writs of mandamus to direct state courts and their judicial officers in the performance of their duties where mandamus is the only relief sought.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Calderon\u2019s request that we vacate and remand for an evidentiary hearing is DENIED. To the extent that Calderon requests mandamus relief from this court, the request also is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
