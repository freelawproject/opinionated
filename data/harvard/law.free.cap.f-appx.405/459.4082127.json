Holbrook, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of her complaint and the denial of her motions for default judgment against Defendants. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Holbrook filed a complaint against Castle Key Insurance Company, the Florida Attorney General, and the United States Attorney General. She complained generally about the outcome of an insurance claim she made and the lack of response from the many persons she contacted about it. Because of the complaint\u2019s vague allegations, the district court ordered Holbrook to amend her complaint to provide a more definite statement and to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8. The court also explained to Holbrook how to file an appropriate complaint and advised her that failure to comply with its order could result in the dismissal of her complaint. Holbrook failed to amend her complaint as ordered, despite being given two opportunities to do so. The district court dismissed the complaint, without prejudice, for failure to comply with Rule 8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">On appeal, Holbrook argues that her complaint adequately was pleaded and that the district court should have granted her motions for default judgment against Defendants because they failed to respond to her complaint. We review orders dismissing complaints based on non-compliance for an abuse of discretion. <em>Goforth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985). And we also review the denial of a default judgment for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1316 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">Rule 8 requires that a pleading contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). The district court has the inherent authority <em>sua sponte </em>to require the plaintiff to file a more definite statement. <em>Fikes v. City of Daphne, </em>79 F.3d 1079, 1083 n. 6 (11th Cir.1996). Where the allegations of a complaint are \u201cvague and ambiguous \u2014 leaving the reader to guess at precisely what the plaintiff [is] claiming,\u201d the court should order a repleader. <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1128-31 (11th Cir.2001) (stressing the district court\u2019s responsibility to halt the use of \u201cshotgun\u201d pleadings).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">The nature of Holbrook\u2019s legal claims against the named defendants and the factual basis for such claims were incomprehensible: far short of the \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement requirement of Rule 8. Although Holbrook referenced many people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and many legal terms, she did not describe how each defendant injured her or point to the laws under which she was asserting a cause of action. And she failed to remedy these deficiencies even upon explicit instruction by the district court on how to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in ordering Holbrook to file a more comprehensible complaint and in ultimately dismissing the complaint upon Holbrook\u2019s noncompliance. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(e) (noting that \u201c[i]f the court orders a more definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days after notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The court also abused no discretion in denying Holbrook\u2019s motions for default judgment. The entry of a default judgment is required \u201c[wjhen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). While it is true that Defendants filed no responsive pleading within the general time for doing so, the court specifically relieved Defendants of this obligation in the light of the complaint\u2019s deficiencies. This act was consistent with the court\u2019s obligation to ensure compliance with the pleading requirements of Rule 8. <em>See Byrne, </em>261 F.3d at 1129. And because Holbrook did not cure the pleading deficiencies, Defendants never became obligated to file a responsive pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">. In its order, the district court also stated that it was dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim. Whether the court had the authority <em>sua sponte </em>to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is unclear. <em>See Jefferson Fourteenth Assocs. v. Wometco de Puerto Rico, Inc., </em>695 F.2d 524, 526-27 (11th Cir.1983) (prohibiting the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a claim as meritless under Rule 12(b)(6) where the district court did not provide plaintiff certain procedural safeguards). But this distinction does not bear on the outcome of this appeal because (1) the court\u2019s order also clearly dismissed the complaint for noncompliance; and (2) the court's dismissal for noncompliance was, as discussed, not in error. We may affirm on any ground supported in the record. <em>See Trotter v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>535 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. Although courts must liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, this obligation \u201cis not the equivalent of a duty to re-write [a complaint] for [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Snow v.
