Laurent, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of her employment discrimination suit against John E. Potter, the Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service (USPS) for failure to perfect service on him in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(i) and (m). Laurent also appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of individual USPS employees Kevin Cullen and Kathy Brantley as improper defendants. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Laurent first asserts the district court erred in dismissing her complaint against Potter for failing to comply with Fed. R.Civ.P. 4 because she committed a technical error, which was excused by the defendants\u2019 initial acknowledgment that they were properly served.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) allows a court to sua sponte dismiss an action without prejudice, or order that service be made at a specific time, if a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). Service of the United States, in relevant part, requires the following: (1) delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the U.S. Attorney for the district where the action originated, or to an AUSA whom the U.S. Attorney designated in writing; and (2) mailing by registered or certified mail a copy of the summons and complaint to the Attorney General in Washington, D.C. <em>Id. </em>4(i)(l). Service of an official requires sending a copy of the summons and the complaint by registered or certified mail to the official. <em>Id. </em>4(i)(2). \u201cA defendant\u2019s actual notice is not sufficient to cure defectively executed service.\u201d <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Laurent\u2019s Title VII complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(i) and (m). The record shows Laurent repeatedly failed to effectuate service on Potter, in spite of receiving detailed instructions regarding proper service from the court and having at least two opportunities to properly serve him. Moreover, the fact that Potter may have had actual notice of the pending suit does not excuse Laurent\u2019s defectively executed service. <em>See Albra, </em>490 F.3d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">Laurent next contends the district court erred in dismissing Cullen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Brantley from her complaint because their alleged conduct was the basis for filing an employment discrimination lawsuit against USPS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Title VII provides that the \u201chead of the department, agency, or unit\u201d that allegedly discriminated against the plaintiff \u201cshall be the defendant\u201d in any civil action by a federal employee claiming discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c); <em>see Newbold v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>614 F.2d 46, 47 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that an individual employee was not a proper defendant in a Title VII suit against the USPS).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The district court did not commit plain error in dismissing Cullen and Brantley from Laurent\u2019s Title VII complaint because Potter, the head of the agency, was the only proper defendant. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Laurent\u2019s complaint, and the court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Cullen and Brantley as improper defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\">. We review for abuse of discretion the district court's dismissal without prejudice of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to properly serve a defendant under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). <em>Lepone-Dempsey v. Carroll Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>476 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. We review dismissals under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) de novo. <em>Clark v. Riley, </em>595 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010) (addressing Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals); <em>Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (addressing Rule 12(b)(1) dismissals). We review for plain error, however, when a party fails to object to a magistrate\u2019s report that is subsequently adopted by the district court, if the report notifies the parties of the consequences of failing to object. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., </em>996 F.2d 1144, 1149 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
