Winding, Mississippi prisoner # K8115, appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law and his motion for a new trial with a jury, which challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. Winding argues that the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment as a matter of law was not supported by the facts or law. He contends that he can prove that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference because they knew that Winding was housed with an inmate with a violent history and failed to take steps to protect him from harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Winding\u2019s postjudgment Federal Rule Civil Procedure 59(e) motion merely disputed the magistrate judge\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions based on the evidence presented at his trial. Rule 59(e) cannot be used to rehash the evidence \u201cor make arguments that could have been offered or raised before the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Templet v. HydroChem Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 478-79 (5th Cir.2004). Windings\u2019s assertions in his motion did not demonstrate any grounds for relief under Rule 59(e), such as a manifest error of law or fact or the discovery of new evidence. <em>See Waltman v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>875 F.2d 468, 473 (5th Cir.1989). The district court did not abuse its discretion' in denying the postjudgment motion because Winding did not raise any challenges entitling him to relief under Rule 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Further, Winding\u2019s challenge to the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his request to reconsider his findings of fact and conclusion of law require this court to review a transcript of the trial. Winding\u2019s failure to provide a transcript may be the basis for the dismissal of the entire appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(2); Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2); <em>Richardson v. Henry, </em>902 F.2d 414, 416 (5th Cir.1990). Windings\u2019s pro se and in forma pauperis status does not preclude consideration of his initial representation to the court that he did not require a transcript to pursue his appeal nor excuse his failure to seek the transcript from this court until after filing his brief. <em>See Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>910 F.2d 234, 237 (5th Cir.1990) The lack of a transcript is an additional consideration in dismissing this appeal as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">? argues that the magistrate judge erred in denying his postjudgment motion for a new jury trial. Winding expressly waived his Federal Rule Civil Procedure 38 right to a jury trial and did not move prior to trial to withdraw the waiver pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 39. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Winding\u2019s request for a jury trial made in a postjudgment motion. <em>See Daniel Intern. Corp. v. Fischbach &amp; Moore, Inc., </em>916 F.2d 1061, 1064 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">Winding has failed to raise issues of arguable merit. His appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of the IFP provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Winding is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). The court notes that the recent dismissal as frivolous of Winding\u2019s appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>in <em>Winding v. The Geo Group, Inc., </em>405 Fed.Appx. 988, 2010 WL 5299869 (5th Cir.2010) constituted another strike under \u00a7 1915(g) strike against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Winding has filed a motion for appointment of counsel, arguing that he is without funds to investigate his claims and that he does not have the skills and knowledge to proceed with his case. The court may appoint counsel in a \u00a7 1983 case upon a showing of exceptional circumstances. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Winding has not made a showing of exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of counsel. The motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Winding has also filed a motion to strike the appellees\u2019 briefs because the defendants did not file a response to his motion for judgment as a matter of law and his motion for new trial filed in the district court. Winding has not shown any valid legal basis for the court to strike the appellees\u2019 briefs. The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
