In his petition, King alleged that he was denied his counsel of choice, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights as articulated in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). King argues that the district court erred in determining that he had not met the requirements for proceeding under \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">To challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence through a \u00a7 2241 petition, King must affirmatively show that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). This requires him to make a showing of both actual innocence and retroactivity. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 903-04. Specifically, he must establish that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">King devotes his brief to the argument that <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>should apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. He makes no argument that he is actually innocent. Moreover, <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>does not establish that his convictions are for nonexistent offenses. <em>See </em>548 U.S. at 151-52, 126 S.Ct. 2557. Therefore, we do not reach the question whether <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review because King cannot meet his burden regardless. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(h); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 897-98. King is CAUTIONED that future attempts to circumvent the successive-motion requirements of \u00a7 2255 will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
