We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Dukes co-founded the Financial Warfare Club and Covenant EcoNet, Inc., which sold memberships in a purported investment club to African Americans. The FBI and SEC investigated Dukes and ultimately instituted civil and criminal actions against him. The criminal action proceeded first, and Dukes was convicted of mail fraud and money laundering and sentenced to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. Dukes\u2019s attempts to challenge the conviction \u2014 both on appeal and in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u2014 were unsuccessful. At the conclusion of the criminal action, the civil action resumed, and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted summary judgment to the SEC on its claims that Dukes committed fraud and violated the Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Dukes then filed this action. In his second amended complaint, which is at issue in this appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he asserted claims arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). More specifically, he raised two claims: (1) several attorneys and an accountant employed by the SEC (\u201cthe SEC defendants\u201d) created a spreadsheet for the criminal prosecution cataloging Dukes\u2019s companies\u2019 financial transactions and violated his rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by refusing to disclose the spreadsheet to the prosecution or Dukes; and (2) an SEC defendant and Maryland\u2019s assistant attorney general made and continue to make defamatory statements about Dukes\u2019s businesses, thus undermining his efforts to recover lost money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The District Court permitted Dukes to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>but then rejected both claims and dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). The Court concluded that any amendment would be futile and thus dismissed the complaint without providing leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">We discern no error in the District Court\u2019s ruling that Dukes\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim fails. While <em>Brady </em>claims are typically directed against prosecutors, we have suggested that other government actors may be liable for failing to disclose exculpatory information to the prosecutor, <em>see Yarris v. County of Delaware, </em>465 F.3d 129, 141 (3d Cir.2006), and we assume here that the SEC defendants represent a proper target. Nevertheless, a meritorious <em>Brady </em>claim, by definition, implies the invalidity of the attendant criminal conviction. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (\u201c[TJhere is never a real <em>\u2018Brady </em>violation\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.\u201d). Dukes\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim is therefore barred by the rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See, e.g., Amaker v. Weiner, </em>179 F.3d 48, 51 (2d Cir.1999) (holding that <em>Brady </em>claims implicate the validity of the resulting conviction and are thus barred by Heck).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Dukes seeks to avoid this result by arguing that while this spreadsheet would have been helpful to him, further proceedings are necessary before it can be determined whether its suppression was sufficiently prejudicial to call his criminal verdict into question. However, this argument cuts both ways. If there is not a \u201creasonable probability that his conviction or sentence would have been different had these materials been disclosed,\u201d then there has been no <em>Brady </em>violation, <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 296, 119 S.Ct. 1936, and Dukes has failed to plead the underlying constitutional violation necessary to make out a <em>Bivens </em>claim, <em>see Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999. Accordingly, under either scenario, Dukes\u2019s claim cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We also affirm the District Court\u2019s alternative holding that there was no <em>Brady </em>violation because the information Dukes claims the government withheld was known by and available to him. \u201c[T]he rationale underlying <em>Brady </em>is not to supply a defendant with all the evidence in the Government\u2019s possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of his defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence <em>only knoim to the Government.\u201d United States v. Zackson, </em>6 F.3d 911, 918 (2d Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis added). Therefore, <em>\u201cBrady </em>does not compel the government to furnish a defendant with information which he already has or, with any reasonable diligence, he can obtain himself.\u201d <em>United States v. Pelullo, </em>399 F.3d 197, 213 (3d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Dukes does not allege that he was unaware of or unable to obtain information concerning the financial transactions cataloged in the spreadsheet; to the contrary, as the District Court noted, in his criminal appeal he acknowledged that he had access to relevant bank records before trial. <em>See United States v. Dukes, </em>242 Fed.Appx. 37, 49 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Dixon, </em>132 F.3d 192, 199 (5th Cir.1997) (no <em>Brady </em>violation when government seized defendants\u2019 financial records because defendants either knew or should have known about this information). While Dukes may have found it more convenient to work from the government\u2019s spreadsheet than from the raw financial information that he either already had or could have acquired with reasonable diligence, <em>Brady </em>does not require the government \u201cto facilitate the compilation of exculpatory material that, with some industry, defense counsel could marshal on their own.\u201d <em>United States v. Runyan, </em>290 F.3d 223, 246 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">? likewise agree with the District Court that Dukes\u2019s defamation claim lacks merit. \u201cThe Supreme Court has made clear that federal courts are not to view defamatory acts as constitutional violations.\u201d <em>Boyanowski v. Capital Area Intermediate Unit, </em>215 F.3d 396, 400 (3d Cir.2000). This bar applies even where the plaintiff claims that the defamatory statement caused financial injury. <em>See Kelly v. Borough of Sayreville, </em>107 F.3d 1073, 1078 (3d Cir.1997). Therefore, Dukes\u2019s defama<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tion claim fails as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Finally, we are satisfied that further amendment to Dukes\u2019s complaint would be futile, and therefore conclude that the District Court properly dismissed the complaint without providing leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002). We will thus summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Dukes\u2019s second amended complaint. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">. It is unclear whether Dukes continues to assert claims that he included in his first amended complaint but omitted from his second amended complaint. To the extent that those claims have not been waived, <em>see United States ex rel. Atkinson v. PA. Shipbuilding Co., </em>473 F.3d 506, 516 (3d Cir.2007), we conclude, for essentially the reasons provided by the District Court, that the claims fail as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\">. Dukes\u2019s claims against the SEC defendants are properly brought under <em>Bivens, </em>while his claim against Maryland\u2019s assistant attorney general is properly brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Lora-Pena v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, </em>529 F.3d 503, 504 n. 1 (3d Cir.2008). The legal analysis detailed below applies with equal force to both species of claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b696-14\">. To the extent that Dukes asserts claims against SEC employees Kevin Delacy and Katy Cody for creating false evidence for use at his 2005 criminal trial, these claims are also barred by <em>Heck. See, e.g., Perez </em>v. <em>Sifel, </em>57 F.3d 503, 505 (7th Cir.1995). Even if they were not, the claims would still fail because, as the District Court correctly held, they are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
