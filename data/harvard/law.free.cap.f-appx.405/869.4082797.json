He is incarcerated for his conviction of aiding and abetting Lizandro Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s possession with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>To obtain a COA, Rodriguez-Marin must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To meet that standard, he must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the [\u00a7 2255 motion] should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). The COA determination requires an overview of the claims and a general assessment of their merits. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). That threshold inquiry does not require a showing that the appeal will succeed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Rodriguez-Marin argues, as he did in the district court, that counsel was ineffective for failing to call Gonzalez-Rodriguez as a witness during his trial and that Gonzalez-Rodriguez was available and willing to testify that Rodriguez-Marin was not involved in the offense. To support his claim, he presented the district court with an unsworn letter from Gonzalez-Rodriguez that was written in Spanish. The letter, which was allegedly translated into English by Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s counsel, purportedly states that Rodriguez-Marin had nothing to do with the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Rodriguez-Marin also provided the court with a portion of the transcript from Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s sentencing proceeding, during which Gonzalez-Rodriguez stated that Rodriguez-Marin had nothing to do with the offense. Rodriguez-Marin also argues, as he did in the district court, that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a Fourth Amendment objection to the drug evidence and for failing to raise a Fourth Amendment claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Rodriguez-Marin has abandoned his claims before the district court of actual innocence, that the search and seizure of the vehicle that led to his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment, that the government failed to prove the drug quantity, and that counsel\u2019s failure to raise the drug quantity issue on direct appeal was plain error. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to challenge the district court\u2019s determination that Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s letter was inadmissible hearsay, Rodriguez-Marin has abandoned any challenge to the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief on his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce the letter at trial. <em>See Hughes, </em>191 F.3d at 613; <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Because Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s purported testimony would have been relevant to and supportive of Rodriguez-Marin\u2019s defense that he did not actually or constructively possess the drugs recovered on the day of his arrest, reasonable jurists could agree that the issue of whether counsel was ineffective for failing to call Gonzalez-Rodriguez as a witness at trial is \u201cadequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Accordingly, a COA is GRANTED in part on that issue. Because the government was not served in the underlying \u00a7 2255 proceeding and because the district court did not expressly address Rodriguez-Marin\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to call Gonzalez-Rodriguez as a witness, we vacate the judgment to the extent it denied \u00a7 2255 relief on that claim and remand for consideration of the issue and, if necessary, an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">The district court did not address Rodriguez-Marin\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a Fourth Amendment claim before, during, or after trial and on direct appeal. A COA is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>GRANTED in part on that issue. <em>See United States v. Daly, </em>823 F.2d 871, 872 (5th Cir.1987). On remand, therefore, the district court also should consider the issue of whether counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a Fourth Amendment claim. Rodriguez-Marin\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED in all other respects. His motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauper-is </em>on appeal is GRANTED. We express no opinion on what decisions the district court should make on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b895-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
