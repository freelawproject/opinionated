Construing his brief and his complaint liberally, Leonard argues that the defendants maliciously prosecuted him for exercising his First Amendment right of access to public records, his right to request information under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), and his right under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245 to freedom from intimidation for exercising his federally protected rights. Additionally, Leonard argues that the district court failed to construe the complaint liberally and that the dismissal of the complaint deprived Leonard of his First Amendment right to petition the government to redress his grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order of dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint, and we accept as true the complaint\u2019s well-pleaded factual allegations. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1997). We may affirm on any ground supported in the record even if that ground was not relied upon or considered by the district court. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). Finally, <em>\u201c[pjro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">The district court must dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint that \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Dismissal under \u00a7 1915 (e) (2) (B) (ii) is governed by the same standard as a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Mitchell, </em>112 F.3d at 1490. Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if the facts as pleaded fail to state a claim for relief that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal). The \u201cplaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (alteration and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">Section 1983 requires the plaintiff to show that he \u201cwas deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001); see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \u201cSection 1983 creates no substantive rights; it merely provides a remedy for deprivations of federal statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Almand v. DeKalb County, Ga., </em>103 F.3d 1510, 1512 (11th Cir.1997). Although Section 1983 applies only to state officials, <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), provides a parallel remedy for the deprivation of rights by a federal official. <em>See Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir.1995). We generally apply the same law to both <em>Bivens </em>and Section 1983 cases. <em>Id. </em>Lib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>erally construed, the complaint alleges a <em>Bivens </em>claim against the federal defendants and a Section 1983 claim against the Florida defendants. The complaint also alleges that the defendants were acting under color of state law; thus, the sole issue is whether the defendants deprived Leonard of a federally protected right.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Despite the existence of the \u00a7 1983 remedy, \u201chabeas corpus [rather than \u00a7 1983] is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Pryor, </em>305 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973)). This rule applies to an action for damages under \u00a7 1983 if a judgment in the plaintiffs favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In either circumstance, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, this rule necessarily applies only if \u201cthere exists \u2018a conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been ... invalidated,\u2019 that is to say, an \u2018outstanding criminal judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 393, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 1097-98, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). Stated differently, <em>Heck </em>does not bar \u201can action which would impugn <em>an anticipated future conviction.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Although Leonard asserts an array of constitutional and statutory violations by the defendants, the substance of Leonard\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Fourth Amendment by maliciously prosecuting Leonard for attempting to exercise his federal rights. To prove malicious prosecution under \u00a7 1983, Leonard must allege \u201c(1) the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, and (2) a violation of [his] Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.\u201d <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). To establish the common law tort of malicious prosecution under Florida law, Leonard must allege that (1) a judicial proceeding was commenced or continued against him; (2) the defendants were the legal cause of the original proceeding; (3) the termination of the original proceeding constituted a bona fide termination of that proceeding in Leonard\u2019s favor; (4) no probable cause existed for the original proceeding; (5) the defendants acted with malice; and (6) Leonard suffered damage as a result of the proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Because Leonard\u2019s state-court criminal prosecution is ongoing, we conclude from the record that the district court erred by dismissing the complaint based on <em>Heck, </em>which bars a \u00a7 1983 claim based on an extant conviction but has no application to an anticipated future conviction. <em>See Wallace, </em>549 U.S. at 393, 127 S.Ct. at 1098. Nevertheless, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the complaint in this case because Leonard\u2019s malicious prosecution claim ripens only if the state-court criminal proceeding is terminated in his favor. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 484, 114 S.Ct. at 2371 (\u201cOne element that must be alleged and proved in a malicious prosecution action is termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused.\u201d). In other words, because Leonard failed to allege the termination in his favor of the state-court criminal prosecution, Leonard failed to state a claim for malicious prosecution. Accordingly, we af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>firm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Leonard\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
