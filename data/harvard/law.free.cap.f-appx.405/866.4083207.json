He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence based on the retroactive amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the Sentencing Guideline for crack cocaine offenses. He also appeals the denial of his motion for the appointment of appellate counsel. He requests the appointment of counsel in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">At Pinson\u2019s original sentencing, the district court found he was a career offender. However, Pinson was sentenced under \u00a7 2D1.1 because his career offender offense level of 37 did not exceed the adjusted offense level of 38 that resulted from the quantity of drugs involved in the offense. Under amended \u00a7 2D1.1, Pinson\u2019s total offense level is 36, but his status as a career offender mandates an offense level of 37. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). With a criminal history category of VI, his sentencing range remains unchanged at 360 months to life imprisonment. If application of an amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level but does not alter the sentencing guideline range on which his sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s. The district court did not err in denying Pinson\u2019s motion. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s.; <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Pinson\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), made application of \u00a7 1B1.10 advisory is foreclosed. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Pinson has provided no support for his argument that the district court erred by denying his motion without requiring the Government to respond and without ordering a new presentence report. Pinson\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s original sentencing decisions are not cognizable in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">Finally, the district court did not err in denying Pinson\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel. This court has previously held that there is no right to counsel at a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 1010-11. However, more recently, this court has suggested that \u201c[t]he question ... of whether a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion triggers either a statutory or constitutional right to an attorney \u2014 in either this court or the district court \u2014 is a different question now than it was before the [2008] amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b),\u201d because those amendments allow district courts to exercise discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, whereas previously they had no discretion. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, in this case, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Pinson is simply ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court did not have any discretion to reduce his sentence. Accordingly, we conclude that under <em>Whitebird, </em>Pinson was not entitled to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Pinson\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
