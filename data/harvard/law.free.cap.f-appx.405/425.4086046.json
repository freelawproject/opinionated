The IJ denied relief on the basis of an adverse credibility determination and lack of corroborating evidence. Zheng challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and findings that he is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA]\u2019s decision, except to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion\u201d or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). This Court reviews for substantial evidence the factual findings of the BIA or IJ. <em>Id. </em>at 1230-31. Factual findings, including credibility determinations, \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Zheng argues that he is eligible for asylum because he was detained and fined in China for violating family planning laws. He also argues that he is eligible because he fears future persecution based on this violation and on his unauthorized religious practices. \u201cTo be eligible for asylum, the applicant bears the burden of proving statutory refugee status.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 (quotation marks omitted); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). \u201c[T]he alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily-protected ground.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">An IJ\u2019s denial of asylum can be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). In the absence of corroborating evidence, the asylum applicant must satisfy the trier of fact that his testimony is credible and persuasive. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). \u201c[The] trier of fact may base a credibility determination on the ... inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s ... account [or] the consistency between the applicant\u2019s ... written and oral statements.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u2022 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Our review of an IJ\u2019s credibility determination is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230. After the IJ provides \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the finding,\u201d the burden shifts to the alien to prove that the decision is not supported by either specific, cogent reasons or substantial evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Zheng is ineligible for asylum. As the IJ concluded, inconsistencies in Zheng\u2019s story undermine his credibility. For instance, Zheng told the asylum officer that he had no relatives who were United States lawful permanent residents. Yet, a lawful permanent resident who claimed to be Zheng\u2019s sister submitted an affidavit in support of his asylum application. Additionally, Zheng\u2019s testimony as to when he and his girlfriend conceived a child was contradictory. The record is replete with other inconsistencies in Zheng\u2019s representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">We also cannot say that the record compels a finding that Zheng was persecuted. Zheng alleged that the Chinese authorities detained him for two days and imposed a monetary fine when they learned that Zheng\u2019s girlfriend had given birth to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>child. We have held that an isolated brief detention does not amount to persecution, even when coupled with minor physical abuse. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009) (finding no persecution where alien was arrested, interrogated and beaten for five hours, detained for four days, and monitored post-release); <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1171-72, 1175 (11th Cir.2008) (finding no persecution where alien was detained for thirty-six hours, kicked and beaten with a belt). Further, Zheng never alleged that he suffered from past persecution for his unauthorized religious practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Zheng did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Zheng himself did not know many details about the Chinese authorities\u2019 knowledge of his unauthorized religious practices or whether they currently seek to punish him for his past religious activities. Although Zheng was briefly detained in China for violating the family planning laws, he had no evidence that the authorities planned to impose additional punishment for the same violation upon his return. Therefore, Zheng failed to prove that he is eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Zheng next argues that the IJ erred in concluding that he is not entitled to withholding of removal under the INA or CAT. The INA prohibits removal to a particular country if \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). To be eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT, an alien must show that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7'208.16(c)(2) (2001)). The burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than that for asylum claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determinations that Zheng is not entitled to withholding of removal. Zheng argues that the Chinese authorities have threatened to arrest or injure him upon his return for his past unauthorized religious practices. A mere threat without more, however, does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (finding no persecution despite menacing phone calls and threats coupled with bombing at restaurant where alien worked).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Further, Zheng has failed to provide corroborating proof of a threat to his life or freedom based on his religious practices or violation of China\u2019s family planning laws. The relatively lax enforcement policy in the region of China where Zheng resides undermines his claim that his return would endanger him. For example, several reports the IJ reviewed reflect that this region punishes violators of China\u2019s family planning laws primarily through monetary fines. Moreover, Zheng\u2019s claim that he fears for his life or freedom is belied by the fact that he did not try to seek asylum in the three other countries he fled to before arriving in the United States. Nor did Zheng seek asylum in the United States until after he was questioned by the government for entering the country using a forged passport. Therefore, the IJ and BIA properly denied Zheng relief because he did not satisfy the more-likely-than-not standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
