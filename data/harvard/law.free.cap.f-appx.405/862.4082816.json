(\u201cPrincipal\u201d). <em>Leipzig v. Principal Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 10-10394, 2010 U.S.App. LEXIS 24396, at *18 (5th Cir. Nov. 29, 2010). In its prompt response, the court explained that it \u201ccould not make a determination of the reasonableness or necessity of Principal\u2019s attorney fees\u201d because \u201cno amount was requested, much less supported by affidavits\u201d at the time of summary judgment. <em>Leipzig v. Principal Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 6:09-CV-36, slip op. at 2 (N.D.Tex. Nov. 30, 2010). Principal\u2019s summary judgment brief and reply brief to the district court, however, both stated that it intended to seek attorney\u2019s fees through a post-judgment motion. Appellant\u2019s Br. 49; R. 337, 839 n. 31. And in response to Principal\u2019s summary judgment motion, plaintiff Bruce Leipzig agreed that attorney\u2019s fees should be addressed post-judgment. Appellant\u2019s Br. 49; R. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The district court reasoned that it \u201cwas not bound by the parties\u2019 agreement\u201d and therefore could <em>sua sponte </em>deny attorney\u2019s fees at the summary judgment stage, because the parties had not submitted the materials required for it to consider whether to grant the fees. <em>Leipzig, </em>No. 6:09-CV-36, slip op. at 2. Although ERISA gives the district court discretion to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) (2006), we review its decision for abuse of discretion. <em>Todd v. AIG Life Ins. Co., </em>47 F.3d 1448, 1458 (5th Cir.1995) (White, J.). Motions for fees under ERISA are subject to the time limits set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54. <em>See Jones v. Cent. Bank, </em>161 F.3d 311, 312 (5th Cir.1998). Rule 54(d)(2)(B) says, \u201cUnless a statute or a court order provides otherwise, the motion [for attorney\u2019s fees] must: (i) be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment. ...\u201d The motion must \u201cspecify the judgment ... entitling the movant to the award,\u201d <em>id., </em>suggesting that an attorney\u2019s fee motion would normally be filed after the entry of judgment so that the judgment could be specified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">The district court points to no order that required the parties to file their motions for attorney\u2019s fees before a decision on summary judgment. The district judge\u2019s own motion practice rules do not specify when fee motions must be made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If anything, those rules suggest that such motions are not due at the summary judgment stage, because motions for summary judgment and fee applications are addressed in different subsections (II.A.1 and II.A.4.b, respectively). <em>Id. </em>It was an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny attorney\u2019s fees for failure to file the required materials where no statute or court order gave notice that the motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>for fees were due earlier than rule 54(d)(2)(B)(i) requires.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The district court also noted that, in any event, it appropriately denied fees at the summary judgment stage because Principal did not subsequently file a post-judgment motion for fees. <em>Leipzig, </em>No. 6:09-CV-36, slip op. at 2. That is error that amounts to abuse of discretion: The reason Principal did not file a post-judgment motion is that fees had already been denied. We therefore REVERSE the denial of attorney\u2019s fees and REMAND for further proceedings as needed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-10\">.
