The district court\u2019s denial of Tubbs\u2019s motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>(5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Tubbs\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense but from his career offender status. \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and did not abuse its discretion in denying a sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>Tubbs\u2019s suggestion that the district court should have applied the Guidelines in an advisory manner is unavailing. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Tubbs challenges the district court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel for him in the district court proceeding. In <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1995), this court held that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) movant had no right to the appointment of counsel in the district court. Further, because Tubbs was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) due to his career offender status, the appointment of counsel was not warranted in the interest of justice. <em>Cf. United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008) (appointing counsel in the interest of justice due to complexity of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Tubbs also challenges his status as a career offender. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not be used to challenge a district court\u2019s calculation of an original sentence or to contest the appropriateness of the sentence. <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1011; <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674. Thus, Tubbs\u2019s challenge to his status as a career offender is</p>\n<p id=\"AR8\">not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Tubbs has not shown error in either the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or in the denial of his request for counsel in the district court. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
