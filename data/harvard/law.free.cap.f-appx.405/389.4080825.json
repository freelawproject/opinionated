Barnes further contends he lacks a remedy to challenge his sentence in the event his convictions are overturned because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f) imposes a one-year limitation on a motion to vacate an unlawful sentence and his state-court appeal is likely to last three to five years. After review, we affirm Barnes\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Barnes to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment upon the revocation of his supervised release. Barnes identifies no procedural error committed by the district court, which expressly considered the evidence and argument presented by the parties, Chapter VII of the Guidelines, the nature and severity of Barnes\u2019s offenses, and the other 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-24\">Additionally, Barnes\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. Barnes suffers no impediment to relief in the event his state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>court convictions are overturned because he would have one year to move under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his federal sentence. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>198 F.3d 811, 813 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] district court may reopen and reduce a federal sentence once a federal defendant has, in state court, successfully attacked a prior state conviction, previously used in enhancing the federal sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 364 (11th Cir.1996) (noting that, if the defendant\u2019s state-court conviction \u201cis reversed, he may seek appropriate modification of his supervised release revocation sentence at that time\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm Barnes\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-17\">. Barnes was sentenced to life for his state-court convictions. The district court ordered Barnes\u2019s supervised release revocation sentence to run consecutively to his life sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-18\">. We review for reasonableness a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006).
