Lyles, Louisiana prisoner # 102175, appeals the dismissal with prejudice of his civil rights complaint against various defendants who allegedly conspired to violate his constitutional rights in connection with a previous civil suit he filed against his former employer, Seacor Marine Inc. (\u201cSeacor\u201d), and in connection with his arrest and convictions for two counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile. The district court found that Lyles was prohibited from proceeding in forma pauperis (IFP) in connection with his civil rights suit because he had three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and he failed to show he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury. The district court also noted that various judges and other named defendants were absolutely or qualifiedly immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">On appeal, Lyles argues the merits of his Seacor-related claims and claims related to his convictions. He asserts that he was not barred from proceeding IFP in the district court under \u00a7 1915(g) because he does not have three strikes, and, alternatively, because \u201cthe risk of future injury\u201d in his case is sufficient to satisfy the imminent danger exception to \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). He argues that the district coui\u2019t\u2019s findings that he had three strikes and that the defendants were immune from suit were not based upon the evidence and were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">The district court correctly concluded that Lyles could not proceed IFP in connection with his civil rights suit because he has three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), and he failed to establish that he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Lyles v. Oubrey, </em>No. 03-1623 (E.D.La.2003); <em>Lyles v. Lemmon, </em>No. 04-2470 (E.D.La.2004); and <em>Lyles v. Lemmon, </em>165 Fed.Appx. 305 (5th Cir.2006). In addition, Lyles makes only eonclusory and speculative arguments that Judge Lemmon and \u201cher co-defendants\u201d are not immune from suit because they conspired to violate his constitutional rights. Accordingly, Lyles has not shown that the district court erred in finding that certain defendants were absolutely or qualifiedly immune. The district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Lyles\u2019s civil rights suit is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">As Lyles has accumulated more than three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is BARRED under \u00a7 1915(g) from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>1915(g). Lyles is CAUTIONED that additional frivolous or duplicitous pleadings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>this court or any other court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will result in the imposition of further sanctions, including monetary sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
