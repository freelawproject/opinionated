Martinez\u2019s application for relief was denied based on the adverse credibility determinations reached by the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Martinez argues that she established the requisite well-founded fear of future persecution based on her testimony that she was kidnaped and raped by gang members, who held her for four months and released her only when Martinez\u2019s family paid ransom. She asserts that due to her youth and the ability of her family to pay ransom demands, she will again be a target for gang exploitation if she is forced to return to El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">We review an immigration court\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence, and we \u201cmay reverse a decision on a factual finding only when the evidence compels us to do so.\u201d <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). Among the findings of fact that we review for substantial evidence is an immigration court\u2019s conclusion that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (quotation and citation omitted); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). We will \u201cdefer therefore to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">There were inconsistencies between Martinez\u2019s oral testimony and her written asylum application. Martinez testified regarding her four-month detention and sexual abuse by gang members, but this significant event was not mentioned in her asylum application. Martinez also gave inconsistent testimony regarding the time frame in which she was kidnaped and held in captivity and an incident in which her niece was shot by gang members. Martinez failed to provide corroborative evidence, such as copies of police reports regarding her family\u2019s numerous complaints to police, that might have lent credence to her account of persecution. The IJ and the BIA noted these considerations in determining that Martinez\u2019s testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Martinez has provided no basis for setting aside the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Because the credibility determinations of the IJ and the BIA are supported by substantial evidence, we will not disturb them. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Martinez\u2019s asylum, withholding, and CAT claims were all based on her assertion that she was in danger of being harmed by a gang in El Salvador. Because the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination regarding Martinez\u2019s claims withstands review, it follows that the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>sion to deny relief is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344-45. Accordingly, Martinez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
