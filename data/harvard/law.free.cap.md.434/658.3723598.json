Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">\u201cThe Court finds the following facts to have been proven by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\u201cThe Respondent was admitted to the Bar of Maryland on June 23,1967 and maintains an office for the practice of law at 1777 Reisterstown Road, Pikesville, Maryland 21208. The Respondent, who has served the community for more than forty-three years, describes his practice as successful and rewarding, having represented and assisted thousands of injured plaintiffs seeking to recover money after suffering personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\u201cThe Respondent represented Michonda Lucas and Wanda Lee Thompson in connection with injuries each of them sustained in separate automobile accidents. Ms. Lucas\u2019s accident occurred on or about March 2, 2002. Ms. Thompson\u2019s accident occurred on or about February 26, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201cIn both cases, the clients and the Respondent executed a Subrogation, Assignment of Rights and Reimbursement Agreement (hereinafter \u201cAgreement\u201d), that assigned to the Food Employees\u2019 Labor Relations Association and United Food and Commercial Workers\u2019 Health and Welfare Fund (hereinafter \u201cthe Fund\u201d) any amount recovered in connection with each of the automobile accidents to the extent of the benefits paid by the Fund on behalf of each of the clients. The Agreement executed by the Respondent and Ms. Lucas was signed on or about March 18, 2003 and the Agreement entered into evidence. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 1. </em>The Agreement executed by the Respondent and Ms. Thompson was signed on or about April 11, 2003 and it, too, was entered into evidence. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 22. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The Respondent executed both assignments that contained express provisions requiring the Respondent to \u2018withhold and pay\u2019 the \u2018full amount due and owing to the fund without reduction for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 22, page 3. </em>Although Respondent signed the Agreement in both Ms. Lucas\u2019s and Ms. Thompson\u2019s cases that assigned to the Fund any amounts recovered in connection with the automobile accidents to the extent of the benefits paid by the Fund on behalf of Ms. Lucas and Ms. Thompson <em>(.Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibits 1, 22), </em>Respondent did not read the Agreement carefully before signing, but relied upon his experience working with other subrogation carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\u201cMs. Lucas\u2019s claims were settled by the Respondent [o]n or about August 2003 for $9,900.00. Ms. Thompson\u2019s case was settled [o]n or about December 2003 for $16,232.00. After the Respondent settled their personal injury claims, both Ms. Lucas and Ms. Thompson were promptly paid their portions of the settlement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\u201cThe Fund\u2019s lien in the <em>Lucas </em>case was for the amount of $1,413.56. The Fund\u2019s lien in the <em>Thomas </em>case was for $4,948.63. In both cases, the Respondent recovered sufficient funds to pay the Fund the full amount of its liens. Although the Fund\u2019s lien in Ms. Lucas\u2019s case was for the amount of $1,413.56, the Respondent\u2019s office was initially informed by the Fund that the Fund\u2019s lien in Ms. Lucas\u2019s case was for the amount of $884.90. Based upon that information, the Respondent maintained that amount for the Fund\u2019s lien in his trust account. There is no clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent\u2019s maintaining less than the correct amount of this lien was intentional. The Respondent did not maintain the entire amount of the Fund\u2019s lien in trust in the <em>Thomas </em>case. He held $4,893.00 in trust. The Respondent\u2019s failure to maintain the difference, $55.63, in trust, was not an intentional misappropriation, but was caused by inadvertence or a mathematical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\u201cThe Respondent did not pay the Fund\u2019s liens in each of the two cases, despite his obligation to do so, until on or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>June 18, 2008, after a representative of the Fund filed a complaint with Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">\u201cThe Respondent communicated with the Fund\u2019s representatives in connection with his obligation to pay the Fund\u2019s lien between August 2003 and June 2008 in connection with the <em>Lucas </em>case, and between June 2003 and June 2008 in connection with the lien in the <em>Thompson </em>case. The Respondent did not communicate with the Fund or its representatives concerning Ms. Lucas\u2019[s] lien between September 15, 2003 and August 20, 2004. The Respondent did not communicate with the Fund or its representatives concerning Ms. Lucas\u2019s lien between December 17, 2004 and October 31, 2005. The Respondent did not communicate with the Fund or its representatives between October 31, 2005 and April 28, 2006 concerning Ms. Lucas\u2019[s] lien. The Respondent did not communicate with the Fund or its representatives between his letter to Ms. Dennis of August 22, 2006 and November 15, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\u201cIn Ms. Thompson\u2019s case, between June 13, 2003 and March 4, 2004, the Respondent and the Fund discussed on several occasions the recovery in Ms. Thompson\u2019s case and settlement of the Fund\u2019s lien. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibits 23, 2Jp, 27. </em>Thereafter, however, the Respondent, confronted with the same issues from Ms. Lucas\u2019s case, did not have any communication with the Fund or its law firm for approximately three and a half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\u201cThe Respondent received the letters addressed to him, of which a copy of each is attached to Petitioner\u2019s Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents and each of said letters was entered into evidence. He drafted the letters executed by him, of which a copy of each is attached to Petitioner\u2019s Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents and each of those letters was entered into evidence. He forwarded each of said letters to each of the addressees on or about the dates set forth thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">\u201cThe Respondent was aware of the obligation to maintain the amounts of the Fund\u2019s liens in trust and to pay the Fund for its liens pursuant to the requirements of Rule 1.15. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>was aware of those requirements when the two cases were settled and he received the funds sufficient to pay the liens. He recalled having been sanctioned for a violation of that Rule in 1999. The Respondent did not pay the Fund the monies to which it was entitled until almost five (5) years after he received the monies with which to pay the Fund in the <em>Lucas </em>case <em>(Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit </em>Ip) and approximately four and a half years after he received the monies in the <em>Thompson </em>case. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 25. </em>In Ms. Lucas\u2019s case, on August 15, 2003, the Respondent sent a letter to the Fund\u2019s law firm, Slevin <em>&amp; </em>Hart, P.C., advising them that Ms. Lucas\u2019s settled for $9,900.00, and asking the Fund to waive its $884.90 lien in view of the fact that the special damages were $6,957.45. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 5. </em>The response he received from the Fund\u2019s law firm was \u2018no.\u2019 No reduction in the lien for Ms. Lucas was acceptable. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 6. </em>He did not respond. On August 20, 2004, more than eleven months later, and despite Respondent\u2019s letter of August 15, 2003 to counsel for the Fund advising of the <em>Lucas </em>settlement, counsel for the Fund asked Respondent to advise them of the outcome of the <em>Lucas </em>case and \u2018If you have received a recovery, please advise of the source amount.\u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 8. </em>On December 8, 2004, Respondent communicated with the Fund\u2019s law firm and he continued to press the Fund to reduce the lien which he erroneously set forth as $884.90 (instead of the correct amount of $1,413.56 that was communicated to him in September of 2003). <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibits 6, 9. </em>He wanted the firm to agree to a \u2018low ball park figure\u2019 to close out the matter. The fund\u2019s law firm replied on December 13, 2004 in an attempt to set the record straight: the lien amount was not $884.90 but was $1,413.56; the Fund (as stated in its letter of more than a year before) would not waive its lien and would not accept a reduction. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 10. </em>On December 15, 2004, the Respondent sent a letter to the Fund\u2019s law firm, referring to the Respondent\u2019s alleged entitlement to an \u2018attorney\u2019s fee, which is accepted at one-third.\u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 11. </em>The Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>spondent did not lie to or mislead the Fund about the fee. The Respondent testified that the demands for a fee were, in reality, simply a \u2018tool\u2019 to achieve a larger payout for his client. His stated objective in dealing with the Fund was to obtain reduction in the lien pertaining to his client, to whom any pecuniary benefit would have been paid. That is, the Respondent had no personal pecuniary stake in the outcome, having been paid in full for his services as a result of the personal injury settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">\u201cStephanie Oliva, a paralegal for the Fund\u2019s counsel, wrote a letter, dated December 17, 2004, addressing the Respondent\u2019s claim for a fee and the Respondent, at the hearing, had no real issue with the recitation of the law set forth in that letter, the Fund stated emphatically that he was simply not entitled to any fee from the Fund. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 12. </em>The Fund again demanded payment. The Respondent did not respond. He testified that he did not know if he received the Fund\u2019s letter and that, if he did, that he did not review it in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\u201cOn October 31, 2005, counsel for the Fund again made demand of Respondent: pay the lien. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 13. </em>On November 21, 2005, Rose Dennis of the Medical Claims Department of the Fund wrote directly to Ms. Lucas advising her that Respondent had failed to respond to numerous requests for updates on the status of her case and that further benefits to her may be subject to offset. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit H. </em>A copy of this letter was forwarded to counsel for the Fund, but not to Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u201cOn April 28, 2006, Respondent wrote a letter to counsel for the Fund, claiming to have paid the lien, as he understood it to be. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 15. </em>He was mistaken. He again asked for the balance of the lien to be waived. He said that this was the first time in his practice in over 40 years where \u2018you are not assuming an attorney fee in the collection of your lien, at a 25%-33-l/3% fee.\u2019 He admitted in testimony that this was the <em>only </em>time he ever dealt with the Fund to that point. Respondent\u2019s reference to \u201cyou\u201d in his letter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>intended to generally mean third-party subrogation claimants (such as health insurance companies). Respondent testified again that this was not intended to be a fee for the Respondent for collecting the fund to pay the lien. Any reduction of the lien would have been passed to Ms. Lucas as a benefit, as was his customary and ordinary practice. That is, he would have received no pecuniary payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">\u201cIn that same letter, the Respondent also objected to the Fund\u2019s decision to unilaterally terminate Ms. Lucas\u2019s insurance benefits claiming that there had been no notice to her as she only learned about the problem when she unsuccessfully sought to fill a prescription. The Respondent \u2018demanded\u2019 that the client\u2019s \u2018insurance\u2019 be reinstated and that she be supplied with a \u2018Notice of Right to Protest through the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s Office.\u2019 The Agreement, signed by the Respondent <em>(Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 1) </em>states if Ms. Lucas refuses \u2018to cooperate with the fund regarding its subrogation rights ... the Fund has the right to offset such amounts against [her] future benefit payments under the Plan ... \u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 1, page 2. </em>The Fund had deemed Respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate to be Ms. Lucas\u2019 failure to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\u201cFinally, the Respondent sought in his letter of April 28, 2006, to resolve what he now called an \u2018asserted\u2019 and \u2018alleged lien.\u2019 On May 2, 2006, counsel for the Fund again wrote to Respondent, setting forth the correct amount of the lien and insisting on full payment of the lien pursuant to its Agreement and the law, without offset for attorney\u2019s fees. In her letter <em>(Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 16) </em>Marilyn Cochran, of the Fund\u2019s law firm, appealed to the Respondent\u2019s ethical sensitivity by quoting Rule 1.15 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent testified that he did not recall reading the May 2, 2006 letter. Respondent did not respond to that letter. Rose Dennis, of the Medical Claims Department of the Fund, wrote to Ms. Lucas, without copying the Respondent, on July 26, 2006. Respondent learned of the correspondence to Ms. Lucas. In response, on August 22, 2006, the Respondent wrote to Ms. Dennis, whom he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>was represented by counsel. In that letter, the Respondent again sought to resolve the lien. He stated that he had had \u2018numerous communications back and forth to and from [her] counsel, as they fail to wish to negotiate on this matter,\u2019 and he invited Ms. Dennis to contact him \u2018so that we may discuss an amicable resolution of this lien to finally close out this necessary dialogue.\u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 17. </em>The Respondent recognizes in hindsight that he should not have acted so hastily and communicated directly with Ms. Dennis, and that his conduct constitutes a \u2018technical\u2019 violation of Rule 4.2. He regrets his error.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\u201cOn August 28, 2006, the Fund\u2019s counsel wrote to Respondent reiterating the Fund\u2019s position against reducing its lien but invited the Respondent to provide information by September 6, 2006 that would permit the Fund to \u2018reconsider its position.\u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 18. </em>The Respondent did not reply. On January 2, 2007, Ms. Dennis of the Fund wrote to Ms. Lucas again threatening offset due to Respondent\u2019s non-cooperation and non-payment of the lien. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 19.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\u201cOn November 15, 2007, Lynn Bowers, Esquire, counsel for the Fund, wrote to the Respondent. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 20. </em>Fund\u2019s counsel advised Respondent of his ethical responsibilities and that payment of the Fund\u2019s lien in full was required. The Respondent did not respond. He testified that he had no recollection of the November 15, 2007 letter. In his May 28, 2008 letter to Petitioner, Respondent referred to the Fund\u2019s lien as an \u2018alleged lien.\u2019 He insisted that he was entitled to his fee \u2018in the collection of the funds to pay the lien.\u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 35. </em>He claimed in his letter to Petitioner that he was still trying to negotiate the lien and was still seeking an attorney\u2019s fee (to which, he had been told again and again by the Fund, he was not entitled). On June 18, 2008, Respondent paid both liens to the Fund in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\u201cWith respect to the lien associated with Ms. Thompson\u2019s case, it is stipulated that the Respondent had no communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tion with the Fund or its representatives for more than three and a half years. He explained to Petitioner that his inability to reach an agreement \u2018about the reduction of lien and my attorney\u2019s fee for negotiating this lien\u2019 in the <em>Lucas </em>matter caused him to face \u2018the same problem with working out the lien for Wanda Thompson,\u2019 <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 35.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">As a result of these findings of fact, the hearing court concluded, as a matter of law, that the respondent violated some of the Rules charged and that the petitioner did not prove, by clear and convincing evidence, others. Those found to have been violated were MLRPC 1.1, 1.15, 4.2 and 8.4(d). Those that the court found the petitioner failed to prove were MLRPC 1.5(a), 4.4, 8.4(c) and BOP \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The respondent\u2019s failure, albeit \u201cinadvertent and/or the product of a mathematical mistake,\u201d citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stolarz, </em>379 Md. 387, 399, 842 A.2d 42, 49 (2004), to retain in his attorney trust account a sufficient amount to cover the total amount of the liens the Fund, the Food Employees\u2019 Labor Relations Association and United Food and Commercial Workers\u2019 Health and Welfare Fund, had against the recoveries obtained by his clients, Thompson and Lucas, the court concluded, constituted a violation of MLRPC 1.15(a). That he also failed to pay the Fund promptly the lien amounts due to it, the court also concluded, was a violation of MLRPC 1.15(b), 1.15(d) and 1.1. With respect to MLRPC 1.15(b), the violations were determined to have occurred with respect to the recovery of each client and for the periods charged by the petitioner, in the case of Lucas, from August 2003 through June 30, 2005, and for Thompson, for the period December 2003 through June 30, 2005. The failure constituting the MLRPC 1.15(d) violation was also in regard to each client and was for the period July 1, 2005 through June 18, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">MLRPC 4.2 proscribes communication with a person represented by counsel without that person\u2019s counsel\u2019s consent. Having determined that the respondent intentionally communicated with an employee of the Fund by letter, the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>court concluded that, in so doing, the respondent violated that Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">As to the charged MLRPC 8.4(d) violation,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cThis Court finds that the extraordinary delay in tendering payment from trust, in violation of Rule 1.15, does give rise to a violation of Rule 8.4(d) as argued by Bar Counsel. Certainly, the Respondent violated Rule 1.15, and the delay of over four years in tendering payment is, by any measure, extraordinary. For the above-stated reasons, th[is] Court concludes that Respondent\u2019s unjustified refusal to pay over trust funds constituting the Fund\u2019s liens to the Fund for a period of more than four years impacts negatively the public\u2019s perception or efficacy of the courts or legal profession. As such, the Court concludes that such conduct is prejudicial to the administration of justice and therefore is in violation of MRPC 8.4(d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The hearing court found that the following mitigation had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\u201cThe Respondent recognizes his errors in both cases, and deeply regrets and is truly remorseful for his conduct. The settlement funds in both Ms. Lucas\u2019s and Ms. Thompson\u2019s cases were held in trust, and the Respondent testified that his intention was to tender payment to the Fund upon resolution of the lien with the Fund. In both cases, the Respondent reimbursed the Fund out of his own personal funds to rectify the errors with regard to maintaining the entire amount of the Fund\u2019s liens in trust. Both Ms. Lucas and Ms. Thompson were paid promptly. Neither Ms. Lucas nor Ms. Thompson was harmed as a result of the Respondent\u2019s conduct and neither client complained to the Respondent about his representation in these matters (although they complained about the fund\u2019s failure to waive its lien). Respondent\u2019s conduct did not involve misappropriation of client funds, misuse of trust funds or commingling client funds with operating account or personal funds. There was no evidence that Respondent had any improper or nefarious intention to reap any extra personal pecuniary benefit for himself despite the delay. The Fund eventually received payment in full. Respondent did not mislead anyone or lie to anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\u201cThe Respondent acknowledges that he has been sanctioned for violating Rule 1.15 in 1999. The Respondent has implemented changes into his law practice whereby he either resolves any subrogation lien with the carrier within 60 days, or he files an action for interpleader, thus ensuring that there is no likelihood that any significant delay in resolving subrogation claims will be repeated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">\u201cThroughout the grievance process, the Respondent has fully and freely complied with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests and been fully forthcoming with any and all disclosures. The Respondent\u2019s cooperation with Bar Counsel has been full and complete.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Neither the petitioner nor the respondent filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of facts.

Thus, disciplinary proceedings are a catharsis for the profession, intended to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute, thereby ensuring the integrity of the bar, as well as a prophylactic for the public. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 27, 741 A.2d 1143, 1157 (1999) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Deutsch, </em>294 Md. 353, 368-69, 450 A.2d 1265, 1273 (1982), in turn quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The factors to be considered when determining the appropriate sanction for professional misconduct are well-settled. We recently restated them in <em>Paul, </em>423 Md. at 284-86, 31 A.3d at 522-23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u201cOf course, what the appropriate sanction for the particular misconduct is, in the public interest, generally depends upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>[Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.]Snyder, </em>406 Md.

Pollack, </em>289 Md. 603, 609, 425 A.2d 1352, 1355 (1981). In that regard, in every case, we consider the nature of the ethical duties violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>[Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.] Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. [586,] 598-99, 911 A.2d [440,] 447-48 [ (2006) ]. The attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, as well as facts in mitigation, constitute[ ] part of those facts and circumstances. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975). We also look to our past cases involving attorney discipline when imposing sanctions. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 520, 830 A.2d 474, 486 (2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201cTo be sure, \u2018a persistent or more egregious course of conduct in violation of our disciplinary rules may lead to much more severe sanctions.\u2019 <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>300 Md. 306, 314, 477 A.2d 1190, 1194 (1984). We have also recognized that an attorney\u2019s voluntary termination of the misconduct, accompanied by an appreciation of the serious impropriety of that past conduct and remorse for it, is evidence that the attorney will not hereafter engage in such unethical conduct if permitted to continue practice. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Freedman, </em>285 Md. 298, 300, 402 A.2d 75, 76 (1979). The likelihood of repetition is a factor to be considered in determining the appropriate sanction. In <em>Freedman, </em>taking that factor into account resulted in a reprimand, rather than a suspension, as the Attorney Grievance Commission had urged. Of course, conduct that is an aberration can be so egregious as to warrant the imposition of a significant sanction. <em>Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. at 263, 619 A.2d at 105 (1993). Our approach to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>sanctioning attorneys is, thus, consistent with, and reflects, that recommended by American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (ABA Standards). ABA Standards For Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 9.82 (1992); <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 488-89, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996). The four questions that ABA Standard 3.0, ABA Standards at 17, pose for the sanctioning court, <em>ie., </em>\u2018(1) What is the nature of the ethical duty violated?; (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?; (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?; and (4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances?\u2019 mirror many of the considerations herein above enumerated. Standard 9.32 prescribes other factors, <em>id. </em>at 41-42, that we agree are relevant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHN\">\u2018Absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKH\">With regard to aggravating factors, we consider whether there are prior disciplinary offenses; whether the attorney acted with a dishonest or selfish motive; whether there is a pattern of misconduct; whether there are multiple offenses; whether there is \u201cbad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency\u201d; whether there was a submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process; whether the attorney refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of conduct; the vulnerability of victim; whether the attorney has substantial experience in the practice of law; and whether he or she displayed indiffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ence to making restitution. Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The petitioner recommends that the respondent be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law. Acknowledging that the hearing judge expressly found that the respondent did not act to deceive or defraud and made substantial findings of mitigation, the respondent focuses on his other finding, that the petitioner acted unreasonably and in bad faith, and on the respondent\u2019s disciplinary history, on the basis of which, it urges that the aggravating factors in this case outweigh the favorable findings and the mitigating factors. It submits, referencing Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 176-77, 994 A.2d 928, 945-46 (2010), in which this Court cited the Standards with approval, that the aggravating factors applicable in the case <em>sub judice </em>include the respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary history, that he engaged in a pattern of misconduct, in addition to the respondent\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the charges and the respondent\u2019s substantial experience in the practice of law. In support, the petitioner stresses what the hearing judge found, that, despite being \u201ctold over and over that he was not entitled to keep the funds associated with the lien\u201d and in spite of the authorities with which he was presented, the respondent persisted in doing so \u201cwithout adequate justification.\u201d The petitioner concludes: \u201cThis was not one mistake or even a series of mistakes. This was a consistent and persistent course of conduct that ignored the lien holder\u2019s rights to funds in the Respondent\u2019s possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">As indicated, the petitioner relies on the respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary history, which it maintains \u201cis very relevant to the sanction to be imposed.\u201d It argues, in that regard, that of the four prior sanctions, two of them \u201cdirectly relate to his failure to honor a lien of a third party.\u201d The petitioner points out that the respondent has been reprimanded twice for violation of MLRPC 1.15, first in 1998, by private reprimand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>on the direction of the Review Board, for failing to notify medical services providers that he had received funds in which they had an interest, and a year later, by this Court, pursuant to a Joint Petition for Reprimand by Consent, for failing to honor the lien of the compensation carrier in a Workers\u2019 Compensation matter. The respondent received another reprimand in 1983, this time for a violation of former DR7102(B)(1)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by failing to have his client correct the record after giving testimony at a deposition that the respondent knew was false. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>296 Md. 558, 565-66, 463 A.2d 868, 871 (1983). Finally, in 2004, the respondent was suspended indefinitely with the right to apply for reinstatement in ninety days. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 193, 844 A.2d 397, 405 (2004). In that case, which the petitioner submits \u201cagain involved his apparent myopia when it comes to the appropriate maintenance of other people\u2019s money,\u201d the respondent was found to have violated MLRPC Rules 1.15 and 8.4 and \u00a7 10-306 of the BOP Article. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 844 A.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The respondent responds that the petitioner\u2019s recommendation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cis far more severe than warranted in light of the Findings of Fact made by the trial judge; far more severe than warranted when compared to the facts and sanctions involved in other decisions of this Court; and far more severe than is necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of these proceedings, to protect the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Acknowledging that his conduct was inappropriate, although, as found by the hearing judge, unintentional, that it violated the Rules of Professional Conduct and that a suspension would be an appropriate sanction, he recommends a 30 day suspension, rather than an indefinite one.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>In support of his recommendation, the respondent emphasizes the purpose of attorney discipline, to protect the public and not to punish, and the hearing judge\u2019s mitigation findings. Specifically, he points to the findings that he did not act with a dishonest or selfish motive, negating one of the aggravating factors enumerated in Standards 9.22, on which we have relied, and that his intention always was to pass reductions he was able to achieve on to his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The respondent concedes, as he must, his disciplinary record, in particular that he has been sanctioned for similar conduct in failing to pay third party liens promptly. Acknowledging that and the aggravating factors the petitioner identifies, including his failure, on multiple occasions, to accept the Fund\u2019s exercise of its right to refuse to waive its liens, he argues that the mitigation found by the hearing judge outweighs the aggravating factors on which the petitioner relies. In addition to the lack of a dishonest, fraudulent or nefarious motive, he points to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that his MLRPC 8.4(d) violation did not involve misappropriation of client funds, the misuse of trust funds or the commingling of client funds, misconduct for which an indefinite suspension has been ordered, citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>403 Md. 695, 715-16, 944 A.2d 525, 537-38 (2008); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 386, 872 A.2d 693, 720 (2005); and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Santos, </em>370 Md. 77, 89, 803 A.2d 505, 512 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In addition, the respondent emphasizes two other mitigating factors that the hearing judge found, his remorse, that he \u201crecognizes his errors in both cases, and deeply regrets and is truly remorseful for his conduct,\u201d and his full and complete cooperation with Bar Counsel in the matter. Finally, the respondent relies on a change in his practice that triggers, after 60 days, the filing of an interpleader action when third party liens have not been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">There is merit in each of the parties\u2019 recommendations. That the respondent has previously been sanctioned for similar misconduct and yet engaged in that conduct again, on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>occasion prompting the hearing court to characterize his persistent and continuing pursuit of his untenable goal as \u201cunreasonable and made in bad faith,\u201d is deeply troubling. It is also significant that one of the prior disciplinary proceedings in which the respondent was found to have violated MLRPC 1.15 resulted in the respondent being sanctioned with an indefinite suspension, albeit with a specified minimum \u201csit-out\u201d period after which reinstatement could be sought. That sanction alone militates against acceptance of the respondent\u2019s recommendation of a \u201cbrief suspension of thirty days.\u201d Indeed, to adopt the respondent\u2019s recommendation, in view of a prior indefinite suspension involving similar misconduct as found in this case, would be inconsistent in that he would be receiving a lesser sanction for subsequent similar misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">On the other hand, the purpose of the disciplinary process and the mitigation findings made by the hearing judge cannot be disregarded. But for the latter, the respondent\u2019s conduct would represent \u201ca persistent or more egregious course of conduct in violation of our disciplinary rules [which] may lead to much more severe sanctions.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>300 Md. 306, 314, 477 A.2d 1190, 1194 (1984). Despite being aware of the respondent\u2019s inadequately supported persistent and continued conduct in the face of the adequate factual and legal justifications for its actions offered by the Fund and characterizing it, after a time as \u201cunreasonable and in bad faith,\u201d however, the hearing judge found that the respondent did not act dishonestly, fraudulently or with a \u201cnefarious motive\u201d in pursuing a reduction of the Fund\u2019s liens. He also found the respondent\u2019s remorse genuine, although aware of the respondent\u2019s grievance history \u2014 he presided over the case in which the respondent was indefinitely suspended\u2014 and the similarity of some of the past sanctioned conduct to the charged conduct <em>sub judice. </em>We have said that appreciation of, and remorse for, the serious impropriety of past conduct is evidence that the attorney will not thereafter engage in such unethical conduct if permitted to continue practice, a factor to be considered in determining the appropriate sanction. <em>Paul, </em>423 Md. at 285, 31 A.3d at 522; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>Attorney Griev.

Moreover, the hearing judge expressly found that the clients were not harmed, the Fund was paid from the respondent\u2019s personal funds, and that steps were now in place to avoid a repetition of this scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">On balance, in light of the mitigation findings, giving effect to the purpose of attorney discipline, we believe the appropriate sanction is, as the petitioner recommends, an indefinite suspension; however, the respondent may apply for reinstatement after a minimum \u201csit-out\u201d period of six months.

As time passed, however, and after the respondent was reminded, by the Fund, that he signed the agreement with regard to the lien, and was provided with legal authority for the Fund\u2019s position, the court changed its position, \"findfing] that Respondent\u2019s continued retention of the Fund\u2019s payment and his continuing demands for the Fund to contribute towards attorneys fees were unreasonable and made in bad faith.\u201d The court also expressed concern that the respondent failed to supply information requested by the Fund to permit it to \"reconsider its position\u201d or respond to the Fund's factual and legal justification for refusing to do so. So it is that the hearing court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\"With respect to the liens, the Respondent never claimed entitlement on his own behalf (or on behalf of his clients) to any more than one-third of the monies he maintained for the Fund. Yet, he never so much as offered the Fund any amount to which it was entitled. Rather, he met the legitimate and documented demands of the Fund\u2019s representatives with silence, demands for reduction and finally, demands to be paid a fee. The Respondent held the monies to pay the liens hostage until the Fund relented and reduced its lien or paid him a fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">.
