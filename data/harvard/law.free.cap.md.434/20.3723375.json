The officer that responded to the accident scene, having noted a \u201cstrong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from the person and breath\u201d of the respondent, arrested the respondent, and requested that he take a blood test to determine alcohol concentration. Following a hearing before the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d), on December 10, 2007, the Administrative Law Judge suspended the respondent\u2019s drivers license for 90 days pursuant to Maryland Code (1977, 2006 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(A) of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The Circuit Court for Carroll County reversed the order of suspension, holding that \u201creasonable grounds ... that [Mr. Sanner] was under the influence of alcohol or intoxicated,\u201d could be inferred \u201conly if, in combination with the odor of alcohol, the accident was [Mr. Sanner\u2019s] fault.\u201d The petitioner, the MVA, filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Sanner, </em>406 Md. 443, 959 A.2d 792 (2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question presented for review is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cDoes a police officer\u2019s certification that a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was present on the breath and person of a driver involved in a motor vehicle crash constitute reasonable grounds to request an alcohol content test under Transportation Article \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We shall hold that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) determination, that the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to request that the respondent take a chemical test for alcohol concentration, was supported by substantial evidence, and, therefore, was not arbitrary, capricious, or premised on any erroneous conclusion of law. Accordingly, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the reasons set forth hereinafter, answering the question presented in the affirmative, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">On May 12, 2007, at approximately 10:00 p.m., a vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Flower Avenue and Maine Street in Westminister, Maryland. Upon his arrival at the scene of the collision, Trooper First Class Brian Clinton of the Maryland State Police (\u201cMSP\u201d) determined that the respondent was the driver of one of the vehicles involved in the collision and, while interacting with the respondent, he detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage \u201cemitting from [his] person and breath.\u201d The respondent was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and taken to Carroll Hospital Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Upon his arrival at the hospital, the respondent was advised, through the MVA\u2019s DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d form,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the consequences of refusing or failing a chemical test for alcohol, and the administrative sanctions attendant to the taking or refusing of a test for alcohol content. The respondent agreed to take a test for alcohol content. Trooper Clinton directed an emergency care technician at the hospital to draw a specimen of blood from the respondent. That specimen was tested at the MSP Forensics Science Division by a qualified analyst, with the result that Mr. Sanner\u2019s blood alcohol content was found to be 0.22 \u2014 more than two-and-a-half times the legal limit. The test result was duly certified on MSP Form 33 (Notification to Defendant of Result of Test Alcohol Concentration). Trooper Clinton also completed a MVA DR-15A (Officer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension) form, in which he set forth the \u201cReasonable Grounds\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>for his belief that Mr. Sanner was driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or impaired by alcohol. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cOn 5/12/07 at 2200 hrs I responded to Flower Ave at Main St. for an accident. The 1st driver was identified by his [Maryland] Driver\u2019s License to be Jerry Dale Sanner. I detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from person and breath. A blood test was completed and a .22 result was detected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The respondent was notified that his driving privileges would be suspended for 90 days. In response, as he was permitted by \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(1) of the Transportation Article<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to do, the respondent requested a hearing to challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>MVA\u2019s order of suspension. The matter was heard by an ALJ of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings, who accepted into evidence, without objection from the respondent, documentary exhibits offered by the MVA, namely, 1) Trooper Clinton\u2019s DR15A Certification; 2) The DR-15 Advice of Rights form signed by Trooper Clinton and the respondent; and 3) the MSP-33 Notification to Defendant of Result of Test Alcohol Concentration form, which recorded the respondent\u2019s test result of 0.22. Trooper Clinton had not been subpoenaed to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">After these exhibits had been admitted, the respondent moved for a \u201cno action\u201d disposition. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201c[tjhere [was] no evidence in the record, particularly the officer\u2019s certification, [MVA exhibit] Number Four, which indicated] that the police officer who stopped or detained Mr. Sanner had reasonable grounds to believe the person who was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol or while impaired by alcohol. The [Maryland Transportation Article] clearly requires that in 16-205.1(f)(8)(l). The only evidence, the only indication of anything is that there is emitting ... Alcohol beverage emitting from the person and breath. Nothing else indicates in any way that Mr. Sanner is under the influence of or was impaired by alcohol. Clearly alcohol breath in itself isn\u2019t sufficient for those grounds under any standard in any judicial system for proving what is necessary to proceed under 16-205.1 and based upon those grounds no action should be taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The ALJ continued the matter so that Trooper Clinton could appear and testify. When the case reconvened, Trooper Clinton failed to appear, and the respondent renewed his request for a \u201cno action\u201d disposition. The ALJ reviewed the documentary evidence that had been admitted previously and, regarding the issue of reasonable grounds, concluded that it was sufficient and that the petitioner had made out a prima facie case. The ALJ reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201c[A]t this time I\u2019m not going to grant the no action on the basis of the documents alone. I\u2019m certainly willing to listen to testimony from your client, but in terms of the basis of the officer to make the stop of this particular individual, the accident in and of itself is more than sufficient grounds to interact with this particular person on that date and time. The accident is what can be the triggering event that this officer would have reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle under the influence or impaired by alcohol. There are lots of different cases, if you look at <em>[Motor Vehicle Admin, </em>v.] <em>Illiano, </em>[390 Md. 265, 888 A.2d 329 (2005) ]; <em>Illiano </em>very specifically says that it can be a failed headlight. It can be an expired tag. It can be a good faith stop for help and safety reasons. It can be a whole host of different reasons why an officer may stop and interact with the driver. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the observation of weaving, running through red lights. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the observation of driving. If you go to <em>Illiano </em>it details a whole host of different scenarios in which an officer can interact with a driver and that interaction with the driver would be sufficient to make the grounds that this person was driving. And then it takes it from there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\u201cSo I have found that this officer had more than sufficient grounds and reasonable; more importantly reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Sanner was driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or impaired by alcohol. Not only do I have the boilerplate language but I have very clearly the officer\u2019s hand written notations under the reasonable grounds that Mr. Sanner was the driver involved in a motor vehicle accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cSo at this point I would entertain testimony from [Mr. Sanner] to challenge the MVA\u2019s prima facie case at this time. If there\u2019s a challenge that would call into question [sic] then at that point I may change my ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">After the respondent declined to testify on the merits or proffer any testimony that might have undermined the probative value of Trooper Clinton\u2019s certification, the ALJ upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the order suspending the respondent\u2019s driving privileges for 90 days. The respondent, challenging the ALJ\u2019s order, filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision, issuing the following \u201cMemorandum <em>Opinion </em>and Order\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cOnce [Mr. Sanner] declined to testify on the merits the ALJ found the evidence before her to be sufficient to find [Mr. Sanner] in violation of [\u00a7 16.205.1 of the Maryland Transportation Article].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cThis Court finds that there was insufficient evidence before the ALJ to make such a finding. Specifically, a motor vehicle accident involving two vehicles could result from one driver\u2019s fault, the other driver\u2019s fault, or no one\u2019s fault. There is nothing in the DR 15(A) supporting that the accident was [Mr. Sanner\u2019s] fault, and it is only if the accident was [Mr. Sanner\u2019s fault] that an inference could be drawn, in combination with the odor of alcohol that there were reasonable grounds to conclude that [Mr. Sanner] was under the influence of alcohol or intoxicated. The strong smell of alcohol is [the] only evidence of [Mr. Sanner] having consumed alcohol. It is not, by itself, probative on the issue of whether [Mr. Sanner] was affected by alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cThe Court also finds the ALJ\u2019s determination to draw sufficient inferences from the available evidence arbitrary and capricious, in light of the fact that the ALJ had previously stated that she needed more evidence in the form of Trooper Clinton\u2019s testimony. Although the ALJ did specifically state on October 3, 2007 that [Mr. Sanner\u2019s] no action request would not necessarily succeed even if Trooper Clinton did not appear, the inconsistency between her need for his testimony on October 3, 2007 and her conclusion that she did not need it on December 10, 2007 remains unresolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">\u201cFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfA\">\u201cORDERED, that the Motor Vehicle Administration\u2019s Conclusion of Law of December 10, 2007 that the Petitioner had violated Transportation Article \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Maryland Code Annotated be and the same is hereby REVERSED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>As we have noted above, the MVA filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of the Circuit Court\u2019s decision and we granted the petition. We shall now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In <em>Maryland Aviation Admin, v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005), Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, explicated the proper standard of review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201cA court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u2018whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u2018must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u2019 and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">\u201cDespite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is not to \u2018substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u2019 Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 571-72, 873 A.2d at 1154-55 (footnote omitted) (citations omitted) (emphasis omitted). <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 14-15, 997 A.2d 768, 775-76 (2010); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

Vol.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Section 16-205.1 of the Maryland Transportation Article, also known as Maryland\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d or \u201cadministrative per se\u201d law, was enacted to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and protect public safety. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 374, 739 A.2d 58, 68 (1999). <em>See Shea, </em>415 Md. at 15, 997 A.2d at 776; <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 255, 923 A.2d 100, 108 (2007); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 178-79, 844 A.2d 388, 396-97 (2004); <em>Embrey v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>339 Md. 691, 697, 664 A.2d 911, 914 (1995); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Vermeersch, </em>331 Md. 188, 194, 626 A.2d 972, 975 (1993); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. 306, 313, 604 A.2d 919, 922 (1992). In order to further this goal, \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) authorizes the detention of any individual who is suspected of \u201cdriving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Probable cause to arrest is not necessary before requesting that a driver take a test to determine alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>concentration. <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 368 n. 7, 739 A.2d at 64 n. 7. All that is required is \u201creasonable grounds,\u201d on the part of the police officer, \u201cto believe [that] the individual was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">This Court previously held that \u201cthe term, \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019, as used in \u00a7 16-205.1 means \u2018reasonable articulable suspicion\u2019 and not preponderance of the evidence or probable cause.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>399 Md. at 254, 923 A.2d at 107. Our cases make clear that this standard is met when a police officer detects a strong odor of alcohol, combined with other signs of impairment. <em>See, e.g., Id. </em>at 246, 923 A.2d at 102-103 (strong odor of alcohol on driver\u2019s breath combined with speeding, bloodshot eyes, a preliminary breath test result of .10, and the driver\u2019s admission that he drank two beers established reasonable grounds); <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 268-69, 888 A.2d at 331-32 (strong odor of alcohol coming from vehicle combined with driver\u2019s statements and performance on field sobriety tests established reasonable grounds); <em>Atterbeary, </em>368 Md. at 484-85, 796 A.2d at 78 (strong odor of alcohol on driver combined with slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and failed sobriety tests established reasonable grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In this case, Trooper Clinton\u2019s detection of a \u201cstrong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the person and breath of Mr. Sanner,\u201d combined with the undisputed fact that Mr. Sanner was the driver of one of the vehicles involved in an accident more than meets the standard of reasonable suspicion that the statute and our case law require. Not only does the Circuit Court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe strong smell of alcohol is [the] only evidence of Mr. Sanner having consumed alcohol and not probative on the issue of whether Mr. Sanner was affected by alcohol,\u201d directly contradict what this Court said in <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Div. 1300 v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>305 Md. 380, 393, 504 A.2d 1132, 1138 (1986), that \u201c[a] sufficiently strong odor of alcohol on the motorist\u2019s breath can furnish reasonable grounds\u201d to \u201crequest or require an individual to take a chemical test for alcohol [under 16-205.1],\u201d it\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>fault/no-fault based definition of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d imposes a requirement that cannot be supported by either the plain language of \u00a7 16-205.1 or this Court\u2019s precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">There also is no merit to the Circuit Court\u2019s finding that the \u201cALJ\u2019s determination to draw sufficient inferences from the available evidence [was] arbitrary and capricious, in light of the fact that the ALJ had previously stated [at the October 3, 2007 hearing] that she needed more evidence in the form of Trooper Clinton\u2019s testimony.\u201d The following transpired immediately after the respondent\u2019s Counsel moved for a \u201cno action disposition\u201d at the initial hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201c[ALJ]: All right. Since counsel has challenged an issue that was brought up by the MVA concerning the evidence of use of alcohol other than alcohol odor I would not be granting you a no action on this basis but instead I will grant the MVA\u2019s request for subpoena for the officer to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201c[Respondent\u2019s Counsel]: Just for the record, I\u2019m totally not totally clear of the answer. I would object to whether you have the ability to do that but I\u2019m not going to argue the point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201c[ALJ] We\u2019re in ... I have three choices ... I may accept exclusively the entire proffer denying the subpoena request which would be that if you [Respondent\u2019s counsel], on behalf of the Licensee [Mr. Sanner], were to make a proffer that there was nothing other than the odor alcohol and you\u2019re making the proffer, not the MVA, you\u2019re making the proffer and that there\u2019s nothing there but the odor of alcohol and that\u2019s your proffer and I believe when I subpoena the police officer this police officer will testify the officer had nothing but an odor of alcohol, that\u2019s all he had to go on before he went through the process of asking for Advice of Rights and then taking of the blood test or a breathalyzer. I can deny the subpoena request; accept all the evidence before me, including the proffer and under this option, if I determine that the proffer is assumed true in its entirety and it\u2019s sufficient to rebut the conflicting evidence then you win <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>without the need for the subpoena for the police officer. That would be option A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">\u201cOption B. I can reject the proffer as a whole, also denying the subpoena request but if I do that I must provide additionally a valid explanation for my rejection and this will enable me to dispose of otherwise improper subpoena requests. So you make the proffer and if ... I think there\u2019s more than sufficient ruling without the officer being present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201cOr third, and this is where I am. Third and it says, an uncertainty of accuracy of the driver\u2019s proffer. Now you\u2019ve made no real proffer. The MVA\u2019s made a subpoena request and the proffer in the subpoena request is that we believe that the evidence of use of alcohol may not be enough for you, Administrative Law Judge, to make a decision in this case. Counsel is actually agreeing with the MVA on this point. I\u2019m saying I think you\u2019re both right. How about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201c[Respondent\u2019s Counsel] There you go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201c[ALJ]: So I am going to suspend judgment, make no decision. I believe that I do need some additional information in order to make a determination. And for those reasons I will postpone ... Continue the matter; subpoena the police officer for the officer to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201c[ALJ] <em>If the officer does not appear for whatever reason which does indeed happen from time to time it would not necessarily mean that it will result in a no action being granted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">\u201cOkay. What I\u2019ve written here is you\u2019ve made the reasonable grounds argument that there was no reasonable grounds to establish that Mr. Sanner was under the influence of impaired by alcohol, that the DR15(a) only notes the odor of alcohol nothing else. I agreed. Because the MVA did request a subpoena on this issue I\u2019ve continued the matter to subpoena [Trooper Clinton]. I\u2019ve noted that there\u2019s been no testimony taken in this case and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>there\u2019s been no testimony I have not made a ... <em>I\u2019ve held in abeyance my decision making and so if the officer doesn\u2019t show up it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a no action will result.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The record illustrates that the ALJ did not state that she would grant the respondent\u2019s \u201cno action\u201d request if Trooper Clinton failed to appear, or that she needed Trooper Clinton\u2019s testimony before proceeding to make findings based on the documentary evidence before her. Her statement \u201cI agreed\u201d is ambiguous, at best. That is especially so when that statement is considered along with her statements, made both before \u2014 \u201cIf the officer does not appear for whatever reason which does indeed happen from time to time it would not necessarily mean that it will result in a no action being granted\u201d \u2014 and after \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve held in abeyance my decision making and so if the officer doesn\u2019t show up it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a no action will result\u201d \u2014 the \u201cI agreed\u201d statement, indicating that the trooper\u2019s failure to appear would not be dispositive of whether a no action finding would be made. Apart from the context, on one hand, \u201cI agreed\u201d could have meant that she initially agreed with the respondent\u2019s counsel, that there were no reasonable grounds to conclude that the respondent was under the influence of alcohol or intoxicated; on the other hand, it simply could have meant that the she \u201cagreed\u201d to postpone the hearing because the MVA did, in fact, request a subpoena for Trooper Clinton. This ambiguity, which easily could have been explored by the respondent\u2019s counsel at any point during the rescheduled hearing simply was not pursued. Instead, the respondent chose not to testify at the hearing and, more important, when offered the opportunity to do so, he did not proffer any evidence, or argument, that would have undermined the MVA\u2019s documentary evidence. We are satisfied from these facts that the ALJ\u2019s decision to make findings based on the documentary evidence before her was neither \u201carbitrary\u201d nor \u201ccapricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8f\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATION.
