They, like the one before them, can be traced back to the discharge of Kevin Clark, the petitioner, from his position as Police Commissioner for Baltimore City, by the former Mayor of Baltimore City, Martin O\u2019Malley (\u201cMayor\u201d), and the City Council of Baltimore, the respondents. The facts surrounding that discharge and the procedural posture of the case pending this Court\u2019s first decision were summarized in <em>Mayor &amp; City Council v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 944 A.2d 1122 (2008) <em>(Clark II):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aob\">\u201cThe respondent, Kevin P. Clark (hereinafter \u2018Clark\u2019 or \u2018the respondent\u2019), in 2003 was appointed the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City by the Mayor of the City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Baltimore (hereinafter \u2018Mayor\u2019) and confirmed by the City Council. Prior to his confirmation, Clark and the Mayor entered into a contract, denominated \u2018Memorandum of Understanding,\u2019 (MOU), \u2018to employ the services of Clark as the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City.\u2019 The contract, which purported to be for \u2018the remaining term of the last Commissioner until June 30, 2008,\u2019 addressed the terms and conditions of Clark\u2019s employment as Police Commissioner. One term related to his removal as Commissioner. Albeit in the context of \u2018Additional Compensation/Severance Pay,\u2019 the parties acknowledged, in Section 2. A. of the MOU, the applicability of PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) to the removal of the Commissioner [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and denied any intention to \u2018affect the rights of the Mayor in that respect.\u2019 In another section, however, the agreement introduced and prescribed another method of removal, one not contemplated or addressed in the Code of Public Local Laws, termination without cause. Section 12. of the MOU provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201c \u2018Either party may terminate this contract at any time, by giving forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other. Notwithstanding the above sentence the provisions of Section 2B [5] remain in force.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cClark commenced his role as Police Commissioner following the signing of the MOU. A little more than a year and a half later, on November 10, 2004, however, \u2018pursuant to Sections 12 and 13 of the Memorandum of Understanding,\u2019 he was relieved of his command. The letter providing the requisite forty-five days notice of the termination of the MOU and, thus, terminating his tenure as Police Commissioner, was delivered to Clark by the City Solicitor, and, as relevant, advised:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">\u201c \u2018This notice is sent on behalf of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u2018City\u2019) pursuant to Sections 12 and 13 of the Memorandum of Understanding (\u2018MOU\u2019) between you and the City dated February 19, 2003. This notice shall serve as the City\u2019s 45-day notice of termination of your employment. Thus, your employment shall terminate 45 days from today. However, as the Mayor announced this morning, you have been relieved of all official duties as of 8:30 a.m., November 10, 2004, and therefore, your further access, if any, to Police Department facilities, equipment, or documents will be subject to the specific, prior authorization of Acting or Interim Police Commissioner Hamm.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cClark filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a verified complaint, naming as defendants, Mayor Martin O\u2019Malley and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, in which, in addition to seeking reinstatement as Police Commissioner and monetary damages, he requested declaratory and injunctive relief. After some preliminary skirmishing, consisting of the denial of injunctive relief and the denial of the petitioner\u2019s dispositive motion for summary judgment, Clark filed an amended complaint. In response, the petitioner again moved for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment to the petitioners, concluding that the MOU was a valid and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>unambiguous contract, pursuant to which Clark had been lawfully terminated, upon notice properly given pursuant to paragraphs 12 and 13 thereof. The Circuit Court also issued a declaratory judgment, in which, consistently, it declared that the Mayor properly had terminated Clark, without cause, on proper notice. Clark immediately noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201cThe intermediate appellate court reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Clark v. O\u2019Malley, </em>169 Md.App. 408, 901 A.2d 279 (2006) <em>[Clark </em>/]. Concluding that the trial court erred in holding, as a matter of law, that the MOU was valid and enforceable, it held that the Mayor did not have the authority to remove a Police Commissioner pursuant to a contract providing for removal without cause, the Mayor\u2019s ability to remove the Police Commissioner having been limited by the <em>General Assembly, </em>169 Md.App. at 439, 901 A.2d at 297, and, therefore, the removal provisions of the MOU were invalid. The Mayor and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore timely filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, which we granted. <em>Baltimore v. Clark, </em>395 Md. 56, 909 A.2d 259 (2006).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 16-19, 944 A.2d at 1124-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">After considering and rejecting the various arguments advanced by the petitioners in that case in challenging the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision, we addressed the only question presented by the petitioner\u2019s \u201ccert\u201d petition: \u201cwhether Kevin Clark is bound by the unambiguous \u2018right to terminate without cause\u2019 provision in the employment contract that he negotiated with the City of Baltimore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 944 A.2d at 1136.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We held that a provision of an employment contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>entered into by the Mayor and a candidate for police commissioner in connection with the latter\u2019s appointment to that office, and which gave the Mayor the right to terminate the Police Commissioner\u2019s employment, without cause, did not trump P.L.L. \u00a7 16 \u2014 5(e), which, by its terms limited the May- or\u2019s power of discharge to the grounds set forth therein and, therefore, was unenforceable. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cThe removal power, as articulated in \u00a7 16-5(e), we hold, is not modifiable by a MOU, and, in particular, the contractual language at issue in the case sub judice. In that regard, we reiterate, \u2018a contract conflicting with public policy set forth in a statute is invalid to the extent of the conflict between the contract and that policy.\u2019 <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 39, 811 A.2d 297, 304 (2002). <em>See also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>307 Md. 631, 643, 516 A.2d 586, 592 (1986) (holding that a contractual provision that violates public policy is invalid, but only to the extent of conflict between stated public policy and contractual provision). Thus, because the provision of the MOU that states that \u2018[ejither party may terminate this contract at any time, by giving forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other\u2019 without need to provide cause, conflicts with \u00a7 16-5(e) of the Public Local Laws, that provision, pursuant to which the Mayor acted' to terminate Clark, is unenforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 33, 944 A.2d at 1133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. That court, as we have seen, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court on the grounds that the Mayor\u2019s reliance on Section 12 of the employment contract did not entitle him to judgment as a matter of law. Thus, concluding that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>circuit court erred in holding as a matter of law that the entire contract between the parties was valid and enforceable,\u201d it remanded the case to the Circuit Court to \u201cconsider the additional questions that have been raised by the City, including questions of waiver, estoppel, and damages.\u201d <em>Clark v. O\u2019Malley, </em>169 Md.App. at 440, 901 A.2d at 297 <em>aff'd sub nom. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 944 A.2d 1122 (2008). More particularly, with respect to damages, the intermediate appellate court advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">\u201cThe Mayor argues that \u2018Paragraph 2B of the contract is a valid and enforceable provision providing for limitation of liability and liquidated damages,\u2019 and maintains that Clark has already been paid all the monetary damages to which he is entitled. Because the court ruled that section 12 of the MOU was valid and enforceable, and that Clark had been properly terminated under that provision, it did not address whether section 2.B. limits Clark\u2019s claim for damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgA\"><em>Id. </em>at 440 n. 10, 901 A.2d at 297 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Armed with the opinion in <em>Clark II, </em>Mr. Clark claimed entitlement to, among other things, reinstatement as Police Commissioner of Baltimore City. Accordingly, he filed in the Circuit Court a Motion for Writ of Mandamus or Motion for Injunction for Reinstatement to Office Forthwith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that motion, referencing counts III and V of his First Amended Complaint, Mr. Clark argued that this Court, in <em>Clark II, </em>\u201cruled unanimously ... that Plaintiff was removed from the Office of Police Commissioner of Baltimore City illegally by Mayor O\u2019Malley,\u201d which effectively required the City to reinstate him as police commissioner. For this latter proposition, he relied on <em>Forami v. Reynolds, </em>248 Md. 246, 252-53, 236 A.2d 20, 25 (1967), in which we stated, \u201cthe writ of mandamus may issue ... to reinstate a person in office from which he has been illegally removed,\u201d and <em>Field v. Malster, </em>88 Md. 691, 705, 41 <em>A, </em>1087, 1091 (1898), in which this Court ordered an officer illegally removed from office reinstated to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>In addition to opposing the petitioner\u2019s motion for reinstatement, the respondents moved for summary judgment. In their opposition, they raised the issue of proper parties, noting that the Mayor who removed the petitioner from office was no longer Mayor, but now the Governor, and the petitioner\u2019s failure to join his successor as a defendant. From these facts, the respondents argue that the then present Mayor may not be ordered to reinstate a police commissioner, whom she did not discharge, and litigation to determine the rightful occupant of a public office requires that the incumbent in that office be joined as a party, which the petitioner failed to do in this case. The respondents also point to the fact that the petitioner\u2019s term \u2014 he was filling the unexpired term of the prior commissioner \u2014 would expire within a short time after the filing of their opposition, making reinstatement \u201cboth pointless and counterproductive,\u201d citing <em>McKeever v. Washington Heights Realty Corp., </em>183 Md. 216, 223-24, 37 A.2d 305, 310 (1944). Finally, relying on <em>Dept. Of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Svcs. v. Donahue, </em>400 Md. 510, 529 n. 7, 929 A.2d 512, 524 n. 7 (2007), which recognizes that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d may trump the preferred remedy of the reinstatement of an illegally discharged employee, the respondents maintain that there are such circumstances in this case and that they, \u201cplus Clark\u2019s failure to adequately plead and meet the substantive elements of the relief requested warrant dismissal of his claims for reinstatement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">With regard to the motion for summary judgment, the respondents made four arguments. First, characterizing \u00a7 2.B. of the MOU<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a liquidated damages clause and maintaining its validity, they argued that, as a result, \u201cas a matter of law, Clark is barred from recovering additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>damages in this case.\u201d Next, noting that the petitioner \u201cknowingly and voluntarily entered into an employment contract\u201d and for almost 2 years \u201caccepted the substantial benefits of that agreement,\u201d the respondents submitted that he is equitably estopped to deny the validity of the contract or to \u201creap a windfall based upon a claim of illegality in a contract which has been performed and from which they have received benefits.\u201d This same conduct, the respondents perceived and thus contended, constituted the waiver by the petitioner of his right to sue for additional damages. Finally, they asserted that the petitioner\u2019s breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Subsequently, Mr. Clark moved for partial summary judgment. In that motion, he argued that the issue of liability was conclusively decided, as a matter of law, by Clark II and that, therefore, the only unresolved issue was damages. In that regard, cognizant of the remand and its purpose, <em>see Clark, </em>169 Md.App. at 440 n. 10, 901 A.2d at 297 n. 10, and directing the court\u2019s attention to language in Clark II that he believes to be dispositive of that issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201c[I]t is well settled that, where the General Assembly has announced public policy, the Court will decline to enter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>public policy debate, even when it is the common law that is at issue and the Court certainly has authority to change the common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">404 Md. at 36, 944 A.2d 1122, 1135-36, the petitioner submitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cThe above-quoted (and emphasized) statement from the opinion ... which pronounces the Court\u2019s refusal to change the common law even where the Court has the authority to do so, clearly disposes of any alleged outstanding common law issues regarding estoppel and waiver. As opposing counsel and the Court are aware, estoppel and waiver are common law principles .... the Court of Appeals has addressed and disposed of any common law questions of estoppel and waiver as a matter of law and has given an unequivocally firm statement that the Court will not interject itself into those common law questions in the context of a contract provision found to be contrary to public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cAdditionally, since the Court of Appeals decided that the termination without cause provision of the Memorandum of Understanding ... is unenforceable and contrary to public policy as a matter of law, any argument by the defense that Plaintiff is barred under principles of estoppel and waiver from arguing that the MOU is unenforceable has been rendered a non-issue.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Moreover, \u2018[o]ne cannot be es-topped from asserting the unenforceability of a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>which is against public policy and therefore invalid.\u2019 <em>Stanbaugh [Stambaugh </em>] <em>v. Child Support Admin., </em>323 Md. 106, 113, 591 A.2d 501, 504 (1991) (and cases cited therein).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADx\">A judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied Mr. Clark mandamus/injunction motion, rejecting the argument that <em>Clark II </em>was dispositive of that issue. Specifically, she pointed out that \u201cnowhere in the Clark opinion or in its mandate does the Court of Appeals order Clark\u2019s reinstatement. The Court of Appeals only addressed the legality and effect of the termination provision in the parties\u2019 MOU and determined that the Mayor had exceeded the authority particularized in P.L.L. \u00a7 16-5(e)\u201d and that this Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which included the remand of the case to the Circuit Court for consideration of outstanding issues of \u201cwaiver, estoppel and damages.\u201d The judge offered other rationales for her decision, some argued by the respondents, the failure to join proper parties, for example: that, given the amount of time remaining in his term, reinstatement would be \u201ca useless and nugatory act,\u201d citing <em>Brown, v. Bragunier, </em>79 Md. 234, 236, 29 A. 7, 8 (1894); that the petitioner\u2019s action for damages was \u201canother available, adequate remedy,\u201d citing <em>Myers v. Chief, Baltimore County Fire Bureau, </em>237 Md. 583, 207 A.2d 467 (1965); and, relying on <em>Kinlein v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>118 Md. 576, 581, 85 A. 679, 681 (1912), that, \u201cif reinstated, Kevin Clark\u2019s term as Police Commissioner would expire on June 30, 2008. Reinstatement for thirteen days or less would surely bring about great and unnecessary disorder and cause inevitable confusion in the operations and administration of the Baltimore Police Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Thereafter, another judge of the Circuit Court considered the cross-motions for summary judgment, denying Mr. Clark\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. With regard to the respondent\u2019s summary judgment motion, the court, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>determined that the other claims had been either waived or otherwise disposed of,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> considered only Count YII of the petitioner\u2019s complaint, his state constitutional violation claim for a denial of due process in connection with his firing. Acknowledging that the petitioner had made out a case for denial of due process in violation of a property interest, the court held that \u00a7 2.B. of the MOU, which it found to be a liquidated damages clause<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201cvalid and enforceable,\u201d limited his claim for compensatory damages. Indeed, the court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u201cThe issue of the continuing validity of the MOU \u00a7 2.B was expressly remanded to this Court for determination, in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 careful articulation that a contract provision that violates public policy is invalid only to the extent of conflict between the stated public policy and the contractual provision. <em>See </em>404 Md. at 33, 944 A.2d 1122. The liquidated damages provision presents no such conflict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV0\">Because there was no disputed issue of material fact and the only basis for compensatory damages greater than those already paid \u2014 that the Mayor relied on a contractual provision later found to be invalid \u2014 is insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, the court limited the damages to those already paid and granted summary judgment to the respondents. Turning to the motion for partial summary judgment, the court concluded that \u201cThe decisions of the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals did not address this issue [of liability]. They were confined to a finding that the termination provisions of the MOU, \u00a7\u00a7 2.A and 12, were unenforceable as in conflict with existing statutory law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In the Court of Special Appeals,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the petitioner made three arguments in challenging the rulings of the Circuit Court: that the court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for writ of mandamus or injunction reinstating him to office; that the court erred in denying his motion for partial summary judgment: and that the court erred in granting the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>dents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>Clark v. O\u2019Malley, </em>186 Md.App. 194, 199, 973 A.2d 821, 824 (2009). The first two arguments were premised on, and, indeed, depended on, the Court of Appeals having determined, on the merits, in <em>Clark II, </em>that his termination was unlawful, and, therefore, that he was entitled to reinstatement as Police Commissioner, as a matter of law. His third argument disputed that \u201cthe City had tendered a check for the sole damages to which Mr. Clark was entitled pursuant to the MOU.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215-16, 973 A.2d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected each of the petitioner\u2019s arguments. Because his term of employment had expired, it concluded that the petitioner\u2019s request for reinstatement was moot. <em>Id. </em>at 218, 973 A.2d at 835. In denying the petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, it concluded that our decision in <em>Clark II </em>\u201cdid not settle the ultimate question of liability,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 221, 973 A.2d at 836-37, noting, in support, that the decision it affirmed held that \u00a7 12 of the MOU was unenforceable, but it remanded the case to the circuit court to consider questions of waiver and estoppel, as well as \u201cwhether section 2.B limited Mr. Clark\u2019s claim for damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 973 A.2d at 836-37, quoting <em>Clark I, </em>169 Md.App. at 440 n. 10, 901 A.2d at 297 n. 10. Thus, the court held that the Circuit Court correctly interpreted our decision as \u201cconfined to a finding that the termination provisions of the MOU, \u00a7\u00a7 2.A and 12, were unenforceable as in conflict with existing statutory law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>186 Md.App. at 221, 973 A.2d at 836-37. With regard to the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the intermediate appellate court rejected the petitioner\u2019s \u201csole argument\u201d against it, that \u00a7 2.B violated public policy because it had some relation to \u201cthe duration of Mr. Clark\u2019s term of office,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 226, 973 A.2d at 839-40, and essentially adopted the reasoning of the Circuit Court \u2014 that \u00a7 2.B., which does not conflict with the public policy reflected in P.L.L. \u00a7 2-16(e), is a clear, unambiguous and valid liquidated damages clause, which is fully enforceable. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26, 973 A.2d at 839. And, because there was no dispute of material fact that the payments required to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>made pursuant to that section were made to the petitioner, the court held that summary judgment was properly entered in favor of the respondents on that point. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 973 A.2d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In this Court, the petitioner presents three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201c1. Where the Court of Appeals has determined that an official was illegally removed from his appointed term, may a Circuit Court preclude that official from returning to office for the remainder of the unexpired term?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Was the Court of Appeals holding in <em>Mayor City Council of Baltimore v. Clark </em>a final determination of Kevin Clark\u2019s violation of right to due process and liability concerning that violation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201c3. Assuming that <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Clark </em>did not resolve all contractual and liability issues in this case concerning the MOU, were the Respondents entitled to summary judgment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The underlying premise of the petitioner\u2019s first two arguments is that <em>Clark II </em>is dispositive of this case and all of its aspects, that it definitively determined not simply that the petitioner had been wrongly discharged, but also that there was nothing more to decide. As the petitioner sees it, a decision that the petitioner was wrongly discharged necessarily means that the agreement containing the provision determined to be contrary to law, was, itself, in its entirety, invalid and, therefore, the respondents liability also has been established conclusively, without regard to, and in spite of any other issues that might have been presented in the case. This is demonstrated by the caption to the petitioner\u2019s first argument, \u201cThe Lower Courts Had No Discretion To Deviate from the Court of Appeals\u2019 Decision,\u201d and confirmed by its first two sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201cIn <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Clark, </em>this Court concluded that on November 10, 2004, then Mayor Martin O\u2019Malley broke the law and illegally removed Petitioner, Kevin P. Clark, from office as Police Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>for Baltimore City. The stated basis for the removal, that was accomplished by gunpoint and through the deployment of a police S.W.A.T. unit, was a memorandum of understanding that was contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Throughout the remainder of the arguments, as a matter of fact, the petitioner makes clear that it is his interpretation of <em>Clark II </em>that \u201c[t]his Court having already ruled that the Mayor removed Petitioner illegally, the factual and legal issues in this case were conclusively determined.\u201d Proceeding from this premise, it follows that the petitioner would view any contrary interpretation by the Court of Special Appeals or the Circuit Court as \u201cattempt[s] to evade this Court\u2019s finding of illegal conduct by suggesting [that] another mode of discharge was appropriate pursuant to the MOU.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The cases on which the petitioner relies for the proposition that mandamus lies to effect his reinstatement, <em>Forami v. Reynolds, </em>248 Md. 246, 253, 236 A.2d 20, 25 (1967); <em>Field v. Malster, </em>88 Md. 691, 41 A. 1087 (1898); <em>Miles v. Stevenson, </em>80 Md. 358, 30 A. 646 (1894); <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Ocean City v. Johnson, </em>57 Md.App. 502, 517, 470 A.2d 1308, 1315 (1984), further make the point. In each of these cases, mandamus was sought to effect the reinstatement of a public official to an office from which, it was alleged, he had wrongly and illegally been removed. In each of these cases, what was presented for decision by the appellant court was the merits of the issue on the basis of which the writ of mandamus was sought and found to be warranted. In <em>Forami, </em>for example, the Mayor of Capital Heights, Maryland appealed the issuance of a writ of mandamus directing him to reinstate a police officer, whom he had told he was no longer a police officer, notwithstanding that the Common Town Council, as reflected by the minutes of the proceedings, had not voted to remove him, as it had done with respect to one of his fellow officers. <em>Forami, </em>248 Md. at 251, 236 A.2d at 24. While the Mayor was given, by Public Local Law,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the power to appoint police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>officers, his appointees could be removed by majority vote of the Common Council and the Mayor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Mayor did not dispute the occurrence, rather he sought to veto the action of the Common Council and justify his own actions. <em>Id. </em>at 249, 236 A.2d at 23. The matter was presented for decision in this posture. This Court, addressing the question of the officer\u2019s entitlement to reinstatement, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that Sergeant Brommer was entitled to be reinstated in his office. He was duly appointed to his office by the mayor in June, 1966, and this appointment was confirmed by the Town Council at its meeting of June 13, 1966. It is not clear from the ordinance (section 8-19 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code already quoted) that he was required to take the oath of office again as he had already taken the oath at the time of his original prior appointment. Assuming, arguendo, that he was required to take the oath again, the duty of the mayor to administer this oath to him was merely ministerial and the mayor may properly be compelled by mandamus to administer the oath as part of the Sergeant\u2019s reinstatement. <em>Spitzer v. Martin, </em>130 Md. 428, 100 A. 739 (1917); <em>Groome v. Gwinn, </em>43 Md. 572 (1875).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u201cHaving been validly appointed and confirmed as a police officer, Sergeant Brommer could only be removed from his office as provided in section 8-48 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code. No proceedings under this section were filed against him nor has there been a majority vote of the Council to remove him under that section. On the contrary, a motion was approved by the Council at its meeting of July 11, 1966, to reinstate him by a vote of three in the affirmative, one in the negative, one not voting and one absent. Whatever may be the effect of this action, it is clear that there was no vote of a majority of the Council to remove him under section 8-48.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">248 Md. at 258-54, 236 A.2d at 25-26. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Ocean City v. Johnson, </em>57 Md.App. at 517, 470 A.2d at 1315, is to like effect. There, the question of the invalidity of the regulations and thus their improper enforcement against Johnson, was directly presented, and, so, \u201chis right to reinstatement was not \u2018doubtful,\u2019 and the Chiefs obligation was not a discretionary one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, 470 A.2d 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Although the petitioner\u2019s action included counts for reinstatement to his position and for damages, the posture in which <em>Clark II </em>reached this Court was vastly different. The respondents\u2019 liability to the petitioner for wrongful discharge was implicated, to be sure; however, what was presented related only to one aspect of liability, not the entirety of the legal and factual issues that were required to be resolved to establish liability, such that reinstatement inexorably would follow. Moreover, <em>Clark II </em>must be viewed in the context of the litigation as it proceeded through the appellate process. The Court of Special Appeals did not resolve the issue of the respondents\u2019 liability to the petitioner for illegal discharge, although, as the case reached it, the case was ripe for the exoneration of the respondents entirely. Rather, the <em>intermediate </em>appellate court, having concluded that there were no disputed issues of material fact, <em>id. </em>at 425, 901 A.2d at 289, determined that the respondents were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, identifying, as the impediment to that result, a provision in an employment agreement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>respondents and the petitioner executed that conflicted with, by expanding, the statutory authority given the Mayor, by the General Assembly, to discharge the Baltimore City Police Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 901 A.2d at 297. That court also recognized that its decision was not dispositive of the issues raised by the parties and, so, ordered the remand of the case to the Circuit Court to consider the issues raised, but yet to be resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 440, 901 A.2d at 297. One such issue it identified was the relationship of the employment agreement to, and its impact on, the petitioner\u2019s litigation challenging his discharge. As the Court of Special Appeals stated, one of the issues was: \u201cwhether section 2.B limited Mr. Clark\u2019s claim for damages.\u201d <em>Clark I, </em>169 Md.App. at 440 n. 10, 901 A.2d at 297 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Although the respondents filed a petition for writ of certiorari to challenge the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that they were not entitled to judgment by reason of the contractual provision, significantly, the petitioner did not cross-petition to challenge the necessity for remand or otherwise to clarify that the judgment entered by the intermediate appellate court was a dispositive one insofar as the illegality of his discharge and entitlement to relief were concerned. Thus, the only question on which we granted certiorari and, therefore, on which we opined was, as we have seen, that challenging the propriety of the judgment rendered by the Court of Special Appeals, \u201cwhether Kevin Clark is bound by the unambiguous \u2018right to terminate without cause\u2019 provision in the employment contract that he negotiated with the City of Baltimore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 944 A.2d at 1136. We answered that question consistent with the way in which the intermediate appellate court had done. <em>Id. </em>at 36, 944 A.2d 1136. Therefore, we affirmed that court\u2019s judgment. In so doing, we necessarily endorsed its remand for the consideration of outstanding issues, issues that the Circuit Court did not address because of its grant of summary judgment, including whether \u00a7 2.B. of the MOU limited the petitioner\u2019s damages claim. That was the extent of this Court\u2019s ruling on the issue of the petitioner\u2019s entitlement to relief. We clearly did not, as both judges of the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>and the Court of Special Appeals, have pointed out, address, not to mention decide, the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims for reinstatement and monetary damages. Far from it, we simply confirmed a ground on which he could prevail and remanded the case for additional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">As we have seen, the very foundation of the petitioner\u2019s argument for reinstatement and for his claim of error in the denial of his motion for partial summary judgment is that this Court reached the merits of his reinstatement claim and decided it in his favor. Indeed, his argument rises or falls on that premise. Because, as the foregoing demonstrates, neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals reached the merits of his claims or purported to do so and neither decision had the effect of doing so, we hold that the petitioner was not entitled to reinstatement or, as the petitioner maintains, to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The petitioner argues that, even if <em>Clark II </em>did not resolve the issue of liability, the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court below should not have denied Mr. Clark\u2019s requests for mandamus and partial summary judgment. With respect to the former, he submits that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when, despite \u201c[tjhis Court [having] unequivocally established that Mr. Clark had not been afforded due process protection prior to his removal as Police Commissioner and that his removal pursuant to an MOU was illegal and unenforceable,\u201d it denied his mandamus petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>He also faults the Circuit Court for, by that same action, ignoring the law of the case doctrine and reinterpreting the MOU to circumscribe this Court\u2019s opinion by determining that not all of the MOU\u2019s provisions were invalid.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By so doing, the petitioner complains that both \u201c[t]he Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals ignored the illegality of the act by the Respondents and focused instead on a questionable theory of alternative termination under \u00a7 2.B. of the MOU.\u201d Finally, he asserts that the Circuit Court ignored his clear right to be reinstated to his unexpired term, contending that its conclusion, premised, in part, on the failure to join necessary parties to the litigation, that reinstatement would be \u201cuseless or nugatory\u201d \u201cwas mere speculation,\u201d not supported by a factual basis established at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Concerning his entitlement to partial summary judgment, the petitioner contends that there are issues of fact in dispute, namely those involving liability and the interpretation of the MOU. One such dispute, he suggests, is that concerning the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201creinstatement of the contract,\u201d as well as the application of \u00a7 2.B., \u201cthe so-called liquidated damages provision,\u201d to the petitioner\u2019s action against the respondents. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>that regard, the petitioner proffers that the Circuit Court opinions \u201cpresumed\u201d a meeting of the minds on that issue when the record failed to show that it occurred. As he did before the Court of Special Appeals, the petitioner argues that it should not be accepted as a fact that the payments \u201ctendered\u201d to him met the City\u2019s obligations under that section of the MOU.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Summary judgment practice in this state is governed by Maryland Rule 2-501. It provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201c(f) Entry of Judgment. The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Under Maryland law, the non-movant bears no burden of proof at the summary judgment stage. Rather, after the moving party has produced sufficient evidence in support of summary judgment, the non-movant \u201cmust demonstrate that there is a genuine dispute of material fact by presenting facts that would be admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Gross, supra, </em>332 Md. at 255, 630 A.2d at 1160; see also <em>Rite Aid Corp. v.

Hall, </em>416 Md. 533, 546-47, 7 A.3d 536, 544 (2010); <em>Lynx, supra, </em>273 Md. at 7-8, 327 A.2d at 509. Finally, in determining whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact, the court must resolve all inferences against the moving party. <em>Appiah, supra, </em>416 Md. at 546, 7 A.3d at 544; <em>O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>382 Md. at 111, 854 A.2d at 1196; Gross, <em>supra, </em>332 Md. at 256, 630 A.2d at 1160; <em>Coffey, supra, </em>291 Md. at 246, 434 A.2d at 567; <em>Berkey, supra, </em>287 Md. at 304-OS, 413 A.2d at 171; <em>Leonhart v. Atkinson, </em>265 Md. 219, 220, 289 A.2d 1, 2 (1972). \u201cA material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome the case.\u201d <em>King, </em>303 Md. at 111, 492 A.2d at 614-615 (citing <em>Lynx, supra, </em>273 Md. at 7-8, 327 A.2d at 509).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The petitioner filed a response in opposition to the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In that motion, he continued to emphasize his belief that <em>Clark II </em>was conclusive of the issue, that it had already disposed of all of the issues relevant to his reinstatement. Then, assuming that <em>Clark II </em>was not conclusive, he also identified issues that he believed to be in dispute, most notably, the ambiguity of the employment agreement, by \u201cboth incorporating] the \u00a7 16-5(e) and seeking] to evade \u00a7 16-5(e) by providing authority to the Mayor to remove the Police Commissioner for something outside the criteria of \u00a7 16-5(e).\u201d Responding to the respondents\u2019 liquidated damages argument, the petitioner claims that <em>Clark II </em>decided the common law defenses related to the employment contract. To the respondents\u2019 arguments that judgment in their favor is warranted because the employment agreement did not require the use of \u00a7 16-5(e), that termination \u201cfor cause\u201d is now inapplicable and that, notwithstanding the invalidity of the \u201cnot for cause\u201d option, the petitioner was nevertheless timely notified in accordance with the employment, he responds simply that they should be rejected. The petitioner\u2019s affidavit disputes certain assertions made in an affidavit filed by the City Solicitor regarding discussions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>about the petitioner\u2019s service prior to November 10, 2004 and includes emails between the petitioner and the former Mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">From the foregoing, it is obvious that the petitioner, did not identify with particularity, either in his response or his brief, each material fact as to which he contended that there is a genuine dispute and that, as to none of the facts that he identified did he \u201cattach the relevant portion of the specific document, discovery response, transcript of testimony (by page and line), or other statement under oath that demonstrates the dispute.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501. It follows that the Court of Special Appeals did not err in granting the respondents\u2019 summary judgment motion and denying the petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Motion to Intervene</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">During the pendency of the proceedings between the petitioner and the respondents, the respondents moved to seal confidential documents concerning the petitioner from the Family Court of New York, which they were going to use to support their opposition to the petitioner\u2019s motion for reinstatement. Natasha Clark, the wife of the petitioner, filed a motion to intervene, noting that the records to be sealed are protected from disclosure and her interest in protecting their confidentiality. After a hearing on the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and Mrs. Clark\u2019s motion to intervene, the Circuit Court granted the respondent\u2019s summary judgment motion, denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and denied, as moot, the motion to intervene. Mrs. Clark noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed. <em>Clark, </em>186 Md.App. at 228, 973 A.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In this Court, Mrs. Clark, argues that the Circuit Court erred in denying her motion to intervene. She alleges that her interest is in sealing evidence that the respondents sought to introduce in opposition to Mr. Clark\u2019s motion for mandamus or injunctive relief. The evidence that she sought to seal included records from New York state court. Mrs. Clark argues that right to intervene in the present litigation stems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>from her right to protect the privacy of information in documents obtained from the family law courts of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The respondents contest Mrs. Clark\u2019s intervention in the law suit. They argue that Mrs. Clark has failed to identify how her interest in protecting the confidentiality of her family court records was not already protected by the existing parties. They maintain further that the City was protecting her interests when it sought to seal the records and, to prevent public disclosure, introduce them under seal and that Ms. Clark failed to \u201cassert that Kevin Clark could not adequately represent her interests with respect to the motion.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">Resolving this issue, the Court of Special Appeals opined: \u201c[T]he procedural posture of this case makes the issue moot. At this point in the proceedings, an order has been entered sealing the records from public disclosure. Pursuant to Md. Rule 16-1005(a), \u201c[a] custodian shall deny inspection of a case record or any part of a case record if inspection would be contrary to,\u201d among other things, \u201c[a]n order entered by the court having custody of the case record.\u201d As the Committee Note to this Rule explains, \u201c[s]o long as a court record is under seal or subject to an order precluding or limiting disclosure, it may not be disclosed except in conformance with the order.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cThus, it appears that, at this point, Ms. Clark\u2019s interest in protecting the confidentiality of the New York records has been satisfied. Moreover, because we are affirming the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in appellees\u2019 favor, absent a further appeal, there will be no trial and the records will not be introduced into evidence in this case. Therefore, the issue of whether Ms. Clark is entitled to intervene is moot. <em>See In re Joseph N., </em>407 Md. at 301, 965 A.2d [at] 72 (\u2018a case is moot when there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties at the time it is before the court so that the court cannot provide an effective remedy\u2019). Accordingly, we dismiss Ms. Clark\u2019s appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbB\"><em>Clark, </em>186 Md.App. at 227-28, 973 A.2d at 840-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-4\">.

Accordingly, the Court is not relying upon these principles in deciding Count VII but rather upon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>finding that \u00a7 2.B. of the MOU is valid and enforceable.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\">. The Court rationalized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\"[Mr. Clark\u2019s] requests for declaratory relief have been rendered moot as a result of the decision in this case issued by the Court of Appeals on March 20, 2008, and his requests for injunctive relief were denied in a Memorandum and Order issued by Judge Carol E. Smith of this Court on June 17, 2008. Thus, Counts I, II, III, IV, V and VI have been resolved. Counts VIII, IX and X are no longer viable as they were predicated upon alleged breaches of contract for terminating plaintiff without just cause (Counts VIII &amp; IX) and without valid notice (Count X). As to the just cause counts, the defendants have not claimed that they had \u2018cause\u2019 to terminate plaintiff, invoking instead his contract provision, \u00a7 12 of the MOU, dated February 2003, which purported to allow the City to terminate Clark without cause upon 45 days notice. It is, of course, this provision which was found by the appellate courts to be violative of the PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) and, therefore, unenforceable. <em>Clark v. O\u2019Malley, </em>169 Md.App. 408, 438-439, 901 A.2d 279 (2006), <em>aff'd by Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 33, 944 A.2d 1122 (2008). The invalid notice claim set forth in Count X was decided against plaintiff in this Court's Declaratory Judgment of April 4, 2005. The Court of Special Appeals found that Clark had not raised below a genuine issue of material fact regarding notice and left this Court\u2019s ruling on that issue undisturbed. <em>See </em>169 Md.App. at 425, 901 A.2d 279. Clark failed to challenge that ruling in his appeals. Therefore, it is precluded from relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">.

Although the petitioner resists the respondents\u2019 arguments, arguing that \u201c[t]he central thrust of the Petitioner\u2019s federal action was an illegal search, seizure, and detention of the Plaintiffs without prior notice and in violation of their federal civil rights,\u201d in view of our disposition of the issues raised in this case, we will not consider whether the petitioner's claims are barred by principles of res judicata.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">.
