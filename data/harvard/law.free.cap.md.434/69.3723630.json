The Attorney Grievance Commission, the petitioner, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 773(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and acting through Bar Counsel, filed, in this Court, a petition for disciplinary or remedial action, based on the misconduct for which the respondent was suspended in the District of Columbia, against the respondent. Citing the opinion of the District of Columbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Court of Appeals, noting particularly its recitation of the Rules the respondent admitted violating, and alleging that the professional misconduct that those violations constituted and for which the respondent was disciplined was also professional misconduct in Maryland, it requested this Court, inter alia, to issue a Show Cause Order and to take appropriate disciplinary action. This Court issued the requested Show Cause Order pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-773(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, after both parties filed their responses to the Show Cause Order, heard oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The underlying basis of these proceedings is the respondent\u2019s admission that he violated Rules 8.4(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 1.7(b)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct (DCRPC). The misconduct underlying those Rules violations consisted of \u201c... inaccurately represent[ing] his status at the law firm where he was employed, ma[king] a false representation on behalf of a friend, improperly charging] personal expenses to others, working] outside the law firm against the law firm\u2019s written policies, and asserting] a position on behalf of clients that was adverse to a position taken by a client of the firm without first obtaining informed consent of all parties.\u201d The respondent\u2019s voluntary admissions were made upon advice of counsel and in connection with a petition for negotiated discipline and were reflected in that portion of the petition setting forth the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts and charges and supported by the respondent\u2019s affidavit. The petition for negotiated discipline stated the \u201cagreed upon sanction,\u201d a 60 day suspension with no fitness requirement, and justification for that sanction in the form of a review of the relevant precedents with respect to the range of sanctions the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has imposed for similar professional misconduct. Also pertinent to the appropriateness of the sanction, the petition set forth the parties\u2019 agreement as to aggravating as well as factors mitigating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cAn aggravating factor is the prejudice to Respondent\u2019s law firm, which absorbed some of Respondent\u2019s personal expenses under false pretenses, and did not seek to recover the full amount in reimbursement from Respondent. The dishonest nature of Respondent\u2019s conduct is also an aggravating factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cIn mitigation, Respondent has acknowledged that he engaged in the misconduct described above, has taken full responsibility for his actions, reimbursed the law firm for the amount it sought, has undergone professional counseling to prevent such ethical lapses from recurring, and has no history of discipline.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The petition for negotiated discipline was referred to a hearing committee of the Board of Professional Conduct, which, after considering the petition, including the statement of relevant precedent in support of the agreed upon sanction submitted by Bar Counsel, the supporting affidavit filed by the respondent, and \u201cthe representations made during the limited hearing by Respondent and Bar Counsel,\u201d made findings and issued its report recommending approval of the petition for negotiated discipline. In deciding to recommend approval of the negotiated discipline, the hearing committee considered, as it was required to do, whether the admissions of the respondent were knowing and voluntary, whether the facts, as related in the petition or shown during a limited hearing support the admissions and the agreed upon sanction and whether the agreed upon sanction is appropriate, justified by the facts and circumstances. As to the latter factor, characterized by the hearing committee as the most complicated of the three, it wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">\u201cUpon consideration of the entire record in this matter, including the circumstances in aggravation and mitigation and the relevant precedent, we conclude that the agreed upon negotiated discipline is justified. As described in the relevant precedent section of the Petition, the range of sanctions for Respondent\u2019s multiple violations is a nonsuspensory sanction to disbarment.... In this instance, Respondent has stated convincing factors in mitigation of his offense and has no history of discipline. He is charged with only two offenses during a relatively short period of time. The Hearing Committee is satisfied the Respondent is sincere in his regret and has taken steps to remedy his violations and prevent recurrences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals accepted the recommendation. In doing so, it commented: \u201cThe respondent has accepted responsibility for his actions, repaid all monies owed and undertaken action to prevent future lapses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">As indicated, this Court issued a Show Cause Order, to which both the petitioner and the respondent filed a response. Not unexpectedly, the respondent answers that he \u201chas no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>grounds, as set forth in Maryland Rule 16-773(e), why corresponding discipline should not be imposed by this Court.\u201d Proffering that the imposition of reciprocal discipline in this case \u201cwould be consistent with this Court\u2019s cases that hold, and emphasize, that \u201c[t]he primary purpose of attorney discipline is the protection of the public, not the punishment of the attorney,\u201d he therefore urges the Court to impose corresponding discipline. Moreover, citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 683, 890 A.2d 751, 763 (2006) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 544, 886 A.2d 606, 613 (2005), the respondent submits, \u201cMaryland deviates from sanctions imposed by sister jurisdictions when the Maryland cases <em>clearly demonstrate </em>that the misconduct warrants a <em>substantially different disposition.\u201d </em>He argues that this is not a case in which a substantially different sanction is warranted, as clearly demonstrated by our cases; therefore, we should adhere to well-settled and well reasoned principles of comity and follow the lead of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">As predictably, the petitioner, in its answer, urges, and makes the case for, a substantially different sanction than the one imposed by the District of Columbia. Citing the rule in this State, that, when considering reciprocal discipline cases, the Court \u201cis inclined, but not required, to impose the same sanction as that imposed by the state in which the misconduct occurred, the petitioner notes that this Court is required to assess for itself the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction and that recommended by the Commission\u201d, <em>see Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 546, 886 A.2d at 615; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Scroggs, </em>387 Md. 238, 254, 874 A.2d 985, 995 (2005), <em>see also Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 672, 890 A.2d at 756 (applying the same test when the sanction imposed by this Court is less than that imposed by the sister jurisdiction), and that, while the Court \u201cusually [does] not deviate from the original jurisdiction\u2019s sanction, [it] will do so when the conduct involved is of such nature that it would not be tolerated from any member of the Bar in this State if the conduct occurred here,\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 552, 886 A.2d at 618. Consistent with this observa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tion, the petitioner argues that the misconduct of the respondent in this case warrants more than a 60 day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">To make its case, in this regard, the petitioner emphasizes the stipulations of fact relevant to the Rule 8.4(c) violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aha\">\u201c1. For some period of time while he was an associate attorney at the law firm of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (hereafter \u2018the Firm\u2019), Respondent\u2019s biography with the African American Real Estate Professionals Association (AAREP) identified him as \u2018senior counsel\u2019 at the Firm. Respondent did not immediately correct that inaccurate representation of his status after the Firm informed him in January 2008 that he needed to do so....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201c2. In August 2006, \u2018Respondent used Firm equipment to prepare and send a false employment verification\u2019 on behalf of a personal friend to a car dealer. In that verification, Respondent, knowing that the individual (identified as \u2018TB\u2019) had only worked for the Firm as a receptionist for approximately two weeks in June 2006, falsely asserted \u2018that she was still employed at the Firm and had been since August 2005.\u2019...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201c3. In 2007, \u2018Respondent used the Form\u2019s word processing staff to prepare a resume for TB falsely indicating that TB had been employed with the Firm from August 2005 until July 2007.\u2019 On the resume prepared for TB, Respondent falsely listed himself as \u2018Senior counsel\u2019 to the Firm....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZ\">\u201c4. \u2018While working a the Firm, Respondent charged a number of personal expenses to the law firm, to <em>pro bono </em>accounts, and to a client for whom Respondent did no legal work.\u2019 This conduct included reassigning \u2018as much as $ 5,000 worth of cell phone and text message charges to clients, professional activities, and business development, even though some of the charges were personal in nature, ... . \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">\u201c5. Contrary to the Firm\u2019s written \u2018Outside Work\u201d policy, Respondent launched a personal real estate venture known as TCR in 2007 without obtaining the Firm\u2019s permission to pursue such an outside business interest. \u2018At times, Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>spondent used the Firm\u2019s resources, including computers and the word processing department, to draft TCR client agreements and TCR payment receipts.\u2019...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">\u201c6. Through TCR, Respondent provided services to a married couple (identified as the \u2018LPs\u2019) with respect to a real estate purchase offer made by Greenbaum &amp; Rose Associates, a real estate company that was a client of the Firm. Although the Firm did not represent Greenbaum &amp; Rose in its negotiations with the LPs, Respondent did not conduct a conflict of interest check within the Firm, and he did not disclose to either the LPs or Greenbaum &amp; Rose the potential conflict requiring informed consent of all affected parties----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">From these stipulated facts, the petitioner argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201cIn the present matter, Respondent engaged in several distinct acts of dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, none of which can be interpreted as anything other than intentionally dishonest. Respondent knew he was an associate at the Shaw Pittman firm, yet he held himself out as \u2018senior counsel\u2019 on a professional biography and on the resume he prepared for the individual identified as TB. He knew that TB only worked at the firm for a two week period, yet he participated in generating two separate documents (the August 2006 employment verification and a resume prepared in 2007) that significantly misrepresented the duration of her employment. Respondent knew that various personal expenses he chose to allocate as professional or business expenses should not be charged to the firm or to client accounts, yet he did so anyway for his personal benefit. Finally, although it is not clearly stated in the stipulated facts that Respondent knowingly and intentionally violated the firm\u2019s \u2018Outside Work\u2019 policy by establishing TCR as a personal venture, his misuse of firm resources to prepare documents in furtherance of a business created for his personal gain reflects added dishonesty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Thus, the petitioner believes that the above described actions demonstrate that the respondent\u2019s conduct, being at the least intentionally dishonest and involving misrepresentation, merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>a more substantial sanction, and preferably, the ultimate sanction of disbarment. For this proposition, the petitioner relies on <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 521, 979 A.2d 146, 154 (2009) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001), we stated the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201cUpon reflection as a Court, in disciplinary matters, we will not in the future attempt to distinguish between degrees of intentional dishonesty based upon convictions, testimonials or other factors. Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cDisbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct. With our opinion today, we impress upon the members of the bar that the Court does not consider Hess or the pre-Kenney cases to be authority for an argument for leniency in attorney disciplinary matters involving intentionally dishonest conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Based on that rule, in <em>Garcia, </em>410 Md. at 521, 979 A.2d at 154, we opined \u201c[w]hen an attorney\u2019s conduct involves intentional dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, we do not discuss \u2018degrees\u2019 of dishonesty, but generally order disbarment, absent compelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d Alternatively, relying on <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 606, 911 A.2d 440, 452 (2006), the petitioner asks this Court to suspend the respondent indefinitely from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">That the respondent has also admitted engaging in conduct that constituted a conflict of interest is further reason, the petitioner submits, for not reciprocating the District of Columbia sanction of a sixty day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The misconduct and the Rules violations having been admitted by the respondent and, indeed, having been finally adjudicated in a disciplinary hearing, thereby being rendered conclusive proof that the respondent engaged in misconduct, Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 773(g);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Scroggs, </em>387 Md. 238, 249, 874 A.2d 985, 992 (2005); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. 44, 56-57, 838 A.2d 1238, 1245 (2003); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cafferty, </em>376 Md. 700, 703-704, 831 A.2d 1042, 1045-46 (2003); <em>Attorney Griev.

Comm\u2019n v. Sparrow, </em>314 Md. 421, 425, 550 A.2d 1150, 1152 (1988); <em>see also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Moore, </em>301 Md. 169, 482 A.2d 497 (1984), the only issue left to be decided is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">This is, as indicated, a reciprocal discipline case. In such cases, although, by its terms, Rule 16-773(g) limits challenges to the original adjudication in reciprocal discipline cases to \u201cnotice and opportunity to be heard\u201d or \u201cinfirmity of proof,\u201d <em>see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Roberson, </em>373 Md. 328, 354, 818 A.2d 1059, 1075 (2003), either of the parties to the proceedings may show \u201cwhy corresponding discipline or inactive status should not be imposed.\u201d Maryland Rule 16-773(c). That is, we pointed out in <em>Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. at 56-57, 838 A.2d at 1245, the purpose of the requirement on the Court to issue a show cause order. Indeed, the Rule prescribes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>exceptional circumstances that will allow for avoidance of reciprocal discipline. Section 16-773(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cExceptional Circumstances. Reciprocal discipline shall not be ordered if Bar Counsel or the attorney demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201c(1) the procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process; \u201c(2) there was such infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to a clear conviction that the Court, consistent \"with its duty, cannot accept as final the determination of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201c(3) the imposition of corresponding discipline would result in grave injustice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201c(4) the conduct established does not constitute misconduct in this State or it warrants substantially different discipline in this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201c(5) the reason for inactive status no longer exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">This Court\u2019s treatment of the imposition of sanction aspect of reciprocal discipline cases is well-settled. We reiterated it in <em>Weiss:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\"><em>\u201cIt </em>is a well established principle in this State that this Court is \u2018inclined, but not required, to impose the same sanction as that imposed by the state in which the misconduct occurred. We are required to assess for ourselves the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction and that recommended by the Commission.\u2019 <em>Scroggs, </em>387 Md. at 254, 874 A.2d at 995 (citations omitted); <em>see also Attorney Griev.

Indeed, we thought it \u201cconceivable that adopting a strict reciprocal discipline policy, in some instances, would result in grossly unfair results and might encourage some Maryland attorneys to turn themselves in to the disciplinary authorities of other jurisdictions where they are a member of the bar, to avoid the results of direct action by Maryland\u2019s processes.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 549, 886 A.2d at 616. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cThere is no doubt that this Court will not tolerate theft by a member of the bar from clients, partners, or third-parties. It would be grave injustice in allowing a member of this Bar to commit such an offense and be given a lesser sanction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>because another jurisdiction did so, while other members of the Maryland Bar would be sanctioned more severely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A18\"><em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 555, 886 A.2d at 620. In support of this holding, we relied on the well-settled rule, stated by <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 519, 307 A.2d 677, 682 (1973),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">\u201c[I]t is essential that all members of the legal fraternity be strongly and constantly impressed with the truism that in handling moneys and properties belonging to their clients or others that they accept them in trust and are strictly accountable for their conduct in administering that trust, so they dare not appropriate those funds and properties for their personal use. The misappropriation by an attorney of funds of others entrusted to his care, be the amount small or large, is of great concern and represents the gravest form of professional misconduct[,]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akq\">and endorsed and reiterated by subsequent cases. <em>See e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 413-14, 773 A.2d 463, 485 (2001); <em>In Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>328 Md. 412, 417, 614 A.2d 955, 958 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev.

Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 512, 979 A.2d 146, 149 (2009), <em>reinstatement granted sub nom. In re Garcia, </em>430 Md. 640, 62 A.3d 728 (2013), and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488, urges the respondent\u2019s disbarment. Although, in <em>Vanderlinde, </em>the attorney was charged with misappropriation of funds, a violation for which, almost without exception, both pre-, but <em>see, e.g. Bakas, </em>and post-, <em>see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Seltzer, </em>424 Md. 94, 34 A.3d 498 (2011), <em>Vanderlinde, </em>disbarment inexorably follows, we stated the rule rather more broadly: \u201cDisbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>410 Md. at 533, 979 A.2d at 162 quoting <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ward, </em>396 Md. 203, 218, 913 A.2d 41, 50 (2006). We reiterated this broad rule in <em>Garcia, </em>emphasizing, citing <em>Vanderlinde, </em>that \u201c[w]hen an attorney\u2019s conduct involves intentional dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, we do not discuss \u2018degrees\u2019 of dishonesty, but generally order disbarment, absent compelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d 410 Md. at 521, 979 A.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In <em>Garcia, </em>the attorney, knowing that his client did not have the employment background and experience needed to qualify for a position as an alien worker, signed a letter, drafted by his co-conspirator, that falsely stated that his client had been employed in the field in the Philippines from October 1995 until June 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 516-17, 979 A.2d at 151-52. He signed the letter in the name of the client\u2019s purported employee and when he did so, he was aware that it would be filed with the then Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), now Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), and would be used to decide the client\u2019s alien worker petition. <em>Id. </em>at 512, 979 A.2d at 149. Agreeing with the hearing judge\u2019s finding and conclusion that \u201c[Mr. Garcia\u2019s] action of signing the letter was clearly intended to commit a fraud, deceive, or misrepresent,\u201d the Court concluded that the <em>Vanderlinde </em>dictates were applicable, with the result that, absent compelling extenuating circumstances, disbarment would be ordered. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 979 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>A.2d at 155. It determined that there were no compelling extenuating circumstances in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The petitioner recognizes, as did the <em>Garcia </em>Court, that, post <em>Vanderlinde, </em>where the misconduct involves \u201cintentional dishonest conduct,\u201d but not misappropriation, the <em>Vanderlinde </em>\u201cbright-line admonition\u201d has not always been applied. It identifies three cases in which, although the attorney was found to have engaged in intentional dishonest conduct and, thus, to have violated MLRPC 8.4(c), a sanction other, and lesser, than disbarment was imposed. In two of the cases, <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Potter, </em>380 Md. 128, 844 A.2d 367 (2004) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Floyd, </em>400 Md. 236, 929 A.2d 61 (2007), the sanction ordered was a 90-day suspension. In the third, <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 605-606, 911 A.2d 440, 451-52 (2006), it was an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In <em>Potter, </em>the attorney left the firm by which he had been employed and established his own sole practice, taking with him two of the firm\u2019s clients, whose files he deleted, without the firm\u2019s permission, from the firm\u2019s office computers. 380 Md. at 136-37, 844 A.2d at 371-72. This conduct was not found by the hearing court to be a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c), but that conclusion was overruled by this Court upon bar counsel\u2019s exception. 380 Md. at 156, 844 A.2d at 383. In <em>Floyd, </em>the Rule 8.4(c) violation consisted of Floyd\u2019s failure to disclose, among other things, that the letter to the FTC, from her current employer and primary reference, which indicated a willingness to pay $55,000 per year to retain her services and which resulted in the FTC raising her starting salary from $42,724 per year to $51,269 per year, was from her husband. 400 Md. at 251-252, 929 A.2d at 70. In neither case did we apply <em>Vanderlinde </em>as dispositive. <em>Potter, 380 </em>Md. at 161-64, 844 A.2d at 386-88; <em>Floyd, </em>400 Md. at 246, 929 A.2d at 66. <em>See Garcia, </em>410 Md. at 526-27, 979 A.2d at 157-58.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The misconduct in which the attorney in <em>Sweitzer </em>engaged and which resulted in his being found to have violated MLRPC 8.4(c) was, without authorization, signing his estranged wife\u2019s signature on a Motor Vehicle Administration Gift Certification form and using that form in an attempt to transfer title to the vehicle and thereby avoid the payment of sales taxes and the inspection of the vehicle. <em>Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 593, 911 A.2d at 444. Agreeing with the hearing court\u2019s findings and conclusions relative to MLRPC 8.4(c), we characterized Sweitzer\u2019s conduct as \u201cegregious,\u201d being \u201cintentionally deceitful and motivated by pecuniary interest.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 603, 911 A.2d at 450. Nevertheless and despite the lack of findings with respect to mitigation, we imposed, as the appropriate sanction, an indefinite suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 911 A.2d at 451-52. As justification, we noted the respondent\u2019s lack of a disciplinary record and that, although there were two violations, they \u201care not the result of a pattern of misconduct; the two violations occurred two years apart.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 911 A.2d at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The case most analogous to <em>Garcia </em>is, as we recognized in <em>Garcia, Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Wingerter, </em>400 Md. 214, 929 A.2d 47 (2007), <em>reinstatement granted sub nom. In re Reinstatement of Wingerter, </em>430 Md. 7, 59 A.3d 504 (2013). There, Wingerter, the in-house counsel of a recruitment and immigration services company, pled guilty to misprison of a felony. <em>Wingerter, </em>400 Md. at 216, 929 A.2d at 49. Based on the statement of facts in support of the plea, which detailed the circumstances in which the crime occurred, the hearing court found, and this Court confirmed, that the respondent admitted being aware of facts indicating that the named co-defendants were engaging in immigration fraud, making false statements and encouraging aliens to enter this country illegally, not reporting those crimes to the proper authorities, and taking steps to conceal the conspiracy. <em>Wingerter, 400 </em>Md. at 231-232, 929 A.2d at 51. From these admissions and with the active concealment as a predicate, Wingerter was found to have engaged in conduct in violation of Rule 8.4(b) \u2014 of helping and counseling violators as to how to conceal their violations, a criminal act that reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness in other regards \u2014 and (c), in so doing, also engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 230-31, 929 A.2d at 57-58. We applied the <em>Vanderlinde </em>test and, noting that \u201c[t]he respondent\u2019s past \u2018stellar\u2019 practice, his pro bono commitment, his lack of pecuniary over-reaching or motivation and his mentoring, while all are commendable and are not disregarded, do not meet the standard we have set for compelling extenuating circumstances that would justify a lesser sanction than disbarment,\u201d adopted the petitioner\u2019s disbarment recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>mendation. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 929 A.2d at 60. Indeed, <em>Sweitzer </em>is more akin, factually and sanction-wise, to <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Wingerter </em>than is the case <em>sub judice. </em>As in those cases, Sweitzer engaged in dishonest behavior by attempting to defraud a governmental entity, in that case, the State of Maryland, rather than, as in <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Wingerter, </em>the immigration agency, and albeit for his own, rather than a client\u2019s benefit. The conduct in which the respondent herein engaged was dishonest, to be sure, but it does not rise to the level of that engaged in by the attorneys in <em>Garcia, Wingerter </em>and <em>Sweitzer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The misconduct in which the respondent engaged and which constitutes the MLRPC 8.4(c) violation in this case is more closely aligned with the misconduct sanctioned in <em>Potter </em>and <em>Floyd </em>than that at issue in <em>Garcia, Wingerter </em>and <em>Sweitzer. </em>And, like <em>Potter </em>and <em>Floyd, </em>the respondent does not have any disciplinary history; he has not previously been the subject of a disciplinary complaint. Nor do we believe that the charges in this case, admittedly multiple, reflect a pattern. In this respect, then, the respondent\u2019s case is, again, like Potter\u2019s and Floyd\u2019s, as well as Sweitzer\u2019s. Moreover, the respondent has been found by the hearing committee of the Board of Professional Conduct, confirmed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, to be \u201csincere in his regret and [to have] taken steps to remedy his violations and prevent recurrences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Under these circumstances, we do not believe disbarment or an indefinite suspension to be the appropriate sanction. On the other hand, the conduct in this case is more extensive and, thus, more serious than that in both <em>Potter </em>and <em>Floyd. </em>Accordingly, considering the respondent\u2019s conduct and the mitigating factors found to be present, we believe the appropriate sanction to be a suspension from the practice of law for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.
