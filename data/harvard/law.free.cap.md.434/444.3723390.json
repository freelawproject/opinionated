Despite the historical complexity, however, the case both then and now has presented a single broad legal issue: whether an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to state-furnished counsel at the defendant\u2019s initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-213(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Plaintiffs in this case filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that they were denied Public Defender representation during their initial appearance proceedings before a District Court Commissioner. They named as defendants the District Court of Maryland, the Chief Judge of the District Court of Maryland, the Administrative Judge of the District Court in Baltimore City, and several other District Court officials in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs asserted that the initial appearance proceeding, during which a District Court Commissioner determines whether there is probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest if the arrest occurred without a warrant and whether an arrested individual is to be detained, or released on bail, or released on his or her own recognizance, is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding requiring state-furnished counsel under the provisions of the Public Defender Act, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2012 Supp.), \u00a7 16-204(b)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article. They also relied upon the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In addition, they argued that the failure to furnish counsel violated the due process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction to enjoin the defendants from violating the plaintiffs\u2019 right to representation at initial appearances before District Court Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Plaintiffs Quinton Richmond, Jerome Jett, Glenn Callaway, Myron Singleton, Timothy Wright, Keith Wilds, Michael LaGrasse, Ralph Steele, Laura Baker, Erich Lewis, and Nathaniel Shivers were each separately arrested for unrelated criminal activity occurring in Baltimore City. Each plaintiff was arrested for a \u201cserious offense\u201d as defined in the Public Defender Statute, \u00a7 16 \u2014 101 (h)(1) \u2014 (4). Each plaintiff was detained at the Central Booking Jail in Baltimore City and brought before a Commissioner for an initial appearance pursuant to statute and Maryland Rule 4-213.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">While the Rules indicate that a defendant\u2019s first appearance must be before a \u201cjudicial officer,\u201d the Rules also provide that a \u201cjudicial officer\u201d may be either a District Court Commissioner or a Judge. Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 102(f). In each criminal case involving the plaintiffs in this civil case, the judicial officer was a District Court Commissioner. The parties agree that it is general practice that Commissioners, rather than District Court Judges, preside over initial appearances. A Commissioner need not be a lawyer. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 2-607(b) of the Courts and Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Proceedings Article; Rule 4 \u2014 102(f); <em>State v. Smith, </em>305 Md. 489, 501-505, 505 A.2d 511, 517-519, <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1186, 106 S.Ct. 2925, 91 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The District Court Commissioner determines at the initial appearance, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-216, whether a plaintiff is eligible for pretrial release. If a defendant was arrested without a warrant, the Commissioner determines whether there was probable cause for each charge and for the arrest. If there was no probable cause, the defendant is released with no conditions of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">If the Commissioner finds that there was probable cause, Rule 4-216(f) details the numerous factors a Commissioner must take into consideration when imposing \u201con the defendant the least onerous condition or combination of conditions of release\u201d that serves the purposes of \u201censur[ing] the appearance of the defendant,\u201d \u201cprotect[ing] the safety of the alleged victim,\u201d and \u201censur[ing] that the defendant will not pose a danger to another person or to the community.\u201d These factors include, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the defendant\u2019s prior record of appearance at court proceedings, and the defendant\u2019s family ties, employment status, financial resources, reputation, character, and length of residence in the community and in the State. The recommendation of the State\u2019s Attorney and any information presented by the defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel also must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">If a Commissioner does not release an arrested individual following this initial appearance, the defendant must be presented to a District Court Judge \u201cimmediately if the Court is in session, or if the Court is not in session, at the next session of the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As this Court pointed out in its January 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>2012, opinion, the Commissioner\u2019s initial bail decision is not often changed during subsequent review, with the bail set by the Commissioner being maintained by the Judge in nearly half of the bail reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">As numerous briefs to this Court pointed out, the failure of a Commissioner to consider all the facts relevant to a bail determination can have devastating effects on the arrested individuals. Not only do the arrested individuals face health and safety risks posed by prison stays, but the arrested individuals may be functionally illiterate and unable to read materials related to the charges. Additionally, they may be employed in low wage jobs which could be easily lost because of incarceration. Moreover, studies show that the bail amounts are often improperly affected by race.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In Baltimore City, an arrestee\u2019s initial appearance occurs in a \u201ctiny narrow booth\u201d in Central Booking Jail, which does not allow the public to attend the proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A record of the proceeding is not made. The Commissioner is separated from the arrested individual by a plexiglass partition, and all communications take place through a speaker system. There are no prohibitions against attorneys participating in these proceedings, but, in practice, arrested individuals are rarely represented by an attorney during an initial appearance before the Commissioner. The State\u2019s Attorney, however, maintains a 24-hour \u201cwar room\u201d in Central Booking for the purpose of making recommendations to the Commissioner regarding bail. These communications usually occur <em>ex parte </em>and without any public record. Without a public record of the proceedings before the Commissioner, the plaintiffs point out that \u201cit [is] impossible to review what a Commissioner or arrestee said or to understand the basis for the ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>At each of the initial appearances involved in this case, the plaintiff requested an attorney to represent him or her, and also informed the Commissioner that he or she was unable to afford an attorney. Despite the plaintiffs\u2019 requests, the Commissioner declined to appoint attorneys and proceeded by setting bails.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In the present civil case, the District Court defendants filed a motion in the Circuit Court for summary judgment as to all claims, and the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. The Circuit Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment for the District Court defendants. The plaintiffs timely appealed and, while the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. After briefing and oral argument in this Court, we held that, under Rule 2-211(a), the Circuit Court should have dismissed the complaint because of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to join the Public Defender as a party to the action. <em>See Richmond v. District Court of Maryland, </em>412 Md. 672, 990 A.2d 549 (2010). We vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case to the Circuit Court with directions to dismiss the complaint unless the plaintiffs joined the Public Defender as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In the Circuit Court on remand, the Public Defender was joined as a defendant in the action. After some procedural skirmishes in the Circuit Court, which we shall not recount here, the Circuit Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and filed a declaratory judgment. The court, however, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief. The Circuit Court determined that the plain language of the Public Defender Act, \u00a7 16-204(b), required the Public Defender to represent indigents at the initial appearance proceedings before a commissioner. The Circuit Court also decided that the failure to provide representation during initial appearances \u201cviolated Plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights.\u201d The Circuit Court stayed its judgment pending appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Both the Public Defender and the District Court defendants noted timely appeals. The plaintiffs cross-appealed and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. The questions presented by the plaintiffs queried whether indigent defendants have a right to counsel at initial appearance proceedings before District Court Commissioners under any of the following: Maryland\u2019s Public Defender Act, the Sixth Amendment, Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the Federal Constitution\u2019s due process guarantee or the Maryland Declaration of Rights\u2019 due process guarantee. The Public Defender filed a cross-petition for certiorari, questioning whether the Circuit Court erred in issuing its declaratory judgment \u201cwithout in any way addressing remedy and how ... [a] funding shortfall\u201d created by the need to provide counsel at initial appearances before commissioners \u201cmight be practicably addressed.\u201d This Court granted the petitions. <em>DeWolfe v. Richmond, </em>420 Md. 81, 21 A.3d 1063 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In the opinion filed January 4, 2012, this Court held that, under \u00a7 16-204(b) of the Public Defender Act, indigent defendants are entitled to public defender representation at any initial appearance proceeding conducted before a commissioner. Because the case was decided on statutory grounds, the Court did not reach the state and federal constitutional issues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201cThe initial appearance before the Commissioner \u2014 including the bail hearing that is part of that event \u2014 is clearly encompassed within a \u2018criminal proceeding,\u2019 and may result in the defendant\u2019s incarceration. The only remaining question is whether the bail determination is a \u2018stage\u2019 of that proceeding. Doubtless it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We pointed out that the Commissioner must take into account numerous considerations when determining whether a defendant is to be released on his or her own recognizance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>incarcerated pending the subsequent District Court bail review. Given the number of factors considered by the Commissioner, we held that the \u201cpresence of counsel for that determination surely can be of assistance to the defendant in that process.\u201d Moreover, the Court gave credence to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201c\u2018[u]nrepresented suspects are more likely to have more perfunctory hearings, less likely to be released on recognizance, more likely to have higher and unaffordable bail, and more likely to serve longer detentions or to pay the expense of a bail bondsman\u2019s non-refundable 10% fee to regain their freedom.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">This Court additionally rejected the District Court defendants\u2019 argument that any wrong committed by failing to furnish counsel during the initial appearance proceeding was ameliorated by the later bail review hearing by a judge. We held that \u201cthe bail-hearing portion of the initial appearance before the Commissioner is a \u2018stage\u2019 of the criminal proceeding, as that term is employed in \u00a7 16-204(b)(2) of the Public Defender Act.\u201d As a stage of a criminal proceeding, the Public Defender Act then provided that indigent defendants are entitled to appointed counsel during the initial appearance proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The Court further held on January 4, 2012, that, because the Public Defender Act then provided for representation for indigent persons at \u201cany other proceeding in which confinement under a judicial commitment of an individual in a public or private institution may result,\u201d representation should be provided not only to those charged with a \u201cserious offense,\u201d but to all indigent persons requesting representation. The Court did not decide whether an indigent criminal defendant had a federal or state constitutional right to state-furnished counsel at an initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>While motions for reconsideration of our January 4, 2012, opinion and order were pending, the General Assembly passed and the Governor signed on May 22, 2012, Chs. 504 and 505 of the Acts of 2012.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These Acts were \u201cemergency measures,\u201d with most of the provisions, including the provisions involved in this case, taking effect upon enactment on May 22, 2012.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Among other things, the statutes amended \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b)(2)(ii) of the Public Defender Act to provide: \u201cRepresentation is not required to be provided to an indigent individual at an initial appearance before a District Court commissioner.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVY\">As such, the first opportunity an arrested indigent individual would have to consult with counsel furnished under the Public Defender Act would occur during the District Court Judge\u2019s bail review proceeding. This bail review proceeding should occur directly after the detainee\u2019s initial appearance before the Commissioner if the District Court is in session. If the District Court is not in session, however, during intervals such as weekends and holidays, the bail review hearing will occur at the District Court\u2019s next session. This delay until the District Court\u2019s next session could result in an individual being incarcerated through the weekend or holidays before having an opportunity to consult with appointed counsel or challenge the bail set by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Due to the above-quoted legislative change in the Public Defender Act, some of the parties filed motions asking this Court to decide whether there was a federal or state constitutional right to state-furnished counsel for indigent defendants at their initial appearances before District Court Commissioners. Other parties argued that, before deciding any constitutional issues, this Court should remand the case to the Circuit Court for development of a \u201cfuller factual record based on actual experience under the revised statute.\u201d The State of Maryland filed a motion to intervene, and this Court on July 9, 2012, granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">On August 22, 2012, the Court issued an amended order determining that \u201ca remand for further development of the factual record [was] unnecessary\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201cthe Court and the parties would benefit from supplemental briefing and additional oral argument on the issue of whether Plaintiffs are entitled, under the recently amended Public Defender Act, to relief on the basis of the right to counsel provided in either or both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and/or either or both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Supplemental briefs by the parties and <em>amicae </em>were filed, and the Court has heard additional oral arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Because of the amendment to the Public Defender statute, this Court must decide whether an indigent criminal defendant has a constitutional right to state-furnished counsel at an initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner. We shall hold that, under the Due Process component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, an indigent defendant has a right to state-furnished counsel at an initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner. We shall not decide whether an indigent defendant, at an initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner, has a right to state-furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>counsel under the Sixth or Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution or under Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u201cArticle 24. Due Process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u201cThat no man ought to be taken or imprisoned or dis-seized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The procedural due process component of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\u2019 Article 24 has long been construed by this Court to require, under some circumstances, state-furnished counsel for indigent defendants. <em>See, e.g., Coates v. State, </em>180 Md. 502, 512, 25 A.2d 676, 680, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 U.S. 625, 63 S.Ct. 33, 87 L.Ed. 506 (1942) (\u201cIn these cases now before us, our conclusion is that counsel should have been appointed as an essential of due process of law\u201d); <em>Jewett v. State, </em>190 Md. 289, 296-297, 58 A.2d 236, 238 (1948) (\u201cWithout attempting to trace the tenuous line between what does and what does not constitute due process in this respect, we may say that we think the wise practice, in any serious case, is to appoint counsel unless the accused intelligently waives such appointment\u201d). This interpretation of Article 24 pre-dates, by several years, the Court\u2019s construction of Article 21 to require state-furnished counsel for criminal defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The above-cited cases, and similar early cases, did not go so far as holding that indigent defendants had a due process right to state-furnished counsel in any proceeding involving incarceration. Nevertheless, this Court did so hold in <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 357-364, 464 A.2d 228, 234-237 (1983).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Rutherford, </em>two defendants in civil contempt cases were found to be in contempt and were sentenced to jail. Neither defendant was represented by counsel, and neither defendant could afford counsel. This Court initially observed in <em>Rutherford </em>that the Sixth Amendment and \u201cArticle 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee^] a right to counsel, including appointed counsel for an indigent, in a criminal case involving incarceration,\u201d and that this \u201cright extends to every \u2018critical stage\u2019 of the criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Rutherford, </em>296 Md. at 357-358, 464 A.2d at 234. <em>Rutherford </em>went on to observe that the civil contempt proceedings were not stages of criminal proceedings and that, therefore, the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 were not directly applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The Court in <em>Rutherford </em>then turned to the requirements of due process, stating (296 Md. at 358, 464 A.2d at 234, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cNevertheless, the constitutional right to counsel is broader than the specific guarantee of the Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ment and Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights. Under certain circumstances, the requirements of due process include a right to counsel, with appointed counsel for indigents, in civil cases <em>or other proceedings </em>not constituting critical stages of criminal trials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The opinion then pointed out that the right to state-furnished counsel for indigents extends \u201cto <em>civil </em>juvenile delinquency-proceedings because of \u2018the awesome prospect of incarceration in a state institution/ \u201d <em>Rutherford, ibid., </em>quoting <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 36-37, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1449, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, 551 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The <em>Rutherford </em>opinion then reviewed cases throughout the country, pointing out that the majority of jurisdictions held that there was a right to state-furnished counsel for indigents in proceedings like the ones before the Court. This Court also pointed out that there was a minority rule that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d were required before the right to counsel attached in such proceedings. <em>Rutherford </em>then held as follows (296 Md. at 360-361, 464 A.2d at 235, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">\u201cWe believe that the majority view is sound. A defendant\u2019s <em>actual incarceration in a jail, as a result of a proceeding at which he was unrepresented by counsel </em>and did not knowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel, is fundamentally unfair. As repeatedly pointed out in criminal and civil cases, <em>it is the fact of incarceration, and not the label placed upon the proceeding, which requires the appointment of counsel </em>for indigents. With regard to the minority \u2018special circumstances\u2019 rule ..., very often the \u2018special circumstances\u2019 requiring the assistance of counsel are not apparent until the defendant is represented by counsel.

As a matter of Maryland constitutional law, where there is a violation of certain procedural constitutional rights of the defendant at an initial proceeding, including the right to counsel, the violation is not cured by granting the right at a subsequent appeal or review proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Thus, in <em>Zetty v. Piatt, supra, </em>365 Md. at 155-160, 776 A.2d at 639-642, the indigent defendant was denied his right to state-furnished counsel at a civil contempt proceeding, but, in a later hearing after the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, the defendant was represented by counsel. This Court, in an opinion by Judge Cathell, first held that, under <em>Rutherford, </em>the defendant was denied due process of law at the initial hearing when the defendant was unrepresented by counsel. Turning to the reconsideration proceeding, Judge Cathell for the Court held as follows (365 Md. at 161, 776 A.2d at 642-643):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201cIf a person\u2019s right to counsel is violated at trial, that violation is not cured by providing the person with counsel for their appeal. * * * Likewise, generally, if a person has his or her right to counsel violated at a contempt hearing, it is not cured by having counsel at a subsequent reconsideration hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>See Reed v.

We are informed by the Plaintiffs that \u2018[unrepresented suspects are more likely to have more perfunctory hearings, less likely to be released on recognizance, more likely to have higher and unaffordable bail, and more likely to serve longer detentions or to pay the expense of a bail bondsman\u2019s non-refundable 10% fee to regain their freedom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201cThat a defendant <em>might </em>have bail reduced or eliminated by a District Court judge at a subsequent bail review hearing does not dispel or even mitigate the fact that, whenever a Commissioner determines to set bail, the defendant stands a good chance of losing his or her liberty, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>if only for a brief time. Furthermore, the likelihood that the Commissioner will give full and fair consideration to all facts relevant to the bail determination can only be enhanced by the presence of counsel. <em>See </em>Abell Pretrial Release Project Report at iii (finding that \u2018most judicial officers decide whether to order release on recognizance or a financial bail without having essential information about the person\u2019s employment status, family and community ties, and ability to afford bail\u2019). We cannot overlook, moreover, the evidence in the record that the Commissioner\u2019s initial bail decision often is not disturbed by the District Court judge on bail review'. <em>See id. </em>at 32 (finding that, at bail review, District Court judges in the sample group maintained prior bail conditions in roughly half the cases, released only 25% of detainees on personal recognizance, and lowered bail for only one in four individuals (27%)).

Nevertheless, we have repeatedly emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">\"simply because a Maryland constitutional provision is <em>in pari materia </em>with a federal one or has a federal counterpart, does <em>not </em>mean that the provision will <em>always </em>be interpreted or applied in the same manner as its federal counterpart.\u201d <em>Dua v.

This Court has held on several occasions that the protections provided under Article 24 are broader than those found in the United States Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Tyler v.

Nevertheless, this Court\u2019s interpretation of the Clause has been an evolving process. Throughout most of our history since 1776, the clause was not construed as requiring the appointment of counsel for indigents but was \"construed ... as merely doing away with the common law rule that denied representation by counsel,\u201d <em>Edwardsen v.

By the 1980s, however, we had taken the position that \"[t]here is no distinction between the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and Art. 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>State v.

More recently, we have emphasized that the Right-to-Counsel Clause of Article 21 is an \"independent Maryland Constitutional provision,\u201d and that Supreme Court decisions under the Sixth Amendment would not be binding with regard to the Right-to-Counsel Clause of Article 21. <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 85-87 and n. 11, 741 A.2d 1162, 1188-1189 and n. 11 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">For a detailed history of Article 21, <em>see </em>Judge Wilner's opinions in <em>Perry v.

That, however, is not the issue. We are not at this time holding any provision of the amended Public Defender Act unconstitutional. Our holding is that an indigent defendant is entitled to state-furnished counsel at an initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner. If the other branches of government decide that compliance with this holding is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>be accomplished by means other than Public Defender representation at initial appearances before Commissioners, they are, of course, free to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b493-6\">BARBERA, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">dissenting, which HARRELL and ADKINS, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Respectfully, I dissent.

Op. at 464, 76 A.3d at 1031. Certainly, such a right to counsel existed under a previous iteration of Maryland\u2019s Public Defender Act. <em>See DeWolfe v.

I do not quarrel with the majority\u2019s recitation of those cases in which we have stated that Article 24 applies in a broader manner than the Fourteenth Amendment. I do part company with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Article 24 dictates a right to counsel at the initial bail hearing before a District Court Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 464 A.2d 228 (1983), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">A defendant\u2019s actual incarceration in a jail, as a result of a proceeding at which he was unrepresented by counsel and did not knowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel, is fundamentally unfair. As repeatedly pointed out in criminal and civil cases, it is the fact of incarceration, and not the label placed upon the proceeding, which requires the appointment of counsel for indigents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 360-61, 464 A.2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The majority seizes upon this language and seems to extrapolate from it to hold that the type of \u201cproceeding\u201d addressed in <em>Rutherford </em>\u2014 a court hearing at which an indigent person, unrepresented by counsel, is incarcerated by court order upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>a judicial finding of civil contempt \u2014 is the equivalent, for purposes of Article 24, of the initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner. The majority bolsters this notion by invocation of other cases in which this Court has stated and/or held, by resort to the Maryland Declaration of Rights, that a person is entitled to counsel if there is a threat of incarceration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Zetty v. Piatt, </em>865 Md. 141, 156, 776 A.2d 631 (2001); <em>Vincenti v. State, </em>309 Md. 601, 604, 525 A.2d 1072 (1987); <em>State v. Bryan, </em>284 Md. 152, 158 n. 5, 395 A.2d 475 (1978). There is a fundamental distinction between those cases and the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In all of the cases cited by the majority, the proceedings at issue were, to the last, in-court proceedings, conducted by a judge and having the potential to result in a judge-ordered term of incarceration that was final, save for the possibility of a subsequent court proceeding at which the defendant would have the right to counsel. The initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner has none of those features.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Under the current iteration of the Public Defender Act, related statutory provisions, and applicable Rules of Procedure, the initial appearance before the Commissioner involves the following. The Commissioner evaluates whether there was probable cause for an arrest, determines whether a defendant should be released and what conditions should accompany any release, and informs a defendant of his or her right to counsel. Maryland Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 2-607(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d). The Commissioner must make a written record of the probable cause determination and commit to writing all communications between the Commissioner and the parties, including the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. Rule 4-216(a) and (b). Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>more, any statements made by a defendant during the Commissioner hearing cannot be used against him or her in later proceedings. CJ \u00a7 10-922. There is a presumption at the Commissioner hearing that a defendant will be released on personal recognizance or bail unless the Commissioner determines that there are no conditions of release that can be imposed that will ensure the appearance of the defendant at a later proceeding or the safety of the victim or community at large. Rule 4-216(c). Defendants who are denied pretrial release entirely or remain in custody after the hearing because they cannot afford the bail amount set \u201cshall be presented immediately to the District Court if the court is then in session, or if not, at the next session of the court.\u201d Rule 4-216.1(a)(1). At those court hearings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Public Defender\u2019s Office is required to provide representation for an indigent defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 4-216.1(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The initial bail hearing before a Commissioner does not result in a final determination of incarceration because no decision made by a Commissioner will lead to a defendant\u2019s languishing in custody without judicial review. Indeed, the law affirmatively requires that the Commissioner\u2019s initial bail decision be reviewed quickly by a judge, at a formal, in-court proceeding, at which every defendant \u2014 indigent or not \u2014 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>entitled to representation by counsel. The very fact of speedy review of the Commissioner\u2019s preliminary determination, by a judge at a formal court proceeding where defense counsel can argue against the Commissioner\u2019s initial bail decision, negates any realistic concern about unfair procedural process. <em>See Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 145, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979) (concluding that \u201ca detention of three days over a New Year\u2019s weekend does not and could not amount\u201d to a deprivation of due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Although decided under the Fourth Amendment, I find instructive the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, </em>500 U.S. 44, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 114 L.Ed.2d 49 (1991). In <em>McLaughlin, </em>the Court examined whether a county\u2019s decision to combine probable cause determinations with arraignment violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that warrantless arrests be followed by a prompt judicial determination of probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 111 S.Ct. 1661. The Court concluded that a probable cause hearing must occur within 48 hours of arrest, and any hearings that take place within this time frame are presumptively constitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 111 S.Ct. 1661. The Court described this outcome as \u201ca reasonable accommodation between legitimate competing concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 111 S.Ct. 1661.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">I view the current Maryland bail-review system as a similar \u201creasonable accommodation between legitimate competing concerns.\u201d The procedure allows for a quick assessment, by a neutral party, of whether the arrestee should, or should not, be released on his or her recognizance or upon satisfying a reasonable bail amount; the procedure further requires a formal judicial review of that initial determination, as soon as practicable, at which the defendant is entitled to the full benefits of counsel. The Commissioner hearing, combining a probable cause hearing with an initial bail determination, is designed to \u201cminimize the time a presumptively innocent individual spends in jail.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 58, 111 S.Ct. 1661. In some cases, a Commissioner will either find probable cause lacking and release an arrestee, or determine that probable cause exists and allow an arrestee to be free pending trial, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>to post a nominal bail amount. If that does not occur, the Commissioner\u2019s decision will be reviewed immediately by a District Court judge, and the arrestee will have the benefit of counsel to plead his or her case. This practice properly addresses the constitutional concerns.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The changes adopted by the majority today will assuredly alter the Commissioner hearing from an informal process into a mini-trial, all of which can be repeated again before a District Court judge within 24 hours if the outcome is not favorable to the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I fear that these changes will prolong \u2014 not diminish \u2014 the time a defendant spends in custody prior to bail review by the District Court. I agree with the State that the Commissioner hearing, as it now stands, is \u201cstraightforward, guided by rule, and of limited duration,\u201d typically occurring \u201cin the absence of opposing counsel\u201d and under rules that \u201cprovide adequate substitute procedural safeguards.\u201d I would hold that such a proceeding does not violate procedural due process under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Judges Harrell and Adkins have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">WHEREAS, this Court filed an opinion and judgment in this case on January 4, 2012. Absent a timely petition for reconsideration, this Court\u2019s mandate would have issued on February 3, 2012, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-606(b). Timely petitions for reconsideration of the January 4, 2012 decision were filed, along with motions to stay the Court\u2019s mandate. Consequently, on March 16, 2012, this Court stayed its mandate pending a decision on the petitions for reconsideration. Subsequently, memoranda were filed and oral argument was held on issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, and</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">WHEREAS, this Court, on September 25, 2013, rendered an opinion and judgment on the motions for reconsideration. Therefore, the stay of mandate pending a decision on the petitions for reconsideration expired when that decision was rendered on September 25, 2013. This Court\u2019s mandate was issued on October 17, 2013, and</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">WHEREAS, the State of Maryland on October 23, 2013 filed in this Court a \u201cMOTION TO RECALL MANDATE,\u201d stating that it \u201creasonably expected that the mandate would not issue before\u201d the expiration of 30 days after the filing of the Court\u2019s September 25, 2013 opinion. Actually, as the above-recitation of the facts shows, the mandate had been stayed much longer than 30 days, and the stay of the mandate pending a decision on the motions for reconsideration expired on September 25, 2013, and</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">WHEREAS, the State of Maryland on October 25, 2013 filed in this Court a \u201cMOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\u201d of this Court\u2019s September 25, 2013 decision re-arguing the merits of the September 25th decision. Also on October 25, 2013, the State of Maryland filed in this Court a \u201cMOTION FOR STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE JUDGMENT,\u201d contending that, for various reasons, more time is needed for the State government to comply with this Court\u2019s September 25, 2013 decision, it is this 6th day of November, 2013</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">ORDERED, by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, a majority of the Court concurring, that the State\u2019s motions to recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the mandate, for reconsideration, and for stay of enforcement of the judgment be, and they are hereby denied. This Court\u2019s September 25th decision only directed the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to enter a declaratory judgment in accordance with the Court\u2019s opinion. No other form of relief was then involved. Under the Maryland Declaratory Judgments Act, a declaratory judgment simply \u201cdeclare[s] rights, status, [or] other legal relations,\u201d Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-403(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The State of Maryland\u2019s arguments concerning the time needed to comply with the declaratory judgment ordered by the Court\u2019s September 25, 2013 decision, as well as any arguments by other parties, may be made in the Circuit Court if, and when, any party files in the Circuit Court an application for \u201cFurther relief based on [the] declaratory judgment,\u201d \u00a7 3-412(a) of the Declaratory Judgments Act. <em>See, e.g., Nova v. Penske, </em>405 Md. 435, 458-461, 952 A.2d 275, 289-291 (2008); <em>Bankers &amp; Ship. Ins. v. Electro Enterprises, </em>287 Md. 641, 652-653, 415 A.2d 278, 285 (1980).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\">. The General Assembly, in response to <em>Richmond I, </em>amended the Act such that representation by the Public Defender at the initial appearance before a Commissioner is no longer required. Md. Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2012 Supp.), \u00a7 16-204(b)(2)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-10\">. The majority declines to consider whether an indigent defendant has a right to counsel under the Sixth or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Maj. Op. at 456-57, 76 A.3d at 1026. Because the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>does not consider the claim under the Sixth Amendment or its Maryland counterpart, Article 21, I shall not analyze those grounds and will limit my dissent to the procedural due process claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\">. The majority cites three additional cases, <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 262, 523 A.2d 597 (1987); <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 248, 513 A.2d 299 (1986); <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 218, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981), for the same proposition. Those cases stated the proposition, but none involved the initial question of whether the defendant had the right to counsel; rather, each involved the question of whether the defendant had properly waived that right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\">. The Public Defender has asked this Court to make clear under what standard of review a District Court judge reviews the initial bail determination made by a Commissioner. In <em>De Wolfe v. Richmond, </em>434 Md. 403, 430 n. 22, 76 A.3d 962, 2012 WL 10853, *12 n. 22 (2012) <em>(\"Richmond </em>I\u201d), we stated in a footnote: \"We emphasize that District Court judges owe no deference to the Commissioners\u2019 initial bail determinations.\u201d The Public Defender asks that this Court \"reaffirm that statement\u201d by making such a holding explicit. To the extent that there was any confusion on this point, I would reaffirm that a District Court judge reviews a Commissioner\u2019s initial determination de <em>novo </em>and owes no deference to the decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. The General Assembly appropriated $5.4 million to the Public Defender\u2019s Office to ensure that it could provide representation at all bail review hearings. Previously, the Public Defender provided representation at some, but not all, bail review hearings in the state. According to the Public Defender, it now represents indigent defendants at all bail review hearings, but does not provide representation at the initial hearing before District Court Commissioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">. The majority cites, at length, the language in <em>Richmond I, </em>434 Md. at 427-31, 76 A.3d at 976-78, in which this Court wrote about the potential for defendants to lose their liberty in a Commissioner hearing and the potential benefit of counsel for defendants in that process. I do not disagree that counsel could be of assistance at a Commissioner hearing, but the question is not whether assistance would be beneficial, but rather whether it is constitutionally compelled. Moreover, the concerns expressed in the earlier iteration of this case came at a time when a defendant did <em>not </em>have the right to counsel at a bail review hearing in District Court. At that point, defendants could spend \"weeks, if not many months,\u201d incarcerated prior to trial without having had counsel argue on their behalf. That concern is no longer present under current Maryland law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">. The State notes that the General Assembly considered a multitude of factors in deciding not to require counsel at the initial hearing stage. These include the high monetary cost, the logistical and practical difficulties inherent in providing counsel at that early of a stage, concerns of public safety, and \"the fact that many arrestees are released at this stage, without assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
