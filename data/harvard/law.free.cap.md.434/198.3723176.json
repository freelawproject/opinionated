The petitioner, Jacqueline D. K, filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Prince George\u2019s County a petition requesting guardianship of her nephew, Tracy K. A judge of that court dismissed the petition on the ground that the Orphans\u2019 Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition. The petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals; however, we issued a writ of certiorari before the intermediate appellate court decided the appeal. <em>In Re Adoption of Tracy K., </em>403 Md. 612, 943 A.2d 1244 (2008). The issue on appeal is whether the Orphans\u2019 Court possessed jurisdiction over Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tions for Guardianship of the Person, where at least one of the natural parents is alive, parental rights have not been terminated, and no testamentary appointment has been made. We hold that the Orphans\u2019 Court did not have jurisdiction in this situation and affirm the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s dismissal of the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Jacqueline D.K., the petitioner, filed a Petition for Guardianship of the Person in the Prince George\u2019s County Orphans\u2019 Court to obtain legal guardianship of her nephew, Tracy K. Tracy K., born on August 8, 1991, had lived with his father, Tracy S. (\u201cFather\u201d), prior to the summer of 2007. At the time of the filing of the instant petition, Tracy K.\u2019s mother (the petitioner\u2019s sister) was deceased. With the alleged consent of the Father, Tracy K. decided to live with the petitioner until he turned eighteen. Therefore, the petitioner initiated the guardianship action that is at the heart of this case. After a preliminary review, the Orphans\u2019 Court scheduled a hearing and sent notices to all interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">At the hearing, the petitioner, appearing pro se, testified that no legal proceedings were on-going currently (or had occurred) seeking to terminate the Father\u2019s parental rights. She testified further that the Father refused to help with Tracy K.\u2019s maintenance or to consent to the guardianship. Jacqueline D.K. affirmed also that Tracy K. was not entitled to any funds or property from his Mother\u2019s, or any, estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The Orphans\u2019 Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The court explained that its jurisdiction is \u201climited to cases where a minor would receive assets resulting from someone\u2019s death ... [or] when there\u2019s no surviving parent or when a surviving parent\u2019s legal rights to be responsible for the child have been terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Petitioner filed timely a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before the intermediate appellate court decided the appeal, a petition for writ of certiorari was filed with the Court of Appeals. We granted the petition to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">\u201cDoes the Orphans\u2019 Court have jurisdiction over Petitions for Guardianship of the person of a minor child where one of the natural parents is alive, where parental rights have not been terminated and no testamentary appointment has been made?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">403 Md. 612, 943 A.2d 1244 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The Maryland Constitution created the Orphans\u2019 Courts and granted the Maryland General Assembly the power to determine the Orphans\u2019 Courts\u2019 authority. Md. Const, art. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 40(c). The Orphans\u2019 Courts have the special and limited subject matter jurisdiction determined by the Legislature. <em>Kaouris v. Kaouris, </em>324 Md. 687, 693, 598 A.2d 1193, 1195-96 (1991). Maryland Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), Estates &amp; Trusts Article (\u201cET\u201d), \u00a7 2-102(a) grants the Orphans\u2019 Courts the power to \u201cconduct judicial probate, direct the conduct of the personal representative, and pass orders which may be required in the course of the administration of an estate.\u201d ET \u00a7 2-102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In ET Title 13 are contained specific laws promulgated for the protection of minors. ET \u00a7 13-105(a) states that \u201c[t]he orphans\u2019 courts and the circuit courts have concurrent jurisdiction over guardians of the person of a minor and over protective proceedings for minors.\u201d Maryland Code (1974, 2008 Repl.Vol.), ET \u00a7 13-105(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ET \u00a7 13-106(a) grants the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Orphans\u2019 Court authority over guardianships of property of a minor, providing that \u201c[a]n orphans\u2019 court has full power to secure the rights of a minor whose estate is being administered by a guardian under its jurisdiction.\u201d ET \u00a7 13-702(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits the Orphans\u2019 Court to appoint, upon petition of any person interested in the minor\u2019s welfare, a guardian of the person of an unmarried minor, but only \u201c[i]f neither parent is serving as guardian of the person and no testamentary appointment has been made.\u201d Nevertheless, ET \u00a7 13-702(a) makes clear that it \u201cmay not be construed to require court appointment of a guardian of the person of a minor if there is no good reason, such as a dispute, for a court appointment.\u201d ET \u00a7 13-701<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> authorizes the surviving parent of a minor, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>is not prohibited by agreement or court order, to make a testamentary appointment. The Maryland Code, in both Title 2 and Title 13 of the Estates and Trusts Article, in almost identical language, limits explicitly the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s jurisdiction. ET \u00a7 2-102(a) of that Article instructs, \u201c[t]he court <em>may not, </em>under pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction not expressly conferred,\u201d (emphasis added) while ET \u00a7 13-106(b) provides: \u201cThe orphans\u2019 court, under the pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, may not exercise jurisdiction not expressly conferred by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We have held that a court has subject matter jurisdiction, referred to also as fundamental jurisdiction, when the Legislature grants a court \u201cthe power to act with regard to a subject matter,\u201d <em>Pulley v. State, </em>287 Md. 406, 416, 412 A.2d 1244, 1249 (1980), and to \u201crender a judgement over a class of cases within which a particular one falls.\u201d <em>Salvagno v. Frew, </em>388 Md. 605, 616 n. 4, 881 A.2d 660, 666 n. 4 (2005) (citing <em>First Federated Co. Tr. v. Comm\u2019r of Sec. for the State of Md., </em>272 Md. 329, 335, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Although this particular issue was one of first impression (prior to the 2009 amendment to the statutory scheme dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>cussed in footnote 2 supra), we have reviewed previously the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s jurisdiction in other cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Kaouris, </em>we considered whether the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction to determine the validity and interpretation of a marital property settlement agreement. <em>Kaouris, </em>324 Md. at 691, 598 A.2d at 1195. We focused the inquiry on \u201cwhether the orphans\u2019 court has the power to construe a written document <em>... is </em>dependent on what the party is asking the court to do and whether, when the court construes that document, it does so consistent with, and in furtherance of, an express grant of power.\u201d <em>Kaouris, </em>324 Md. at 706, 598 A.2d at 1202 (emphasis in original). We held that the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction to construe the marital settlement because it was necessary for the settlement of the deceased\u2019s estate and, thus, \u201cwas incidental to the court\u2019s exercise of an express power.\u201d <em>Kaouris, </em>324 Md. at 716, 598 A.2d at 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Applying <em>Kaomis\u2019s </em>analytical template to the present case, we conclude that the Orphans\u2019 Court did not have jurisdiction here. <em>Kaouris </em>requires that the court\u2019s action be \u201cconsistent with, and in furtherance of, an express grant of power.\u201d <em>Kaouris, </em>324 Md. at 706, 598 A.2d at 1202. ET \u00a7 2-102(a) expressly grants the Orphans\u2019 Court the power to administer and conduct probate, which includes some functions that are incidental to achieving this main purpose, such as construction of a marital settlement agreement, resolution of conflict with estate creditors, and determination of property\u2019s title. ET \u00a7 2-102(a); <em>see e.g. Kaouris, </em>324 Md. at 716, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>598 A.2d at 1207; <em>Radcliff v. Vance, </em>360 Md. 277, 295, 757 A.2d 812, 821 (2000) (affirming the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s jurisdiction over an estate\u2019s creditors); <em>Talbot Packing Corp. v. Wheatley, </em>172 Md. 365, 369-70, 190 A. 833, 835 (1937) (holding that the Orphans\u2019 Court has jurisdiction only to determine the title of property in specific instances designated by the Maryland Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The present case is not within the express grant of the court\u2019s power because the guardianship petition is not incidental to administering probate. Although Tracy K.\u2019s Mother is deceased, the guardianship petition was not related to her estate and his Mother did not make a testamentary appointment of guardianship in her will. The petitioner also testified that Tracy K. was not entitled to any property from this or any estate. Under the <em>Kaouris </em>inquiry, the petition of guardianship is not incidental to a probate case and, thus, the Orphans\u2019 Court did not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Our inquiry is not complete until we determine whether ET \u00a7 13-105(a) or ET \u00a7 13-702(a) expands the Orphans\u2019 Courts\u2019 express jurisdiction. This is an issue of statutory construction. Our precedents state that \u201c[a] court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.\u201d <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274, 987 A.2d 18, 28 (2010) (citations omitted). If the court determines that the statute is plain, \u201cunambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose,\u201d then the court\u2019s \u201cinquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction.\u201d <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 275, 987 A.2d at 29 (citations omitted). The court must interpret the statute \u201c \u2018as a whole [ ] so that no word, elause[, sentence,] or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory,\u2019 \u201d <em>Potomac Valley Orthopaedic Assocs. v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>417 Md. 622, 630, 12 A.3d 84, 88 (2011) (citations omitted), or given an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>interpretation that \u201cis absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 276-77, 987 A.2d at 29 (citations omitted). Finally, the court \u201cdo[es] not read statutory language in a vacuum,\u201d but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">[rjather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 275-76, 987 A.2d at 29 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">As previously discussed, the primary purpose of the Orphans\u2019 Court is to administer and manage probate. ET \u00a7 2-102(a) grants the Orphans\u2019 Court the jurisdiction to \u201cconduct judicial probate, direct the conduct of a personal representative, and pass orders which may be required in the course of the administration of an estate of a decedent.\u201d ET \u00a7 2-102(a). This authority is limited immediately by the last line in that subsection, which prohibits the court from, \u201cunder the pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercising] any jurisdiction not expressly conferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Outlining the rules for the protection of minors, ET, Title 13 includes the two statutes in question. ET \u00a7 13-105(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGC\">\u201cThe orphans\u2019 courts and the circuit courts have concurrent jurisdiction over guardians of the person of a minor and over protective proceedings for minors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">ET \u00a7 13-702(a) requires specifically that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">\u201c[i]f neither parent is serving as guardian of the person and no testamentary appointment has been made, on petition by any person interested in the welfare of the minor, and after notice and hearing, the court may appointment a guardian of the person of an unmarried minor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">At first blush, ET \u00a7 13-105(a) seems to expand the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to guardians of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>person to that concurrent with the Circuit Court. This interpretation would be incorrect. ET \u00a7 13-105(a) must be analyzed in conjunction with ET \u00a7 13-702(a), and in the context of the broader legislative purpose. ET \u00a7 13-702(a) limits the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s jurisdiction over guardianship of the person petitions only to situations in which neither parent is a guardian and there is no testamentary grant of guardianship. The Circuit Court retains jurisdiction over this particular situation and all other guardianship of the person cases. Most likely the facts required by ET \u00a7 13-702(a) would arise in the context of probate and, thus, it also fits the larger purpose of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The petitioner urges that we accept an alternative reading of ET \u00a7 13-702(a). Pointing ostensibly to the plain language of that subsection, she asserts that the phrase \u201cneither parent is serving as guardian\u201d includes circumstances where the parents are not deceased and their parental rights have not been terminated. She argues that, if \u201cnot serving as\u201d is interpreted to mean that the parental rights have been terminated, the language is superfluous because the same result could be achieved by simply stating \u201cif neither parent is guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We reject the petitioner\u2019s proposed interpretation of ET \u00a7 13-702(a). This argument is inconsistent with the established jurisdiction over related family law matters. Maryland law grants the circuit and juvenile courts the jurisdiction to terminate parental rights. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 1-201; <em>Carroll Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 175-76, 577 A.2d 14, 26 (1990). Until such determination, \u201c[t]he parents [are] the natural guardians of their minor child\u201d and are \u201cresponsible for the child\u2019s support, care, nurture, welfare, and education.\u201d FL \u00a7 5-203(a)-(b). Title 5 of the Family Law article requires the courts to make very specific inquiries into the best interests of the child before ruling on the termination of the parental rights. Under the petitioner\u2019s interpretation, the Orphans\u2019 Court would have the jurisdiction to determine whether the parent is \u201cserving as a guardian,\u201d but the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>does not give the Orphans\u2019 Court a standard by which to answer this question. It is unlikely that the Legislature intended for the circuit and juvenile courts to engage in an intensive, statutorily-guided, and fact-based inquiry, but left the Orphans\u2019 Court to determine its own standard. Without express authority from the Maryland General Assembly, we may not grant, by interpretation, the Orphans\u2019 Court this additional jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">For the aforegoing reasons, we affirm the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s dismissal of Jacqueline D.K\u2019s petition requesting guardianship of Tracy K.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\">. We issued previously a <em>per curiam </em>order affirming the Orphans' Court\u2019s order, <em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship of Tracy K., </em>405 Md. 82, 950 A.2d 86 (2008), and now explain our reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">.

She argues that ET \u00a7 13-105(a) grants the Orphans\u2019 Courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction, and ET \u00a7 13-702(a) describes the requirements that must be met for the Orphans' Court to appoint a guardian. If ET \u00a7 13-702(a) states the requirements that must be met for the Orphans\u2019 Court to appoint a guardian, then the Orphans\u2019 Court would be unable to grant guardianship in the instant case. ET \u00a7 13-702(a) states that if neither parent is serving as a guardian and there is no testamentary appointment of a guardian, then the Orphans\u2019 Court may appoint a guardian. In the instant case, these conditions are not met and, thus, the Orphans' Court may not appoint a guardian. We do not consider this argument because it leads inevitably to the same outcome as reached here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b233-5\">.
