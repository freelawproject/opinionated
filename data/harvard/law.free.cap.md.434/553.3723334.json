We ordered, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), that the matter be transmitted \u201cto the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to be heard and determined by Judge Robert A. Greenberg, of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The petitioner was unable to serve the respondent with the Petition for Disciplinary Action at any of her listed mailing addresses and, therefore, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-753, served the Administrator of the Client Protection Fund. The respondent neither filed an answer to the Petition, nor a motion to vacate the consequent Order of Default issued by the Circuit Court pursuant to Maryland Rules 2-613(b) and 16-754(c). Following a hearing, at which the respondent failed to appear, the Circuit Court made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201cRespondent was admitted to the bar of Maryland on June 5, 1996. On or about December 4, 2005, Complainant, who is presently serving a life sentence at the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, retained Respondent for representation in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. On that date, Complainant signed a retainer agreement that obligated him to pay Respondent a flat fee of $20,000.00, which would be placed in her operating account and considered earned upon undertaking the representation. Complainant, however, did not give informed consent, confirmed in writing, for Respondent to immediately place the fee in her operating account. The retainer agreement also provided that the Complainant would make an advance payment of $10,000.00, which would be non-refundable once earned, regardless of the case\u2019s outcome. In exchange, Respondent agreed to file a successive <em>habeas corpus </em>petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201cPursuant to the parties\u2019 fee agreement, the following payments were made: $8,225.00 on August 15, 2005; $1,550.00 on May 23, 2006; $500.00 on August 7, 2006; and $10,000.00 on September 21, 2006, for a total of $20,275.00. All of the payments, except for the $500.00 installment, were deposited in Respondent\u2019s operating account, which was titled \u2018IOLTA.\u2019[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cRespondent never filed a <em>habeas corpus </em>petition on Complainant\u2019s behalf. On March 18, 2008, Respondent sent Complainant a letter stating that, because of health issues, she could no longer represent him, but could solicit the assistance of another attorney on his behalf. She also stated that Complainant could terminate her as his counsel, at which time they would \u2018discuss the terms of refunding his fee.\u2019 Complainant did not respond to this letter. Respondent wrote him again on May 5, 2008, inquiring how he wished to proceed. This was her last correspondence to Complainant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cOn April 8, 2008, the Court of Appeals decertified Respondent for failure to pay the Client Protection Fund assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ment. Despite being stripped of her ability to legally practice law in Maryland, Respondent subsequently entered her appearance in three cases: <em>Waterton v. Waterton, </em>0602SP029202008, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County; <em>Rose v. Daneri, </em>713338-FL, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County; and <em>Shumate v. Duren, </em>CAL 0814488, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. \u201cComplainant sent a letter to Bar Counsel on May 11, 2008, lodging a complaint against Respondent. He stated that he had retained Respondent as counsel for his <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, and paid her flat fee for her services, but she had not performed the agreed-upon work. Further, he alleged that, despite numerous attempts, he had not been able to get in contact with her and speak about the status of the case. On May 28, 2008, Assistant Bar Counsel Kathleen McLaughlin forwarded to Respondent a copy of the complaint, requesting a response to the allegations within 15 days. Respondent did not answer this letter. On June 24, 2008, Ms. McLaughlin sent her another request for a response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201cOn June 26, 2008, Respondent answered Ms. McLaughlin\u2019s correspondence, and enclosed copies of her letters to Complainant to demonstrate her attempts at communication. Ms. McLaughlin, in turn, wrote to Respondent on July 8, 2008, stating that Complainant no longer required her services, but emphasized that he wanted his fee returned. This letter was unanswered, so on July 21, 2008, Ms. McLaughlin again wrote to Respondent, requesting copies of her billing statements, evidence that the retainer payment was placed in her escrow account, and documentation concerning disbursement of Complainant\u2019s funds, within 10 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cOn July 17, 2008, Complainant wrote to Ms. McLaughlin, and enclosed a letter from Gary Roehm, Esq., dated July 14, 2008, indicating that he had been hired by Respondent to work on Complainant\u2019s <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. However, in his correspondence to Ms. McLaughlin, Complainant stressed that he did not want, nor did he agree to, Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>dent hiring substitute counsel and still desired the refunding of his fee. This letter was forwarded to Respondent on July 31, 2008, and on August 18, 2008, Gary Huggins, Esq., sent Bar Counsel a response on her behalf. Mr. Huggins stated that Respondent had already paid $3,750.00 to another attorney and a private investigator for Complainant\u2019s case. Mr. Huggins, however, failed to provide the documents previously requested by Mr. McLaughlin. Therefore, on August 28, 2008, Ms. McLaughlin wrote to Mr. Huggins, requesting evidence of Complainant\u2019s consent to Respondent depositing the $20,000.00 fee immediately into her operating account. In a letter, dated September 10, 2008, Respondent stated that the retainer agreement itself authorized placement of the advance fee payment in her operating account. Respondent never returned any portion of Complainant\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\u201cIn light of the Complaint and Respondent\u2019s failure to comply with Petitioner\u2019s requests, Bar Counsel assigned Dennis Biennas, its investigator, to look into the matter. As part of his investigation, Mr. Biennas arranged to interview Respondent on November 20, 2008. Respondent, however, canceled the appointment on the morning of the interview, and rescheduled for December 3, 2008. On December 3, Respondent again canceled the appointment, after Wendy Hartman, a Virginia-barred attorney, advised her to seek counsel and arrange for a new interview date. Mr. Biennas did not hear from Respondent after December 3, so on December 16 he wrote her a letter, seeking a new appointment date and reciting his previous efforts to set up a meeting. Because Respondent failed to answer this letter, Mr. Biennas ceased the investigation on January 9, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cOn February 9, 2009, Albert Wilson, Jr., Esq., wrote to Ms. McLaughlin and Glenn Grossman, Deputy Bar Counsel, regarding Respondent\u2019s disciplinary investigation, stating that she had performed substantial work on Complainant\u2019s case (138.5 hours), and in support of this contention, en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>closed a record log of the time spent on the case, for which she billed at an hourly rate of $225.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">(Internal citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">From these facts, the hearing judge drew conclusions of law, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201c1. M[L]RPC 1.1 \u2014 Competence, M[L]RPC 1.2(a)[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]\u2014 Duty to Consult with Client and M[L]RPC 1.3 \u2014 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201cAlthough Respondent may have been competent to represent Complainant in his <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, the facts demonstrate a complete failure to file a <em>habeas corpus </em>petition, the purpose of Respondent\u2019s representation. The Court of Appeals has held that an attorney\u2019s complete failure to file a petition on behalf of his/her client, such as an emergency or adoption petition, constitutes a violation of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cM[L]RPC\u201d) 1.1 (See <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388 [946 A.2d 1009] (2008); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33 [891 A.2d 1085] (2006)). This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>similarly finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent\u2019s complete disregard for Complainant\u2019s case and the <em>habeas corpus </em>petition violated M[L]RPC 1.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">\u201cAdditionally, in violation of M[L]RPC 1.2(a) and 1.3, Respondent failed to exercise reasonable diligence on Complainant\u2019s behalf and consult with him about the case. After May, 2008, Respondent simply walked away from the matter, and, although she initially stated that Complainant might be entitled to a refund of his fee, she subsequently ended all communication. Then, from November, 2008, until January, 2009, Respondent canceled several appointments and failed to meet with Mr. Biennas, thus ignoring her duty to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cThis court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent\u2019s complete abandonment of her duties and responsibilities to Complainant constituted a violation of M[L]RPC 1.1,1.2(a) and 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201c2. M[L]RPC 1.4(a)(3) \u2014 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201cIn July, 2008, Bar Counsel forwarded Complainant\u2019s letters to Respondent, indicating that he no longer wished to retain her as counsel, but wanted his fee returned, pursuant to her March, 2008, offer. Respondent never answered this correspondence, nor did she refund any portion of the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201cM[L]RPC 1.4(a)(3) requires an attorney to promptly comply with a client\u2019s reasonable request for information. Complainant was entitled to be apprised of Respondent\u2019s position on the refund and, at the very least, a general response to his correspondence. This court finds clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s absolute lack of attention to Complainant\u2019s inquiries and communications constituted a violation of M[L]RPC 1.4(a)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201c3. M[L]RPC 1.5(a) \u2014 Unreasonable Fee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">\u201cThe court in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554 [745 A.2d 1037] (2000), held that a non-refundable fee, obtained for unperformed work, would most likely violate M[L]RPC 1.5, which prohibits an attorney from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">\u201cContrary to the Rules, Respondent entered into a fee agreement with Complainant that entitled her to $20,000.00, simply by signing the agreement, and without performing the agreed-upon work. This court finds clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s actions, in connection with the fee agreement, violate M[L]RPC 1.5(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201c4. M[L]RPC 1.15 [ (c) J, Md. Rule 16-604 and Md.Code Ann., Bus. Occ. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. \u00a7 10-304 \u2014 Placing Client\u2019s Payments Immediately Into Operating Account</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-D\">\u201cIn Respondent\u2019s September, 2008, letter to Assistant Bar Counsel, she contends that the fee agreement itself authorized her to immediately deposit the money into her operating account. Additionally, Mr. Wilson forwarded to bar Counsel Respondent\u2019s record of the time she spent on the case, reflecting an hourly charge of $225.00. This log, however, did not indicate that Respondent even drafted, much less filed, Complainant\u2019s <em>habeas corpus </em>petition. A substantial portion of the work allegedly performed on Complainant\u2019s behalf occurred before the retainer agreement was signed. Further, pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, Complainant was to pay a flat fee of $20,000.00 for the entire representation, and was not to be billed at an hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201cThis court finds that although Complainant agreed to the fee arrangement, he did not give the requisite informed, written consent, pursuant to M[L]RPC 1.15(c). Complainant should have been advised of his right to insist upon placement of the money in trust, the risks associated with direct deposit into an operating account, and then confirmed his consent in writing. Additionally, Md. Rule 16-604 and Md.Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. \u00a7 10-304 require an attorney to deposit a client\u2019s fee immediately into an attorney trust account, in an approved financial institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aho\">\u201cBy failing to obtain the requisite consent when entering into the subject agreement, and later failing to preserve these monies in trust, this court finds, by clear and convine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ing evidence, that Respondent violated M[L]RPC 1.15(c), Md. Rule 16-604 and Md.Code Ann., Bus. Occ. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. \u00a7 10-304.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">\u201c5. M[L]RPC 1.16(d) \u2014 Failure to Return an Unearned Fee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cM[L]RPC 1.16(d) provides that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps, to the extent reasonably practicable, to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. This court in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Tinsky, </em>777 [377] Md. 646 [835 A.2d 542] (2003), held that an attorney violates M[L]RPC 1.16(d) when he or she abandons his or her practice and fails to return fees to a client for an uncompleted case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cIn the instant case, Respondent abandoned the case and failed to refund any portion of Complainant\u2019s $20,000.00 fee, despite alluding to this possibility in March 2008. Because Respondent\u2019s performance did not entitle [ ] her to the fee deposited into her account, this court finds clear and convincing evidence that her failure to return the money constitutes a violation of M[L]RPC 1.16(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201c6. M[L]RPC 5.5(a) \u2014 Unauthorized Practice of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjNv\">\u201cM[L]RPC 5.5(a) prohibits an attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law or assisting in such activity. Although, she was no longer authorized to practice law in Maryland, Respondent continued to enter her appearance in three Maryland cases after her April, 2008 decertification. This court finds clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s continued practice of law, subsequent to her decertification, constitutes a violation of M[L]RPC 5.5(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201c7. M[L]RPC 8.1(b) \u2014 Failure to Cooperate With Disciplinary Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">\u201cAfter scheduling an appointment to meet with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator, Mr. Biennas, Respondent canceled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>November 20th meeting and failed to make herself available for future dates. Her refusal to cooperate with the disciplinary authority caused Mr. Biennas to cease the investigation. However pursuant to M[L]RPC 8.1(b), Respondent was required to respond to a lawful demand for information from the disciplinary authority, in connection with an investigation. This court finds clear and convincing evidence that this obstruction of the disciplinary investigation violates M[L]RPC 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">\u201c8. M[L]RPC 8.4(c) \u2014 Attorney Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cPursuant to M[L]RPC 8.4(c), it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. This court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that by expending Complainant\u2019s entire fee, without preserving funds in trust, or performing the agree[d-]upon work, Respondent violated M[L]RPC 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201c9. Md. Rule 16-606 \u2014 Name and Designation of Account</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cPursuant to Md. Rule 16-606, an attorney shall maintain each attorney trust account with a title that includes the name of the attorney or law firm and that clearly designates the account as \u2018Attorney Trust Account,\u2019 \u2018Attorney Escrow Account,\u2019 or \u2018Client\u2019s Funds Account,\u2019 on all checks and deposit slips. The title shall distinguish the account from any other fiduciary account that the attorney or law firm may maintain and from any personal or business account for the attorney or law firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cIn the instant case, the court finds clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Md. Rule 16-606, by titling the subject account TOLTA,\u2019 rather than \u2018Attorney Trust Account,\u2019 \u2018Attorney Escrow Account,\u2019 or \u2018Client\u2019s Funds Account,\u2019 as permitted by the Rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">As indicated, the respondent did not appear or participate in these proceedings. Therefore, she has not filed any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>of Law.

MLRPC 8.5(a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> authorizes this Court to impose sanctions for attorney misconduct. We do so, however, aware that the purpose of attorney discipline is the protection of the public, not the punishment of the erring attorney. <em>E.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Goodman, </em>426 Md. 115, 131, 43 A.3d 988, 997 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">When imposing sanctions that will best seive this purpose, we must look to the facts and circumstances underlying the misconduct. <em>E.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 74, 930 A.2d 328, 347 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257, 269, 920 A.2d 458, 465 (2007). This is because \u201c[t]he severity of the sanction to be applied is measured by the egregiousness of the misconduct under the particular facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gisriel, </em>409 Md. 331, 386, 974 A.2d 331, 363 (2009) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm,\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 165, 567 A.2d 112, 117 (1989)). Next, \u201cwe consider the nature of the ethical duty violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Again, this is because it is only by imposing sanctions \u201cthat are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gore, </em>380 Md. 455, 472, 845 A.2d 1204, 1213 (2004), that this Court may best protect the public, which is, as we have seen, the purpose of attorney sanctions authorized under MLRPC 8.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The petitioner recommends that the respondent be disbarred.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In support of this recommendation, the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>emphasizes the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the respondent abandoned representation of the complainant without providing the agreed-upon representation and without returning any portion of the agreed-upon fee. Furthermore, it is troubled by the fact that the respondent deposited the complainant\u2019s fee directly into her operating account. The petitioner likens the respondent\u2019s conduct to the conduct for which the attorneys in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 402-03, 946 A.2d 1009, 1018 (2008); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

It points out that, in each of the cases, the attorney \u201cexpended advance fee payments before completing the work for which [he or she was] paid and made no refunds to [his or her] client[ ].\u201d In <em>McCulloch, </em>the misconduct consisted of placing an unearned fee in her operating account, spending the unearned fee for personal purposes, failing to return any portion of the unearned fee, and failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries concerning her client\u2019s complaint. The misconduct in <em>Duvall </em>included failure to account for the unearned portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>a retainer, failing to refund the unearned portion to the client, and using those funds for a purpose other than that for which it was entrusted to the respondent. In <em>Tinsky, </em>the misconduct involved, in addition to a lack of diligence and preparation and failing to communicate with clients, charging unreasonable fees, failing to account for, or return, unearned fees, misrepresentations, and failure to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">We agree with, and will adopt, the petitioner\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, we evaluate our precedents to determine the appropriate sanction for [the respondent\u2019s] admitted misconduct. Under Maryland\u2019s two-tiered system, intentional misappropriation warrants disbarment ordinarily, but where the conduct was unintentional or due to negligence, indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction usually.\u201d <em>See, e.g., [Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.] Cafferty, </em>376 Md.
