Stillwell. In the petition, it alleged that the respondent violated certain of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812, specifically Rules 1.3, Diligence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.4, Communication,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Safekeeping Property<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 8.4, Misconduct,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as Maryland Rules 16-603 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 16-604.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and by Order dated July 27, 2011, we referred the matter to Judge Sean D. Wallace of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for proceedings pursuant to Rule 16 \u2014 757(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After a hearing, Judge Wallace made findings of fact and drew conclusions of law, which determined that the respondent violated all of the charged Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Judge Wallace found the following facts. The respondent, who was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 19, 1989, met the complainant, Temitope Akojie, a Maryland licensed real estate agent, in December 2009<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> at a seminar he pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>sented in the Exit Premier Realty office. He also \u201cused\u201d office space at the Realty\u2019s Apollo Drive office. Following the presentation, Ms. Akojie spoke with the respondent about her involvement in August Real Estate, a New York Limited Liability Company (\u201cLLC\u201d), its debt situation and her desire to establish a Maryland LLC, independent of Exit Premier Realty, for her real estate business. They did not speak again until the next month, in January, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">At that time, Ms. Akojie expressed to the respondent that she \u201cwanted to keep the name August Real Estate Team for her limited liability company in Maryland, that she was willing to assume the debts incurred by Ms. [Amanda] Pinales[, her partner in the New York LLC,] in connection with August and that she wanted him \u2018to begin work to set up the L.L.C. as a formed corporation in Maryland, also as a single-member L.L.C. which also entailed whatever Respondent needed to do with regards to removing Amanda Pi\u00f1ales as a member, as well as [Ms. Akojie\u2019s] assumption of [the L.L.C.\u2019s] assets and liabilities.\u2019 \u201d It was not until March 9, 2010 that the parties entered into a Legal Services Agreement. That agreement, printed on the respondent\u2019s attorney letterhead, as pertinent, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\u201cClient hereby engages Attorney to perform the following legal services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">a. Assist in establishing August Real Estate Team, LLC, as a Maryland Foreign Limited Liability Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">b. Assist in establishing August Real Estate Team as a single member LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">c. Assist in having assets and liabilities of August Real Estate Team LLC transferred to exclusive control, responsibility and ownership of Client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Ms. Akojie agreed to pay the respondent \u201cfor performing the above and described matter at a flat fee of $3000.00 of which $2000.00 shall be due upon execution of the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>After signing the agreement, Ms. Akojie gave the respondent a personal check, payable to him, in the amount of $2,000.00. The respondent deposited the check in his personal checking account, rather than in his attorney trust account, required by Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules, to be maintained for the receipt and safekeeping of client funds. In fact, the respondent did not have an active attorney trust account when he deposited the $2,000.00 check from Ms. Akojie.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The respondent did not obtain Ms. Akojie\u2019s informed consent, either within the written Legal Services Agreement or confirmed separately in writing, to cash her $2000.00 fee check immediately rather than depositing same in a client trust fund for safekeeping until the fee was earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Rejecting the respondent\u2019s testimony that he began work on Ms. Akojie\u2019s matter in January, after their conversation, Judge Wallace, by clear and convincing evidence, found that there was no attorney client relationship established until the Legal Services Agreement was executed. Any work done on the case was, he determined, was \u201clay[ing] the groundwork for the possible future representation.\u201d Judge Wallace also was convinced that there was no attorney client relationship by the terms of the Legal Services Agreement: it provided that the term of the agreement would \u201ccommence\u201d when the agreement was signed by the parties and \u201cthe client submits the requested engagement amount\u201d and it defines the effective date, consistently, as \u201cas of the date it is executed by all parties and Client has submitted payment of the requisite retainer deposit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">After the representation agreement was signed and the respondent deposited Ms. Akojie\u2019s check for $2,000.00, the respondent\u2019s communication with Ms. Akojie and work on the matters for which he was retained were \u201csporadic,\u201d with the only documented exchanges between Respondent and Ms. Akojie being by means of electronic mail. In an April 17, 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>email to the respondent, Ms. Akojie expressed her frustration at not having been able to speak to him more frequently and the frustration of Ms. Pi\u00f1ales, from whom the representation required him to obtain debt information, in trying to reach him. She concluded, \u201c[w]e would like to stop our services and request for [sic] a refund of our funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Although in response to the April 17th email, the respondent promptly arranged a meeting with Ms. Akojie, which he followed up with written instructions designed to result in the transfer of Ms. Pi\u00f1ales\u2019 interest in the New York LLC to Ms. Akojie and setting a goal for when \u201ccomplete\u201d discussions with creditors would be held, \u201cby May 30th,\u201d and all interests in rental property would be transferred, \u201cthe end of June,\u201d neither self-imposed deadline was met. Ms. Pi\u00f1ales provided the respondent with the information about the multiple accounts she had opened in connection with the New York LLC and, as early as April 27, faxed to him the signed authorizations he would need to negotiate with those creditors. The respondent did not acknowledge receiving the faxed documents until May 14, 2010. With regard to communicating with those creditors, the respondent testified that he made efforts, by phone, to do so, but provided no notes or other records to confirm that he did. He conceded that he did not send any of them any written correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Throughout May and June of 2010, Ms. Akojie attempted to contact the respondent, leaving \u201cmultiple voice mail messages ... but did not hear back from him for \u2018probably a couple of weeks.\u2019 \u201d When the respondent did call back in June, he proposed continued representation on a pro bono basis and additional representation in an unrelated, separate employment matter. That proposal was refused, as Ms. Akojie had decided to terminate the respondent\u2019s representation, which she did in an email on July 8, 2010. In that email, she requested return of her \u201cinitial deposit of $2,000\u201d and \u201cpaperwork.\u201d Return of the latter had been promised the day before, when, in a phone call, the respondent told Ms. Akojie that \u201chis secretary \u2018would contact [her] and provide the paperwork before 2 pm that day.\u2019\u201d On July 14, Ms. Akojie sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>another email, this one reminding the respondent that his secretary stated to her \u201clast week that my check would be ready by the 15th.\u201d Acknowledging his agreement to refund the $2000, in a letter the same day, he advised that the processing of the check would take between 10 and 14 days. Ms. Akojie filed her complaint with the petitioner, which wrote to the respondent on August 9, 2010. When the refund was not received by July 30, Ms. Akojie again inquired about the refund check, by emails dated July 30 and August 12. The respondent refunded the $2000 in a letter dated August, 21, 2010, causing the court to find, \u201cRespondent did not act to issue the refund of $2000, which he previously had promised to Ms. Akojie within \u201c10-14 days\u201d of July 15, 2010, until after Respondent received notification of Ms. Akojie\u2019s grievance via Bar Counsel\u2019s correspondence dated August 9, 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">From these factual findings, the hearing court drew conclusions of law, as follows. First, with regard to the $2000 fee payment, it concluded that the respondent violated MLRPC 1.15. Because the fee had not been earned when paid and, instead, was intended to be applied to the future legal services described in the retainer agreement the parties executed, the respondent violated MLRPC 1.15(a) by not depositing that fee into an attorney trust account, which Title 16, Chapter 600 requires lawyers to maintain. Without informed consent, confirmed in writing, having been given by the client, that same conduct violates MLRPC 1.15(c). The client gave no such consent in this case. From the fact that the respondent did not maintain an attorney trust account, the hearing court concluded that the respondent also violated Rule 16-603.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The refund of the $2000 fee payment also was central to the hearing court\u2019s conclusions with respect to the respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>compliance with MLRPC 1.15(d) and 1.16(d). Having acknowledged in writing to Ms. Akojie that he was going to refund her $2,000.00 payment within 10-14 days, the court concluded that Ms. Akojie was entitled to receive those funds and, therefore, that the respondent\u2019s failure to meet his self-imposed deadline for refunding them violated MLRPC 1.15(d), as their delivery was not \u201cprompt.\u201d Inasmuch as the promised $2000.00 refund was a result of her termination of the respondent\u2019s representation, the court also concluded that the failure to surrender those funds promptly violated MLRPC 1.16(d), as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Second, with regard to the diligence charges, the hearing court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cAs part of the representation he agreed to undertake on behalf of Ms. Akojie, Respondent was responsible for contacting the various creditors identified by Ms. Panales and finding out what arrangements could be made to transfer the subject debts to Ms. Akojie or otherwise resolve such debts. Despite having written authorization from Ms. Panales by April 27, 2010, and setting a May 30, 2010 deadline \u2018to complete discussions with all creditors,\u2019 Respondent did not complete this task with reasonable diligence and promptness. He failed to send any written correspondence to the creditors and produced no documentary evidence that he had any substantive communications concerning the transfer or other resolution of such debts. Because he failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness to deal with the debt issues, he could not move forward with completing the other contemplated aspects of the representation, involving the establishment of August Real Estate Team as a single-member limited liability company for Ms. Akoyie. In summary, Respondent did not act with reasonable diligence and promptness to perform any of the three itemized legal services set forth in his Legal Services Agreement with Ms. Akoyie. This court concludes that such failure on Respondent\u2019s part violated MLRPC 1.3.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">A violation of MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) was found by the hearing court because of the respondent\u2019s failure to keep Ms. Akojie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201creasonably informed about his communications with the various creditors and what actions may be required of her.\u201d MLRPC 1.4(a)(3) was violated when the respondent did not promptly respond to Ms. Akojie\u2019s various and numerous electronic mail messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The hearing court finally concluded that the respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(a). His reasoning was straight-forward: \u201cby violating other Rules of Professional Conduct as described herein, it follows that Respondent engaged in professional misconduct under MLRPC 8.4(a).\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The petitioner took no exceptions<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to the findings and conclusions made by the hearing court, but it did make a recommendation for sanction, that the respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. In addition to the violations found by the hearing court in the instant case, the petitioner factors into its recommendation calculus, as an aggravator, see American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991), \u00a7 9.22(a), the fact that the respondent, who is the subject of a reciprocal discipline petition involving the same alleged misconduct, was suspended by the District of Columbia, for 60 days for violation of the District of Columbia equivalent of Maryland Rules 8.4(c) and 1.17(b)(1). When this prior disciplinary sanction is considered with another aggravating factor, see \u00a7 9.22(d), \u201cthe multiple violations in the present case ... \u201d, the petitioner concludes that \u201cthe appropriate discipline for Respondent should certainly be no less than an indefinite suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The respondent filed exceptions to the findings of fact and the conclusions of law flowing from those findings that he believes, and therefore argued, are \u201ccrucial\u201d to finding that he violated the charged Rules and, on that basis and for that reason, recommends that the Court dismiss all charges. These findings of fact, and the related conclusions, are (1) that there was no lawyer client relationship established between the respondent and Ms, Akojie prior to the execution of the legal services agreement; (2) that the partial fee paid when the agreement was executed was not then earned and was paid in anticipation of future services; (3) that the only documented communications between the respondent and Ms Akojie was via electronic mail; (4) that the respondent failed to acknowledge receipt of faxed documents until May 14, 2010, long after they had been faxed; and (5) that he did not communicate with Ms. Akojie\u2019s creditors in writing and failed to produce notes or other records reflecting the communications he did engage in.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">With regard to the attorney client relationship issue, the respondent relies on this Court\u2019s acknowledgment, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. </em>James, 355 Md. 465, 467-77, 735 A.2d 1027, 1033 (1999), that neither the existence, or not, of an attorney client agreement nor payment for the services rendered is dispositive of whether such a relationship has been formed. In that regard, he also emphasizes what we said on the subject of when an attorney client relationship comes into being in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 174, 821 A.2d 414, 425 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201cMany courts have adopted the following standard to assess whether the relationship has been established: An attorney-client relationship is said to be have been created when (1) a person seeks advice or assistance from an attorney; (2) the advice or assistance sought pertains to matters within the attorney\u2019s professional competence; (3) the attorney expressly or impliedly agrees to give or actually gives the desired advice or assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Proceeding on those premises, he argues that his attorney client relationship with Ms. Akojie was formed well prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>March 2010, when the parties executed a legal services agreement and Ms. Akojie paid the partial fee to the respondent. This is borne out, he submits, by the conceded facts that Ms. Akojie consulted him in the fall of 2009 about a matter within his professional competence and that he agreed to give advice and assistance, as demonstrated by his having met with her on the subject subsequently on more than one occasion, including with her business partner, whose part of the business she was interested in assuming. In addition, the respondent maintains that he began work on the matter, aside from the meetings, two by conference call with Ms. Akojie and Ms. Pi\u00f1ales, he reviewed the public records of the New York LLC, \u201cbegan looking at the terms, amounts owed and began negotiating debt relief on behalf of Ms. Pi\u00f1ales,\u201d reviewed the documentation of the debt Ms. Akojie and Ms. Pi\u00f1ales incurred and reviewed Ms. Akojie\u2019s corporate status in the State of Maryland. Moreover, the respondent asserts that Ms. Akojie acknowledged that he was acting on her behalf. In support, he points to her testimony on cross-examination, in which she admitted that, in January and February, 2010, the respondent was providing her with information and discussing her concerns related to her company and business.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Conceding that the terms of the legal services agreement are what they are, the respondent\u2019s exception to the finding that the partial fee payment was made \u201cin anticipation of future legal services to be rendered by Respondent and that the fee had not yet been earned at the time of its receipt\u201d is based on \u201cother evidence presented at trial which demonstrated that the $2000 had been earned and was not just paid in anticipation of future legal services.\u201d More particularly, he directs our attention to the evidence that the total fee was $3000, of which $2000 was payable \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and that he agreed to continue reviewing the matter pertaining to the New York LLC. Also of significance, the respondent submits, is his testimony concerning his professional experience, the hours he expended on the Akojie matter and his fee charges. According to that testimony, the $2000 fee had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>earned when paid even when discounted or his lowest hourly rate was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Excepting to the finding that \u201c[t]he only documented communications between [the respondent and Ms. Akojie] occurred by electronic mail,\u201d the respondent relies on his testimony at the hearing. More specifically, he points to an email, which sought to determine the availability of Ms. Akojie and Ms. Pi\u00f1ales for a conference call and the record of that conference call.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">As noted, the hearing court found that the respondent did not acknowledge receipt of documents faxed to him on April 27, 2010 until May 14, 2010. The respondent\u2019s exception is that there is no evidence that he received a fax on April 27, 2010 from Ms. Pi\u00f1ales. He supports that assertion with emails, one to Ms. Akojie and Ms. Pi\u00f1ales and another to Ms. Pi\u00f1ales, from him, both post April 27, inquiring about the faxed documents and a fax receipt notification email, also post April 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">To the court\u2019s finding that he did not send written correspondence to any of the creditors and produced no notes or other records reflecting any such communication, the respondent, in excepting, responds that documentary evidence and the testimony of both the respondent and Ms. Akojie belie that finding. The documentary evidence on which the respondent relies consists of the authorizations, which he prepared and forwarded to the creditors. He also claims that Ms. Akojie testified that she had been told by the respondent that he had been in contact with Chase, one of the New York LLC\u2019s creditors and knew that he had been in contact with Citibank, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Because the court\u2019s conclusions of law are drawn from the facts it found, the respondent also excepts to them. Thus, the respondent argues, if his exceptions to the findings of fact are sustained so too would the corresponding exceptions to the conclusions of law. Therefore, for the reason that the $2000 partial fee had been earned when received, he submits that he \u201cwould not be in violation of Rule 1.15(a) or (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>of the Rules of Professional Conduct [and] would not have been in violation of Maryland Rule 16-603, because he would not have been in receipt and acceptance of trust money....\u201d Similarly, MLRPC 1.3 and 1.4(a)(2) would not be sustainable for the reason that \u201c[the respondent] did not acknowledge receipt of the faxes until May 14, 201[0], because that was the day he actually received them, and he communicated with Ms. Akojie via teleconference as well as electronic mail\u201d and documents presented at the hearing and Ms. Akojie\u2019s testimony demonstrate that he communicated with the creditors as required. With regard to MLRPC Rules 1.15(d) and 1.16(d), he asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">\u201c... [The respondent] was not required to remit any funds because he had earned the fees. Ms. Akojie was not entitled to receive any funds at all, however, [the respondent] was aware of her financial situation and chose to refund her money and consider the work on her matter pro bono. [The respondent] should not be found in violation of Rules 1.15(d) and Rule 1.16(d) for not \u2018promptly\u2019 remitting funds that he did not have to remit, but choose to remit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Maryland Rule 16-759(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201c(1) Conclusions of Law. The Court of Appeals shall review de novo the circuit court judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201c(2)Findings of Fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u201c(A) If No Exceptions Are Filed.

If exceptions are filed, the Court of Appeals shall determine whether the findings of fact have been proven by the requisite standard of proof set out in Rule 16-757(b).

Gore, </em>380 Md. 455, 468, 845 A.2d 1204, 1211 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"> As we have seen, the hearing court found that the respondent did not form an attorney client relationship with Ms. Akojie until they executed a legal services agreement, at which time the respondent was paid two-thirds of the agreed-upon fee. That finding was based on the agreement itself,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which expressly stated that the term of the agreement would commence when the agreement was executed and the partial fee was paid. It was also significant to the hearing court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4r\">\u201c[t]he Legal Services Agreement between Ms. Akojie and Respondent contained no provision recognizing that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>portion of the stated fee amount was for any <em>legal </em>services rendered prior to March 9, 2010. Respondent maintained no time sheets or other records of time he claimed to have spent on Ms. Akojie\u2019s matter during the months of January and February 2010.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">From this finding, that the attorney client relationship did not form until March 9, the court made the further finding that the partial fee payment was made in anticipation of future services and not for past legal services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Neither of these findings nor the basis for them is clearly erroneous. To be sure, the respondent testified consistently with an attorney client relationship having been formed prior to March 9, 2010 and there is some testimony by Ms. Akojie that may support his testimony. In addition, referencing his experience, his fee schedule, and the work he maintained he did pursuant to his engagement by Ms. Akojie, he testified that he had already earned the partial fee when it was paid. It is also true that this testimony and any corroborating testimony by Ms. Akojie would support the factual finding that the respondent advocates. It is well settled, however, that the court was not obliged to credit the respondent\u2019s testimony. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 388, 794 A.2d 92, 100 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>288 Md. 341, 363, 420 A.2d 940, 950 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 970, 101 S.Ct. 1492, 67 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). Indeed, we have said that \u201c[t]he hearing judge is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to decide which one to believe.\u201d <em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 390, 794 A.2d at 101. In fact, the hearing judge may \u201cpick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 253, 760 A.2d 1108, 1118 (2000). The court obviously did not credit the respondent\u2019s testimony, opting instead to rely on the more objective legal services agreement, both for the terms it contained, as well as those it did not. Accordingly, these exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Not only are these factual findings not clearly erroneous, they support the conclusions of law drawn from them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>by the hearing court. Therefore, we overrule the respondent\u2019s exceptions to the conclusions of law flowing from these factual findings. We repeat, in that regard, what we said in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Robertson, </em>\u201c[w]hen the factual findings are not clearly erroneous and the conclusions drawn from them are supported by the facts found, exceptions to conclusions of law will be overruled.\u201d 400 Md. 618, 629, 929 A.2d 576, 583 (2007). Because we conclude that there was no attorney client relationship until March 9, 2010, when the legal services agreement was executed, we also conclude, as did the hearing court, that the partial fee payment could not have been earned and necessarily was made in anticipation of future legal service, rendering such payment, at the time it was made, trust funds. Because the respondent did not deposit these funds into an attorney trust account that he was required to, but did not, maintain and, in addition, did not obtain the client\u2019s informed consent to do otherwise, it follows that he violated the charged provisions of the relevant MLRPC Rule: 1.15(a) and (c). By not maintaining a lawyer\u2019s trust account, which is conceded, the respondent also violated Maryland Rule 16-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The factual finding that the $2000 partial fee payment constituted trust funds is dispositive of the respondent\u2019s exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s conclusion of law that he violated MLRPC Rules 1.15(d) and 1.16(d) by not promptly refunding it after his services had been terminated by his client. The sole basis for these exceptions is that the payment did not consist of trust funds because he had already earned the payment before it was made. We rejected that basis when we considered whether an attorney client relationship predated the parties\u2019 legal services agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The next three exceptions by the respondent address findings related to the method the respondent used to communicate with his client, the timeliness of his acknowledgment of faxed documents and whether and how he communicated with creditors of his client in furtherance of the legal undertaking for which he had been retained. They also are to the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>conclusions of law that the hearing court drew from these factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The factual findings made by the hearing court, to which the respondent excepted, were a part of a larger, more general, finding with respect to the diligence with which the respondent pursued his Ghent\u2019s matter and communicated with her to keep her apprised of his progress. Because the gravamen of the Rule 1.3 and 1.4 violations is the failure to act diligently and promptly and to keep the client informed, particularly answering her inquiries timely and promptly, it was critical to the petitioner\u2019s case with regard to those Rules that, having been roused from a sporadic approach to his client\u2019s matter by an email indicating frustration in her attempts to communicate with him about her case to the point that she was contemplating the termination of his services, the respondent set certain goals for the representation and then failed to meet those goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In proving its case, the petitioner presented evidence of the communications between the respondent and his client, specific instances of mis-communication and of the manner in which the respondent interacted and communicated with the client\u2019s creditors in pursuit of the accomplishment of the goal he set. To be sure, the hearing court made factual findings with regard to some of this evidence. With regard to the finding that the only documented communication between the respondent and Ms. Akojie was by electronic mail, we believe that the hearing court may have over-stated or over-emphasized the limited manner in which the respondent communicated with his client, or documented that fact. Accordingly, we sustain his exception to that finding. We likewise are satisfied that the respondent is correct, the documentary evidence demonstrates that the respondent did not receive the faxed authorizations until May 14, even though they were faxed on April 27, and thus that the hearing court\u2019s finding in that regard is clearly erroneous. This exception also is sustained. On the other hand, we overrule his exception to the court\u2019s finding with regard to the respondent\u2019s communications with creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The above factual findings to which the respondent excepted, viewed in context, were more peripheral, rather than central, to larger, more general findings establishing the respondent\u2019s lack of diligence and failure to keep his client adequately informed. Therefore, the fact that the respondent may have communicated with his client in ways other than electronic mail, and may have documented those other methods, does not answer or negate the allegation that, nevertheless, he was not diligent and did not keep his client well informed about her matter. In a similar vein, we do not regard the fact that the respondent really did not receive the faxed documents until the day he acknowledged receiving them as undermining the finding by the hearing court that, in other respects, he failed to act diligently. The respondent\u2019s exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that he violated MLRPC Rules 1.3 and 1.4(a)(2) and (a)(3) are, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Having disposed of the respondent\u2019s exceptions, resulting in the sustaining of the charges lodged against him, we turn to the determination of the appropriate sanction. We do so fully cognizant that the purpose, the goal, of attorney discipline is well settled., \u201cto protect the public, not to punish the erring attorney.\u201d <em>Goff, </em>399 Md. at 30, 922 A.2d at 571, <em>reinstatement granted, </em>400 Md. 97, 928 A.2d 795 (2007). <em>See Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. at 703, 919 A.2d at 677; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We have also made clear that \u201c[t]he severity of the sanction to be applied is measured by the egregiousness of the misconduct under the particular facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Gisriel, </em>409 Md. at 385-86, 974 A.2d at 363, citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 165, 567 A.2d 112, 117 (1989) (\u201cthe extent of the discipline to be applied is generally dependent upon the severity of the misconduct and the particular facts and circumstances surrounding it.\u201d). Other relevant considerations are \u201cthe attorney\u2019s prior grievance history[,] ... the attorney\u2019s remorse for the misconduct, and the likelihood of the conduct being repeated.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Post, </em>379 Md. 60, 71, 839 A.2d 718, 724-25 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The petitioner\u2019s recommendation that the respondent be sanctioned by being indefinitely suspended from the practice of law is based on both the fact that the respondent has been found to have violated multiple Rules of Professional Misconduct, which, according to the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991), \u00a7 9.22(d) is a factor in aggravation, and the nature of those violations, as well as his prior disciplinary history. Of particular significance is the trust account violations, that he did not have and maintain a trust account and, therefore, could, and did, not deposit trust funds into a trust account. The respondent\u2019s lack of diligence in pursuing the client\u2019s matter and in refunding her funds and failure to keep his client informed likewise inform the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Without regard to the respondent\u2019s disciplinary history, the violations in this case, standing alone, are enough to justify an indefinite suspension, the petitioner submits, relying on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Patterson, </em>421 Md. 708, 28 A3d 1196 (2011), reconsideration denied (Oct. 24, 2011). There, in the representation of clients in several cases, Patterson violated numerous Rules of Professional Conduct, including trust account violations under Rules 1.15, 16-606.1, and 16-609(c), not being diligent in the pursuit of his clients\u2019 cases under Rule 1.3, failing to communicate sufficiently with his clients under Rule 1.4(b), and failing to respond to repeated requests by Bar Counsel for information about the cases under Rule 8.1. <em>Patterson, </em>421 Md. at 740, 28 A.3d at 1215. Patterson also failed to take responsibility for his lack of diligence. <em>Id. </em>at 737, 28 A.3d at 1213. His only mitigation was that he suffered from MS, but that, this Court concluded, only partially excused his inaction, and that only with regard to his failure to respond to Bar Counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 743, 28 A.3d 1196, 1216-17. When the reciprocal discipline the respondent received as a result of a negotiated discipline agreement accepted by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is considered, the petitioner asserts, the case for an indefinite suspension is only strengthened.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The respondent recommends that the disciplinary action be dismissed. The recommendation is premised on the success of his exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cIt is obvious from what has been presented in these exceptions that the Court could not find by clear and convincing evidence that no attorney-client relationship existed between Mr. Stillwell and Ms. Akojie; that the $2000 fee paid by Ms. Akojie was in anticipation of future legal services; that the only documented correspondence between Mr. Stillwell and Ms. Akojie was by email; that Mr. Stillwell failed to acknowledge receipt of the authorization letters soon after they were sent. All of these findings of fact by the court were crucial in its decision to find Mr. Stillwell in violation [of the Rules violations]. Since these facts cannot be proven by clear and convincing evidence, this action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>should be dismissed or the court should find that [ ] if these were a technical violation, there should be no sanction in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">As we have seen, we do not agree with the respondent, having overruled, in substantial part, his exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The petitioner is correct, the respondent was charged in this Court, in a reciprocal discipline action, with violating MLRPC 8.4(c) and 1.7(b)(1), as a result of the respondent\u2019s negotiated discipline agreement in the District of Columbia, in which he admitted violating the District of Columbia version of those Rules. Rather than acquiesce in the discipline imposed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, a 60 day suspension, the petitioner, in its answer to the Show Cause Order issued in the case, sought disbarment or, alternatively, an indefinite suspension from the practice of law. Although agreeing with the petitioner that reciprocal discipline was not, under the circumstances, appropriate, but rejecting its sanction recommendation in other respects, we imposed a 6 month suspension. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Stillwell, </em>434 Md. 69, 73 A.3d 243 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The petitioner asserts that the respondent\u2019s violations in the present case rise to the level of the violations found, and sanctioned, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Patterson, </em>421 Md. 708, 28 A.3d 1196 (2011), reconsideration denied (Oct. 24, 2011), and, therefore, that the sanction imposed in that case should also be imposed in this one. Like the respondent in Patterson, the respondent in the present case violated Rules of Professional Conduct involving attorney trust accounts, by failing to exercise diligence in conducting his representation of Ms. Akojie, and by failing to communicate timely with his client. See <em>Patterson, </em>421 Md. at 743, 28 A.3d at 1216-17. We believe, however, that the violations at issue in Patterson were more egregious. The respondent in Patterson, unlike the respondent in the present case, committed each of the aforementioned violations multiple times with multiple clients. See <em>id. </em>He also failed, despite agreeing to do so, to refund all of his client\u2019s funds. See <em>id. </em>at 735-736, 28 A.3d 1196 (concluding that the respondent\u2019s collection of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>unreasonable fee, and his subsequent failure to refund the fee to his client, violated Maryland Rule 1.16(d)). By contrast, the respondent in the present case fully refunded, albeit not expediently, the money tendered by Ms. Akojie as part of the Legal Services Agreement. Furthermore, in <em>Patterson, </em>the respondent was found to have violated MPRC 8.1, which provides, inter alia, that \u201ca lawyer ... in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from ... [a] disciplinary authority[.]\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 738-39, 28 A.3d at 1214. In short, the respondent in <em>Patterson </em>failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel with respect to two separate client complaints. See <em>id. </em>The record shows that the respondent in this case has cooperated fully with Bar Counsel, and provided all information requested to assist in his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">We acknowledge, as the petitioner emphasizes, that \u201cthis case involves multiple violations in the representation of a client, including safekeeping property infractions, but without misappropriation or other dishonest conduct.\u201d In other cases, where the offending attorney has mishandled client funds, but not as the result of dishonest conduct, we have suspended the offending attorney indefinitely with the right to apply for readmission after a period of time. For example, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 872 A.2d 693 (2005), the offending attorney violated several rules of the MLRPC, including MLRPC 1.15, due to employee theft and ineffectual accounting procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 872 A.2d 693, 710. We suspended the respondent in that case indefinitely with the right to apply for readmission after 30 days, noting inter alia the lack of intentionally dishonest conduct on the part of the offending attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 386, 872 A.2d at 720. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 844 A.2d 397 (2004), the respondent was found to have violated, among other Rules, MLRPC 1.15, had been previously sanctioned, and was found to have operated a relatively large negative balance to his client trust account (approximately $40,000), but was not accused of dishonest conduct in relation to his handling of client funds. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 844 A.2d at 405. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that case, we suspended Sperling indefinitely, with the right to apply for readmission after 90 days. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The public interest and legal profession, we have long maintained, is protected by the issuance of a sanction that reflects the importance of fidelity to the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly with respect to the handling of clients funds, diligence, and competence. Based on the facts of the present case, the violations committed, the aggravating and mitigating factors present, and our prior decisions involving similar misconduct, we conclude that the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension from the practice of law in the State of Maryland. The respondent shall have the right to apply for readmission to the practice of law after 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.

To be sure, and to be clear, a written agreement establishing the terms of a lawyers representation is not dispositive of the existence of an attorney client relationship. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Shoup, </em>410 Md. 462, 489, 979 A.2d 120, 136 (2009). Our cases, as the respondent has pointed out, see <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. James, </em>355 Md. 465, 467-77, 735 A.2d 1027, 1033 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 174, 821 A.2d 414, 425 (2003), confirm this point. Whether an attorney-client relationship had been formed and when, is a question of fact, <em>(see e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Coppola, </em>419 Md. 370, 392, 19 A.3d 431, 444 (2011); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

Under that standard, we consider the evidence with \u201cdue regard\u201d for the judge's factual determinations, and \u201cin a light most favorable to the prevailing party[.]\u201d Our review of the judge\u2019s factual findings ceases where there exists substantial evidence in the record to support that judge\u2019s findings. <em>Clickner v.

Nor do we understand the corroborating evidence from Ms. Akojie to be a statement of her belief that such a relationship had been formed. We simply do not accept that it is error to determine that an attorney-client relationship does not exist merely because the record contains contrary evidence. That, however, will be the result if, despite the hearing judge's clear finding, we were to conclude nevertheless that an attorney client relationship had been formed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b302-7\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A37\">concurring, in which CATHELL, J., joins</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Although I concur in the judgment of the Majority, I fear that the Majority opinion could be interpreted as grounds to sanction diligent, rule-abiding, attorneys. Often an attorney is asked to \u201cjump right on\u201d a client\u2019s problem, before execution of a formal retainer agreement, and thereafter will take a portion of the retainer commensurate with the work they have already done. In this case, the hearing court found that no attorney-client relationship was formed until the formal retainer agreement was executed; therefore, it was impermissible for the attorney to allocate a portion of the retainer for work previously done. Most respectfully, I disagree with the Majority\u2019s deference to the hearing court\u2019s conclusion because it inappropriately stresses the importance of a retainer agreement and will discourage attorneys from promptly beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>working on a client\u2019s matter until after the agreement is signed and the retainer paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">As the Majority acknowledges, the hearing judge\u2019s finding that no attorney-client relationship existed prior to the execution of the formal retainer agreement \u201cwas based on the agreement itself.\u201d The hearing judge read the contract, which stated that \u201cthis Agreement will commence as of the date this Agreement has been signed by both Attorney and Client below and Client submits the requested engagement amount.\u201d Then, noting that the agreement \u201ccontained no provision recognizing that any portion of the stated fee amount was for any legal services rendered prior to [executing the retainer,]\u201d dismissed anything that happened before signing the retainer as simply \u201can effort to lay the groundwork for the possible future representation.\u201d In short, the hearing judge read the plain language of the contract, dismissed any contradictory evidence, and found that no relationship was created until the retainer was signed and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">What the hearing judge did, and what the Majority approves, might be viewed as simply applying the parol evidence rule to interpret the contract. The hearing judge found the retainer clear and unambiguous in setting forth the beginning date for the representation; therefore, the judge declined to consider any parol evidence that would contradict the written contract. Although this approach may be appropriate in contractual disputes \u2014 as, for example, a fee dispute between attorney and client \u2014 it falters in the context of an attorney grievance proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">As the Majority acknowledges that, in attorney grievance proceedings, the formal retainer contract does not determine when an attorney-client relationship has been formed. This Court has repeatedly recognized that, in forming an attorney-client relationship, no formal contract or retainer agreement is necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">Although an agreement upon the amount of a retainer and its payment is rather conclusive evidence of the establishment of the attorney-client relationship, the absence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>an agreement or payment does not indicate conclusively that no such relationship exists. Indeed, the payment of fees is not a necessary element in the relationship of attorney and client. The services of an attorney to the client may be rendered gratuitously but the relationship of attorney and client nonetheless exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 173-74, 821 A.2d 414, 424 (2003) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Indeed, our case law is settled on this point: \u201cOur cases make clear that an explicit agreement or payment arrangement is not a prerequisite to the formation of an attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shoup, </em>410 Md. 462, 489, 979 A.2d 120, 136 (2009).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In fact, our Rules of Professional Conduct acknowledge that a written retainer agreement can be provided to the client after the representation has already commenced: \u201cThe scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation[.]\u201d Maryland Lawyers Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Thus, contrary to the contractual interpretation approach taken by the hearing judge, our decisions and Rule 1.5(b) make clear that the determination of an attorney-client relationship is not based on a formal contractual retainer agreement. Rather, we recognize that \u201c[t]he facts and circumstances of each particular case are critical in determining whether an attorney-client relationship exists.\u201d <em>Shoup, </em>410 Md. at 489, 979 A.2d at 135. In setting forth the test for determining when the relationship is formed, we have adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the requirements of the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axy\">A relationship of client and lawyer arises when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">(1) a person manifests to a lawyer the person\u2019s intent that the lawyer provide legal services for the person; and either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">(a) the lawyer manifests to the person consent to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">(b) the lawyer fails to manifest lack of consent to do so, and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide the services; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">(2) a tribunal with power to do so appoints the lawyer to provide the services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-11\"><em>Slump, </em>410 Md. at 490, 979 A.2d at 136 (quoting Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 14 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Thus, the formation of an attorney-client relationship clearly depends on the intent of the parties. This intent must be mutual, and thus calls for a two-part inquiry. One, the client manifests an intent to receive legal services, and, two, the lawyer manifests consent to provide those legal services. According to the Restatement, \u201cThe client\u2019s intent may be manifest from surrounding facts and circumstances, as when the client discusses the possibility of representation with the lawyer and then sends the lawyer relevant papers or a retainer requested by the lawyer.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 14 cmt. c. The Restatement makes clear, however, that, \u201cThe client need not necessarily pay or agree to pay the lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, in explaining the lawyer\u2019s consent, the Restatement explains that the lawyer \u201cmay indicate consent by action, for example by performing services requested by the client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14 cmt. e. In such a case, \u201cthe lawyer\u2019s conduct constitutes implied assent\u201d and \u201ca client-lawyer relationship arises when the [client] reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide services.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Neither the Majority nor the hearing judge ever set forth this test in making their determination that Respondent and Ms. Akojie failed to form an attorney-client relationship prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to executing the retainer agreement. Instead, as the Majority states in its opinion, the hearing court\u2019s finding \u201cwas based on the agreement itself.\u201d This is simply not our test for determining when an attorney-client relationship is formed. In other words, the hearing court was not entitled to rely exclusively on the March retainer agreement. It should have examined the intent of the parties throughout January and February. Failure to do so is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Nonetheless, the hearing court did examine the amount of work that Respondent performed before depositing the money in his personal account (rather than a trust account.) I concur, rather than dissent because, even if an attorney-client relationship existed before January 2010, the hearing court was not clearly erroneous in finding that Respondent had not earned the $2000 at the time he deposited the money. Respondent argues that he worked on the case for six hours in January and for twelve hours in February, and, at his lowest billable hour rate of $250 per hour, Ms. Akojie would have owed him over $4000 at the time he deposited her $2000 check. But, at the same time, Ms. Akojie disputed, in the hearing court, how much work Respondent really did. Outside of two conference calls, Ms. Akojie testified that no work had been done on her case. And, besides these two conference calls, Respondent was unable to substantiate his claims that he did additional work during January and February. Indeed, the hearing court found that Respondent \u201cmaintained no time sheets or other records of time he claimed to have spent on Ms. Akojie\u2019s matter during the months of January and February 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Weighing the evidence and the credibility of witnesses is the role of the hearing court. With Respondent\u2019s failure to provide any tangible proof of the time he worked on Ms. Akojie\u2019s case, I cannot say that the hearing court was clearly erroneous in finding that Respondent had not earned all $2000 at the time he deposited the check into his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In sum, I concur in the judgment of the Majority, but write separately in an attempt to protect future lawyers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>promptly begin working on a client\u2019s matter before executing a formal retainer agreement. I stress that an attorney-client relationship can be formed before signing the retainer agreement, and thus, an attorney can be justified in immediately applying a portion of the after-acquired retainer to pay for work already done. We should not discourage attorneys from promptly beginning work on a client\u2019s matter, even before signing a formal retainer agreement. Based on the hearing court\u2019s findings, and the Majority opinion, however, it would be wise for attorneys to include language, in their retainer agreements, that a portion of the retainer fee can be used to pay for work done prior to the effective date of the retainer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Judge CATHELL authorizes me to state that he agrees with the views set forth in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
