The judicial officer, who in all instances relevant to the matter <em>sub judice </em>is a District Court Commissioner (\u201cCommissioner\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark><em>, </em>has a number of duties at the initial appearance, among which is to comply with the pretrial release provisions of Maryland Rule 4-216. That rule requires the Commissioner to determine whether there was probable cause for the arrest and, if so, whether the defendant should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>be released on his or her own recognizance, on bail, or not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">We are asked in this appeal whether an indigent defendant is entitled to appointed counsel when a Commissioner makes the Rule 4-216 bail determination. We hold, for the reasons that follow, that an indigent defendant is entitled to such representation, under Maryland\u2019s Public Defender statute, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 16-101 through 16-403 of the Criminal Procedure Article (hereafter \u201cPublic Defender Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">This case comes to us from the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granting summary judgment for the Plaintiffs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entering a declaratory judgment, and denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for an injunction to enforce the rights declared. The Plaintiffs sought a declaration that they and the class of indigent persons they represent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> have the right, under the federal and state constitutions and the Public Defender Act, to be represented by the Public Defender at bail hearings, which are conducted as part of the initial appearance before Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>missioners at the Baltimore City Booking and Intake Center (\u201cCentral Booking Jail\u201d). To assist in understanding the parties\u2019 respective arguments and the issues we must decide, we describe at the outset what occurs at the initial appearance before the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The duties of the Commissioner at the initial appearance are governed by Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Rep. Vol., 2010 Supp.), \u00a7 2-607(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d) and Maryland Rules 4-213(a) and 4-216. The Commissioner must inform the defendant of the charge and allowable penalties; provide the defendant a copy of the statement of charges, if the defendant does not have one and one is available; advise the defendant of the right to counsel; advise the defendant, when it is relevant, of the right to a preliminary hearing; and comply with the pretrial release provisions of Rule 4-216. Md. Rule 4-213(a); <em>see </em>C.J. \u00a7 2-607(c)(l)-(2). The pretrial release provisions of Rule 4-216 require the Commissioner, in those instances when the defendant has been arrested without a warrant, to determine whether the arrest was supported by probable cause. If the arrest was not supported by probable cause, then the Commissioner \u201cshall release the defendant on personal recognizance, with no other conditions of release.\u201d Md. Rule 4-216(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Of particular relevance to this case is what follows if the Commissioner determines that the arrest was supported by probable cause. In that instance, the Commissioner must comply with the provisions of Rule 4-216(d). That subsection of the Rule requires the Commissioner to determine whether the defendant is eligible to be, and should be, released on his or her recognizance or whether the case requires bail, pending trial. In that process, the Commissioner considers a number of factors that are set forth in Rule 4-216(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the Commissioner \u201cdetermines that the defendant should be released other than on personal recognizance without any additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>conditions imposed,\u201d then the Commissioner \u201cshall impose on the defendant the least onerous condition or combination of conditions of release set out in section (e) ... that will reasonably\u201d: \u201censure the appearance of the defendant as required\u201d; \u201cprotect the safety of the alleged victim\u201d; and \u201censure that the defendant will not pose a danger to another person or to the community.\u201d Rule 4 \u2014 216(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Rule 4-216(d)(4) further requires the Commissioner to \u201cadvise the defendant in writing or on the record of the conditions of release imposed and of the consequences of a violation of any condition.\u201d In addition, \u201c[w]hen bail is required, the judicial officer shall state in writing or on the record the amount and any terms of the bail.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The initial appearance before a Commissioner in Baltimore City is not conducted in a courtroom. According to the Plaintiffs, the initial appearance is not open to the public and is not recorded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Plaintiffs report that the event takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>place in a \u201ctiny narrow booth\u201d at Central Booking Jail. A plexiglass wall separates the arrestee and the Commissioner, and the two communicate through a speaker system. According to the Plaintiffs, \u201cpublic defenders never are present\u201d at the initial appearance, notwithstanding that many arrestees are indigent. The Plaintiffs report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">Theoretically, private lawyers may participate, but, in practice, security concerns, lack of personnel for escorts, cramped quarters, and procedural issues at Central Booking make private representation rare. In contrast, by Rule and by practice, the commissioner may receive <em>ex parte </em>recommendations for bail from the State\u2019s Attorney, without any public record of such contact. The State\u2019s Attorney staffs a 24-hour war room in Central Booking for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The Plaintiffs further report that, because the initial hearings are \u201cnot open to the public ... [and are] not transcribed or recorded,\u201d \u201cit [is] impossible to review what a Commissioner or arrestee said or to understand the basis for the ruling.\u201d Moreover, Commissioners \u201care not required to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings and thus do not.\u201d When commissioners \u201cask about residence, employment, family, community ties, prior record, and, frequently, the charges[,] ... [a]rrestees are expected to answer. Most do, not knowing that the information may be recorded in a closed envelope for use against them by judges and prosecutors. They are not informed whether a prosecutor has <em>ex parte </em>contact with a commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Whenever the Commissioner does not release a defendant following the initial appearance, the defendant is presented to a District Court judge for a bail review hearing \u201cimmediately ... if the court is then in session, or if not, at the next session <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>of the court.\u201d Md. Rule 4 \u2014 216(f). The Plaintiffs also inform us that, when a warrant is served with a \u201cpreset\u201d bail issued after a defendant fails to appear in violation of a summons, the Commissioner \u201ctypically declines to modify the bail previously set <em>in absentia </em>or to consider the defendant\u2019s explanation for the [Failure to Appear].\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[t]hat bail remains in effect until a bail review hearing, where most judges defer to a colleague\u2019s preset amount.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\n<em>The Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On November 13, 2006, the Plaintiffs filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a class action complaint (later amended) seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. They sought a declaratory judgment that: (1) the initial bail hearing before the Commissioner is a stage of the criminal proceeding, entitling them to representation under \u00a7 16-204(b)(2) of the Public Defender Act, which states that \u201c[representation shall be provided ... in all stages of a proceeding listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>], including, in criminal proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ings, custody, interrogation, preliminary hearing, arraignment, trial, and appeal\u201d; (2) they are entitled to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because the initial bail hearing is an adversary proceeding and/or a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of a criminal prosecution, as that phrase is understood in Sixth Amendment parlance<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; (3) the initial bail hearing implicates the Plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental right to liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; and (4) they were denied their right to counsel. The Plaintiffs also sought an injunction enjoining the Defendants from violating the Plaintiffs\u2019 right to representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tion by the Office of the Public Defender at initial bail hearings in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Each named Plaintiff<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was arrested for a crime that qualifies as a \u201cserious offense,\u201d as that term is defined in the Public Defender Statute, \u00a7 16 \u2014 101 (h)(1) \u2014 (4).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Each Plaintiff was detained at the Central Booking Jail and, without counsel present, was brought before a Commissioner for the purpose of determining eligibility for pretrial release. Each Plaintiff informed the Commissioner that he or she could not afford an attorney and requested an attorney to represent him or her at the initial appearance. On each occasion, the Commissioner refused to appoint an attorney and, ultimately, set bail for the Plaintiff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Plaintiffs named as defendants the District Court of Maryland; the Chief Judge of the District Court of Maryland, the Coordinator of Commissioner Activity for the Maryland District Court Commissioners; the Administrative Judge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the District Court for Baltimore City; the Administrative Commissioner for Baltimore City; and the Commissioners of the District Court in Baltimore City, individually and collectively in their official capacities as District Court Commissioners. The parties later agreed that the District Court should be dismissed from the case because it was not a proper party.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After a hearing on the motions, at which the Circuit Court certified the class, the court issued a written order granting summary judgment in favor of the District Court Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The Plaintiffs noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While the case was pending in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari on our initiative. <em>Richmond, v. Dist. Court, </em>405 Md. 348, 952 A.2d 224 (2008). Subsequent to briefing and oral argument, we vacated the order of the Circuit Court and remanded the case with the direction that it be dismissed if the Plaintiffs failed to amend their complaint to assert claims against the Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">On remand, the Circuit Court conditionally denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 petition to certify the class and ordered dismissal of the complaint if the Public Defender was not joined as a defendant. The Plaintiffs amended the complaint to add the Public Defender as a defendant. The Public Defender filed a response to the cross-motions for summary judgment, originally filed in 2007. He argued that the Plaintiffs had \u201cvery strong constitutional and statutory claims,\u201d but the court should not order representation absent funding, and he asked the court to use its discretion to deny declaratory relief or to: (1) order a 6-to-9-month stay for an intergovernmental group to develop solutions; (2) bifurcate the case to add a remedy stage, at which the court could join \u201cadditional parties, including political actors\u201d responsible for funding or exercise its \u201cinherent power\u201d to compel funding; (3) issue an injunction with \u201creform guidelines\u201d; or (4) delay relief until funding is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The District Court Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the amended complaint failed to seek \u201ccoercive relief\u2019 from the Public Defender. At a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the motion to dismiss, the Circuit Court recertified the class and invited the Plaintiffs to amend their complaint orally, to add claims for relief against the Public Defender. The Plaintiffs did so, following which the court stated that it would regard the District Court Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The court then invited the Public Defender to address his response to the cross-motions for summary judgment. The Public Defender argued that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the Due Process Clause and the Public Defender Act \u201care well taken.\u201d He argued nevertheless that the court should defer ruling on the merits of the claims, to give him the time to resolve budgetary constraints that made it impracticable for the Public Defender\u2019s Office to provide counsel at the appearance before the Commissioner, while providing \u201cresponsible representation ... when it really matters,\u201d at trial and other critical stages of criminal proceedings. The hearing ended with the court informing the parties that it intended to issue a written decision. The court granted the parties leave to file post-hearing memoranda and advised them to \u201cassume for the purposes of our understanding that the Court does find that the appearance before a judicial officer, i.e., the commissioner, initiates the adversarial responsibility of the right to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Plaintiffs thereafter formally amended their complaint and filed a renewed (and amended) motion for summary judgment. The amended complaint sought additional injunctive relief from the Public Defender, specifically requesting the court to \u201c[e]nter[ ] an affirmative injunction directing the Public Defender to assign the district public defender for Baltimore City, an attorney from the district Office of the Public Defender for Baltimore City, or a panel attorney to represent indigent defendants at initial bail hearings and thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">On September 30, 2010, the Circuit Court issued an Order and accompanying Memorandum and Opinion, ruling that presentment to a Commissioner is a critical stage of a criminal prosecution and therefore indigent arrestees in Baltimore City have a right under the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>represented by appointed counsel. The court cited as support for that ruling <em>Rothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 </em>U.S. 191, 128 S.Ct. 2578, 171 L.Ed.2d 366 (2008), which was decided after the initial proceedings in the Circuit Court. The court further ruled that the Plaintiffs were entitled to counsel under the Public Defender Act, noting that the duty of representation under the Act extends beyond the requirements of the Sixth Amendment. Finally, the court ruled that, \u201cby denying Plaintiffs and those similarly situated any representation at the initial bail hearing, Defendants violated Plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights.\u201d Based on those rulings, the Circuit Court denied the District Court Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (treating it as a motion for summary judgment) and granted the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court issued an order staying the decision pending appellate review. Both the Public Defender and the District Court Defendants noted timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The District Court Defendants thereafter filed a motion requesting the court to enter clarifying orders, as no declaratory judgment had been entered and the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief had not been decided. The Public Defender responded to that motion, agreeing that a separate order setting forth the terms of the court\u2019s declaratory judgment \u201cseems appropriate.\u201d The Public Defender disagreed, however, that the court should enter an order specifying the terms of any injunctive relief, and he asserted that the Plaintiffs should be deemed to have abandoned their claims for such relief. By Order dated December 28, 2010, the Circuit Court granted the Plaintiffs declaratory relief in conformance with its earlier Memorandum and Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">By separate Order of the same date, the Circuit Court denied without prejudice the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief. The Plaintiffs then sent correspondence to the Circuit Court, requesting the court to amend the order denying injunctive relief \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d as the order might not constitute a \u201cfinal\u201d order for purposes of appellate review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The Plaintiffs submitted two proposed orders, one awarding them the injunctive relief they requested and the other denying it. The Plaintiffs advised the court that they \u201cdo not object to denial of their request for injunctive relief at this time,\u201d but they asked the court to include in its order denying relief a proviso stating that, \u201c[t]o the extent Plaintiffs may require injunctive relief in the future,\u201d they could seek that relief in subsequent proceedings by making a supplementary petition, under C.J. \u00a7 3-412 <footnotemark>16</footnotemark>. In that letter, the Plaintiffs also asserted that the denial of injunctive relief would not erect a <em>res judicata </em>bar and C.J. \u00a7 3-412 expressly allows further relief based on a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The District Court Defendants did not oppose the modification of the Order denying injunctive relief, but opposed the Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed proviso. They asserted that the additional language would create the impression that the parties contemplated further action in the Circuit Court and, therefore, there would be no final judgment. The District Court Defendants also took the position that <em>res judicata </em>would apply to future requests for injunctive relief. According to the Defendants, although declaratory judgment actions are an exception to traditional <em>res judicata </em>principles, the exception does not apply where the declaratory judgment action additionally sought injunctive relief. The Public Defender did not oppose amending the order to deny injunctive relief outright, noting that the Plaintiffs \u201cwould then have the option to seek further relief, if necessary, under [C.J.] \u00a7 3^12 at a later time if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Defendants were to fail to comply with the declarations after appeals are resolved and the stay is lifted.\u201d The Circuit Court issued an Amended Order entered February 25, 2011, denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief, and omitting the proviso requested by the Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The District Court Defendants filed another timely notice of appeal to \u201cremove any uncertainty about whether the notice they filed on November 1, 2010, is effective in light of the Court\u2019s later revisions.\u201d The Public Defender then filed his own timely Renewed Notice of Appeal. The Plaintiffs, in turn, filed a timely Notice of Cross-Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Plaintiffs then filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari seeking this Court\u2019s consideration of the judgment prior to review by the Court of Special Appeals. The Plaintiffs presented the following questions for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">1. Do indigent defendants have a right to counsel at initial bail hearings before district court commissioners under Maryland\u2019s Public Defender Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">2. Do indigent defendants have a right to counsel at initial bail hearings under the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">3. Do indigent defendants have a right to counsel at initial bail hearings under Maryland or federal guarantees of due process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">4. Even if no right to counsel exists under Issues 1 through 3, do indigent defendants have a due process right to counsel at initial bail hearings when commissioners impose bail \u201cpreset\u201d by the district court <em>in absentia?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">5. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion by granting the Class declaratory relief in accord with its findings that defendants are violating the Class\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">6. Does the circuit court\u2019s denial of [the Plaintiffs\u2019] request for an injunction establish a <em>res judicata </em>bar against a future request to enjoin future violations to effectuate the court\u2019s declaratory judgment, and, if so, did the court err, either by denying the injunction request without reserving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>[the Plaintiffs\u2019] right to seek injunctive relief in the future or by failing to order an injunction that would be stayed pending appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The Public Defender filed a Conditional Cross-Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, presenting the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">In light of the uncontested facts presented by the Public Defender that providing counsel at initial bail hearings would render the Office of the Public Defender unable, within its currently available resources, to provide representation at these proceedings while still meeting its obligation to provide effective, competent, and diligent representation to indigent defendants, did the circuit court err in issuing the declaration without in any way addressing remedy and how this undisputed funding shortfall might be practicably addressed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We granted certiorari to address these important questions. <em>DeWolfe v. Richmond, </em>420 Md. 81, 21 A.3d 1063 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first question presented by the Plaintiffs and hold that they enjoy a right under the Public Defender Act to be represented at any bail hearing conducted before a Commissioner. We need not and therefore do not address the federal and state constitutional claims presented by the Plaintiffs\u2019 second, third and fourth questions. <em>See McCarter v. State, </em>363 Md. 705, 712, 770 A.2d 195, 199 (2001) (stating that \u201cthis Court adheres to the \u2018established principle that a court will not decide a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Baltimore Sun Co. v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 653, 659, 755 A.2d 1130, 1133-34 (2000) (citation omitted)). We further hold, in answer to the Plaintiffs\u2019 fifth question, that the Circuit Court did not err in declaring the Plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to representation of appointed counsel at the bail hearing before a Commissioner. As for the related question presented by the Public Defender\u2019s cross-petition, we hold that the Circuit Court did not err in issuing its declaration without consideration of the costs attendant to the rights declared. Finally, in answer to the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>of the Plaintiffs\u2019 questions, we hold that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief does not erect a <em>res judicata </em>bar to the Plaintiffs\u2019 seeking future injunctive relief, as may be necessary to enforce the right to counsel declared by the Circuit Court in its December 2010 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">A. <em>Right to Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We have said on more than one occasion that the right to counsel provided under the Public Defender Act is broader in scope than that granted under the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See McCarter, </em>363 Md. at 713-14, 770 A.2d at 200, and cases cited therein. Section 16-204 of the Act outlines the scope of representation by the Public Defender and lists in subsection (b) the \u201cProceedings for which representation shall be provided.\u201d Subsection (b)(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Indigent defendants or parties shall be provided representation under this title in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">(i) a criminal or juvenile proceeding in which a defendant or party is alleged to have committed a serious offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">(ii) a criminal or juvenile proceeding in which an attorney is constitutionally required to be present prior to presentment being made before a commissioner or judge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">(iii) a postconvietion proceeding for which the defendant has a right to an attorney under Title 7 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">(iv) any other proceeding in which confinement under a judicial commitment of an individual in a public or private institution may result;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">(v) a proceeding involving children in need of assistance under \u00a7 3-813 of the Courts Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(vi) a family law proceeding under Title 5, Subtitle 3, Part II or Part III of the Family Law Article ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Subsection 16 \u2014 204(b)(2) in turn provides: \u201cRepresentation shall be provided to an indigent individual in all stages of a proceeding listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection, including, in criminal proceedings, custody, interrogation, preliminary hearing, arraignment, trial, and appeal.\u201d The Circuit Court agreed with the Plaintiffs and the Public Defender that, by its plain language, \u00a7 16-204(b) mandates public defender representation at the bail hearing that occurs as part of the initial appearance before a Commissioner. The District Court Defendants counter, as they did in the Circuit Court, that the Public Defender Act does not include within its mandate representation at the initial appearance before a Commissioner. They urge a construction of the Act, and \u00a7 16-204(b) in particular, that depends largely on an examination of the historical roots of the Act\u2019s enactment, the \u201cnearly contemporaneous! ] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 establishment of the District Court,\u201d and the promulgation of pertinent Rules of Procedure \u201cgoverning post-arrest and pre-trial procedures.\u201d The District Court Defendants assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">The statute, the rules, and the District Court were part of an overarching design to ensure that Maryland practice conformed to constitutional requirements, to ensure that arrestees received prompt probable-cause determinations, to facilitate the appointment of counsel in advance of critical stages of the proceedings, such as a preliminary hearing or trial in the District Court, and to encourage the entry of counsel early in circuit court proceedings, thus avoiding delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The District Court Defendants contend that the Act cannot be divorced from its constitutional underpinnings, which in their view demonstrate that the initial bail hearing is not a critical stage for Sixth Amendment purposes; consequently, the Plaintiffs have no right under the Act to public defender representation at the initial bail hearing. In further support of that argument, the District Court Defendants point to Maryland Rule 4-214(b), which they believe reflects the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>stitutionally-based foundations of the Act. That rule provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">Extent of duty of appointed counsel. When counsel is appointed by the Public Defender or by the court, representation extends to all stages in the proceedings, including but not limited to custody, interrogations, prehminary hearing, pretrial motions and hearings, trial, motions for modification or review of sentence or new trial, and appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The District Court Defendants assert that, despite the language of \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b) of the Act extending representation to \u201call stages of a proceeding,\u201d Rule 4-214(b) does not extend as far. They ask us to read the Act and its legislative history in conjunction with Rule 4-214(b) and its history. The District Court Defendants urge that the history supports their argument because \u201c[t]he impetus for enactment of the legislation establishing Maryland\u2019s statewide public defender system was the Supreme Court\u2019s extension of the right to counsel at a preliminary hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They rely, too, on unsuccessful efforts over the years to amend the statutory language to provide expressly for representation at bail hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The Plaintiffs urge a far different interpretation of \u00a7 16-204(b). They argue that, by its plain language, the statute dictates the outcome here: indigent defendants are entitled to public defender representation at \u201call stages\u201d of the proceedings, and \u201call means all.\u201d The Plaintiffs direct our attention to subsections \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b)(l)(i) and (iv). They claim entitlement to public defender representation under either (b)(l)(i), because they have been charged with a \u201cserious offense\u201d as that term is defined in the Act, <em>see </em>\u00a7 16 \u2014 101 (h)(1) \u2014 (4), or under (b)(l)(iv), because they are at risk of possible incarceration in a public institution such as the Central Booking Jail. The Plaintiffs then posit that the only remaining question concerns, in their words, \u201cwhether bail is a covered \u2018stage\u2019 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00a7 16-204(b)(2) such that representation must be provided at that stage.\u201d They answer that question by directing us to the plain language of the subsection itself, which states that representation is to be provided at <em>\u201call stages of a proceeding listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection, </em>including, in criminal proceedings, <em>custody, </em>interrogation, preliminary hearing, arraignment, trial, and appeal.\u201d (Alteration by the Plaintiffs.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The Plaintiffs urge, moreover, a view of the legislative history of the Act that varies significantly from that of the District Court Defendants. The Plaintiffs cite the purposes announced in the Act, to <em>\u201cassure the effective assistance and continuity of counsel to indigent accused individuals taken into custody and indigent individuals in criminal and juvenile proceedings before the courts of the State.\u201d </em>\u00a7 16-201(2) (alteration by the Plaintiffs). The Plaintiffs further assert that the Act was drawn from a Montgomery County ordinance, which provided counsel at bail hearings; therefore, when the General Assembly enacted \u00a7 16-204(b), it was well aware of what \u201call stages of a proceeding\u201d would encompass.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We conclude that the Plaintiffs have the better part of the argument. It is plain to us, as it was to the Circuit Court and is to the Public Defender himself, that the relevant language of the Act is unambiguous and dictates the outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In construing the extent of the Plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement under \u00a7 16-204(b), we do not write on a clean slate. We have addressed on a number of occasions the applicability <em>vel non </em>of that subsection. One of the first opportunities came when we were asked in <em>Webster v. State, </em>299 Md. 581, 474 A.2d 1805 (1984), to decide, among other issues, whether the Act, then codified at Article 27A, entitles an indigent arrestee to appointed counsel at a pre-indictment lineup. We noted at the outset of our1 discussion on the subject: \u201cIt is clear that legal representation by the Public Defender is not limited to those proceedings in which the Sixth Amendment demands the assistance of counsel: the statute contemplates such represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>tation in certain areas beyond the reach of that guarantee.\u201d Id. at 603, 474 A.2d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We recognized that a lineup that takes place before formal accusation, though not a \u201ccritical stage\u201d under the Sixth Amendment, \u201cis nevertheless a critical stage for the suspect, who, of course, is in custody at the time.\u201d Id. at 603-04, 474 A.2d at 1317. Therefore, notwithstanding that a lineup that occurs before formal accusation \u201cis not encompassed within the types of cases designated in [former] \u00a7 4(b) as calling for the assistance of the Public Defender,\u201d \u201csuch a confrontation, arranged by the police, at which a suspect is exhibited in order to obtain evidence that he is the criminal agent, is within the ambit of the Public Defender statute.\u201d Id. at 604, 474 A.2d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We discussed <em>Webster </em>in <em>Harris v. State, </em>344 Md. 497, 511\u201412, 687 A.2d 970, 977, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1017, 118 S.Ct. 605, 139 L.Ed.2d 492 (1997). <em>Harris </em>involved whether a court could <em>appoint </em>standby counsel from the Office of the Public Defender for a <em>pro se </em>defendant who validly had waived his right to counsel. Although we decided that the Act did not provide for public defender representation in such a role, we did not depart from our prior understanding that the Act reached beyond the demands of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 687 A.2d at 971. We noted in <em>Harris </em>that we had been \u201cpersuaded [in <em>Webster </em>] by the fact that the policy of the Public Defender statute \u2018was not only \u201cto provide for the realization of the constitutional guarantees of counsel in the representation of indigents ... in criminal and juvenile proceedings within the State ...\u201d but also \u201cto assure effective assistance and continuity of counsel to indigent accused taken into custody and indigent defendants in criminal and juvenile proceedings before the courts of the State of Maryland <em>Id. </em>at 512, 687 A.2d at 977 (quoting <em>Webster, </em>299 Md. at 603, 474 A.2d at 1316 (quoting former Art. 27A \u00a7 1, now \u00a7 16-201 of the Act)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Subsequently, in <em>State v. Flansburg, </em>345 Md. 694, 697, 694 A.2d 462, 463-64 (1997), we were asked to decide whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>indigent defendant is entitled to representation by the Public Defender when filing a motion to modify a sentence that was imposed at a probation revocation proceeding. We observed, as we had in <em>Webster, </em>that \u201cthe right to counsel under the Public Defender Act is significantly broader than the constitutional right to counsel.\u201d <em>Flansburg, </em>345 Md. at 700, 694 A.2d at 465. We noted that probation revocation proceedings are civil proceedings, and we reasoned that they came within the ambit of what was formerly Article 27A, \u00a7 4(b)(4), now \u00a7 16-204(b)(l)(iv) of the Act, because those proceedings could result in incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 700 n. 5, 700, 694 A.2d at 465 n. 5, 465. We further reasoned that a motion to modify a sentence imposed at a probation revocation proceeding is a \u201cstage\u201d of that proceeding, entitling the defendant to public defender representation under then Article 27A, \u00a7 4(d), now \u00a7 16-204(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 702, 694 A.2d at 466. We therefore held that Flansburg was entitled to have Public Defender representation in filing the motion to modify the sentence that had been imposed at the probation revocation proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 703, 694 A.2d at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Most recently, we decided <em>McCarter. </em>We considered in that case whether \u201ca defendant has a right to counsel at an initial appearance, under Maryland Rule 4-213(c), at which time the defendant purported to waive his right to a jury trial.\u201d 363 Md. at 707, 770 A.2d at 196. We held that the Public Defender Act bestows such a right to counsel at the proceeding, and, consequently, the trial court erred when it accepted at that proceeding McCarter\u2019s purported waiver of his right to a jury trial, without the benefit of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 713, 770 A.2d at 199-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In so holding, we undertook the same analysis of the Public Defender Act as we had done in <em>Webster </em>and <em>Flansburg. </em>We restated at the outset what by then was a settled proposition of law: \u201c[T]he right to counsel under the Public Defender Act is significantly broader than the constitutional right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713-14, 770 A.2d at 200 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We reasoned that a Rule 4-213(c) initial appearance is a \u201cstage\u201d of the proceeding; <em>id. </em>at 715-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>16, 770 A.2d at 201; representation under the Public Defender Act \u201cextends to all stages in the proceedings\u201d; and \u201c \u2018[a]ll\u2019 means \u2018all\u2019\u201d; <em>id. </em>at 716, 770 A.2d at 201 (quoting former Article 27A, \u00a7 4(d)). We went so far as to state: \u201cThe specific types of proceedings listed in the statute ... are for purposes of illustration only.\u201d <em>Id., </em>770 A.2d at 201.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>McCarter, </em>much like <em>Webster </em>and <em>Flansburg </em>preceding it, directs us to the proper disposition of the present case. The parties agree, and we concur, that the initial appearance before a Commissioner in Maryland is an event that marks the beginning of the formal criminal adversarial process. Indeed, the Supreme Court has confirmed that \u201c[a] criminal defendant\u2019s initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charge against him and <em>his liberty is subject to restriction, </em>marks the start of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d <em>Rothgery v. Gillespie County, </em>554 U.S. at 213, 128 S.Ct. 2578 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The initial appearance before the Commissioner \u2014 including the bad hearing that is part of that event \u2014 is clearly encompassed within a \u201ccriminal proceeding,\u201d and may result in the defendant\u2019s incarceration. The only remaining question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>whether the bail determination is a \u201cstage\u201d of that proceeding. Doubtless it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">We detailed at the outset of this opinion the process by which the Commissioner must determine, by reference to a number of fact-laden considerations listed in Rule 4-216(d), whether the defendant is to be released on his or her own recognizance or incarcerated until further consideration by a District Court judge at a subsequent bail review hearing. <em>See </em>Rules 4-213(a), 4-216. The presence of counsel for that determination surely can be of assistance to the defendant in that process. We are informed by the Plaintiffs that \u201c[ujnrepresented suspects are more likely to have more perfunctory hearings, less likely to be released on recognizance, more likely to have higher and unaffordable bail, and more likely to serve longer detentions or to pay the expense of a bail bondsman\u2019s non-refundable 10% fee to regain their freedom.\u201d The Plaintiffs also note that an unrepresented person, in an effort to obtain release, could make incriminating statements to the Commissioner.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">That a defendant <em>might </em>have bail reduced or eliminated by a District Court judge at a subsequent bail review hearing does not dispel or even mitigate the fact that, whenever a Commissioner determines to set bail, the defendant stands a good chance of losing his or her liberty, even if only for a brief time. Furthermore, the likelihood that the Commissioner will give full and fair consideration to all facts relevant to the bail determination can only be enhanced by the presence of counsel. <em>See </em>Abell Pretrial Release Project Report at iii (finding that \u201cmost judicial officers decide whether to order release on recognizance or a financial bail without having essential infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>mation about the person\u2019s employment status, family and community ties, and ability to afford bail\u201d). We cannot overlook, moreover, the evidence in the record that the Commissioner\u2019s initial bail decision often is not disturbed by the District Court judge on bail review. <em>See id. </em>at 32 (finding that, at bail review, District Court judges in the sample group maintained prior bail conditions in roughly half the cases, released only 25% of detainees on personal recognizance, and lowered bail for only one in four individuals (27%)).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Whenever the Commissioner\u2019s bail decision is left standing, the defendant will remain incarcerated for weeks, if not many months, before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The District Court Defendants assert that Rule 4-214 informs, better than does the plain language of the Act, the stages at which the right to counsel applies. Rule 4-214(b) provides that, \u201c[w]hen counsel is appointed by the Public Defender or by the court, <em>representation extends to all stages in the proceedings, including but not limited to </em>custody, interrogations, preliminary hearing, pretrial motions and hearings, trial, motions for modification of review of sentence or new trial, and appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We see no conflict between Rule 4-214(b) and \u00a7 16-204(b). Both provisions extend representation to \u201call stages,\u201d though each provides a different exemplary list, which, as stated in Rule 4-214(b), is not exclusive.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">For all these reasons, we hold that the bail-hearing portion of the initial appearance before the Commissioner is a \u201cstage\u201d of the criminal proceeding, as that term is employed in \u00a7 16-204(b)(2) of the Public Defender Act. Because public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>defender representation is to be afforded \u201cin all stages of a proceeding listed in paragraph [ (b) ](!),\u201d and we have determined that the bail hearing is a stage of a \u201ccriminal ... proceeding\u201d enumerated at (b)(l)(i), it follows that indigent defendants charged with \u201cserious offense[s],\u201d as that term is defined in the Act, are entitled to appointed counsel at the bail hearing. This conclusion is fully in keeping with our prior decisions in <em>Webster, Flansbwrg, </em>and <em>McCarter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We further hold that indigent defendants who are not charged with a serious offense, and therefore do not come within the ambit of \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b)(l)(i), do come within the reach of \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b)(l)(iv), because the bail hearing at the initial appearance for the non-serious offense might result in incarceration. Subsection (b)(l)(iv) provides public defender representation for indigent persons at \u201cany other proceeding in which confinement under a judicial commitment of an individual in a public or private institution may result.\u201d As the District Court Defendants note, \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b)(1)(iv) applies to civil commitments and civil contempt proceedings. <em>See Flansburg, </em>345 Md. at 700, 700 n. 5, 694 A.2d at 465, 465 n. 5. Still, to our knowledge, we never have suggested that \u00a7 16-204(b)(l)(iv) is limited to those proceedings. It would be nonsensical, and contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 16-204(b)(l)(iv), to construe that provision as <em>excluding </em>indigent persons who are not charged with a serious offense \u2014 and so not within subsection (b)(l)(i) \u2014 yet nonetheless face at the bail hearing the (albeit unlikely) possibility of a no-bail disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Finally, given our holding that \u00a7 16-204(b) of the Public Defender Act is plain, there is no cause to delve into its legislative history. The first principle of statutory construction is that the legislative purpose is to be ascertained, if possible, from the plain language of the statute at issue. <em>Guttman v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>421 Md. 227, 234-35, 26 A.3d 856, 860 (2011). If the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, then our role in determining the legislative purpose ends. <em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 26 A.3d at 860. Moreover, though we may, but need not, point to the legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>as confirmation of the purpose expressed through the statute\u2019s plain language, we may <em>not </em>undertake a search of a plainly written statute\u2019s legislative history to seek out evidence of a contrary intent by the General Assembly. <em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 26 A.3d at 860. We shall not violate this rule of statutory construction by investigating the legislative history of the Public Defender Act in an effort to uncover aspects of that history that <em>might </em>(at least in the view of the District Court Defendants) suggest a legislative intent that is contrary to the Act\u2019s plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In sum, indigent defendants are entitled, under \u00a7 16-204(b) of the Public Defender Act, to public defender representation at the bail-hearing portion of the initial appearance before a Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">B. <em>Declaratory Judgment Without Court-Fashioned Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We have noted the Public Defender\u2019s agreement with the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cforceful, meritorious constitutional and statutory claims that they have a right to counsel at their Rule 4-213(a) initial bail hearings before a District Court Commissioner.\u201d Consequently, the Public Defender does not challenge the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that the Public Defender Act mandates representation of indigent defendants at the bail-hearing portion of the initial appearance before the Commissioner. The Public Defender asserts, however, that the Circuit Court nonetheless erred by declaring the Plaintiffs\u2019 right to counsel without addressing the practical concerns regarding implementation. That failure, the Public Defender asserts, constitutes \u201can obvious error in the application of the principles of equity\u201d and is not entitled to any deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The Plaintiffs disagree and assert that the Circuit Court had the duty to declare their rights, but no corresponding duty to craft a remedy for implementation. To the contrary, the Plaintiffs assert, the court would have abused its discretion had it declined to declare their right to counsel at initial bail hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201c[I]t has long been held that a person whose rights are affected by a statute may obtain a declaration of his rights and status.\u201d <em>Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., Inc., </em>272 Md. 15, 25, 320 A.2d 266, 272 (1974) (citing <em>Pressman v. D'Alesandro, </em>211 Md. 50, 54, 125 A.2d 35, 37 (1956)). Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 3-409 provides, with limited exception not applicable here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 ... a court may grant a declaratory judgment or decree in a civil case, if it will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding, and if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">(1) An actual controversy exists between contending parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">(2) Antagonistic claims are present between the parties involved which indicate imminent and inevitable litigation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">(3) A party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege and this is challenged or denied by an adversary party, who also has or asserts a concrete interest in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">We have held consistently that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay4\">when a declaratory judgment action is brought and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, \u201cthe court must enter a declaratory judgment, defining the rights and obligations of the parties or the status of the thing in controversy,\u201d and that judgment must be in writing and in a separate document. That requirement is applicable even if the action is not decided in favor of the party seeking the declaratory judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\"><em>Lovell Land, Inc. v. State Highway Admin., </em>408 Md. 242, 256, 969 A.2d 284, 292 (2009) (quoting <em>Allstate v. State Farm, </em>363 Md. 106, 117 n. 1, 767 A.2d 831, 837 n. 1 (2001)) (citation omitted). The crucial question is whether the action is appropriate for declaratory judgment, that is, whether the declaratory judgment would terminate the controversy and whether there are actual, concrete, and adverse claims or interests, as provided by C.J. \u00a7 3-409. We never have held that declaratory judgment is inappropriate because a party may incur a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>consequential, albeit substantial burden, particularly under the circumstances here, where the statutory right to counsel is at issue in a class action suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Moreover, the budgetary concerns of the Public Defender never have played a role in Maryland appellate decisions involving defendants\u2019 statutory right to counsel. <em>See, e.g., Webster, </em>299 Md. at 623, 474 A.2d at 1327 (recognizing a right to counsel under the Public Defender Act at lineups conducted before the initiation of adversary proceedings, although the issue was not decided by the lower courts or briefed in the Court of Appeals, without mentioning the fiscal practicability of implementation). As Judge Alan Wilner explained, writing then for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Baldwin v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 538, 555, 444 A.2d 1058, 1069 (1982), \u201cit goes without saying that reductions in the Public Defender\u2019s budget and his desire to be frugal have no relevance whatever in the matter\u201d of whether a defendant qualified as \u201cindigent\u201d under the Public Defender statute. Judge Wilner emphasized the court\u2019s obligation to uphold the law, \u201cand that obligation is not subject to or in any way dependent upon the level of appropriations received by the Public Defender.\u201d <em>Id., </em>444 A.2d at 1069; <em>cf. Office of the Pub. Defender v. State, </em>413 Md. 411, 427 n. 12, 993 A.2d 55, 64 n. 12 (2010) (commenting upon but not deciding the legal validity of COMAR 14.06.03.05A and D(2), and quoting with apparent approval the statement in <em>Baldwin, </em>51 Md.App. at 555, 444 A.2d at 1069, that \u201cit goes without saying that reductions in the Public Defender\u2019s budget and his desire to be frugal have no relevance whatever in the matter\u201d), <em>superseded on other grounds by </em>2011 Md. Laws, ch. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Other courts have expressed similar sentiments. <em>Caswell v. Califano, </em>583 F.2d 9 (1st Cir.1978), provides an example. That case involved a challenge to the delays in scheduling disability benefits hearings. <em>Id. </em>at 11. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">the vindication of almost every legal right has an impact on the allocation of scarce resources. And the courts, while mindful of the impact of remedies upon persons not before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>them, can hardly permit the legal rights of litigants to turn upon the alleged inability of the defendant fully to meet his obligation to others. We agree ... also that it is likely that an ultimate, comprehensive solution to the problem of hearing delays may well require congressional action. We cannot in good conscience, however, deny relief to the plaintiffs pending such action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 17-18 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>Hurrell-Harring v. New York, </em>15 N.Y.3d 8, 904 N.Y.S.2d 296, 930 N.E.2d 217 (2010), is to like effect. There, the Court of Appeals considered whether a complaint challenging the New York State legislature\u2019s delegation to the counties of the responsibilities in implementing the right to counsel could proceed. <em>Id., </em>904 N.Y.S.2d 296, 930 N.E.2d at 219. The complainants argued that the delegation amounted to an unfunded mandate that served to deprive defendants of their constitutional right to counsel. <em>Id., </em>904 N.Y.S.2d 296, 930 N.E.2d at 219. The court allowed the claims to proceed notwithstanding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">a remedy in this action would necessitate the appropriation of funds and perhaps, particularly in a time of scarcity, some reordering of legislative priorities. But this does not amount to an argument upon which a court might be relieved of its essential obligation to provide a remedy for violation of a fundamental constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">We have consistently held that enforcement of a clear constitutional or statutory mandate is the proper work of the courts, and it would be odd if we made an exception in the case of a mandate as well-established and as essential to our institutional integrity as the one requiring the State to provide legal representation to indigent criminal defendants at all critical stages of the proceedings against them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\"><em>Id., </em>904 N.Y.S.2d 296, 930 N.E.2d at 227 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Moreover, we have not uncovered any instance in which we have delayed implementation of a substantive right, much less one that affects indigent defendants\u2019 statutory right to public defender representation, out of concern for the financial costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>attendant to implementation of that right. And the Public Defender has not been able to direct us to any Maryland authority for such a proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the Circuit Court did not err or abuse its discretion when it issued the declaratory judgment in the Plaintiffs\u2019 favor without also considering the Public Defender\u2019s fiscal concerns and crafting a remedy to address them. For the same reasons, we deny the Public Defender\u2019s request that we stay for some period of time implementation of our judgment that indigent defendants are entitled to public defender representation at the bail-hearing portion of the initial appearance before the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">C. Res Judicata <em>and Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Before we close, we address the question raised by the Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, which asks whether the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of their request for injunctive relief erects a <em>res judicata </em>bar that precludes them from seeking injunctive relief for future violations. The Plaintiffs, understandably, seek to clarify their entitlement to enforce their rights by seeking injunctive relief in the Circuit Court in the event that the District Court Defendants and the Public Defender do not comply with our decision today. The Plaintiffs assert that, if <em>res judicata </em>would bar future requests, then the Circuit Court erred in denying them injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The District Court Defendants have moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal. They present three arguments for why, in their view, the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not properly before this Court: (1) the Plaintiffs did not properly preserve the claim because it was not raised in the Circuit Court; (2) the Plaintiffs are not aggrieved because they themselves requested that the injunctive relief be denied; and (3) the Plaintiffs seek a premature resolution, which would require this Court to render an improper advisory decision. As for the merits, the District Court Defendants assert that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to decide the issue of preclusive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The Plaintiffs, not surprisingly, oppose the Motion to Dismiss. The Plaintiffs argue that the issue was presented directly to the Circuit Court and is therefore preserved, and they are aggrieved because they never sought the bare denial of their request for injunctive relief. They also argue that, under the circumstances of this case, we must decide the issue they raise in the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We can dispose quickly of the District Court Defendants\u2019 first two arguments for dismissal of the cross-appeal. The Plaintiffs specifically addressed the issue of <em>res judicata </em>in their correspondence with the Circuit Court after the court issued its declaratory judgment establishing the Plaintiffs\u2019 right to counsel. We have recounted how the Plaintiffs, in an effort to ensure that the Circuit Court\u2019s declaratory judgment was \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of appeal, sought a ruling on their request for injunctive relief. In requesting, as one option, denial of the injunction, the Plaintiffs stated expressly their position that res <em>judicata </em>would not bar future requests for injunctive relief. They pointed directly to C.J. \u00a7 3-412, which provides for further remedy after the entry of declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The District Court Defendants, in response, made clear their position that <em>res judicata </em>would bar subsequent relief because the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint initially sought both declaratory and injunctive relief. Unquestionably, the <em>res judicata </em>issue presented by the cross-appeal was raised in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Moreover, in light of this record, there is no merit to the District Court Defendants\u2019 assertion that the Plaintiffs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>not aggrieved because they proposed the denial of their request for relief. We repeat, the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for an amendment of the court\u2019s original denial of injunctive relief was done with the expressed understanding that they would maintain the right to seek injunctive relief in the future, pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 3^112.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We reject as well the last of the District Court Defendants\u2019 grounds for dismissal of the cross-appeal. Considering this matter\u2019s protracted history, the clear positions taken by each party before the Circuit Court and this Court, and the concrete issue presented, we deem it appropriate to address the question whether <em>res judicata </em>would apply to bar requests for injunctive relief in the event of future violations. The Public Defender, throughout the proceedings on remand and before this Court, has agreed that the Plaintiffs have a right to counsel at initial bail hearings before the Commissioner. The Public Defender, however, vehemently opposes immediate enforcement of that right to counsel, pointing to the fiscal and practical impediments his office would encounter in its efforts to comply with the declaratory judgment. In light of those stated impediments, and given our holding that the Circuit Court did not err when it issued declaratory judgment in the Plaintiffs\u2019 favor without also considering the Public Defender\u2019s fiscal concerns and crafting a remedy to address them, it is more than mere conjecture that the Plaintiffs will seek future injunctive relief should the Public Defender be unable to provide representation at initial bail hearings. We therefore deny the District Court Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and address whether the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>will apply to bar injunctive relief for future violations of the declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bars a claim only when three distinct elements are satisfied: (1) the parties in the subsequent litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier dispute; (2) the subsequent action presents matters that were, or could have been, litigated in the earlier action; and (3) there was a valid final judgment on the merits in the earlier dispute. <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 389, 761 A.2d 899, 908 (2000). The Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief does not satisfy either the second or third of these criteria. Obviously, the Plaintiffs could not have litigated <em>future </em>violations of the declaratory judgment before the judgment was issued and any such violations occurred. Additionally, it is clear from the Circuit Court\u2019s initial ruling that the court believed it premature to consider entering an injunction because the court had stayed its decision pending appellate review. The denial, therefore, was not on the merits of the Plaintiffs\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We therefore hold that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief does not preclude any future requests by the Plaintiffs for injunctive relief to enforce the right to counsel declared in that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In sum, we hold that the bail hearing that occurs at the initial appearance before a Commissioner, held pursuant to Maryland Rules 4-213(a) and 4-216, is a stage of the criminal proceeding under \u00a7 16-204(b) of the Public Defender Act. Consequently, if a defendant qualifies for public defender representation, a bail hearing may not occur at the initial appearance unless the defendant has been afforded appointed counsel or waived the right to counsel. We do not mean by our holding that the Commissioner is foreclosed from carrying out all of the other duties attendant to the initial appearance, pursuant to Rule 4-213(a), if counsel is not present. What we do mean is that, whenever a person purporting to be indigent has not waived public defender representation at the initial appearance, the Commissioner may not proceed to the bail determination in the absence of a public defender who has assumed representation. If a public defender is not immediately available to assume representation, then the Commissioner must delay the bail hearing until such representation can be provided or is waived by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Moreover, notwithstanding that the present case deals only with bail hearings before Baltimore City Commissioners, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>holding applies with equal force <em>to </em>initial appearances before Commissioners throughout Maryland. That is to say, no bail determination can be made concerning an indigent person without the presence of counsel at any initial appearance in Maryland, unless such representation has been waived. It also follows quite naturally from our holding that there is an entitlement to public defender representation at the subsequent District Court bail review hearing, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 216(f).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We further hold that the Circuit Court neither erred nor abused its discretion in declining to consider, and provide a remedy for, the fiscal concerns the Public Defender raised in connection with implementation of the right to counsel at the initial bail hearing before a Commissioner. Moreover, we decline the Public Defender\u2019s request for a stay in implementing today\u2019s holding affirming that right. The Public Defender\u2019s asserted defense of budgetary impracticability, though evidently pertinent in many contexts, is not a proper consideration for the judiciary. We cannot declare that Plaintiffs have a statutory right to counsel at bail hearings and, in the same breath, permit delay in the implementation of that important right and thereby countenance violations of it, even for a brief time.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Finally, for the reasons we have stated, we deny the District Court Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, and we hold that <em>res judicata </em>does not bar Plaintiffs from seeking further injunctive relief, as provided by C.J. \u00a7 3-412, to enforce the rights declared in the December 28, 2010 judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

We point out, though, that to the extent the District Court Defendants assert that Rule 4-214 overrides and narrows the scope of public defender representation, set forth in \u00a7 16-204(b), the assertion is suspect. See, e.g., <em>Consol. Constr. Servs., Inc. v. Simpson, </em>372 Md. 434, 449-52, 813 A.2d 260, 269-71 (2002) and cases discussed therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\">.

We note, in connection with our holding today, that \"this Court has held, on equal protection principles, that a person with means to obtain his own lawyer has a right to representation by his [or her] own counsel which is equally as broad as an indigent\u2019s right under the Public Defender Act.\u201d <em>McCarter, </em>363 Md. at 714, 770 A.2d at 200 (quoting <em>Flansburg, </em>345 Md. at 700 n. 4, 694 A.2d at 465 n. 4); <em>accord Wilson v.

The Majority finds the prospect of further proceedings in the Circuit Court to flesh-out the details of the remedy for Petitioners\u2019 newly-declared right or, in the alternative, a stay, unparalleled in Maryland jurisprudence. (Majority op. at 435-36, 76 A.3d at 980-81\u2014 \u201cMoreover, we have not uncovered any instance in which we have delayed implementation of a substantive right, much less one that affects an indigent defendant\u2019s statutory right to public defender representation, out of concern for the financial costs attendant to implementation of that right. And the Public Defender has not been able to direct us to any Maryland authority for such a position.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">It is unclear whether the Majority believes that it lacks discretion to grant relief to the OPD or whether it is merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>unpersuaded to do so. Judge Adkins and I, on the other hand, are persuaded to exercise our discretion to urge that a stay of modest duration should have been part of this Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As the OPD summarized in its opening brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">It is undisputed that the Public Defender\u2019s attorney caseloads are stretched to \u2014 and even beyond in some instances \u2014 the acceptable limit. In 2009, the Office was out of compliance with the Maryland caseload standards in 11 districts (out of 12 for district court cases and 10 districts for circuit court cases. The Public Defender estimates that, should the circuit court\u2019s ruling be affirmed, there could be thousands of initial bail hearings per year, for which the Office would have to provide representation on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a week basis at the Baltimore City Central Booking facility[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] [Internal citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Further, in its reply brief, the OPD foresees (and Judge Adkins and I agree) that the \u201cOffice\u2019s persistent and severe resource constraints would, absent some further remedy, render it unable to supply counsel at initial bail hearings while still meeting its constitutional and ethical representation obligations, including to provide effective assistance of counsel, at later, critical stages [of criminal proceedings].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Because the Court identifies a statutory right, rather than one grounded in constitutional law, consideration should be given to the ramification that the Legislature and Governor, having not heretofore provided budgetarily for implementation of this right, must do so. The Legislature meets once a year normally, between January and April. Although supplemental appropriations to an annually adopted State budget are possible, in either the case of the annual budget or supplementary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>appropriations, the process of formulation, vetting and adoption of those actions is not as instantaneous relatively as the issuance of our mandate in this case. In addition, the Governor and the Legislature have a few other matters and priorities to balance during each annual (or the infrequent special) legislative session. To refuse to give any weight to these realities, along with the current state of the out-of-standards performance by the OPD of its pre-existing undertakings, invites application to the Court\u2019s opinion in this case of the cliched metaphor of the \u201costrich\u2019s head in the sand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The tasks confronting implementation of the Court\u2019s holding are not limited to the OPD. Consideration of the venues in State and local detention facilities, where initial appearances are held, may need to be assessed for new construction or reconstruction in order to balance additional attorney participation by the OPD and security objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Although Judge Adkins and I concur with the Majority opinion\u2019s holdings regarding: (1) recognition of the declared statutory right of indigent persons to have the effective assistance of counsel from the OPD for the bail hearing portion of initial appearances before District Court Commissioners; (2) the inappropriateness of res judicata effect on subsequently-sought injunctive relief for future violations of the statutory right declared here; and (3) declining to vacate the declaratory judgment and remanding this matter to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for further proceedings to flesh-out the remedy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we part company with our colleagues who refuse the OPD\u2019s request for a stay. Rather, we would have granted a stay of the judgment until 30 June 2012,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> during which period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the OPD, the Governor, the Legislature and others must do what needs to be done to effectuate the right declared here. During the stay, we would expect the OPD, in addition to efforts to insure the full execution of the right declared here on or after 30 June 2012, would formulate and carry-out a \u201cbest efforts\u201d initiative, using its existing resources, to represent indigent persons for bail consideration purposes at initial hearings before Commissioners.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Judge ADKINS authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. I am reminded of the royal pronouncement uttered by the actor Yul Brynner in the movie \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), who, in the character of Pharaoh Ramseses II of Egypt, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">So let it be written;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">So let it be done.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\">. The Majority opinion, at 432-36, 76 A.3d at 979-81, analyzes only the OPD\u2019s request for further proceedings in the trial court to flesh-out implementation of the remedy; however, the reasons given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Majority opinion for rejection of that request are claimed to apply with like result to deny the OPD\u2019s alternative request for a stay (Op. at 435-36, 76 A.3d at 981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\">. As the Majority opinion makes clear, \"our holding applies with equal force to initial appearances before Commissioners throughout Maryland.\u201d Majority op. at 439-40, 76 A.3d at 983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">. We join the Majority in rejecting this form of relief sought by the OPD because of our concern that such \"further \u00a1judicial] proceedings\u201d could become a vehicle of enduring delay before the right is implemented. The courts need not officiate over the inevitable negotiations that must occur. Although not an apt analogy, we do not wish to foster the sort of delays in implementation that followed the Supreme Court's \"all due haste\u201d direction in the arena of school desegregation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">.
