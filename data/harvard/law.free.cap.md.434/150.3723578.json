In a medical malpractice case, like this one, there is a legal distinction between a defendant physician who testifies based solely on what she did and what she observed in her actual treatment of the patient (a fact witness), and a physician who gives opinions based upon facts and/or materials furnished to him during the course of litigation (an expert witness). <em>See, e.g., In re Application of Republic of Ecuador, </em>280 F.R.D. 506, 511 (N.D.Cal.2012); <em>Carson v. Webb, </em>486 N.W.2d 278, 281 (Iowa 1992). In this case, it is undisputed that Dr. Schneider testified solely as a fact witness. His status as a fact witness limits the proper scope of his witness accreditation, which in turn will affect the admissibility of evidence offered by the patient that he is not board-certified in vascular surgery. Likewise, as a fact witness, his substantive testimony is limited to an explanation of what he did or observed, and why, concerning the alleged malpractice. His testimony may not go beyond that.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">In May of 2007, Victoria Little, Petitioner, sought treatment at Vascular Surgery Associates. She complained of pain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>her thighs and buttocks, which, it turned out, stemmed from a blocked aorta. Little was scheduled for a aortobifemoral bypass surgery to be performed by Respondent Dr. Schneider and Dr. Gonze on July 16, 2007. The goal of the surgery was to remove the buildup of plaque in the aorta and thereby restore appropriate blood flow to the pelvis and lower extremities. The surgery is performed by cutting the abdominal aorta below the renal arteries and then using a graft to connect the aorta to the femoral artery. The surgeon determines the proper size of the graft by visually inspecting the aorta during surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">During surgery, Drs. Schneider and Gonze chose to use a 16 x 8 mm graft. The suture used to connect the tissue to the graft, however, would not hold, causing Little to lose a large amount of blood. The doctors tried to complete the surgery several times, but the sutures continued to open up, making Little lose more blood with each attempt. Unable to complete the aortobifemoral bypass, Drs. Schneider and Gonze converted the surgery into an axillobifemoral bypass.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In this procedure, the bypass is performed at the axillary artery, which is then reconnected with the use of a graft to the femoral artery. The surgeons were able to complete the axillobifemoral bypass with the use of an 8 mm graft. But, by then, Little had lost 5100 ccs of blood \u2014 almost her entire volume of blood. As a result, there were severe surgical complications: Little became permanently paralyzed from the waist down and suffered temporary damage to her kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and spinal cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">At trial, Ms. Little\u2019s primary theory of negligence was based on an alleged mismatch in the size of her aorta and the size of the graft used in the initial attempt at completing the aortobifemoral bypass. Little contended that her aorta was 7-8 mm, and thus, the 16 x 8 mm graft was much too large. Dr. Schneider maintained that Little\u2019s aorta was 14 mm, and thus, the 16 x 8 mm graft was proper. The jury agreed with Little, finding that Drs. Schneider and Gonze had negligently performed the surgery and awarded Little $224,898 for past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>medical expenses, $2,000,000 for future medical expenses, and $1,333,000 for pain and suffering.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Dr. Schneider appealed, challenging two evidentiary rulings by the trial court: (1) allowing Little to question Dr. Schneider about his lack of board certification and (2) excluding from evidence a chest CAT scan, from an unrelated hospital visit, which allegedly showed Little\u2019s aorta. The Court of Special Appeals reversed on both issues. <em>See Schneider v. Little, </em>206 Md.App. 414, 49 A.3d 333 (2012). Little petitioned for certiorari review in this Court, which we granted on November 16, 2012. <em>Little v. Schneider, </em>429 Md. 303, 55 A.3d 906 (2012). We consider two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">1. Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in finding that evidence of Dr. Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification was admissible as a result of Dr. Schneider\u2019s extensive testimony regarding his accomplishments, credentials, and qualifications?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">2. Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in prohibiting Dr. Schneider from testifying about a CAT scan that Dr. Schneider had never used in his treatment of Little?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Admissibility of Physician\u2019s Board Certification Status</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Ms. Little argues that the trial court was correct in allowing her, on re-direct examination, to inquire into Dr. Schneider\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>lack of board certification in vascular surgery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Schneider counters, claiming that evidence was inadmissible. Both parties rely on <em>Dorsey v. Nold, </em>362 Md. 241, 765 A.2d 79 (2001), to support their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In <em>Dorsey, </em>we were presented with the question of whether a plaintiff may introduce into evidence the fact that the defendant physician had failed his board certification examination on his first attempt. <em>Id. </em>at 249-51, 765 A.2d at 83-84. We held that such information was not admissible, explaining, \u201cthe general rule is that a physician\u2019s inability to pass a medical board certification exam has little, if any, relevance\u201d in a medical malpractice suit. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 765 A.2d at 84 (citations and quotation marks omitted). That is so because \u201cthe fact of failure makes it neither more nor less probable that the physician complied with or departed from the applicable standard of care in the diagnosis or treatment -of a particular patient for a particular condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 765 A.2d at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Little reads <em>Dorsey, </em>however, to say that it is only the physician\u2019s failure to pass the exam that is inadmissible, not the physician\u2019s current status of certification. In support of this distinction, Little explains that in <em>Dorsey </em>the jury was informed of the fact that the physician was \u201cnot yet board-certified\u201d at the time of the alleged malpractice. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 765 A.2d at 83. Because the jury in <em>Dorsey </em>was actually allowed to hear the physician\u2019s current certification status, Little argues, <em>Dorsey </em>cannot possibly stand for a rule that a physician\u2019s certification status is always inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Schneider has a different take on <em>Dorsey, </em>using it to argue that his decision not to take the board certification examination is not relevant. Just like Dorsey\u2019s failure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>certification exam, Schneider avers, his choice not to take the exam makes it no more or less probable that he breached the standard of care in performing Little\u2019s surgery. The trial judge, he argues, had no discretion to admit this irrelevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Schneider\u2019s reading of <em>Dorsey </em>is correct. That Dr. Schneider was not board certified makes it no more or less probable that he breached the standard of care in his treatment of Little. Yet, the doctor\u2019s argument based on <em>Dorsey </em>does not respond to what may be Little\u2019s best theory: that Schneider put his qualifications at issue. In other words, he \u201copened the door\u201d to Little\u2019s use of the lack of board certification evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>\u201cOpening the Door </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The doctrine of \u201copening the door\u201d to otherwise inadmissible evidence is based on principles of fairness. As we have stated: \u201c \u2018opening the door\u2019 is simply a way of saying: \u2018My opponent has injected an issue into the case, and I ought to be able to introduce evidence on that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 85, 629 A.2d 1239, 1243 (1993). It is a method by which we allow parties to \u201cmeet fire with fire,\u201d as they introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence in response to evidence put forth by the opposing side. <em>See Terry v. State, </em>332 Md. 329, 337, 631 A.2d 424, 428 (1993). In this regard, the \u201cdoctrine is really a rule of expanded relevancy.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>332 Md. at 84, 629 A.2d at 1242. It \u201cauthorizes admitting evidence which otherwise would have been irrelevant in order to respond to ... admissible evidence which generates an issue.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 84-85, 629 A.2d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Dr. Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification in vascular surgery was brought up several times in the course of this litigation. It was first raised pre-trial by Schneider himself in a motion in limine seeking to prevent Little from introducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the evidence at trial. During the motions hearing, Little\u2019s counsel argued that, as a matter of fairness, he should be permitted to use Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification to counter the picture \u2014 which he anticipated would be painted by the defense \u2014 that Dr. Schneider is the \u201cgreatest\u201d vascular surgeon in the region. The trial judge ruled for Dr. Schneider but warned the parties that the order was \u201csubject to the proviso that upon request during the course of the trial, said ruling is subject to reconsideration by this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Apparently, the defense viewed the judge\u2019s favorable ruling as giving them a green light for introducing Dr. Schneider\u2019s experience and achievements, because counsel touted Dr. Schneider\u2019s credentials and qualifications during opening statements. Specifically, he stated that Schneider had gone to undergraduate school at Hamilton College and medical school at Case Western Reserve University. He emphasized that Dr. Schneider completed a five-year residency in surgery at John Hopkins, voluntarily elected to perform an additional year-long fellowship at Hopkins specializing in vascular surgery, and was hired by Hopkins to teach vascular surgery for the next eleven years. Defense counsel also stated that Dr. Schneider was instrumental in bringing a new state-of-the-art hospital into the community, and that he volunteered to serve as the Chairman of the hospital\u2019s Board of Directors, which is an unpaid position. All this, he said, occurred while Schneider was \u201ca full-time practicing surgeon [who] is in the operating room three or four days a week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The issue of board certification came up again when Little called Dr. Schneider as an adverse witness. She asked the trial court to revisit its ruling on the motion in limine. At that time, the trial judge refused to overturn his previous ruling, but cautioned defense counsel that unnecessary bolstering of Schneider, like that in the opening statement, could cause him to change his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Defense counsel did not heed this warning. In his cross-examination of Dr. Schneider, he wasted no time: he went over all of Dr. Schneider\u2019s accomplishments, credentials, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>qualifications. This time, defense counsel went into even more detail then he did in opening statements, prompting Dr. Schneider to testify that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u2022 he had graduated from Hamilton College with honors and served as the president of the Senior Honor Society;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u2022 in medical school at Case Western Reserve University he was selected to be on the Search Committee for a Dean, the Teaching Excellence Award Committee, and the Quality Assurance Teaching Committee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u2022 after medical school he was selected to complete a residency at John Hopkins;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u2022 his initial residency lasted five years in which time he was able to perform all types of surgeries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\u2022 he elected to spend an additional sixth year focusing solely on vascular surgery and was trained by \u201cthe Chief of Vascular Surgery, who is really one of the most preeminent vascular surgeons in the country, as well as another vascular surgeon who has written several textbooks on vascular surgery\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u2022 his residency started with twenty-two interns, but by his fifth year he was one of only three still remaining, as the rest had been cut out of the program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">\u2022 he spent six months in an exchange program studying vascular surgery at Oxford University in England;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">\u2022 when he came back to Hopkins, he was chosen as a Halstead Surgical Fellow to continue training in vascular surgery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">\u2022 upon the completion of his residency he was asked to stay on the faculty at Hopkins to teach vascular surgery while, at the same time, he was also a full-time practicing surgeon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">\u2022 by the time he completed his training at Hopkins he had performed 300 aortic procedures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">\u2022 he then formed his own private practice called Vascular Surgery Associates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u2022 at the time of trial he estimated that he had performed between 400 to 500 aortobifemoral by-pass surgeries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u2022 he had privileges at Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, St. Joseph Hospital, Harford Memorial Hospital, and Sinai Hospital;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u2022 he served as the Chief of Surgery at Fallston General Hospital, the predecessor to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, and as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, a position that is unpaid, of the Upper Chesapeake Health System;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u2022 he was largely responsible for creating Upper Chesapeake by being in charge of the organization that raised funds to build the hospital;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u2022 he had authored numerous publications in national medical journals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">\u2022 he belonged to several professional organizations, including Chesapeake Vascular Society, John Hopkins Medical and Surgical Association, and Halstead Surgical Society; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">\u2022 he volunteers for Health Link, which \u201cis a charitable venture that Upper Chesapeake funds through donations from its foundation ... to take care of indigent patients, patients without medical insurance in Harford County.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">During this testimony, Little objected twice, on relevancy grounds, but the trial judge permitted Dr. Schneider to continue. Upon the completion of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Schneider, Little once again asked the trial judge to revisit his original ruling on the motion in limine. Little argued that the doctor could not have it both ways: his accomplishments and great deeds were no more relevant than his lack of board certification. This time, the trial judge agreed, reversing his ruling and allowing Little to inquire, on re-direct, about Dr. Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>[WJhen I made my initial ruling pretrial, which I thought was correct, I did caution everybody it was subject to being revisited, depending on how much puffing went in, and, quite frankly, I am going to use the term puffing, but I am not in any way minimizing these things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">He is certainly very accomplished. He should be complimented. However, as counsel has indicated, what\u2019s the relevance of all those wonderful accomplishments to the issues before the Court? So what\u2019s good \u2014 there is a balance here. So if you are going to puff up, they get to puff down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The trial transcript reveals that the judge was in tune with the progression of the trial and properly understood that the tables turned once Dr. Schneider engaged in extensive recitation of his many accomplishments on cross-examination. We have held that the doctrine of \u201copening the door\u201d applies equally in opening statements, witness examination, and closing arguments. <em>See, e.g., Terry, </em>332 Md. at 329, 631 A.2d at 424 (opening statement); <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 612 A.2d 258 (1992) (cross examination); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 969 A.2d 989 (2009) (closing argument). Here, the \u201cpuffing\u201d evidence was introduced during a phase of testimony known as \u201cwitness accreditation.\u201d We see no reason why the doctrine should apply any differently in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Witness accreditation is an aspect of the witness examination process that has received scant attention in appellate opinions or legal treatises. It is a process by which a lawyer (usually the witness\u2019s counsel) elicits preliminary background information from the witness to \u201cenhance a witness\u2019 credibility because the information portrays the witness as a real human being, not just an impersonal source of evidence.\u201d Paul Bergman, <em>Trial Advocacy In A Nutshell </em>173 (2013). In other words, \u201cthe purpose of the accreditation process is largely ... to do whatever possible to make the jury receptive to the witness and his testimony before eliciting the key aspects of that testimony.\u201d Steven P. Grossman, <em>Trying the Case </em>47 (1999). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>It is a routine practice in trials for an attorney to ask his witness certain preliminary questions which may not be relevant to the issues being litigated, which may go beyond mere identification and which are designed to show that the witness will be somewhat credible or not biased in favor of the side calling him. For example, the educational background or professional status or employment position of a non-expert witness may be asked, or the witness\u2019s lack of prior contact with the side who has called him may be brought out. These questions give the jury some knowledge of the individual and a more complete perspective in considering his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><em>City of Baltimore v. Zell, </em>279 Md. 23, 28, 367 A.2d 14, 17 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The legitimate process of accrediting a witness is not without limits, however. In <em>Zell, </em>we acknowledged that accreditation questions \u201cserve the useful function of informing the jury about the witness,\u201d but the \u201cextent to which such questions are permitted must ... remain in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d 279 Md. at 28, 367 A.2d at 17; <em>see also White v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 684, 695, 726 A.2d 858, 863 (1999). Thus, the key to deciding whether Dr. Schneider \u201copened the door\u201d through his testimony during the accreditation is to examine the \u201creasonable limits\u201d imposed by the trial judge on the accreditation process. In doing so, we are mindful that Schneider was not an expert; he was a fact witness testifying as an adverse witness in the plaintiffs case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">With regard to fact witnesses, \u201c[pjersonal background questioning is usually quite short.\u201d Bergman, <em>supra </em>at 173. Ordinarily, it is not as extensive as that of an expert, because a fact witness will not give any opinions in the case. Therefore, the jury does not need to receive the same amount of detail as to his qualifications or credentials in order to decide whether he is credible. Thus, a judge is more likely to restrict the \u201creasonable limits\u201d of accreditation of a fact witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Reviewing the transcript, we see that the trial judge, in establishing the \u201creasonable limits,\u201d was willing to give defense counsel some leeway in accrediting Dr. Schneider. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>judge originally granted Schneider\u2019s motion in limine, and, even after defense counsel\u2019s discussion during opening statement, refused to reverse his decision. But, at the same time, the trial judge made clear that, if defense counsel went too far in the accreditation of Dr. Schneider, he might allow Little to counter with Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">This is what ultimately happened. As defense counsel attempted to paint a picture of Dr. Schneider as a model of excellence in the field of vascular surgery and a great humanitarian, the trial judge became persuaded that he exceeded the basic background information appropriate for accreditation of a fact witness. <em>Zell, </em>279 Md. at 28, 367 A.2d at 14. While such an accreditation might be appropriate for an expert, Dr. Schneider was testifying solely as a fact witness. Thus, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that, by going outside the reasonable limits of accreditation, Schneider placed at issue the question of his excellence in the field of vascular surgery and \u201copened the door\u201d to rebuttal inquiry on re-direct examination. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing Little to ask Dr. Schneider, on re-direct, about his lack of board certification in order to counter Schneider\u2019s effort to cloak himself as the paragon of vascular surgeons.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s Use of the Lack of Board Certification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">This is not to say that Little could have a free-for-all with Dr. Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification. The doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of \u201copening the door\u201d has limitations. <em>Clark, </em>332 Md. at 87, 629 A.2d at 1244. It allows for the introduction of otherwise inadmissible evidence, but only to \u201cthe extent necessary to remove any unfair prejudice that might have ensued from the original evidence.\u201d <em>Savoy v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 241, 254, 494 A.2d 957, 963 (1985). In this regard, Dr. Schneider argues that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Little to improperly use the lack of board certification as evidence of negligence. Specifically, Dr. Schneider draws our attention to Little\u2019s use of the board certification evidence on re-direct examination and in closing argument. We review both for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On re-direct examination, Little\u2019s counsel had an opportunity to question Dr. Schneider about his lack of board certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">Q. Good morning, Dr. Schneider. Yesterday we were talking about your background and training. [Defense counsel] asked you several questions about those issues....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Q. One of the questions [defense counsel] didn\u2019t ask you was whether or not you were board certified in vascular surgery. In fact, you are not board certified in vascular surgery, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">A. When I trained, there was no board in vascular surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">Q. The answer is you are not board certified in vascular surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">Q. You don\u2019t have a Certificate of Special Qualification in Vascular Surgery that you could have pursued later on either; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">A. I was not able to do that, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">Q. At the time of your deposition, you weren\u2019t even sure whether you were currently board certified in general surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">A. I was not certain, but, in fact, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Q.

When I trained, there was no board in vascular surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Q. Doctor, listen to my question. That\u2019s a nice qualification to have, isn\u2019t it, a board certification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">A. I disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">Q. It\u2019s your testimony under oath that you don\u2019t know whether you are board certified in general surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">A. That\u2019s correct, I don\u2019t at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">Q. But you can tell us under oath that you are not board certified in vascular surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">A. I have never been board certified in vascular surgery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">As this colloquy demonstrates, Little\u2019s counsel\u2019s questions focused on Dr. Schneider\u2019s professional status, namely the board certification and whether Dr. Schneider viewed it as important. Once this was established, Little\u2019s counsel promptly moved on. This is in keeping with an appropriate witness accreditation \u2014 briefly eliciting preliminarily background information about a witness\u2019s educational or professional background and then moving on to the substantive testimony. In other words, in this instance, Little used the lack of board certification only to the extent necessary to counter the potentially unfair prejudice created by defense counsel had the overblown accreditation of Dr. Schneider gone unaddressed. We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in allowing Little\u2019s questions on redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Little\u2019s counsel, however, did not stop there. He returned to Dr. Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification in closing argument. This time, he used it to call into question Dr. Schneider\u2019s general credibility, implying that he had lied to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8M\">Every physician who testified in this case was board certified except for Dr. Schneider. I asked Dr. Schneider, Board certification is a big deal, isn\u2019t it, doctor? Oh, no, absolutely not. That is not a big deal at all. So, Dr. Suggs, the very expert witness for Dr. Schneider, comes in.... Dr. Suggs, you said that you were board certified. We can agree that is not really that big of a deal, is it? Oh, I disagree, it is a big deal. I\u2019m not saying Dr. Schneider is a lesser doctor because he is not board certified, but the fact that he would come into this courtroom and try to tell you it is not a big deal to be board certified when his own expert witnesses know that that is not true tells you about his credibility in this case. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We read this closing as an attempt to use the lack of board certification evidence to challenge the truthfulness of Dr. Schneider\u2019s entire testimony. If Dr. Schneider had objected, and the trial court had sustained his objection, we might well agree that Little\u2019s counsel had gone too far at this point.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yet, Dr. Schneider failed to object to this statement at trial. As a result, any complaint Dr. Schneider may have with regard to Little\u2019s closing argument is waived and not preserved for appellate review. <em>See Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 58, 733 A.2d 1014, 1026 (1999) (\u201cEven if Allstate\u2019s comments during closing arguments were prejudicial and resulted in an inadequate verdict, it was incumbent upon Farleys\u2019 counsel to immediately object so that the trial judge could promptly rule on the matter.\u201d); <em>see also Warren v. State, </em>205 Md.App. 93, 132-33, 43 A.3d 1098, 1120 (2012) (\u201cThe record reveals that appellant failed to lodge any objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>whatsoever during the State\u2019s closing argument.... As such, any issue as to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks is not preserved for appellate review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Exclusion of the CAT Scan</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Schneider also complains that the trial judge improperly excluded a chest CAT scan, which allegedly could be used to determine the actual size of Little\u2019s abdominal aorta. Schneider argues that Little\u2019s central theory of negligence was the \u201cmismatch between the size of the aorta and the graft,\u201d and therefore, the actual size of Little\u2019s aorta was a fact of consequence to the outcome of the action. Thus, he avers, because the CAT scan could illuminate the actual size of Little\u2019s aorta, it is relevant evidence and should not have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Little responds that the CAT scan was not relevant because it was from an unrelated medical procedure which played no part in Dr. Schneider\u2019s treatment of Little. In Ms. Little\u2019s opinion, the scope of relevant evidence is confined to that which Dr. Schneider actually used in treating Little. And, because Dr. Schneider had never previously used this CAT scan, it was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">On this point, we agree with Dr. Schneider. Little draws too narrow of a definition of relevancy. Maryland Rule 5M01 defines relevant evidence broadly as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d It is clear from the record, that the size of Little\u2019s aorta was the central fact of consequence in this case. Thus, if the CAT scan could aid in determining the size of Little\u2019s aorta, it may be relevant under Rule 5-401.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Determining relevancy, however, is only the first step. Dr. Schneider still had to have a witness who could identify and interpret the CAT scan. In this regard, the trial judge found that none of Schneider\u2019s experts reviewed or relied on this CAT scan in forming their opinions, and he excluded their testimony on this point. Neither party challenges this ruling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In excluding the proffered exhibit, the trial judge also inquired into Dr. Schneider\u2019s use of the CAT scan. Little\u2019s counsel explained to the trial judge that Schneider had never used this CAT scan in his treatment of Little,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and defense counsel admitted as much. The trial judge asked Dr. Schneider\u2019s counsel: \u201ccan you cite me to anything that any of your folks, either your individual clients or your experts, where they [looked at this CAT scan].\u201d In response, all defense counsel could come up with was one line from Dr. Schneider\u2019s deposition in which he referenced CAT scans generally as one method by which one can measure the size of a vessel: Question, Are there any radiographic studies that can \u2014 let me rephrase it. Are there any radiographic studies from which you can assess the size of a vessel? Answer, CAT scans and some types of aortograms if there is a marker catheter present will allow you to.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Defense counsel relied upon this generic reference to show Dr. Schneider\u2019s use of the CAT scan. Yet, as the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>properly noted: \u201cHe didn\u2019t point to this one. He just said CAT scans in general.\u201d Thus, it is clear from the record that one of the trial judge\u2019s reasons for excluding the CAT scan was the complete lack of any indication that Dr. Schneider used or relied on this CAT scan in his treatment of Little.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Nevertheless, Dr. Schneider argues that, because he was a fact witness, he should have been permitted to testify about the CAT regardless of whether he used it in his treatment of Little. This is because, in Schneider\u2019s opinion, the \u201cCAT scan was an objective, factual image\u201d upon which he \u201cwould merely have had to identify the aorta ... and compare it to the calibration on the image.\u201d In this regard, Dr. Schneider argues that \u201c[i]n medical malpractice trials, defendants regularly testify about their training, qualifications, and experiences and a variety of medical and surgical subjects without being designated as experts.\u201d He fears that \u201c[i]f they were not allowed to do so, they could not defend themselves.\u201d To illustrate this point, Dr. Schneider analogizes the CAT scan to other parts of his testimony in which, for example, he was permitted to use a demonstrative aid in explaining the axillary by-pass procedure he performed, and the identification of several vessels on that demonstrative aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As we said before, Dr. Schneider acknowledges that he was only a fact witness, not an expert. It is well established that fact witnesses must have personal knowledge of the matters to which they testify. <em>See Walker v. State, </em>373 Md. 360, 388 n. 8, 818 A.2d 1078, 1094 n. 8 (2003) (\u201c[T]he threshold standards for calling any fact witness are merely that the witness have personal knowledge of the matter attested to and that the matter be relevant to the case at hand.\u201d). As we explained in <em>Dorsey </em>\u2014 a medical malpractice action \u2014 when a defendant physician testifies as a fact witness, the physician\u2019s testimony must be \u201climited to a recitation of what he observed and what he did on the occasion of [the patient\u2019s] visit.\u201d 362 Md. at 251, 765 A.2d at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In this regard, the trial judge clearly found that Dr. Schneider lacked the necessary personal knowledge. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>judge specifically inquired into Schneider\u2019s use of the CAT scan and found that Dr. Schneider never reviewed the CAT scan, never considered the CAT scan, and never relied upon the CAT scan. Indeed, the trial judge could find no indication at all that Schneider even knew that the CAT scan existed when he was treating Little. Clearly, then, it was within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to prohibit Dr. Schneider from testifying about this CAT scan because such testimony would have gone outside the realm of Schneider\u2019s personal knowledge regarding what he did and what he observed in the treatment of Little.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">When a defendant physician testifies as a fact witness, the defense must limit the witness accreditation and substantive testimony to that of a fact witness. In this case, Dr. Schneider\u2019s witness accreditation exceeded the reasonable limits for accreditation of a fact witness because it inquired extensively into his professional accomplishments. His attempt to testify regarding the CAT scan likewise would have gone beyond the legitimate testimony of a fact witness because Schneider had no personal knowledge of the scan. Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in either allowing Little to discuss Dr. Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification or excluding the CAT scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HARFORD COUNTY; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\">. The award for pain and suffering was reduced by the trial court to $650,000 in accordance with the cap on non-economic damages for a total judgment of $2,874,398 in favor of Little. Dr. Gonze entered into a settlement with Little after the trial and prior to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\">. We have rephrased the questions for brevity and clarity. In Little\u2019s Petition for Certiorari the questions were phrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">1. Is evidence of a physician's board certification status admissible when the physician is a defendant in a medical malpractice action, is called by the plaintiff as an adverse witness, and testifies about the physician's specialized knowledge, skill, and expertise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">2. Did the Circuit Court act in a manner well removed from any center mark and beyond the fringe of what is minimally acceptable by precluding Respondent from testifying about a CAT scan which played no role in, and was not relevant to, his treatment of Petitioner?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">. Dr. Schneider was called as an adverse witness to testify during Little's case-in-chief. During Little\u2019s direct examination, she was prohibited from discussing Dr. Schneider board certification status. However \u2014 after Schneider testified, during cross-examination by his own counsel, regarding his vast professional experience and community service \u2014 the trial judge permitted Little to inquire into the subject on re-direct examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">. The doctrine may also allow a party to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence to respond to \"inadmissible evidence admitted by the court over objection.\u201d <em>Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 85, 629 A.2d 1239, 1243 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">. All in all, Dr. Schneider's accreditation covered eleven MI pages of the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. Although this opinion affirms use of Dr. Schneider\u2019s lack of board certification, it should not be read so broadly as to condone generally the use of negative irrelevant facts regarding a physician. For example, even excessive puffing during defendant's witness accreditation does not justify introduction of evidence that the physician was previously sued for malpractice. The goal of the \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine is to balance any unfair prejudice one party might have suffered. Ordinarily, evidence of prior malpractice suits is so prejudicial that it would tip the scale unfairly against the doctor. Thus, evidence of prior malpractice suits would not be permissible in cases like this one, \u201cunless the defendant doctor injected this topic into the trial, for example, by testifying that he or she had never been sued for malpractice.\u201d <em>Lai v. Sagle, </em>373 Md. 306, 323 n. 9, 818 A.2d 237, 248 n. 9 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. That Little was allowed to introduce the lack of board certification to counter the advantage that Dr. Schneider gained through his inappropriate witness accreditation does not mean that she should be allowed to use the evidence to create her own, albeit small, advantage over Dr. Schneider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\">. Little makes the argument that this CAT scan was not relevant at all because it was a scan of Little\u2019s <em>chest, </em>and the trial was concerned with the size Little\u2019s <em>abdominal </em>aorta. Yet, this CAT scan is not in the record before us, and thus, as an appellate court, we are not in a position to make the factual determination regarding how much of the body is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>depicted in a chest CAT scan. Dr. Schneider proffered that this CAT scan could be used to show the size of Little\u2019s abdominal aorta, and we have no reason to question this proffer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\">. The trial judge also excluded the CAT scan based on a discovery violation, but Little does not rely on that theory in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">. Little\u2019s counsel had the following colloquy with the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">The Court: So, [the CAT scan] wasn't any part of [Dr. Schneider\u2019s] treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">[Plaintiff's Counsel]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">The Court: Or decision making?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">[Plaintiff's Counsel]: Nothing to do with his decision making.... They were asked questions repeatedly about what they did, what they revealed, why they did this and why they did that, and [the CAT scan] never came up in that context.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">. Likewise, Dr. Gonze could not have introduced the CAT scan evidence for the same reason Dr. Schneider could not: he had no personal knowledge of the existence of the CAT scan during his treatment of Little.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
