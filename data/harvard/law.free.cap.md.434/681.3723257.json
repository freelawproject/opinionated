Petitioner Roguell Blue, the head of security for a nightclub, was arrested by the Prince George\u2019s County Police for carrying a handgun without a permit on the open parking lot of the nightclub. Mr. Blue brought suit against the County, contending at trial that his arrest was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>illegal because the parking lot should be considered to be \u201cwithin the confines\u201d of the nightclub.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that there is no reason to believe that the Legislature used the term \u201cconfines\u201d with respect to a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d other than in its ordinary sense, which would not include an open parking lot adjacent to a nightclub. We thus affirm the judgment of that court directing judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\n<em>Handgun Permit Requirement and Exceptions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Under Maryland law, an individual may not \u201cwear, carry, or transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, on or about the person[.]\u201d Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article (\u201cCR\u201d), \u00a7 4 \u2014 203(a) (1) (i) ,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There are numerous exceptions to this prohibition. As a general rule, a member of the public may legally carry a handgun only by obtaining a permit pursuant to the handgun permit law \u2014 one of the exceptions to the prohibition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CR \u00a7 4 \u2014 203(b). Pertinent to this case, the statute also excepts from the prohibition: the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by a supervisory employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">(i) in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">(ii) within the conf\u00ednes of the business establishment in which the supervisory employee is employed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">(iii) when so authorized by the owner or manager of the business establishment^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>CR \u00a7 4-203(b)(7). Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor that carries maximum penalties that vary depending on the circumstances and location of the offense, as well as whether the defendant has prior firearms-related convictions. CR \u00a7 4-203(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\n<em>Mr. Blue\u2019s Arrest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On the night of June 17, 2008, Mr. Blue was working as the head of security for Irving\u2019s Nightclub,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a strip club in Capitol Heights, Maryland. His employer required that he be armed with a handgun.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During the evening, he came to believe that there was \u201cillicit sexual activity\u201d taking place outside the club in a car in the nightclub\u2019s parking lot. Mr. Blue confronted the individuals involved, ordered a man out of the car, and attempted to pat him down for weapons. The man ran from the scene, and Mr. Blue and other security guards relented when he left the parking lot. Mr. Blue then called the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department to report the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">As it turned out, however, officers from the Police Department were already on their way to the nightclub in response to a report of gunshots. Upon arrival, the officers learned that Mr. Blue was carrying a handgun and asked him to produce a valid permit for it. Instead, Mr. Blue showed them a laminated copy of CR \u00a7 4-203 and informed them that he had the permission of the club owner to possess the handgun on the premises.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mr. Blue was arrested and charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201cwearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in public\u201d in violation of CR \u00a7 4-203(a)(l). Those charges were later disposed of with the State\u2019s entry of a <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>Mr. Blue's Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On September 14, 2009, Mr. Blue filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against the County and three of the police officers involved in his arrest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In his complaint, he alleged a violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> false arrest and imprisonment, and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">A trial was held from December 13 to December 15, 2010. At the trial, Mr. Blue asserted that he was legally permitted to carry the handgun under CR \u00a7 4 \u2014 203(b)(7) as a \u201csupervisory employee,\u201d and that the officers therefore did not have probable cause to arrest him. The nightclub owner testified that Mr. Blue\u2019s position required him \u201cto have a weapon on [the] premises\u201d in order to ensure \u201cthat everything was safe around the club,\u201d including \u201c[i]nside and around the parking lot.\u201d At the close of Mr. Blue\u2019s case, the Circuit Court, finding that Mr. Blue had failed to prove that the arrest was motivated by \u201cill will ... or contempt or with the intent to injure,\u201d granted the County\u2019s motion for judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>malicious prosecution claim. The remaining two claims were eventually sent to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The jury found in favor of Mr. Blue on his State constitutional claim and on the false arrest and imprisonment claim. He was awarded $106,100 in damages, comprised of $29,350 for lost wages, $1,750 for medical expenses, and $75,000 in other non-economic damages. The trial court denied the County\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Both Mr. Blue and the County appealed. On August 30, 2012, the Court of Special Appeals, in a reported decision, upheld the dismissal of the malicious prosecution claim, but reversed the judgment based on the jury verdict. 206 Md. App. 608, 51 A.3d 42 (2012). The intermediate appellate court reasoned that, because Mr. Blue had been carrying his handgun in the parking lot of the club and not \u201cwithin the confines of the business establishment\u201d \u2014 which it construed to mean the interior of the building \u2014 the officers had probable cause to arrest him. This precluded a finding in Mr. Blue\u2019s favor on his constitutional and false arrest and imprisonment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Mr. Blue subsequently filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court, which we granted on November 16, 2012, to determine whether the supervisory employee exception to Maryland\u2019s handgun law allows a security guard to carry a handgun on the parking lot of a nightclub without a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The parties apparently agree that, if the exception for a supervisory employee in the Maryland handgun law did not apply, the officers had legal justification to arrest Mr. Blue under CR \u00a7 4-203(a). Thus, resolution of this appeal turns on whether CR \u00a7 4-203(b)(7) authorized Mr. Blue to carry a handgun without a permit on the parking lot of Irving\u2019s Nightclub.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The crux of this case is the construction of CR \u00a7 4-203(b)(7) \u2014 in particular, whether the phrase \u201cwithin the confines of the business establishment\u201d includes an open parking lot associated with a business conducted inside a building. This is a question of law on which we owe no deference to the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>425 Md. 1, 30-31, 38 A.3d 333 (2012); <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Bellevale Farms, Inc., </em>432 Md. 292, 311, 68 A.3d 843 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The goal of statutory construction is to discern and carry out the intent of the Legislature. Our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals have aptly summarized this quest, based on this Court\u2019s past decisions, as one that requires an examination of the statutory text in context, a review of legislative history to confirm conclusions or resolve questions from that examination, and a consideration of the consequences of alternative readings. \u201cText is the plain language of the relevant provision, typically given its ordinary meaning, viewed in context, considered in light of the whole statute, and generally evaluated for ambiguity. Legislative purpose, either apparent from the text or gathered from external sources, often informs, if not controls, our reading of the statute. An examination of interpretive consequences, either as a comparison of the results of each proffered construction, or as a principle of avoidance of an absurd or unreasonable reading, grounds the court\u2019s interpretation in reality.\u201d <em>Town of Oxford v. Koste, </em>204 Md.App. 578, 585-86, 42 A.3d 637 (2012), <em>aff'd, </em>431 Md. 14, 63 A.3d 582 (2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\n<em>Supervisory Employee Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The elements of the supervisory employee exception in CR \u00a7 4 \u2014 203(b)(7) are clear. A supervisory employee may possess a handgun (1) \u201cin the course of employment\u201d; (2) \u201cwithin the confines of the business establishment in which the supervisory employee is employed\u201d; and (3) \u201cwhen so authorized by the owner or manager of the business establishment.\u201d The County does not dispute that Mr. Blue possessed the handgun in the course of his employment and was authorized by the owner of the club to carry it. The only element of the exception in dispute is whether Mr. Blue was carrying the handgun \u201cwithin the confines of the business establishment\u201d in which he was employed when he was on the parking lot. <em>\u201cWithin the Confines of the Business Establishment </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">\n<em>Statutory Text</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The statute itself does not provide a specific definition for the phrase \u201cwithin the confines of the business establishment.\u201d Common dictionary definitions provide some direction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cWithin\u201d and \u201cconfines\u201d are defined respectively as \u201cin or into the interior\u201d and \u201csomething (as borders or walls) that encloses.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (9th ed. 1987) at 275, 1355. \u201cBusiness\u201d is defined as \u201ca commercial or sometimes an industrial enterprise\u201d and an \u201cestablishment\u201d is defined as \u201ca place of business or residence with its furnishings and staff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 425. Finally, the statutory exception identifies the business establishment as the one <em>\u201cin which </em>the supervisory employee is employed\u201d\u2014 again placing the emphasis on interior space. CR \u00a7 4-203(b)(7)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Putting these definitions together, \u201cwithin the confines of the business establishment\u201d appears to mean the interior space of a commercial enterprise, where one may find its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>furnishings and staff, enclosed by walls or similar bounds. With application to this case, the business of a strip club occurs inside the building that houses its \u201cfurnishings and staff.\u201d The business of such an establishment is not conducted in an open parking lot.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">The use of the term \u201cconfines\u201d in the statute apparently denotes some area distinct from the entire area owned by or associated with the business.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Otherwise, if the area being referenced was co-extensive with the entire area owned by or associated with the business, the drafters could simply have written \u201cwithin the business establishment\u201d; \u201cconfines\u201d would have been redundant and unnecessary. It is a commonplace principle that interpretations that treat statutory language as surplusage should be avoided. <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick </em>366 Md. 295, 302-3, 783 A.2d 667 (2001). Thus, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the language of the exception indicates that it is \u201cspecific and narrow.\u201d 206 Md.App. at 618, 51 A.3d 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>Statutory Context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The supervisory employee exception is not the only part of the handgun law that refers to the \u201cconfines\u201d of a \u201cbusiness establishment.\u201d Another exception in the statute permits \u201cthe wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by a person on real estate that the person owns or leases or where the person resides or <em>within the confines of a business establishment </em>that the person owns or leases.\u201d CR \u00a7 4 \u2014 203(b)(6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>(emphasis added). This exception allows an individual to carry a handgun without a permit in three places:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">1\u2014 on real estate that the person owns or leases</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">2\u2014 on real estate where the person resides</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">3\u2014 within the confines of a business establishment that the person owns or leases</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The reference to \u201creal estate\u201d in this exception obviously encompasses buildings and other improvements on that real estate, as it presumably is not limited to people who reside on bare land. It is evident that \u201cwithin the confines of the business establishment\u201d can refer to something less than the \u201creal estate\u201d on which the business sits. <em>Cf. Marshall v. Walker, </em>958 F.Supp. 359, 365 (N.D.Ill.1997) (construing weapons possession statute and distinguishing exception relating to possession \u201cin\u201d a place of business as opposed to \u201con\u201d the person\u2019s land).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">\n<em>Legislative History ofCR \u00a7 h-203(b)(7)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">It appears that the State\u2019s initial effort to regulate handgun possession was enacted in 1886. Chapter 375, Laws of Maryland 1886. That law flatly prohibited the wearing or carrying of concealed pistols by an individual who was not a \u201cconservator of the peace,\u201d as well as the open wearing or carrying of pistols with the intent to cause injury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This strict prohibition did not last long, however. Eight years later, the General Assembly \u2014 noting that the law \u201cdoes not make proper discrimination in favor of those who travel in dangerous localities, or from other imminent necessity, or prudent precaution in the presence of threatened injury to their lives or persons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>may reasonably arm themselves for self-protection\u201d \u2014 added a broad exception for carrying the weapon \u201cas a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger.\u201d Chapter 547, Laws of Maryland 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">That proviso persisted throughout the statute\u2019s various iterations until 1972. In the early 1970s, handgun use resulting in death and serious injuries had risen to troubling levels in the State. In January 1972, the Governor submitted emergency legislation to curb \u201cthe widespread carrying of handguns on the streets and in vehicles by persons who have no legitimate reason to carry them.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Senate Bill 205 (1972); House Bill 277 (1972). The cross-filed bills proposed a permitting scheme with a variety of exceptions for groups or individuals with a legitimate need to carry handguns. An exception to the general ban was made for those holding a permit to carry a weapon, as issued by the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police according to certain criteria set forth in the statute. Other exceptions pertained to on-duty law enforcement, military, or correctional personnel; various sporting activities; and those possessing handguns in their home or place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">As to the exception for residences and places of business, the bills as originally introduced provided: \u201cNothing in this section shall prevent a person from having in his presence any handgun within the confines of any dwelling, business establishment, or real estate owned or leased by him.\u201d Senate Bill 205 (1972), \u00a7 3 (first reader); House Bill 277 (1972), \u00a7 3 (first reader). This proviso was apparently added for purposes of self-defense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Some legislators, however, argued that the proposed exception for residences and businesses was inadequate in that it pertained only to the owner or lessor of the premises. Senator Newton I. Steers complained that \u201cit was legal for anybody to have one, or indeed, 50 pistols in his dwelling or his place of business. However, nobody could pick up one of these pistols ... unless he was a building owner or tenant; thus, when the homeowner leaves his house or the store owner leaves his store, any guns in the building are immobilized.\u201d Statement on Gun Control, Senator Newton I. Steers, Jr. (February 25, 1972), <em>available in </em>Legislative Reference Bill File for Handgun Control Bill (the \u201cBill File\u201d) (1972).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Senator Steers proposed to amend the provision in several respects. One such amendment would have substituted the following: \u201cNothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the placing, wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun anywhere within the confines of any building by a person who is the owner, tenant or custodian thereof, or who obtains the permission of that owner, tenant or custodian.\u201d Proposed Amendment to Senate Bill 205. This amendment would have narrowed the area within which a handgun could be carried from dwellings, business establishments, and real estate to \u201cbuildings\u201d; simultaneously, it would have expanded significantly the category of individuals who could carry a handgun within a building, leaving it to the owner or lessor\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Ultimately, a compromise was reached. An owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s ability to carry a handgun without a permit on owned or leased real estate was retained. The owner\u2019s or lessor\u2019s ability to endow others with that right was limited to \u201csupervisory employees\u201d of a business and restricted to the \u201cconfines of the business establishment,\u201d but not real estate generally. The provision ultimately adopted by the General Assembly read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">Nothing in this section shall prevent a person from wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun within the confines of real estate owned or leased by him or upon which he resides or within the confines of a business establishment owned or leased by him. Nothing in this section shall prevent a supervisory employee from wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun within the confines of a business establishment in which he is employed during such time as he is acting in the course of his employment and has been authorized to wear, carry, or transport the handgun by the owner or manager of the business establishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Chapter 13, Laws of Maryland 1972 <em>then codified at </em>Maryland Code, Article 27, \u00a7 36B(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Under the canons of statutory construction, \u201c[w]hen a general provision in a statute has certain limited exceptions, all doubts should be resolved in favor of the general provision rather than the exceptions.\u201d Norman J. Singer and J.D. Shambie, <em>Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>(2013), \u00a7 47:11 (internal footnote omitted). Thus, the supervisory employee exception should not be construed in a way that would defeat the purpose of the prohibition in the law. A contemporaneous interpretation by the Attorney General of this exception construed it narrowly and concluded that a supervisory employee was not entitled to transport a handgun between the business establishment and the employee\u2019s home. <em>See </em>57 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>502, 506 (1972). And this Court later confirmed that the purpose of the exception was for self-defense. <em>Montgomery County v. Atlantic Guns, Inc., </em>302 Md. 540, 545, 489 A.2d 1114 (1985) (\u201c[t]he purpose of this section is to permit those who believe a handgun is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>necessary to defend their lives or property at home or in their place of business to carry one on such premises\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In 2002, the law was recodified as part of the new Criminal Law Article with new language, but without substantive change, at its current codification. Chapter 26, Laws of Maryland 2002. As part of the recodification, the exception was split into two \u2014 one pertaining to owners and lessors (current CR \u00a7 4-203(b)(6)) and one pertaining to supervisory employees (current CR \u00a7 4-203(b)(7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\n<em>Consequences of Alternative Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Mr. Blue argues that \u201clogic and common sense\u201d compel a different result, because if he \u201cwere trying to apprehend someone who had just committed a violent crime inside the building, and the suspect was able to escape to the outside,\u201d he would be \u201crequired to either drop his gun at the door before continuing the chase outside, risking his own personal safety, or allow the suspect to escape.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He asserts that, if there was a fight in Irving\u2019s parking lot, an interpretation that restricts the exception to the nightclub itself would require him \u201cto leave his handgun inside the nightclub building before trying to intervene in the fight, or not intervene at all.\u201d These statements are undeniably correct, and, we believe, precisely the limitation the Legislature intended for a supervisory employee who is wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun without a handgun permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">As Judge Cole of this Court noted, \u201c[i]t is clear that the 1972 handgun control legislation is designed to discourage and punish the possession of handguns on the streets and public ways.\u201d <em>State v. Crawford, </em>308 Md. 683, 695, 521 A.2d 1193 (1987). The rationale was that \u201cby controlling the number of handguns in public, and not permitting citizens to carry guns when there is time for alternative, safe action, the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>sought to \u2018preserve the peace and tranquility of the State and to protect the rights and liberties of its citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The supervisory exception in the handgun law was not meant to confer on a business the power to deputize a private citizen who lacks a handgun permit as a law enforcement officer. It was not designed to permit an employee to chase suspects into public areas in order to \u201capprehend\u201d them, nor was the Legislature\u2019s aim to authorize private citizens to brandish a handgun and \u201cintervene\u201d in an altercation. Rather, the legislative history indicates that the purpose of allowing firearms <em>within the confines of business establishments </em>was to defend the business against <em>robberies </em>\u2014 i.e., for self-defense. Once a robber has fled the building, there is no longer a need for the employee to defend himself or other employees or patrons. In these circumstances, the employee should contact the authorities and leave to them the task of catching a robbery suspect or breaking up a parking-lot melee.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Mr. Blue asserts that, because the owner required the club\u2019s security guards to have a weapon, his job necessitated that he carry a handgun on the parking lot to be \u201ca deterrent to likely criminal elements\u201d and to halt \u201cillicit activities on the premises.\u201d To the extent that an individual employed as a private security guard believes that possession of a handgun is essential to carrying out his duties on the parking lot of his employer\u2019s business, that individual may apply for a handgun permit pursuant to Maryland Code, Public Safety Article, \u00a7 5-304. Indeed, if Mr. Blue had been certified under State law as a private security guard, he would have been required to obtain a handgun permit in order to be armed while performing that job. <em>See </em>COMAR 29.04.01.12D. Mr. Blue did not have a handgun permit and his right to carry a handgun was limited to the breadth of the supervisory employee exception. <em>Application of Similar Exceptions in other Jurisdictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Similar exceptions in handgun laws of other states are likewise not given an expansive construction. <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Scope and effect of exception, in statute forbidding carrying of weapons, as to person on his own premises </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>or <em>at his place of business, </em>57 A.L.R.3d 938 (1974, 2013 Supp.). Courts in a number of other jurisdictions have held that an exception to a ban on concealed weapons related to possession of the weapon in a home or business did not extend to outside areas adjacent to the home or business. <em>See, e.g., Marshall v. Walker, </em>958 F.Supp. 359, 363-64 (N.D.Ill.1997) (defendant who was outside of an apartment building he owned was not within statutory exception that allowed gun owner to carry weapon \u201con his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business\u201d); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>975 A.2d 791, 796 (Del.2009) (any right to carry handgun within home did not extend to defendant\u2019s property outside of home); <em>People v. Tolbert, </em>253 A.D.2d 832, 680 N.Y.S.2d 96, 97 (1998) (exception for home or place of business did not cover outdoor area); <em>Dunbar v. State, </em>162 Ind.App. 375, 319 N.E.2d 630, 632 (1974) (defendant not within exception that covered possession in \u201cplace of abode\u201d when defendant was in an alley adjacent to residence); <em>State v. Davidson, </em>217 N.W.2d 630, 631-32 (Iowa 1974) (defendant not within exception that covered possession \u201cin his dwelling house ... or other land possessed by him\u201d when defendant was in a common hallway adjacent to his apartment); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>418 S.W.2d 687, 688 (Tex.Crim.App.1967) (exception for a person\u2019s \u201cown premises\u201d did not extend to shared driveway of apartment building); <em>Sherrod v. State, </em>484 So.2d 1279, 1281-82 (Fla.App.1986) (exception for a person \u201cat his home\u201d did not cover person in the parking lot of his apartment building).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The supervisory employee exception to the handgun law allows such an employee to carry a handgun, with the employer\u2019s permission, within the enclosed premises of the business in which the employee works. As is evident from the statutory language and confirmed by the legislative history, the exception was not intended to include an unenclosed parking lot adjacent to a nightclub. When Mr. Blue left the \u201cconfines\u201d of the nightclub and took his handgun into the parking lot, he was no longer within the exception set forth in CR \u00a7 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>203(b)(7).

Plain Meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">It is quite common, as the Majority did, to look to dictionary definitions in order to ascertain the meaning behind statutory language. <em>See Montgomery Cnty. v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 67, 31 A.3d 191, 198 (2011). It is not often, however, that the Court explains why it consulted a particular dictionary. <em>See Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 260 n. 11, 884 A.2d 1171, 1181 n. 11 (2005). But as this Court has explained, \u201c[bjecause we are attempting to ascertain the intent of the Legislature in choosing certain language at a point in time, resort to a dictionary, legal or otherwise, should logically include consultation of those editions (in addition to current editions) of dictionaries that were extant at the time of the pertinent legislative enactments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Rossville Vending Mach. Corp. v. Comptroller of </em>Treasury, 97 Md.App. 305, 316-18, 629 A.2d 1283, 1289-90 (1993) (\u201cIt seems logical, at least in a linear way, that a popular dictionary of [the time in which a statute was enacted] would be an informative resource in attempting to arrive at a determination of what the ... Legislature intended by the usage of [a term in the applicable statute].\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">To this end, consultation of several dictionaries in use at the time this Legislation was enacted in 1972 provided useful direction. Notably, \u201cconfine\u201d was defined as \u201ca limit, end or boundary,\u201d <em>Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>244 (3d ed. 1969), and as \u201ca boundary or bounded region; border; limit,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary of the American Language </em>307-08 (Encyclopedia ed. 1951). There was no mention of \u201cwalls\u201d or \u201cbuilding\u201d in either definition. Current dictionary editions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>should also be consulted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One modern dictionary defined \u201cconfines\u201d as \u201cthe limits of an area: borders,\u201d and posed the example: \u201cwithin the <em>confines </em>of one\u2019s county.\u201d <em>Websters II New College Dictionary </em>242 (3d ed. 2005). Because the plain meaning of \u201cconfines\u201d does not require \u2014 and most of the time the definition does not even mention \u2014 walls or a building, it is reasonable to interpret \u201cconfines\u201d to include the borders of a business, such as a parking lot or fenced-in area surrounding any building in which the business is operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The next logical inquiry is the plain meaning of \u201cbusiness establishment.\u201d Again to reference dictionaries in use at the time the legislation was enacted, \u201cestablishment\u201d has been defined as \u201c[t]he place in which one is permanently fixed for residence or business; ... any office or place of business, with its fixtures,\u201d <em>Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>418 (3d ed. 1969), and \u201cplace of business and fixtures; residence with grounds, furnishings, equipage, etc.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>643 (4th ed. 1951). More recently, \u201cestablishment\u201d has been defined as \u201c[a] place of business, including its possessions and employees.\u201d <em>Websters II New College </em>Dictionary 392 (3d ed. 2005). Because it is unclear whether \u201cestablishment\u201d includes the real estate a business sits on, resort to the use of the phrase in Maryland law provides further guidance. Maryland\u2019s use of the phrase in its regulations of business signs is most enlightening. There, \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d include gas stations, restaurants with drive-in outdoor stalls, and campgrounds, all of which are establishments that are not limited to a single building with four walls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> COMAR 11.04.10.04, .05, .07.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Based on the plain meaning of the term \u201cwithin the confines of a business establishment,\u201d in the context of \u00a7 4-203(b)(7) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the Criminal Law Article, reason supports the conclusion that an adjacent private parking lot is within the boundaries in which a supervisory employee may carry a handgun. Delving further into our precepts of statutory construction, consideration of the legislative purpose, legislation that was not adopted by the General Assembly, and the adverse consequences of any other construction are particularly helpful tools to elucidate this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">II. Legislative Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The Majority reads a limitation into the statute that does not exist, a conclusion that is strengthened by an inquiry into the legislative purpose behind Md. Code (1972, 1976 Repl. Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 36B(c)(4) (now \u00a7\u00a7 4-203(b)(6)-(7) of the Criminal Law Article). As the Majority articulates in its opinion, \u00a7\u00a7 4-203(b)(6) and (b)(7) of the Criminal Law Article were initially codified as one provision under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(c)(4)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It therefore follows to interpret (b)(7) in light of (b)(6). Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(c)(4) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">Nothing in this section shall prevent a person from wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun within the confines of real estate owned or leased by him or upon which he resides or within the confines of a business establishment owned or leased by him. Nothing in this section shall prevent a supervisory employee from wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun within the confines of a business establishment in which he is employed during such time as he is acting in the course of his employment and has been authorized to wear, carry or transport the handgun by the owner or manager of the business establishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The General Assembly made clear that the purpose underlying the enactment of this regulatory scheme was to curb \u201cthe [high] number of violent crimes perpetrated in Maryland,\u201d a \u201csubstantial increase ... which is traceable, in large part, to the carrying of handguns on the streets and public ways by persons inclined to use them in criminal activity.\u201d Art. 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u00a7 36B (a). \u201cTo effectuate that policy, the Legislature generally made it unlawful for persons to wear, carry or transport handguns ... [but] also provide[d] certain limited exceptions to the prohibition.\u201d <em>Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 142, 497 A.2d 1143, 1151 (1985). The supervisory employee exception, obviously, falls within the exception created \u201cfor ... <em>business protection if confined to the real estate owned or leased by the persons having the handguns. </em>\u201d <em>See Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 143, 497 A.2d at 1152 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The Majority cites <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Atlantic Guns, Inc., </em>302 Md. 540, 489 A.2d 1114 (1985), to explain the legislative purpose. I agree that in <em>Atlantic Guns, </em>we said that \u201c[t]he purpose of ... section [36B(c)(4), now \u00a7\u00a7 4 \u2014 203(b)(6)\u2014 (7) of the Criminal Law Article] is to permit those, who believe that a handgun is necessary to defend their lives or ... their place of business, to carry one on such premises.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] \u201d 302 Md. at 545, 489 A.2d at 1116. This exception, however, cannot be read reasonably to mean that \u201cbusiness premises\u201d or \u201cwithin the confines of the real estate owned\u201d is limited only to the interior of buildings located on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Additionally, it is not unusual for this Court to consider legislation that was not adopted in order to confirm legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Stearman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>381 Md. 436, 455-56, 849 A.2d 539, 551 (2004) (discussing the introduction of bills in the General Assembly that were not enacted during an analysis of legislative intent); <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 229, 858 A.2d 484, 491 (2004) (concluding that because a home detention statute was not adopted at the time, it was unlikely that the Legislature contemplated home detention when it used \u201cplace of confinement\u201d in the relevant statute). Had the legislature intended for a supervisory em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ployee\u2019s right to carry a handgun to stop at the entryway of a building, it would have and could have said so. In fact, Senator Newton I. Steers, Jr. proposed an amendment that would unambiguously mean just what the Majority holds is the correct interpretation of the present statute, yet this amendment failed before the Maryland Senate. The amendment read: \u201c(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the placing, wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun anywhere <em>within the confines of any building </em>by a person who is the owner, tenant or custodian thereof, or who obtains the permission of that owner, tenant, or custodian.\u201d Senator Steers, Amendment to Senate Bill 205 (emphasis added). The General Assembly chose not to adopt the language \u201cof any building\u201d in its final version of the statute, which would have made the Majority\u2019s reading of the statute persuasive; instead, it adopted the phrase \u201cwithin the confines of a business establishment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Moreover, this Court has previously charged that in interpreting a statute we should \u201cavoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Blake, </em>395 Md. at 224, 909 A.2d at 1026. The Majority erroneously dismisses Petitioner\u2019s \u201clogic[al] and common sense\u201d approach to the appropriate statutory interpretation. Petitioner poses the hypothetical that \u201cif there was a fight in Irvin\u2019s parking lot, it would have been natural for [Petitioner] and other security to intervene,\u201d but that with the Majority\u2019s interpretation, \u201c[Petitioner] would have been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>quired to either drop his gun at the door before continuing ... outside, risking his own personal safety,\u201d or to not go outside at all. It does not follow that this outcome is \u201cprecisely the limitation the Legislature intended,\u201d as the Majority suggests. Ordinarily, \u201cin seeking to ascertain legislative intent, [the Court] may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986). The General Assembly could not have intended for a security guard, hired for the purpose of protecting the business establishment, and given the intensive nature of his or her duties, to drop a loaded weapon at the door of the building before going out into the parking lot of the business to break up a fight or to inspect a disturbance occurring on the premises. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Chief Judge BELL (ret.) and Judge ADKINS join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\">. The Majority cites <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>1355 (1987), which defines \"confines\u201d as \"something (as borders or walls) that encloses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">. The Majority draws a distinction between enclosed business establishments and \u201copen air\u201d business establishments. In doing so, the Majority reads into the statute its own limitation on the application of the supervisory employee exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">. Majority Op. at 695-96, 76 A.3d at 1137.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. The generally-accepted definition of premises is \"a house or building, along with its grounds.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1219 (8th ed. 2004); <em>see Giant Food, Inc. v. Dept. of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, </em>356 Md. 180, 192, 738 A.2d 856, 862 (1999) (defining premises as: \u201ca. a tract of land including its buildings, b. a building together with its grounds or other appurtenances, c. the property forming the subject of a conveyance or bequest\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">. Also included in the Bill File is an additional proposal by Senator Steers, which was likewise not adopted by the General Assembly. That amendment read: \"Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the placing, wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun anywhere <em>within the confines of any building </em>by a person who is the owner ... or by a tenant <em>within that portion of the building </em>of which he is the tenant, or <em>by a person left in charge of part or all of a building by the owner or tenant, </em>in that portion of the building of which he is left in charge.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, Senator Steers advocated for the terms, \"confines,\u201d to a \"building\u201d or \"portion of a building\u201d (much more narrow language than \"confines of a business establishment\u201d) to be included in the statute. Senator Steers\u2019s more narrow language was not adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
