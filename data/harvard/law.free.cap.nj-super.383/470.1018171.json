We hold that they cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The more precise questions posed are (a) whether making the statements to the landlord\u2019s employee constituted publication to a third party for purposes of a defamation claim, (b) whether this State\u2019s public policy to protect residential tenants precludes a landlord from suing a tenant in defamation for complaints made to the landlord\u2019s agent about the landlord, and (c) whether the tenant\u2019s statements are actionable if the landlord\u2019s agent does not believe them.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">This case arises from a series of bitter disputes between a tenant, Eleanor Capograsso, and Lefrak Organization, Inc., which was responsible for constructing the apartment complex in which she lived and which was the parent of the corporation that operated the building. We briefly review the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Plaintiffs, 30 River Court East Urban Renewal Company and its corporate parent, Lefrak Organization, Inc., sued defendant, Eleanor Capograsso, for defamation; she counterclaimed, asserting that the lawsuit was filed in retaliation for her activities with a tenant organization. She also filed a separate complaint against Lefrak, 30 River Court East, and several municipal, State and Federal entities. The gist of her complaint was that Lefrak had permitted her and other tenants to move into an apartment building before construction was finished, thus subjecting them to safety hazards and severe inconvenience. The two cases were consolidated. After defendant violated discovery orders, her answer was suppressed and her complaint and counterclaims were dismissed. The trial court held a proof hearing limited to plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal indicated that she was appealing from two April 30, 2004 trial court orders which addressed only the trial court\u2019s decision in favor of plaintiffs on their defamation claim. Defendant\u2019s affirmative claims against the plaintiffs and against State and municipal defendants were dismissed by the terms of earlier orders that were not included in her notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>appeal. Therefore those orders are not 'within the scope of her appeal, and we will not address them. <em>See R. </em>2:5 \u2014 l(f)(3)(i); <em>Fusco v. Bd. of Educ. of Newark, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 460-62, 793 A.2d 856 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>544, 810 A.2d 64 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">These are the pertinent facts. Defendant, Eleanor Capograsso,-was a tenant in the Presidential Plaza Towers complex, which is owned by a subsidiary of the Lefrak Organization. She lived in the 30 River Court East Tower building. According to Angel Class, the concierge at 30 River Court East Tower, on March 11, 2001, defendant called the front desk numerous times with assorted complaints. Her first complaint, at 8:15 a.m., concerned an allegation that the snow had not been properly removed from \u201cthe ring road and the sidewalks [around the complex].\u201d Class testified that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">made approximately 20 phone calls to the front desk within a matter of an hour ... In those conversations she was just ranting. Then she went on to say that ... she knew that Lefrak had hired some goons to drive her off the West Side Highway ... Then she went on to say, I\u2019m aware that the Lefrak Organization has been going through my mail. I\u2019d try to explain to her that no one has access to the mail room but the Postal Service. And she went on ... a [tirade] stating that she knew that the Lefraks had access to that room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Class testified that defendant also told him he was unfit to have his job, and that the apartment staff were \u201ca bunch of low lives [sic]\u201d who did not know what they were doing. After trying to respond to her concerns, Class finally hung up on her. He then reported his conversations with defendant to his supervisor and made an entry in the log book. He testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">[ajnything and everything is logged in that book, whether it\u2019s a food delivery, a car service picking up a tenant, a conversation with a tenant that we deem or the concierge deems necessary to log in there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Class testified that he was employed by 30 East Hampton Renewal Corporation. When asked if he considered the Lefrak Organization to be his employer, Class responded that Lefrak was \u201cpart of the corporation that owns the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Ferm\u00edn Garcia, who was the general manager of the apartment complex and Class\u2019 supervisor, testified that he worked for the real estate management company that managed the building on behalf of the Lefrak Organization. He confirmed that the real estate management company was \u201ca Lefrak company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Garcia testified that defendant was a \u201c[ujniquely difficult\u201d tenant who made frequent complaints and spoke to the staff in abusive terms. He described her multiple complaints about construction and noise in the building as \u201cbabbling.\u201d Significantly, he also testified that the apartment\u2019s management invited and encouraged tenants to communicate their concerns about any tenancy issue to the doorman or concierge by calling the front desk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">[I]n our buildings everyone ... the superintendent, the concierge desk, our Management Office and porters throughout the building have walkie talkies ... So, the point that I\u2019m making there simply is that if with such means of communication, if Ms. Capograsso or any other tenant .. has a request for a clogged toilet, tub or what have you, they call the desk. She would call the desk. The door ... person, doorman in this particular case, would say, you know, Apartment 301 has a clogged toilet, tub, what have you. And within the hour ... this work would be performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Garcia also testified that after defendant made numerous complaints directly to him, he asked her to stop calling his pager and instead to \u201cmake an appointment\u201d if she wanted to talk to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Garcia testified that when Class reported to him that defendant had called the front desk multiple times on March 11, 2001, and that she had made the statement concerning Lefrak hiring \u201cgoons to drive her off the West Side Highway,\u201d Garcia sent her a letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asv\">essentially a cease and desist letter, advising her, you know, buzz off, if you don\u2019t have a life ... find a life, go to the museum. It was ... that oppressive for the staff .. so I sent her a letter telling her [to] leave my staff alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Neither Garcia nor Class testified that they believed defendant\u2019s statements about the \u201cgoons\u201d or about Lefrak\u2019s access to her mail. Their testimony indicated that they regarded these statements as the \u201cranting\u201d or exaggerated complaints of a particularly excitable and difficult tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">There is no dispute that Capograsso had had a long-running series of disputes with the landlord concerning conditions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>apartment building, stemming in large part from the fact that the building was still under construction although tenants were living on the lower floors. She had also participated in creating a tenants\u2019 organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In an oral opinion issued on March 4, 2004, the trial judge concluded that Lefrak and the management company had \u201ca parent subsidiary relationship\u201d and were \u201cone entity\u201d for purposes of the litigation. He concluded that defendant\u2019s statements to Class concerning Lefrak hiring \u201cgoons to run her off the West Side Highway\u201d and \u201c[gjoing through her mail,\u201d were defamatory per se, because they accused Lefrak of committing crimes. He reasoned that defendant \u201caccused Lefrak of a specific illegal act that reflects negatively on and could adversely affect the company\u2019s reputation.\u201d And \u201c[rjegardless of the obvious illegality, no tenant would want a landlord to read their mail.\u201d He also concluded that these statements were false, based on the testimony of Class. Finally, he concluded that the statements were \u201cpublished\u201d because they were spoken \u201cto Mr. Class, a person other than the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">While we will defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings so long as they are supported by sufficient, credible evidence in the record, our review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions is de novo. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>Manalapan Realty v. Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). Employing that standard, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Lefrak and its subsidiary should be treated as one entity for purposes of the litigation. Therefore, we refer to Lefrak as the landlord. We part company with the trial court on the issue of whether Capograsso\u2019s statements about Lefrak, made to the concierge of her building, constituted defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>A. Publication to a Third Party</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The tort of defamation requires that plaintiff prove \u201cpublication\u201d of a slanderous statement. \u201cSince the law of defamation seeks to secure reputation, there must be a communication to a third person.\u201d <em>Gnapinsky v. Goldyn, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>243, 252, 128 A.2d 697 (1957). The first issue is whether Capograsso\u2019s statements to Class amounted to \u201cpublication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Since there is no New Jersey case law directly on point, we first consider the development of the law as reflected in other sources, beginning with the <em>Restatement. </em>According to the <em>Restatement,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">the communication to a servant or agent of the person defamed is a publication although if the communication is in answer to a letter or a request from the other or his agent, the publication may not be actionable in defamation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\"><em>[Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 577, comment e (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In some jurisdictions, the requirement that the communication come in response to a \u201crequest\u201d has been construed as extending to an agent whose official responsibilities include receiving such communications. Thus, in <em>McDaniel v. Crescent Motors, Inc., 249 Ala. </em>330, 31 So.2d 343 (1947), the Supreme Court of Alabama held that critical statements, which a supervisor made about a bus driver in a conversation with the driver\u2019s union representative, were not actionable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">Publication is essential to slander, and it must be in the presence of one or more other parties. So that if the words were spoken only to the complaining party or to his agent, representing him in the matter discussed and invited by him, it is not such a publication as will support an action for slander. This includes one who is interceding for the employee as his authorized agent and representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 344; citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-12\"><em>See also Mims v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>200 <em>F.2&amp; </em>800, 802 (5th Cir.1952), <em>cert, denied, </em>345 <em>U.S. </em>940, 73 <em>S.Ct. </em>831, 97 <em>L.Ed. </em>1366 (1953) (\u201c[I]f the language complained of was uttered only to the complaining party or to his agent representing him in the matter discussed in the communication, it is not such a publication as will support an action for slander. Particularly is this true where the communication was solicited by the plaintiff or his agent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Following <em>McDaniel, </em>the Indiana Court of Appeals held, in a case with sinhlar facts, that \u201cpublication to an agent of plaintiff who is acting at plaintiffs behest and on his behalf is tantamount to a publication to plaintiff himself, and as such does not fulfill the publication requirement.\u201d <em>Brockman v. Detroit Diesel Allison Div. of Gen. Motors Corp., </em>174 <em>Ind.App. </em>240, 366 N.E.2d 1201, 1203 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The courts of New Jersey have not addressed the specific issue presented here. In <em>Mick v. American Dental Association, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262,139 A.2d 570 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>74, 141 A.2d 318 (1958), the plaintiff, a dentist, asked a fellow practitioner to write a letter to the American Dental Association inquiring about plaintiffs reputation. When the Association wrote back with an unflattering assessment, plaintiff sued for defamation. We cited <em>McDaniel, supra, </em>in concluding that \u201c[w]hen the publication of defamatory matter has been invited, instigated or procured by the one defamed, or by someone acting on his behalf, he generally cannot be heard to complain of the resulting injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275,139 A.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Beck v. Tribert, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>335, 711 A.2d 951 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>424, 719 A.2d 1022 (1998). There an employee asked several of his friends to pose as prospective employers and contact his former employer for references about him. Relying on the <em>Restatement, </em>\u00a7 577, comment e, and on <em>Mick, </em>we concluded that the former employer\u2019s negative statements to plaintiffs friends were not \u201cpublished\u201d to a third party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Tribert also made defamatory statements to plaintiffs friends, Halley and Donnell, who posed as prospective employers. These statements also do not form the basis for a slander claim <em>because they were not published. </em>The <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 577 cmt. e, at 203 (1977), provides that \u201cthe communication to a servant or agent of the person defamed is a publication although if the communication is in answer to a letter or a request from the other or his agent, the publication may not be actionable in defamation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">[Id at 350, 711 A.2d 951; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In <em>Murphy v. Johns-Manville Products Corporation, </em>45 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 490, 133 A.2d 34 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>55, 134 A.2d 833 (1957), we analyzed the issue of intra-company distribution of employee information in terms of qualified privilege rather than publication. There, an employee, who had been fired for stealing company supplies, claimed that he was defamed when the employer sent copies of the minutes of his union grievance hearing to several company managers and sent a letter summarizing the company\u2019s decision to his union president. While noting that we would follow \u00a7 577 comment e of the <em>Restatement </em>if we were to reach the issue of publication, we decided the case on the issue of qualified privilege instead; we held that the employer could claim a qualified privilege, because it acted pursuant to a duty to distribute the minutes to persons within the company who had an interest in seeing them, and pursuant to a duty to notify the union president of management\u2019s decision on the grievance. <em>Id. </em>at 489-92,133 A.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We conclude that the <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 577 comment e, and the cases that follow the <em>Restatement, </em>are the most appropriate precedent here. We also agree with <em>Beck, supra, </em>that invited communications to an agent are not \u201cpublished\u201d for defamation purposes. Accordingly we apply that analysis to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Based on the undisputed record, we have no hesitation in concluding that Lefrak was the landlord, and that Class was the landlord\u2019s agent. The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that 30 River Court East Urban Renewal Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Lefrak Organization, Inc., and that plaintiffs should be treated as one entity for purposes of the lawsuit. Further, the undisputed record reveals that Class, as the concierge, was authorized to accept complaints from tenants. And the building superintendent, Garcia, testified that he encouraged tenants, including plaintiff specifically, to voice complaints by calling the concierge at the front desk rather than by calling Garcia directly. Hence, we conclude that the landlord, through its superintendent, invited and directed plaintiff to make any complaints concerning the tenancy to Class.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>We also conclude that plaintiffs statements related directly to her tenancy, insofar as they expressed her views, rational or not, that the landlord was out to get her by hiring \u201cgoons\u201d to persecute her and by opening her mail. Coming as they did, in the midst of a general tirade about her tenancy problems, her statements about the landlord can be construed no other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We conclude that a landlord, having designated an agent to accept tenant complaints, cannot sue a tenant in defamation for complaining to the agent. Tenant complaints to a landlord\u2019s designated agent, such as a concierge or superintendent, are implicitly if not explicitly invited. Even if they are complaints about the landlord and not specifically about the building itself, so long as they are made to the landlord\u2019s agent, they are within the scope of the invitation. And because the agent is merely a stand-in or conduit for the landlord, the agent is not a \u201cthird party\u201d for defamation purposes. Communications to the agent are in effect communications to the landlord and are not \u201cpublished\u201d to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">This construction of comment e to \u00a7 577 of the <em>Restatement </em>is consistent with common sense and with the purpose of the law of defamation to protect reputation. Where an agent\u2019s duty includes taking customer complaints on behalf of the agent\u2019s principal, there is little likelihood that any complaints the customer makes about the principal will affect the principal\u2019s reputation. This is because the agent\u2019s duty of loyalty to the principal makes it most likely that the agent will communicate the complaints to the principal and will not publish them to third parties outside the agent-principal relationship. Further, as in this case, one whose duty is to take customer complaints is highly likely to regard outrageous customer statements with skepticism, again diminishing the likelihood that the principal\u2019s reputation will be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We recognize that customer service communications could also be analyzed using the \u201cqualified privilege\u201d doctrine discussed in <em>Murphy, supra, </em>and in \u00a7 593 of the <em>Restatement. See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 593. But we choose the \u201cinvited com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>munication\u201d approach of \u00a7 577 comment e, as we have construed it, because it achieves the correct result with a less complex analysis and will therefore be easier to apply. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 577 comment e.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">B. State legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Our conclusion, that tenant complaints are not actionable in defamation, is consistent with State law. The Legislature has expressed in no uncertain terms the policy of this State to protect tenants against substandard housing conditions. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>55:13A-1 to -28; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>55:13A-2 (declaring the purpose of the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law \u201cto assure the provision ... of decent, standard and safe units of dwelling space.\u201d) To that end, the owner of a multiple dwelling is legally required to make an agent available to take tenant complaints concerning emergencies and necessary repairs. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>55:13A-12 (requiring multiple dwelling owners to file a certificate of registration with Commissioner of Community Affairs and to post a copy in the lobby of the premises); <em>N.J.SA </em>46:8-29 (landlord must give copy of registration statement to each tenant); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:10-1.11(18) and (19) (registration statement must include \u201c[t]he name and address, including the dwelling unit, apartment or room number, of any person employed by the owner or managing agent to provide regular maintenance service\u201d and \u201c[t]he name, address and telephone number of an individual representative of the owner or managing agent who may be contacted at any time and who has authority to make emergency decisions concerning the building and any repair thereto or expenditure in connection therewith\u201d); <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:10-11.1 to -11.3 (maintenance and janitorial services required, duties and responsibilities of manager).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Further, consistent with the Anti-Eviction Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2 A: 18-61.1, a residential tenant may withhold rent from a landlord where, after receiving notice from the tenant, the landlord fails to repair significant defects in the rented premises. <em>See Marini v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Ireland, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>130, 146-47, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); <em>Berzito v. Gambino, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>460, 469-70, 308 A.2d 17 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that landlords are required by law to invite communications from their tenants, either directly or through a superintendent or concierge. And tenants must be able to bring problems to a landlord\u2019s attention without having to worry that if they complain too stridently the landlord will sue them for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">C. The listener\u2019s belief</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Finally, we address defendant\u2019s alternate contention concerning the agent\u2019s belief or disbelief of her statements. Relying on <em>Ricciardi v. Weber, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 478, 795 A.2d 914 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>433, 815 A.2d 479 (2003), defendant contends that her statements were not actionable because Class did not believe them. In <em>Ricciardi, </em>a ease involving statements that were not per se defamatory, we stated that \u201c[t]here ... can be no defamation if the recipients of the alleged defamation did not believe the statements.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We cited <em>Nanavati v. Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, </em>857 F.2d 96, 109 (3d Cir.1988), <em>cert, denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1078, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1528, 103 L.Ed.2,d 834 (1989), in support of our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We find <em>Nanavati </em>instructive. <em>Nanavati </em>involved a bitter feud between two doctors at a local hospital. In one of the alleged defamatory incidents, Dr. Nanavati made a statement about his nemesis, Dr. Sorenson, that would have constituted slander per se, because it cast aspersion on Dr. Sorenson in \u201chis business, trade, profession or office.\u201d <em>Gnapinsky v. Goldyn, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>243, 250, 128 A.2d 697 (1957). Nonetheless, the court cogently analyzed the matter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">While testifying at trial, an EKG technician, Ann O\u2019Neil, provided surprise testimony that Nanavati called Sorensen a \u201csenile old doctor that had been there [the Hospital] for 20 years Mlling patients.\u201d ... The statement was uttered in the course of a November 1985 conversation in which Nanavati complained to O\u2019Neil that Sorensen had a locked drawer in which to keep his prescription pads but that he, Nanavati, did not. O\u2019Neil testified that she was the only one to hear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>comment alleging Sorensen\u2019s incompetence and senility and did not believe it. Additionally, she testified that when she challenged Nanavati, he asserted: \u201cThat\u2019s not opinion, that\u2019s facts.\u201d Finally, O\u2019Neil testified that she wrote the statement down and two days later gave it to her superior at the Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">Upon hearing O\u2019Neil\u2019s testimony, Sorensen successfully moved for leave to amend, over objection, to add this statement as a ground for his defamation claim. Nanavati claims that the mid-trial amendment was an abuse of discretion. He also submits that the statement to O\u2019Neil caused no injury. <em>In our view, the inju/ry alleged here borders on the metaphysical. The facts indicate that no one who heard the slander believed it, and those who repeated the slander did so only to express outrage at the speaker. </em>The entire situation seems more like a fiendish law school hypothetical gone amok than a compensable claim for slander. We believe that New Jersey would not compensate for slander under these facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\"><em>[Nanavati, supra, </em>857 <em>F.2d </em>at 109; emphasis added; citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">We agree with this analysis and find it applicable here. Neither Class nor his supervisor Garcia testified that they believed Capo-grasso\u2019s statements about the landlord hiring \u201cgoons\u201d and going through her mail. From their testimony, we conclude that no reasonable trier of fact could conclude otherwise than that they both dismissed her statements as the \u201cranting\u201d of an irritable, irrational and \u201cuniquely difficult\u201d tenant. <em>See Ward v. Zelikovsky, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>516, 532-33, 643 A.2d 972 (1994) (insults are less likely to be perceived as true statements when made in the midst of an angry outburst). In context, neither statement had even a remote possibility of causing harm to the landlord\u2019s reputation, and for that reason they cannot support a claim for defamation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">We do not condone Capograsso\u2019s abusive conduct toward the staff of her apartment complex. Indeed we echo the comments of the Supreme Court in <em>Ward, swpra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">There is a regrettable rudeness in our society today. Social and public discourse is marked by uncivility and boorishness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>[136 <em>N.J. </em>at 542, 643 A.2d 972.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">But legal precedent and common sense lead us to conclude that the statements she made to her landlord\u2019s agent, complaining about the landlord\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct toward her as a tenant, are not actionable as defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The Supreme Court has acknowledged criticism of the doctrine of slander per se and has cautioned \u201cagainst further expansion of the highly-criticized <em>per se </em>categories,\" <em>Ward, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 643 A.2d 972, noting \u201c[w]e leave for another time whether we should eliminate slander <em>per se.\u201d Id. </em>at 541, 643 A.2d 972. <em>See also Biondi v.
