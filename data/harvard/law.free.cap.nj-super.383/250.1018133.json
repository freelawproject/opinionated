An Order Approving Settlement was entered on June 25, 2002, awarding him 100% of total permanent disability with second injury fund participation, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-95. At the time of his injury, Wayne\u2019s wages were $900 per week, entitling him to a compensation rate from respondent, Jackson Township, of $539 per week for 225 weeks, commencing March 19, 2002, and ending July 11, 2006. Because Wayne was receiving Social Security disability benefits, respondent was entitled to a credit, pursuant to <em>N.J.SA </em>34:15-95.5, in the amount of $155.41 per week, thus reducing Wayne\u2019s award to $383.59 for the designated period. The June 2002 Order Approving Settlement reflected the Social Security Disability benefits offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">On February 8, 2003, Wayne died from causes unrelated to his injury. He was fifty-four years of age. Because Wayne had not reached the age of sixty-two, his Social Security Disability benefits terminated as of February 1, 2003. His widow, Patricia, applied to the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation to modify the Order Approving Settlement, seeking to delete the $115.41 per week offset, requiring respondent to pay the full compensation rate for the remainder of the designated period. Respondent opposed Patricia\u2019s application, asserting that Patricia\u2019s rights derive from <em>N.J.SA. </em>34:15-12e, entitling her to \u201cthe remaining payments,\u201d thereby limiting her to the amount she was getting under the June 2003 Order Approving Settlement. The compensation judge disagreed and found that, under <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-13, Patricia was entitled to the full compensation rate Wayne would have received if his Social Security Disability had been terminated. On February 1, 2005, the judge entered an order requiring respondent to pay $539 per week from the date of petitioner\u2019s death until July 11, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>On appeal, respondent reprises its argument previously made before the Division. Relying upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12e, specifically the use of the words \u201cremaining payments,\u201d respondent contends that Patricia is not entitled to a modification of the award to make up for the Social Security Benefits no longer received, but is instead limited to the \u201cremaining payments\u201d set forth in the initial award. We disagree and hold that the Social Security Benefits offset under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-95.5 does not continue where petitioner\u2019s dependent no longer receives those benefits because they terminated on petitioner\u2019s death. Accordingly, we affirm the order requiring respondent to pay the full compensation rate from the date of petitioner\u2019s death through the end of the designated period.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The basic principles governing appellate review of Workers\u2019 Compensation decisions are well settled. When reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s decision based upon the evidence, we are required to determine whether, as in any non-jury case, the agency\u2019s findings reasonably could have been reached on the basis of sufficient credible evidence in the record, with due regard to the agency\u2019s expertise. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). The agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, however, although entitled to some weight, is not binding on the reviewing court. <em>Carpet Remnant Warehouse, Inc. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>567, 587, 593 A.2d 1177 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act) is \u201chumane social legislation designed to place the cost of a work connected injury upon the employer who may readily provide for it as an operating expense.\u201d <em>Tocci v. Tessler &amp; Weiss, Inc., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>582, 586,147 A.2d 783 (1959). \u201cIt has long been axiomatic ... that the Act is remedial social legislation and should be given liberal construction in order that its beneficent purposes may be accomplished.\u201d <em>Kahle v. Plochman, Inc., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>539, 547, 428 A.2d 913 (1981). Thus, the Act has consistently been accorded liberal construction. <em>Brock v. Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>378, 383, 693 A.2d 894 (1997). That being said, the preference toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>liberal construction must nevertheless \u201cbe constrained by the plain meaning of the statute and the underlying purpose of the legislature.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We begin our analysis with the Social Security Act offset provision, which mandates that disability benefits for any month shall be reduced to the point where the combined Social Security and periodic Workers\u2019 Compensation benefit does not exceed eighty percent of the individual\u2019s average current earnings. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 424a(2). Section 424a(d), however, provides for an exception for those states that enacted laws, on or before February 18, 1981, requiring a reduction in the amount of Workers\u2019 Compensation benefit payments by the federal disability benefits received. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>424a(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe clear intent of the statute was to preserve and protect a level of income for the disabled employee while avoiding a duplication of benefits irrespective of the cause of the disability.\u201d <em>Krysztoforski v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 857, 860 (3d Cir.1995); <em>see Richardson v. Belcher, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>78, 83, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>254, 258, 30 L.Ed.2d 231, 236 (1971) (purpose of federal offset provision is to reduce excessive benefit payments by \u201climiting total state and federal benefits to 80% of [pre-disability earnings]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-95.5, effective August 21,1980, provides in pertinent part that compensation benefits received by an employee under <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-12(b) or 34:15-95 \u201cshall be reduced by an amount equal to the disability benefits payable under the Federal ... Disability Insurance Act.\u201d The provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-95.5 \u201ccomplement[ ] the set-off provision of the Social Security Act\u201d requiring that federal disability benefits be reduced by compensation benefits unless, under state law, compensation benefits are required to be reduced by federal disability payments. <em>Fiore v. Trident Constr. Co., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>101, 103, 597 A.2d 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(App.Div.1991), <em>Ries v. Harry Kane Inc., </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185, 478 A.2d 1195 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-12(b) established the compensation rate to be paid for \u201cdisability total in character and permanent in quali-ty____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(e) provides in relevant part that in \u201ccase of the death of the person from any cause other than the accident or occupational disease, during the period of payments for permanent injury, <em>the remaining payments </em>shall be paid to such of the deceased person\u2019s dependents as are included in the provisions of E.S. 34:15-13 ....\u201d (emphasis added). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-13 includes a decedent petitioner\u2019s surviving spouse as a dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In <em>Metro Glass &amp; Glazing Inc. v. Orona, </em>868 P.2d 1178 (Colo.Ct.App.1994), the Colorado Court of Appeals was faced with a similar fact pattern. The decedent, who was permanently and totally disabled, was receiving Social Security disability benefits in addition to his compensation benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 1179. The Social Security benefits terminated on his death and the issue was whether the petitioner\u2019s dependent widow should be subject to the offset or receive full dependent compensation payments. The Colorado statute did not speak to what rate should be paid in terms of the existence or nonexistence of Social Security offsets. <em>Ibid. </em>Noting the principle that the \u201csocial security offset exists to avoid a duplication of benefits,\u201d the Colorado Court of Appeals concluded, \u201callowance of the offset would result in an absolute decrease in the amount of support received by [petitioner\u2019s] wholly dependent widow ... a result [which] would be manifestly inequitable and contrary to the beneficent purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">As in the Colorado legislation, the use of the words \u201cremaining payments\u201d in our statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation. Considering the intent of the offset legislation to preserve and protect a level of income while avoiding duplication and the remedial and beneficent purpose of the Act, we come to the same inescapable conclusion, as the Colorado Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>peals. Simply stated, neither our Legislature nor Congress intended the Social Security disability benefit offset to continue after a dependent spouse is no longer receiving the very benefit that gave rise to the offset in the first place. To do so would penalize a dependent spouse unfairly, contrary to the purpose of the Act. As a dependent spouse, petitioner\u2019s widow is entitled to the full measure of compensation petitioner would have received had he not been receiving Social Security disability benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the Order of February 2, 2005, deleting the offset and requiring respondent to pay petitioner\u2019s dependent spouse the full compensation rate of $539 per week from the date of petitioner\u2019s death to the end of the designated period.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> Alaska, Kansas, Montana, Oregon, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, New Hampshire, California, Louisiana, New Jersey, Utah, Colorado, Maine, New York, Washington, District Of Columbia, Michigan, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Florida, Minnesota, and Ohio, are the only states that have taken advantage of the exception. <em>Larson's Workers' Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 157.03D.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
