(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Defendant, Dr. Thomas R. Howard, Jr., appeals from his conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a), after a trial de novo in the Law Division. The primary issue presented on appeal is whether the State is required to prove that a defendant has been advised of his or her right to independent testing pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c) and (d) in order to sustain a conviction of a per se violation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a). Because we conclude that the State is not required to present such proofs as an element of the offense, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">On December 13, 2003, at approximately 2:00 a.m., defendant was operating a motor vehicle eastbound on Hollywood Avenue, Township of Carney\u2019s Point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was proceeding home, having just left the Italian Kitchen Restaurant where he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>consumed alcoholic beverages commencing at 10:00 p.m., the evening prior. Following directly behind defendant was an individual operating a red vehicle. Corporal Ogbin, who had been driving a police vehicle in the opposite direction, turned his car around, and followed the two automobiles. While behind the red vehicle, Ogbin observed defendant\u2019s car \u201ccross the center line\u201d and \u201creturnO to the proper lane of travel and immediately cross[] the shoulder line, and then turn[] ... and then return[] to the proper lane of travel.\u201d In the interim, Patrolman Mangioeco turned onto Hollywood Avenue and followed behind Ogbin\u2019s vehicle. While in this position, Mangioeco made observations of defendant\u2019s vehicle. \u201cHe just kept coming back into the [west] lane and traveling back into the [east] lane into his lane of travel.\u201d Corporal Ogbin activated his emergency lights intending to stop the red vehicle. After the red vehicle and Ogbin\u2019s vehicle pulled to the shoulder, Mangioeco pulled directly behind defendant and followed him for approximately 100 yards, during which time he observed defendant \u201cswerving.\u201d When asked to describe what he meant by \u201cswerving,\u201d Mangioeco stated: \u201c[h]e continued to go into the [westbound] lane, bring his vehicle back in his lane of travel, at which time I stopped his vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Following the stop, Mangioeco observed that defendant had bloodshot eyes and fumbled through a number of receipts that fell to the floor of his car when asked to produce motor vehicle credentials. On making the observations, Mangioeco requested defendant to exit his motor vehicle for the purpose of performing field coordination tests. As defendant stepped out of the vehicle, Mangioeco observed that \u201che ... place[d] his right hand on his vehicle to use for balance to walk to the front of his vehicle to the side of the road.\u201d Mangioeco requested defendant to perform two field coordination tests: a heel-to-toe walk, and a one-leg stand. Mangioeco concluded that defendant failed the two tests because he took the wrong number of steps when performing the heel-to-toe test, and kept the \u201ctip of his foot ... touching the ground for balance\u201d when performing the one-leg stand test. After comple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>lion of the tests, Mangiocco formed the opinion that defendant was under the influence of alcohol, and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">At police headquarters, defendant was turned over to Corporal Ogbin who administered two breathalyzer tests at 2:54 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., resulting in .12 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) readings. Defendant was issued a summons for DWI; failure to exhibit a valid insurance card, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-29; failure to drive within a single lane, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-88b; and reckless driving, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The matter was tried before Judge Krell in the Carney\u2019s Point Township municipal court on June 10, 2004. Police Officers Mangiocco and Ogbin testified as to their observations of defendant\u2019s motor vehicle on the roadway; Mangiocco testified to his observations of defendant at the time of the stop; and Ogbin testified concerning the two breathalyzer test results. Defendant testified that another person was operating a second vehicle directly behind him on Hollywood Avenue at the time of the stop for the purpose of following defendant to his home; that he observed flashing lights from a police car behind the second vehicle pulling the operator over; that he pulled his vehicle over, in order not to leave the other person; and, that it was at this time when Mangiocco pulled behind defendant. Defendant denies that he was directly pulled over by Mangiocco.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Prior to Ogbin\u2019s testimony concerning the administration of the breathalyzer tests, defense counsel, having reviewed the discovery provided by the State, stipulated that: 1) Ogbin was a qualified breathalyzer operator; 2) that the breathalyzer was properly tested before and after the date of the offense, and was in proper working order at the time of the tests; and 3) that the breathalyzer tests were administered properly. Based on the testimony and the stipulation, the judge found that the State had probable cause to arrest defendant for DWI; determined that the State had failed to prove DWI based upon the officers\u2019 observations of the operation of defendant\u2019s motor vehicle and defendant at time of the stop, but found defendant guilty of DWI based solely upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>per se violation because of the two BAC readings. Because this was defendant\u2019s second offense, the judge imposed a sentence of two years suspension of driving privileges; forty-eight hours detention at an approved Intoxicated Driver Resource Center (IDRC); and fines of $505. Other appropriate costs, assessments, penalties and surcharges were also imposed. Those portions of the sentence suspending defendant\u2019s driving privileges and directing his detention at an IDRC were stayed, pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">On appeal de novo to the Law Division, defendant argued the issue of lack of probable cause for Mangioceo to arrest him for DWI, and also raised for the first time at oral argument an issue concerning the validity of Ogbin\u2019s breathalyzer operator\u2019s certification card. Defendant contended that the card was invalid because one of the two persons whose facsimile signature appears on the card, former Superintendent of State Police Carl Williams, had left his office on February 28, 1999, approximately four months prior to the date that Ogbin was issued the card on June 18,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On October 15, 2004, after having made independent findings of fact and giving due regard to the municipal judge\u2019s opportunity \u201cto judge the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 157, 199 A.2d 809 (1964), the judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument concerning lack of probable cause for his arrest, and found defendant guilty of DWI based upon the two breathalyzer readings. The judge, however, never made independent findings of fact concerning whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to sustain a conviction for DWI based upon the police officers\u2019 observations of defendant\u2019s motor vehicle moving upon the highway, and of defendant at the time of the motor vehicle stop.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge also declined to hear argument concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>breathalyzer operator\u2019s certification card because that issue had not been raised at the municipal court level. The same sentence as below was imposed, and defendant\u2019s request for a stay of the sentence was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Defendant retained new counsel, and appeals his conviction arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\n<em>POINT i.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">PRIOR COUNSEL\u2019S FAILURE TO HAVE A DIRECTED VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY BASED ON THE POLICE OFFICER\u2019S FAILURE TO INFORM DR.

Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 687, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2064, 80 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>674, 693 (1984). <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987) (holding the precepts of <em>Strickland </em>and its tests have been adopted by New Jersey). Under <em>Strickland, </em>defendant must show that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 688, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Additionally, defendant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">There is a strong presumption that counsel \u201crendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695. Further, because prejudice is not presumed, <em>Fritz, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 60-61, 519 A.2d 336, defendant must demonstrate \u201chow specific errors of counsel undermined the reliability\u201d of the proceeding. <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>648, 659 n. 26, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2039, 2047 n. 26, 80 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 657, 668 n. 26 (1984). Moreover, such acts or omissions of counsel must amount to more than mere tactical strategy. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 689,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 80 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 694-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Adequate assistance of counsel is measured by a standard of \u201c \u2018reasonable competence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jack, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>240, 248, 676 A.2d 545 (1996) (quoting <em>Fritz, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 53, 519 A.2d 336). Therefore, judicial scrutiny requires great deference because the standard does not demand \u201cthe best of attorneys,\u201d but rather requires attorneys be \u201c[not] so ineffective as to make the idea of a fair trial meaningless.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>341, 351, 561 A.2d 1082 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are particularly well-suited to post-conviction relief proceedings because in most instances the claims require development of a record beyond the trial record. <em>State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). In fact, we ordinarily decline to review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal unless the claim can be resolved on the trial record. <em>See State v. DeAngelis, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>256, 265-66, 657 A.2d 447 (App.Div.1995); <em>State v. McBride, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 272, 517 A.2d 152 (App.Div.1986). It is with these principles in mind that we address defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Defendant argues that prior counsel \u201cshould have moved for a directed verdict of not guilty at the conclusion of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>because the State failed to produce evidence that [defendant] was informed pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(d)[,] of [his] statutory-right under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c)[,] to have [a person of his own choice conduct] independent \u2018chemical tests of his breath, urine or blood.\u2019\u201d Defendant contends that the State must prove, as an element of a per se violation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a), that defendant was advised of the statutory right to have independent chemical tests of his \u201cbreath, urine or blood\u201d after he submitted to the breathalyzer tests, and because the record is devoid of any evidence that he was so advised, the breathalyzer test results should have been excluded from evidence. Defendant asserts that prior counsel\u2019s failure to move for a directed verdict \u201creveals a lack of the essential legal knowledge needed to meet the case of the prosecution[,] is contrary to professional norms[,] and constitutes an unreasonable and deficient performance.\u201d Defendant also contends that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the breathalyzer test evidence,\u201d because neither the municipal court nor the Law Division judge found him guilty based upon observational evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The State counters that it is not required to prove that defendant was advised of the statutory right to obtain independent testing of his \u201cbreath, urine or blood\u201d after submitting to the breathalyzer tests in order to establish a per se violation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a). The State further contends that prior counsel, having reviewed discovery in the case, made a tactical decision of attacking the probable cause for the arrest, rather than procedural aspects of the case; and therefore, the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2 (the Implied Consent Law) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle on any public road, street or highway or quasi-public area in this State shall be deemed to have given his consent to the taking of samples of his breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in his blood; provided, however, that the taking of samples is made in accordance with the provisions of this act and at the request of a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that such person has been operating a motor vehicle in violation of the provisions of [AT./.S.A] 39:4-50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>(c) In addition to the samples taken and tests made at the direction of a police officer hereunder, the person tested shall be permitted to have such samples taken and chemical tests of his breath, urine or blood made by a person or physician of his- own selection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">(d) The police officer shall inform the person tested of his rights under subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We hold that the State is not required to present affirmative proof that a defendant has been advised of the right to independent testing under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c) and (d) in order to sustain a conviction of a per se violation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a). It is only where a defendant seeks to suppress breathalyzer test results for failure of the State to comply with the statutory provisions concerning a defendant\u2019s right to independent testing that the State is required to prove compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Prosecution for operation of a motor vehicle in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50(a), is quasi-criminal in nature, and as such, the State is obligated to prove each element of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Dively, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>573, 585, 458 A.2d 502 (1983); <em>State v. Di Carlo, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>321, 327, 338 A.2d 809 (1975); <em>State v. Emery, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>348, 353,142 A.2d 874 (1958). A violation of <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4r-50(a), may be proven \u201cthrough either of two alternative evidential methods: proof of a defendant\u2019s physical condition or proof of a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level.\u201d <em>State v. Kashi, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 545, 823 A.2d 883 (App.Div.2003), <em>aff'd, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>45, 848 A.2d 744 (2004). That the Legislature may \u201crequire a motor vehicle operator, arrested on probable cause for driving [in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a),] to submit to a [breath] test\u201d is beyond challenge. <em>State v. Macuk, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>1,14, 268 A.2d 1 (1970). An operator, arrested on probable cause in violation of the statute, does not have a \u201clegal right or choice to refuse\u201d a breath test. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 268 A.2d 1. Nor does the admission of breath test results in a prosecution under the DWI statute violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 13-17, 268 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">A defendant who submits to the taking of a breath sampling retains the statutory right \u201cto have such samples taken and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>chemical tests of his breath, urine or blood made by a person or physician of his own selection.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c). Once a defendant submits to the taking of a breath test, the \u201cpolice officer <em>shall </em>inform the person tested of his [statutory] rights.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4r-50.2(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2 does not address any \u201caffirmative duties on the part of the police,\u201d other than \u201cthe need to inform an arrestee of the right to a copy of the test results[,] [Subsection (b),] and that he or she is permitted to have an independent test performed[,] [Subsections (c) and (d)].\u201d <em>State v. Greeley, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>38, 43, 834 A.2d 1016 (2003). Accordingly, issues concerning the statutory right and the obligation of the police to refrain from any actions or omissions that \u201cwould render the statutory right meaningless\u201d are addressed on an individual case basis. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">However, the reported eases do not address the issue presented here: whether the State must offer proof of compliance with that part of the refusal statute requiring the police to advise defendant of the statutory right to independent testing. It was assumed in each of the reported cases that the defendant had been properly advised of the statutory right. The cases only concerned the obligation of the State to establish a proper police procedure to afford a defendant a meaningful opportunity to have independent tests conducted, and to ensure that the police not interfere with or thwart the defendant\u2019s attempt to exercise the right to independent examination. <em>Id. </em>at 43-45, 834 A.2d 1016 (citing <em>State v. Jalkiewicz, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 434, 697 A.2d 155 (App.Div.1997); <em>State v. Ettore, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 28-31, 548 A.2d 1134 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>473, 555 A.2d 600 (1989); <em>State v. Hicks, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 550-51, 550 A.2d 512 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>324, 604 A.2d 599 (1990)). We have accorded defendants who have been thwarted or impeded from exercising the statutory right to independent testing the remedy of moving to suppress the breathalyzer test results. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45, 604 A.2d 599; <em>Jalkiewicz, supra, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 434, 697 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>155; <em>Hicks, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 547, 550 A.2d 512. We determine that the same remedy applies when a police officer fails to inform a defendant of his or her statutory right. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">However, the mere absence of evidence in the record that the police complied with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(d), does not give rise to an established fact of non-compliance requiring suppression of otherwise valid breathalyzer test results. Where a defendant seeks to bar admission of breathalyzer test results because of a police officer\u2019s failure to comply with the statute, the defendant is obligated to move to suppress the breathalyzer test results and present evidence of the police officer\u2019s non-compliance. This is the burden imposed upon a defendant who seeks to suppress evidence obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. See <em>Rule </em>3:5-7, governing motions to suppress in the Law Division, and <em>Rule </em>7:5-2, for motions to suppress filed in the municipal court. Although the \u201cburden of proof allocation\u201d may shift on the motion, \u201ci.e., on the defendant where the search is made under a warrant and on the State where warrantless,\u201d we require in either instance that a defendant file a motion to suppress. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comments 2 and 3 on <em>R. </em>3:5-7 (2006); <em>see also State v. Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>126, 133, 459 A.2d 1149 (1983). Because breathalyzer test results used in prosecuting individuals charged with DWI are obtained from the defendants without a search warrant, motions to suppress such evidence are generally brought in the municipal court. <em>R. </em>7:5-2(a). Requiring a defendant to follow the same procedure when there is a claim of a violation of a statutory right does not violate due process. <em>Greeley, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 44-45, 834 A.2d 1016; <em>Jalkiewicz, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 434, 697 A.2d 155; <em>Hicks, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 547, 550 A.2d 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">That defendant should have moved for suppression is especially appropriate in this case where prior to Corporal Ogbin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>testimony concerning the administration of the breathalyzer tests, defendant stipulated the fact that the breathalyzer tests were administered properly. It was reasonable for the prosecutor to have assumed that it was not necessary to delve into whether the officer advised defendant of the statutory right to independent testing. The State is not required to prove a negative. Because we conclude that the State was not required to produce affirmative proof of compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(d), we determine that defendant fails to meet the <em>Strickland </em>test on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Defendant argues next that trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue concerning the validity of Corporal\u2019s Ogbin\u2019s certification card at the municipal court level, and to properly raise it in the Law Division, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant argues that the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>is met because counsel admitted at the trial de novo that he failed to raise the issue at the municipal court level because he only recently became aware of the issue. Defendant argues that the second prong of <em>Strickland </em>is satisfied because failure to raise the issue concerning the certification card materially affected the outcome of defendant\u2019s case. Defendant contends that if the card is invalid, \u201cthe reliability of the breathalyzer test results are suspect and prior counsel should not have stipulated to those results because without the breathalyzer test results, Dr. Howard would (and could) not have been convicted of a <em>per se </em>violation.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Because the parties stipulated Corporal Ogbin\u2019s qualifications as a breathalyzer operator, the card was not introduced into evidence. Prom the description of the certification card, we are satisfied that the card in question is a replica,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> not the officer\u2019s original certification. The original certification is maintained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the Division of State Police. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.14. Defendant argues that because the replica produced in discovery was signed by a former Superintendent of State Police who had left office at the time Corporal Ogbin completed his original breathalyzer certification course, the card is invalid and could not have been presented as evidence to establish Ogbin\u2019s qualifications to operate the breathalyzer, thereby precluding the admission of the breathalyzer results. Defendant does not challenge Ogbin\u2019s completion of his original course certification or of any re-certification courses completed subsequent thereto or that the original operator\u2019s certificate on file with the State Police is invalid. Defendant only presents a technical challenge to the replica card.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">We dismiss the challenge because we are satisfied that \u201c[o]nly upon completion of this required course of training will the certification and replica be issued.\u201d <em>State v. Sohl, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 579, 833 A.2d 1104 (App.Div.2003) (holding that the fact that the officer\u2019s initial training course completion date was not set forth on the breath test operator\u2019s certification card did not render the card invalid). \u201c[T]he replica which is maintained by the operator is [only] evidence of the operator\u2019s qualifications to operate the breathalyzer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 833 A.2d 1104. That the replica was signed by a former Superintendent of State Police, not holding office at the time that the operator completed his course certification, does not affect the results obtained from tests administered from an otherwise qualified breathalyzer operator. It is at best a technical deficiency which does not require the exclusion of the breathalyzer test results. <em>Id. </em>at 579-80, 833 A.2d 1104. Because Ogbin\u2019s replica breathalyzer certification card containing the former Superintendent\u2019s signature does not affect his qualifications to operate a breathalyzer, we determine that defendant has not met <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Lastly, defendant argues that his prior counsel\u2019s failure to move for a directed verdict of not guilty based on the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>failure to enter into evidence the documents underlying the breathalyzer stipulation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant contends that notwithstanding his stipulation that the breathalyzer operator was qualified, the breathalyzer was in proper working order before and after the test, and the test was administered properly, the State was still obligated to move into evidence documents underlying the stipulation including the breathalyzer operator\u2019s certification card, the pre-and post-testing instrument inspection certificates, and the certificate of analysis of the breath alcohol simulator solution. We considered the argument in light of the record and applicable law, and are satisfied that the argument is without sufficient merit to warrant a discussion herein. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2). Although a defendant is not required to concede undisputed facts in a criminal matter, <em>State v. Flynn, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 219 n. 1, 494 A.2d 350 (App.Div.1985), a defendant is free to enter into a stipulation where \u201cthere is no bona fide dispute between the parties\u201d concerning a relevant fact. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>101(a)(4). When a defendant stipulates the facts necessary for the admissibility of breathalyzer test results, the State is not required to introduce the underlying documents. If defendant wanted to qualify his stipulation, defendant should have so stated at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\"> Patrolman Mangiocco of the Carney\u2019s Point Township Police Department testified that the roadway runs in a northbound/southbound direction, and defendant was operating his vehicle southbound. However, Corporal Ogbin testified that the roadway does not run in a northbound/southbound direction at the area of the motor vehicle stop, but rather in an eastbound/westbound direction, and defendant was traveling eastbound. Because the direction of defendant's motor vehicle is not relevant to the resolution of the issues presented on appeal, we shall refer to the roadway as tunning in an eastbound/westbound direction throughout the opinion for purpose of consistency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> We have previously recommended municipal court judges, and Law Division judges on trials de novo, \"in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:4-50 cases where there are proofs of guilt, with and without breathalyzer readings, [that] the judge[s] should make findings and conclusions on both bases.
