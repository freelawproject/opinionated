(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Defendant Donna Wolf Benjamin appeals from a Family Part order reducing the child support obligation of plaintiff Michael Gifford by the amount of federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits received by their disabled child, Melissa. Because plaintiffs monthly child support obligation was $361.20 and the child\u2019s SSI monthly benefit was $477.40, the court held that defendant was not required to pay any child support. We conclude that because SSI benefits are \u201cmeans-tested\u201d based on the child\u2019s disability and the custodial parent\u2019s financial need, they are not to be credited against the non-custodial parent\u2019s child support obligation under applicable child support guidelines. Therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">On August 1, 2002, plaintiff was ordered to pay child support of $84.00 per week, effective March 30, 2002. He was incarcerated at the time, having begun serving a four-year sentence in February 2002. On April 27, 2004, in anticipation of his approaching release from prison, plaintiff filed a motion seeking to modify his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>child support obligation based upon Melissa\u2019s receipt of SSI benefits, which she began receiving in May 2003. Melissa, who was born on January 30, 1993, receives SSI benefits because of her disability and her mother\u2019s minimal income. A hearing on the motion was conducted on June 16, 2004, after which the court reserved decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">On June 29,2004, the court issued a written opinion holding that Melissa\u2019s SSI benefits should be credited against plaintiffs support obligation, reducing that obligation to zero. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated that it was relying on the holdings in <em>Herd v. Herd, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 704 A.2d 1340 (App.Div.1998) and <em>Burns v. Edwards, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 842 A.2d 186 (App.Div.2004). We conclude that the court misapplied the holdings in those cases to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">SSI benefits, the type received by Melissa, are \u201cmeans-tested,\u201d meaning that eligibility is \u201cdetermined on the basis of the income or resources of the recipient.\u201d <em>Burns v. Edwards, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 36, 842 A.2d 186 (App.Div.2004). The purpose of such benefits is to provide minimally-adequate incomes to disabled indigents. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The issue in <em>Bums </em>was whether SSI benefits received by the disabled, non-custodial parent were to be treated as income for the purpose of calculating his child support. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 842 A.2d 186. The court held that the non-custodial parent was not required to pay child support out of his SSI benefits when those benefits were his only income and he had no other viable resources. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 842 A.2d 186. Thus, the holding is consistent with the purpose of means-tested benefits to supplement income and bring it to a minimum subsistence level.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">While a non-custodial parent\u2019s SSI benefits are not to be included in gross income for the purpose of calculating that parent\u2019s child support, there is no basis for concluding that the child\u2019s SSI benefits should be deducted from the parent\u2019s child support obligation. Indeed, such a holding would be inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>with the purpose of means-tested benefits as it relates to the child, because it would take away from the child benefits based on her own disability and intended to bring the child\u2019s income to a minimum subsistence level.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In <em>Herd, supra, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 704 A.2d 1340, the issue did not implicate SSI benefits. Instead, the court addressed whether Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits received by a child should be deducted from the child support amount otherwise payable by a parent. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 704 A.2d 1340. SSD benefits, as distinguished from SSI benefits, are non-means-tested, meaning that eligibility for such benefits is not determined on the basis of the recipient\u2019s income or resources. <em>Burns, supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 36, 842 A.2d 186. SSD benefits are designed to replace income lost because an employee is disabled and unable to work. <em>Ibid. </em>As they are a substitute for earned income, SSD payments \u201cmay be utilized as income when calculating child support in accordance with the child support guidelines____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 842 A.2d 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Thus, neither <em>Bums </em>nor <em>Herd </em>provides support for deducting a child\u2019s SSI benefits from a parent\u2019s support obligation. Furthermore, the Sole-Parenting and Shared-Parenting Worksheets\u2014 Line Instructions for the use of the child support guidelines, specifically exclude SSI benefits received by an obligor from the calculation of gross income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\"><em>Types of Income Excluded from Gross Income </em>\u2014 The following types of income are excluded from <em>gross income:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">a. means-tested income (i.e. based on the fact that the recipient has minimal income and requires government assistance to live) including, hut not limited to ... Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind or Disabled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">[Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Rules, </em>Appendix IX-B to <em>R. </em>5:6A at Sole-Parenting Worksheet 2328 and Shared-Parenting Worksheet 2346 (2006).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">The guidelines further prohibit SSI benefits received by the child from being deducted from a support award. The prohibition against crediting a child\u2019s SSI benefits against a parent\u2019s support obligation is accomplished by excluding SSI benefits from the definition of \u201cgovernment benefits\u201d that are to be deducted from the support award. Government benefits are deducted from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>support award by virtue of their inclusion on line 12 of the Sole-Parenting Worksheet and line 11 of the Shared-Parenting Worksheet used by the court to calculate child support. <em>Sole-Parenting Worksheet </em>at 2339 and <em>Shared-Parenting Worksheet </em>at 2355. However, a child\u2019s SSI benefits are not to be deducted from the support award because, as stated in the line instructions, \u201cSSI ... and other means-tested benefits are <em>not </em>government benefits based on a parent\u2019s earnings record, disability or retirement----\u201d <em>Sole-Parenting Worksheet </em>at 2339 and <em>Shared-Parenting Worksheet </em>at 2355.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Clearly, the specific instructions for the calculation of child support are consistent with the holdings in <em>Bums </em>and <em>Herd. </em>Based on those holdings and the child support guidelines, we conclude that the court erred in concluding that Melissa\u2019s SSI benefits should be deducted from plaintiff\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Reversed and remanded for a redetermination of plaintiffs child support obligation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
