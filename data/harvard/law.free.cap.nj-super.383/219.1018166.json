The Division acknowledges that the \u201crates under appeal\u201d constitute the per-patient DRG rates. However, the Division argues that, when calculating marginal loss, the hospitals must include as revenue their entire \u201cMedicaid reimbursement for inpatient services,\u201d a sum that includes not only DRG reimbursements but also the lump-sum payments that the hospitals receive as Medicaid rate supplements because they serve a disproportionate share of the State\u2019s indigent population.

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, in which New Jersey participates, established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide medical assistance on behalf of certain categories of persons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1396, 1396a to 1396v. As a participant, the State is required to comply with federal Medicaid statutes and regulations. <em>Harris v.

The methodology can be found in Attachment 4.19-A of the Plan. Approval of the State Plan by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services permits receipt of federal matching funds for amounts spent as medical assistance in accordance with the State Plan. 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396b. Over the years, New Jersey has submitted amendments to its State Plan, each of which has been federally approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Until 1981, reimbursement to Medicaid-eligible hospitals was based on the \u201creasonable costs\u201d of services actually provided to Medicaid inpatients, regardless of variances in those costs or the extent of efficiencies realized. <em>See United Hosps.

In 1981, Congress sought to limit the rapidly increasing costs of inpatient hospital care and other medical services and to allow the states more flexibility in designing Medicaid programs by enacting the Boren Amendment as part of the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Pub.L. No. 97-35. Under that amendment, states were required to pay rates that were \u201creasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>1396a(a)(13)(A)(repealed 1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Hasps.

In the case of disproportionate share hospitals, DSH payments serve to increase the overall rate of payment. Although DSH payments are not tied specifically to inpatient services provided to identified patients, in that they do not increase DRG rates applicable to those patients, their payment is associated solely with inpatient care to the Medicaid eligible. <em>County of Camden v.

Thus, DSH payments are designed to address the special financial plight of the hospitals which serve a high volume of indigent patients; they are not addressed to the special financial plight of any individual patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 281-82, 678 A.2d 1101.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Because of the statutory origin of DSH payments as an element of inpatient Medicaid reimbursement unassociated with an individual patient, in <em>County of Camden, </em>we rejected claims by fourteen counties to those funds as compensation for their payments to psychiatric facilities and developmental centers involved in the care of mentally ill or developmentally disabled persons who were medically indigent, finding that such funds, unlike social security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>payments, did not constitute a part of a patient\u2019s estate subject to recoupment by the counties. <em>Id. </em>at 279-84, 678 A.2d 1101. Of significance here, in doing so, we relied, in part, on the definition of DSH payments given by the New Jersey Director of Medical Assistance and Health Services as they related to factors including patient and hospital reimbursement by Medicaid. The Director determined them, in relevant part, to be related solely to inpatient care provided to Medicaid eligible patients, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">a) Patient reimbursement by Medicaid</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">Disproportionate share payment adjustments are additional payments made to hospitals that are providing inpatient care to low-income patients (also called charity care). By definition, charity care is hospital care provided to individual patients who have no source of payment (including Medicaid), third-party insurance, or personal resources. Therefore, patient reimbursement by Medicaid is guided by the relevant provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and the approved New Jersey Medicaid State Plan and is unaffected by disproportionate share payment adjustments. Nevertheless, actual disproportionate share payment adjustments could be made as an add-on to such patient per diem reimbursement rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">b) Hospital reimbursement by Medicaid</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\n<em>Disproportionate share payment adjustments are payments made to hospitals over-anchabove the normal payments to hospitals for inpatient care provided to Medicaid eligible patients. ...</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 282, 678 A.2d 1101 (quoting <em>Joint Select Committee on Medicaid Reimbursement: \u201cTo take testimony from invited indimduals from the Department of Human Services regarding the application made by the Department for Medicaid uncompensated care retroactive claims, to July 1, 1988, for disproportionate share payments for State and county psychiatric hospitals,\u201d </em>October 20,1992, Memorandum and Attachment 1 by Saul M.

Use of the concept of \u201cmarginal loss\u201d in the rate appeals regulation also helps to assure that no hospital is worse off because it treats Medicaid beneficiaries. So long as Medicaid payments meet a hospital\u2019s marginal costs and make some contribution to fixed costs, a hospital is better off serving Medicaid beneficiaries than not serving them. The \u201cmarginal loss\u201d standard is, therefore, reasonably related to the Boren Amendment goal of assuring that Medicaid beneficiaries have reasonable access to hospital inpatient services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">[29 <em>N.J.R. </em>353.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The hospitals, contending that they had sustained marginal losses in one or more years from 1996 to 2001, all filed administrative rate appeals with the Division pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b). In each case, the Division denied the hospital\u2019s appeal after determining that the hospital had not <em>or </em>would not sustain a marginal loss in the relevant period. In making these determinations, the Division relied upon the inpatient Medicaid cost figures contained in the hospitals\u2019 MCRs and it considered as revenue the hospital relief subsidy fund (HRSF) component of their DSH subsidies. The Division\u2019s determinations were appealed pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(d), and the matters were transferred to the Office of Administrative Law, where they were consolidated for consideration by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">While matters were pending before the ALJ, in 2002 we determined a challenge to the Division\u2019s denial of all rate appeals for the year 1995. <em>See In re Zurbrugg Mem. Hosp., supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 793 A.2d 17. The Division had taken the position that in order to prevail on a rate appeal, the hospital was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to submit documentation establishing (1) the cost it must incur in providing services to Medicaid patients; (2) whether the hospital had taken all reasonable steps to contain or reduce its costs; and (3) whether the hospital demonstrated that it would sustain a marginal loss in providing inpatient Medicaid services at the rates under appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 793 A.2d 17. Although we found the Division\u2019s statutory interpretation to have been correct, we found that the Division\u2019s summary denial of the hospitals\u2019 appeals on the ground of insufficient evidence was arbitrary and capricious and an abdication of the Division\u2019s responsibility to consider the appeals on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 793 A.2d 17. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">We do not disagree, in principle, with the Division that the initial submission must address the three core issues identified by the regulations, but that does not end the inquiry or the \u201cinteraction\u201d between the parties. The dilemma faced by a hospital here is that the regulatory process enabled by <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1 is so flawed that compliance becomes a matter of chance rather than one that is carefully enunciated and systematic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">The deficiencies in the lack of definition in the regulation in effect at the time of consideration of these appeals supports this view. Critical to any analysis of the rate appeals is the concept of \u201cmarginal loss,\u201d a term not defined in the 1995 regulations. \u201cMarginal loss\u201d is neither self-explanatory nor self-defining. The difficulties resulting from this lack of definition become most apparent in the context of the Division\u2019s determination to reject appeals based on a hospital\u2019s failure to establish \u201cmarginal loss.\u201d In declining to consider some of the rate appeals, the Division concluded that the inclusion of fixed costs as an element of marginal loss was inappropriate. The Division did not suggest that such inclusion would prompt further inquiry and revision of a submission, but that it would bar substantive review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 36-37, 793 A.2d 17 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Because of the flaws that we perceived to exist in the implementation of <em>N.J. A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2 as it existed in 1995, we found that \u201csubstantial justice will best be served by starting the process anew and allowing the hospitals to make a full submission of documentation consistent with the three core issues identified and, if found to be deficient, then requiring the agency to respond in kind by delineating such documentation that it requires to properly consider the rate appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 793 A.2d 17. The appeals were thus remanded for the required \u201cinteractive process\u201d to occur. These appeals remain undecided at the agency level.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>After our decision in <em>Zurbrugg </em>had been filed, cross-motions for summary decision were filed by the hospitals and the Division in the present matters. The hospitals argued that the Division had failed to comply with the APA, that its actions were arbitrary and capricious, and a remand and reconsideration of whether a marginal loss had been demonstrated was required in light of <em>Zur-brugg. </em>The Division asserted that its denials of the appeals should be affirmed on the basis of its marginal loss methodology and its results.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In an opinion dated May 14, 2003, the ALJ accepted the hospitals\u2019 argument that the term \u201cmarginal loss\u201d was susceptible to different interpretations, and he remanded the appeals to the Division for an interactive process to occur with respect to the evidence necessary to establish that a marginal loss had occurred.'</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In a final administrative decision by the Division dated September 8, 2003, its Acting Director agreed that the rate appeals should be remanded so that the parties could engage in the interactive process required by <em>Zurbrugg. </em>However, he found \u201cample support\u201d for the Division\u2019s use of the hospitals\u2019 MCRs as a source of financial information, rather than the SHARE report that the hospitals sought to have utilized. Additionally he found that the Division could use DSH payments in the marginal loss calculation, and he modified the ALJ\u2019s opinion in these two respects. Although the ALJ had not determined whether the Division\u2019s inclusion of DSH/HRSF funds and use of MGR data without rulemaking violated the APA, the Division\u2019s Acting Director addressed the issue, finding that \u201cthe clear language and intent of the rate appeal regulations obviates the need for any further rulemaking, and ... <em>there is no </em>violation of the APA. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">As noted above, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)(2)(x) specifically identifies the Medicare Cost report as a document the Division may rely upon in the calculation of marginal loss. Moreover, the Division\u2019s interpretation that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b) permits it to take into account DSH revenues in the marginal loss calculation is entitled to substantial deference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The hospitals appealed from those portions of the Division\u2019s final decision that differed from the conclusions of the ALJ, without engaging in any interactive process with the Division and without waiting for the Division\u2019s final decisions on remand. We granted leave to appeal, but remanded the cases for completion of the interactive process by April 16, 2004. In letters sent by the Division to the hospitals in early February, 2004, it sought any corrections required to Medicaid cost data derived from the hospitals\u2019 MCR reports and any additional existing analyses of marginal costs. On April 16, 2004, the rate increase requests were denied as unsupported by evidence of marginal loss. In reaching this conclusion, the Division again utilized the hospital\u2019s MCRs as a source of Medicaid cost data, and it included the charity care component of DSH supplements as well as the HRSF component as revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It is significant to note that in this appeal, the hospitals do not seek a determination whether they actually sustained marginal losses in the periods at issue. Their appeal concerns more fundamentally only the manner in which marginal loss is calculated and the documentation relevant to that calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">We address first the hospitals\u2019 contention that the only revenues that the Division can consider in determining marginal loss under the regulations existing in 1995 and 1997 are those received pursuant to DRG rates since they constitute the \u201crates under appeal\u201d to which <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52 \u2014 9.1 (b)2 refers. According to the hospitals, the Division inappropriately considered DSH subsidies as \u201cMedicaid reimbursement for inpatient services\u201d because those subsidies are not patient-specific, they are utilized to compensate in part for services provided to persons who are not Medicaid recipients, and they cover outpatient as well as inpatient care. The hospitals also note the failure by the Division to request and consider cost data associated with the use of these distinct DSH funds. They argue, as well, that the Division was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>obligated to consider financial projections contained in their SHARE reports in determining marginal loss, and that a focus solely upon MCR data derived from actual costs was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The Division counters the hospitals\u2019 position by arguing that, in accordance with the Boren Amendment and subsequent federal law, as well as New Jersey\u2019s State Plan, DSH payments are recognized as a component of a hospital\u2019s inpatient Medicaid reimbursement (albeit not allocated to individual patients) that must be considered in determining whether a hospital has sustained a marginal loss as the result of the provision of Medicaid inpatient care. The Division also argues that it was within its discretion to rely upon actual Medicaid inpatient costs data derived from the hospitals\u2019 MCR reports, since SHARE reports have not been audited since 1988. <em>See </em>27 <em>N.J.R. </em>912 (March 6, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We reject the hospitals\u2019 argument that the Division acted arbitrarily in including DSH revenues when calculating marginal loss pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2, finding that the hospitals have failed to meet them burden of establishing arbitrary or capricious action. <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 656, 731 A.2d 35 (1999); <em>Brady v. Bd. of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 210-11, 704 A.2d 547 (1997); <em>Matter of Musick, </em>343 <em>N.J. </em>206, 216, 670 A 2d 11 (1996); <em>George Harms Constr. Co. v. N.J. Turnpike Auth, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>8, 27, 644 A.2d 76 (1994). <em>Van Dalen v. Washington Twp., </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>234, 244, 576 A.2d 819 (1990). In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that the Division\u2019s interpretation of its own marginal loss regulation to permit a recognition of DSH revenue is entitled to great weight, <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act Rules, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>478, 489, 852 A.2d 1083 (2004), since the Division is in the best position to understand what was meant by the regulation when it was promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The federal/state Medicaid program that we have described at the beginning of this opinion contains, at its core, a recognition that the DRG rates paid as reimbursement for individual inpatient Medicaid care may provide inadequate compensation for the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of treating Medicaid patients incurred by hospitals providing a disproportionate share of indigent care. Thus, the \u201cappropriate reimbursement rate\u201d (H.R.Rep. No. 97-158, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 295 (1981)) paid by the federal government as matching funds has, since the early 1980s, included a payment adjustment for such care as an element of inpatient Medicaid reimbursement. Because these Medicaid adjustments constitute a supplement to per-patient DRG inpatient rates applicable to Medicaid recipients, even if those DRG rates prove to be lower than actual costs, total revenue after receipt of any DSH supplements is designed to exceed such costs so that no hospital is worse off as the result of treating Medicaid patients.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> DSH payments are made to hospitals because they serve a disproportionate share of the indigent. However, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-4(a)(l)(B) provides that the increase in rates reflecting DSH payments is effective only for rates applicable to inpatient hospital services to Medicaid patients. That increase thus serves as an incentive to the provision of continued inpatient Medicaid care.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Division has summarized the relationship between DSH payments and direct reimbursement for inpatient care to Medicaid patients in its response to comments to the most recent amendment to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1b(2), adopted in 2005, that raise the same arguments as presented by the hospitals here, by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKp\">Federal law permits states to set the amount of DSH payments on the basis of the cost or volume of a hospital\u2019s services to low-income patients. Nevertheless, DSH payments are not payments for those services (other than services to Medicaid inpatients). Regardless of how DSH payments are calculated or are used by hospitals, DSH payments are Medicaid payments which arise from a hospital\u2019s provision of Medicaid inpatient services. DSH payments are the vehicle by which New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid inpatient payment rates (DRG rates) take into account the situation of hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients with special needs, as required by Federal law. In other words, DSH payments are an adjustment to Medicaid DRG rates and thus an enhancement to Medicaid fee-for-service reimbursement. They recognize that, in order to remain viable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>provide access to inpatient care for Medicaid beneficiaries, DSH hospitals may need Medicaid payments in excess of the amounts paid under the DEG median-cost efficiency standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">The purpose of the marginal loss appeal rule is to assure that no hospital is worse off because it treats Medicaid beneficiaries. A hospital can qualify for DSH payments only if its Medicaid inpatient utilization rate is at least one percent. This means that DSH payments are a benefit that results from participating in the Medicaid program, and therefore should be taken into account in determining whether a hospital is worse off because of its Medicaid program participation. For these reasons, it would be inappropriate to exclude DSH payments from the marginal loss analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">[37 <em>N.J.R. </em>2506(a) (July 5, 2005).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In light of the statutory history that we have set forth, we cannot agree with the hospitals that the Division\u2019s interpretation of the marginal loss provisions of <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52 \u2014 9.1(b)2 so as to include DSH payments as revenues for purposes of a marginal loss calculation is arbitrary or capricious. Whatever a hospital\u2019s actual use of such payments may be, the Division is statutorily entitled to categorize DSH payments as a form of unallocated reimbursement for inpatient Medicaid care. We find that such a categorization does not violate either express or implied legislative policies and indeed is consistent with them. <em>See L.M. v. State of N.J. Div. of Med,. Assist. &amp; Health Servs., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>480, 490, 659 A.2d 450 (1995) (an \u201cagency\u2019s interpretation of the operative law is entitled to prevail, so long as it is not plainly unreasonable\u201d) (quoting <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 327, 478 A.2d 742 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Although the regulations in effect in 1995 and adopted in 1997 could conceivably be read, as the hospitals contend, to require a comparison of marginal costs only to the amount of DRG reimbursements for inpatient care to Medicaid patients <em>(e.g., </em>the \u201crates under appeal\u201d), the language of the regulations does not require that interpretation, and it is contrary to abundant authority recognizing that DSH payments are to be considered a component of fee-for-service inpatient reimbursement to eligible hospitals. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2 does not state or even suggest that rate adjustments may be made when DRG payments alone fall below marginal costs of providing inpatient services to Medicaid patients. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Thus the Division\u2019s interpretation of the marginal loss regulation was not contrary to the terms of that regulation. Indeed, if reimbursements in accordance with DRG rates constituted the only revenue source to be considered in calculating marginal loss, as the hospitals suggest, and rate relief were deemed warranted whenever those rates failed to cover marginal costs, DSH payments would be unnecessary to cover a Medicaid shortfall, since none would ever exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We also do not find arbitrary the Division\u2019s determination not to subtract the costs of indigent care that is unrelated to Medicaid inpatient treatment from DSH payments in determining marginal loss. Precedent establishes that these payments do not constitute payments for specific services provided to non-Medicaid eligible persons. Thus we find to be reasonable the Division\u2019s argument that the costs incurred are not relevant to the marginal loss calculation. The fact that DSH funds may have been used, in part, to provide inpatient and outpatient indigent care in addition to Medicaid-eligible inpatient fee-for-service care does not affect the conclusion, derived from federal statutes, that the funds are Medicaid supplemental allotments and can be considered as such by the Director.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As a final matter, we find that the hospitals have failed to demonstrate that the Division acted arbitrarily and capriciously in utilizing the Medicaid cost data contained in audited hospital MCRs as a basis for its marginal loss calculation. In this regard, we are mindful of the strong presumption of reasonableness that we must accord to the Division\u2019s exercise of its statutorily delegated duties, <em>Van Dalen, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 244-45, 576 A.2d 819, especially in a case such as this in which agency expertise is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>significant factor in decisionmaking. <em>City of Newark v. Natural Res. Council, D.E.P., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>530, 540, 414 A.2d 1304, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>983, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>400, 66 L.Ed.2d 245 (1980); <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In considering this issue, we find it noteworthy that the hospitals do not contend that the data contained in their MCRs is inaccurate, that it fails to fairly set forth variable costs (although they contest the elements of such costs), or that its use is unsanctioned by regulation. The hospitals merely contend that the Division should instead have relied on the projections contained in their SHARE reports. However, they do not present persuasive evidence that such reports are more reliable. That SHARE reports \u201care standard forms used by hospitals to report their costs to Medicaid and Medicare,\u201d <em>Univ. of Med. &amp; Dentistry of N.J. v. Grant, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 171, 778 A.2d 473 (App.Div.2001), does not render them <em>ipso facto </em>superior for the purposes of calculating marginal costs. We thus find no arguments of such countervailing force as to overcome the deference to the Division\u2019s decision that we owe in this regard. <em>City of Newark, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 414 A.2d 1304; <em>Univ. of Med. &amp; Dentistry of N.J., supra, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 168-71, 778 A.2d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The hospitals additionally claim that their administrative due process rights to fundamental fairness were denied as the result of the Division\u2019s \u201cshifting\u201d application of the marginal loss regulation, and that as a result they were never afforded the opportunity to have their rate appeals heard within a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The hospitals claim that, as the result of the Division\u2019s responses to their 1995 rate appeals, the hospitals were led to believe that their SHARE cost data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>would be accepted as dispositive and that only DRG revenues would be considered in calculating marginal loss. The hospitals claim further that they were unaware until 1999, when they received determinations of their appeals of 1996, 1997 and 1998 rates, that the Division considered the HRSF component of their DSH subsidies as revenue for marginal loss calculation purposes and relied on the Medicaid component of the hospitals\u2019 MCRs in determining costs. Finally, they assert that they were unaware until 2003 when the Division\u2019s Acting Director rendered his final opinion that the Division was taking the position that the entire DRG subsidy would be considered revenue, and that it was only in 2004 that the charity care component of the DRG supplement was actually considered in calculating marginal loss. In order to afford adequate notice and an opportunity for comment, each of these changes in position, the hospitals contend, should have been embodied in a regulation duly promulgated in accordance with the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The hospitals argue as well that, even now, the Division has failed to ascertain the cost data that corresponds to the receipt of DSH funds.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They also assert that the Division\u2019s use of actual cost data in lieu of projected data based upon SHARE reports is fundamentally unfair. Moreover, the hospitals claim that the Division has given them inadequate notice of its reliance upon MCRs rather than SHARE reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We do not condone the delay that has occurred in connection with the processing of the hospitals\u2019 rate appeals, some of which as we have noted, have been pending for eleven years. We expressed our disapproval strongly in <em>Hospital Center at Orange v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>Guhk </em>when we condemned the Division\u2019s delay in determining rate appeals for the years 1996 through 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">However, we are unable to agree with the hospitals\u2019 position that the Division definitively agreed to calculate marginal loss by reference only to DRG revenue in 1995, that it accepted SHARE projections as dispositive at that time, and that its position has unfairly changed. The 1995 appeals never reached a state of resolution in which the Division\u2019s position with respect to these matters was clearly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As the Division points out, the Division has never adopted the position that DSH funding was irrelevant to a marginal loss calculation, and indeed, it has always considered such funds to be a supplement to Medicaid\u2019s individual inpatient reimbursements, albeit an unallocated one.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em>27 <em>N.J.R. </em>910 (March 6, 1995) (stating in response to a comment regarding New Jersey\u2019s revised hospital reimbursement methodology that DSH payments \u201care in addition to the payments received through the DRG reimbursement rates); HHS Departmental Appeals Board Decision No. 1652 (March 16, 1998), 1998 HHSDAB LEXIS 29 (\u201cWhile DSH payment adjustments are intended as supplemental payments to reflect the excess burden on some hospitals of the costs of providing uncompensated care, the payment adjustments are structured as part of the reimbursement for Medicaid inpatient hospital services provided by those hospitals.\u201d) We note as well that DSH revenues were considered by the Division in determining on an expedited basis an October 1996 rate appeal by United Hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The Division\u2019s common-sense interpretation of its marginal loss regulation to permit the consideration of DSH funds as revenue in the calculation of such loss has been expressed to the hospitals and has constituted the principal issue underlying all of the pending appeals.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In that connection, both the Division and the hospitals have had ample opportunity to air their views as to whether the inclusion of such funds as revenue was proper or not.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As the result of the appellate process, the hospitals\u2019 due process rights have been fully protected. <em>George Harms Const. Co., supra, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>at 19-20, 644 A.2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Further, governing regulations have always permitted the consideration of MCR data in determining whether a marginal loss has occurred. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2x (stating that a hospital may be required to submit, at a minimum, enumerated documentation including MCR reports in connection with any application for adjustment in rates). The Division has in the past found SHARE reports to be \u201cresponsive\u201d to its data requirements, since they constitute another cost accounting report, <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2ix. However, while the appeals were pending, cost data that initially had to be presented in projected form to meet the time requirements for appeals from projected rates became finalized in the form reported in the hospitals\u2019 MCRs. We do not find it to have been unfair for the Division to consider actual costs in lieu of projected costs in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Finally, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the hospitals were misled into believing that only SHARE data would be considered by the Division and solely on that basis did not file MCRs, or that any of the present appeals were denied because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the unavailability of MCE data when, in 2004, the Division considered the rate appeals at issue on the merits. If only SHARE data is available at the time that rate appeals are filed, nothing prevents their supplementation with more accurate MCR data as part of the interactive process as rate appeals progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">As a final matter, we reject the hospitals\u2019 argument that the use of MCR data and the inclusion of DSH/HRSE funds as revenue in marginal loss calculations constituted <em>de facto </em>rulemaking in violation of the APA and should be considered void as the result of the absence of proper rulemaking under the standards set in <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 328-37, 478 A.2d 742. \u201cAn agency may not use its power to interpret its own regulations as a means of amending those regulations or adopting new regulations.\u201d <em>Besler &amp; Co. v.

Bd. of Appeals, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 554, 555 A.2d 1175 (App.Div.1989)). However, we find this maxim inapplicable to the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In <em>Metromedia, </em>the court held that an agency determination must be considered an administrative rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">when all or most of the relevant features of administrative rules are present and preponderate in favor of the rule-making process. Such a conclusion would be warranted if it appears that the agency determination, in many or most of the following circumstances, (1) is intended to have wide coverage encompassing a large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or narrow select group; (2) is intended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons; (3) is designed to operate only in future cases, that is, prospectively; (4) prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization; (5) reflects an administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rule, or (ii) constitutes a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position on the identical subject matter; and (6) reflects a decision on administrative regulatory policy in the nature of the interpretation of law or general policy. <em>[Metromedia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 331-32, 478 A.2d 742.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\"><em>Metromedia </em>was a successful challenge, on the ground of <em>de facto </em>rulemaking, to the utilization by the Director of the Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>of Taxation of a calculation referred to as \u201caudience share\u201d to measure receipts earned within New Jersey in calculating the corporate franchise tax owed to New Jersey by an out-of-state corporation broadcasting in a multi-state reception area that included this State. The Court found that the Director\u2019s <em>ad hoc </em>application of the \u201caudience share\u201d measure to a pending appeal constituted rulemaking that required compliance with the APA because the determination was prospective, of general applicability, continuing in its effect, was not expressly provided for by statute or clearly and obviously implied, and raised issues that could be most appropriately resolved by invoking the procedures of the APA. <em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 478 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">What distinguishes the record here from that in <em>Metromedia </em>is that, in this case, a regulation in the form of <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2 existed with respect to the calculation of marginal loss at the time of the initial appeals in 1996 and remains in somewhat amended form. In <em>Zwrbrugg, </em>where an issue raised was the extent and nature of fixed costs that could be considered in determining marginal loss, we characterized the applicable regulation as lacking a \u201cdefinition of terms.\u201d 349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 37, 793 A.2d 17. However, in that case, we did not demand further rulemaking, but instead observed: \u201cThese regulations were in their first year of application, and no body of administrative decision-making existed to provide guidance to the hospitals regarding the limits of marginal loss including any consideration of fixed costs. Given this context, the agency cannot simply decline to consider the merits of any application without providing guidance to assure compliance with this newly enacted regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We construe <em>Zwrbrugg </em>as evidence that the present matter, involving the same regulation that was at issue in <em>Zurbrugg, </em>is not one in which rulemaking in accordance with the APA was absent, as in <em>Metromedia. </em>It is a ease in which the rulemaking resulted in a regulation that the hospitals claim is susceptible to interpretation in a manner that favors their position, whereas the Division, relying on statutory language, contends otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We find in this context that the Division\u2019s construction of its own rule did not require it to engage in additional rulemaking in accordance with the APA, but rather the interpretive process that occurred at the administrative level and is culminating here. <em>Cf. Cobo v. Market Transition Facility, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 394, 680 A.2d 1103 (App.Div.1996) (distinguishing between clarification consistent with departmental intent and a material change that requires compliance with APA rulemaking). We thus reject the hospital\u2019s argument as it relates to the Division\u2019s interpretation of the marginal loss regulation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In 2005, the Division promulgated, received comment upon, and adopted an amendment to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52 \u2014 9.1(b)2, that expresses the position of the Division here that DHS payments are to be considered as revenue in determining the existence of a marginal loss and was stated to constitute a clarification of current policy and practice. 37 <em>N.J.R. </em>2506(a) (July 5, 2005). The hospitals cite the amendment as evidence of the Division\u2019s departure from existing law that precludes the Division\u2019s consideration of DHS payments as revenue prior to the amendment\u2019s passage. We decline to give the adoption of the amendment such a draconian effect, viewing it instead in accordance with the Division\u2019s explanatory statement as a clarification of the existing regulation. <em>In re Heller, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>292, 308, 374 A.2d 1191 (1977); <em>County of Monmouth v. Communications Workers of Am., 300 N.J.Super. </em>272, 292, 692 A.2d 990 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>As a final matter, we address the hospitals\u2019 position that the Division\u2019s reliance on MCR data required a rule change. As we have already demonstrated, the use of MCR data in determining marginal loss was authorized by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2x throughout the period spanned by these appeals. We have no reason to challenge the Division\u2019s determination, presented through the certification of Division Chief Financial Officer John Guhl that, at present, the audited data contained in the hospitals\u2019 MCRs constitutes the most reliable source of cost information provided by the hospitals and is more accurate than the projections based upon unaudited data contained within SHARE reports. We rely on the Division\u2019s representation that, in accordance with applicable regulations and the practice that it adopted in 2004, it will continue to accept other cost accounting data and will rely upon that data if circumstances warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The final agency determinations to utilize DSH payments as revenue in calculating marginal loss pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(b)2 and to utilize Medicaid costs contained in hospital Medicare cost reports in such calculations are affirmed. The appeals are remanded to permit further consideration of applicable costs and such other issues as may remain. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> This program was previously known as NJ KidCare-Plan A.
