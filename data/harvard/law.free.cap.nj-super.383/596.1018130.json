Portnoff Law Assocs., </em>396 F.3d 227, 232 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Pollice v. Nat\u2019l Tax Funding, L.P., </em>225 F.3d 379, 400 (3d Cir. 2000)). The narrow question before us in this appeal is whether a law firm representing a landlord in a summary dispossess action is a \u201cdebt collector\u201d subject to the FDCPA. We find that it is \u00bf/the firm regularly engages in a practice prosecuting summary dispossess actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The following is a summary of the facts relevant to this appeal. Plaintiffs Rochelle and Renita Hodges are sisters who reside in separate apartments in the Sotnas Garden Apartments, located in Newark, and operated by defendant Sasil Corporation. Their rent is subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), commonly referred to as Section 8 rental assistance. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437f. The defendant law firm, Fein-stein, Raiss, Kalin &amp; Booker (Feinstein or the firm), regularly represents the Sasil Corporation in landlord/tenant disputes. Defendant Rosalie C. Seheckel, Esq. is a member of the firm who regularly prosecutes eviction proceedings on behalf of Sasil.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 leases expressly provide that in addition to the monthly rental rate, tenants are obligated to pay at least three forms of \u201cadditional rent\u201d: late fees, court costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Sasil. Because the apartments are subsidized by HUD, plaintiffs\u2019 legal \u201crent\u201d obligation is strictly defined by federal statute and regulations as thirty percent of their \u201cadjusted\u201d monthly household income. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(l); 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>5.601 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Plaintiff Renita Hodges has a monthly income of $424 for herself and five children. Plaintiff Rochelle Hodges\u2019 monthly income is $632 for herself and six children. In accordance with federal regulations, Renita\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rent was $55 per <em>month and </em>Rochelle\u2019s was $119 as of February 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Plaintiffs acknowledge that they were in arrears on their rent, late fees, attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs under the terms of their leases. Feinstein filed and prosecuted summary non-payment of rent eviction complaints seeking to collect from plaintiffs not only outstanding rent, but also late charges and attorneys\u2019 fees \u2014 which are not rent under federal law, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(l), and for which no judgment of possession may be entered under State law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:18-61.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Feinstein does not dispute that assertion and acknowledges that \u201c[t]he Summary Dispossess Complaints [Feinstein] filed in the Special Civil Part included rent and other contractual charges for which the Hodges were obligated under their lease agreements.\u201d Feinstein maintains, however, that the law does not prohibit a landlord from collecting other charges for which a tenant is obligated in an eviction action: \u201c[t]he law merely states that a landlord [can] not evict a tenant based on those other charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In filing the landlord/tenant complaints, Feinstein alleged that total amounts due and owing for legal fees, late fees and rent were \u201crent.\u201d While a subsequent paragraph in each of the complaints itemizes the amounts due and owing by category, the complaints consistently state that the total amount is \u201crent.\u201d Nothing in the complaint advises tenants that they are only required to pay the actual rent to avoid eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">For example, on October 31, 2003, Scheckel, on behalf of Feinstein, filed a summary nonpayment of rent eviction (summary dispossess) complaint against Renita in Docket No. LT-37185-03. The matter was listed for trial on December 15, 2003. The complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">2.

Renita paid $460, believing she had to pay the full amount to avoid eviction..</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">On April 28, 2004, Scheckel, on behalf of Feinstein, filed another summary dispossess complaint against Renita in Docket No. LT-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>16116-04. The matter was listed for trial on June 4, 2004. The complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">2.

Renita certified that on the trial date she went to the courthouse with $250 \u201cto see if they would take that.\u201d As of the trial date, Renita owed only $220 in rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-18\">Rather than answering the trial call, Renita met with the landlord and a Feinstein attorney in the courthouse. She offered to pay the $250 to avoid eviction, but her offer was rejected. Instead, the Feinstein attorney advised that she had to pay $499. The attorney wrote (\u201c$499.00\u201d) on the summons, adding the words \u201cincludes June.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-19\">Under applicable law, payment of $220 plus $29 costs of court (totaling $249) required dismissal of the summary nonpayment of rent eviction complaint. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-55; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-9; <em>Vineland Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. DeMarco, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>459, 469, 173 A.2d 270 (1961); <em>Hous. Auth. v. Taylor, </em>171 <em>N.J. 580, 593, 796 </em>A.2d 193 (2002). Despite having tendered all rent plus the costs legally due, a judgment of possession was entered against Renita and she was subsequently served with a warrant of removal. She was forced to apply for an emergent order to show cause to stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the eviction. After Renita obtained legal representation, however, the Feinstein firm moved on June 28, 2004 to amend the complaint and dismiss all non-rent charges. The court dismissed the complaint upon Renita\u2019s payment of $259, rather than the $499 demanded by the Feinstein attorney on the original trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">On April 28, 2004, Scheckel filed a summary dispossess complaint against Rochelle in Docket No. LT-16117-04, which was also listed for trial on June 4, 2004. That complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">2. There is due, unpaid and owing from defendant\u00a9 to plaintiff\u00a9 $497.00 for rent as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">02/2004 Legal Fees $147.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">04/2004 Late Fees $ 30.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">04/2004 Rent $131.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">04/2004 Legal Fees $189.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">and any additional rent that may be due at the time of hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">3. Said rent has not been paid [n]or has possession of the premises been surrendered by defendant\u00a9 to plaintiff\u00a9, but defendant\u00a9 hold\u00a9 over and continue\u00a9 in possession without the consent of the plaintiff\u00a9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">4. The provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-27 <em>et seg. </em>have been complied with by the plaintiff\u00a9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">Judgment is demanded for possession of the premises together with costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">Rochelle owed only $131 rent, not $497 as stated in the perforato-ry language of paragraph two.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">On the trial date, Rochelle appeared with legal representation. She moved to transfer the eviction action to the Law Division to consolidate it with this action, which had been filed that morning. Feinstein then stipulated to dismissal of the late charges and legal fees, leaving only the uncontested rent charges which Rochelle was prepared to pay. Feinstein accepted the $236 tendered by Rochelle, which included $29 in court costs, and indicated on the receipt that Rochelle had a $-0- rent balance through June. The court determined that the nonpayment action had been rendered moot by Feinstein\u2019s dismissal of the non-rent charges and Rochelle\u2019s payment of the actual rent due plus court costs. The court, therefore, dismissed the complaint rather than transfer it to the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>On October 28, 2004, Feinstein filed a third summary dispossess complaint against Renita. In addition to $165 in rent, the complaint itemized $619 in non-rent charges, including $249 in late charges and attorneys\u2019/legal fees \u2014 the same itemized fees that had been dismissed at the June 28, 2004 hearing in Docket No. T-16116-04. When she received this complaint, Renita \u201cran around trying to get the money together\u201d and paid $600 before the court date because she was afraid a warrant of removal would issue. Notwithstanding the fact that Renita paid substantially more than the $165 rent due, Feinstein did not dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The summonses appended to each of the summary dispossess complaints state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">NOTICE TO TENANT: The purpose of the attached complaint is to permanently remove you and your belongings from the premises. If you want the court to hear your side of the case you must appear in court on this date and time: <em>\\ </em>] at 8:30 a.m., or the court may rule against you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The heading on each summons contains a checked line stating, \u201cNonpayment \u2014 Back Rent Claimed\u201d and include the total amount of rent plus the extraneous charges. Nothing in the summonses or complaints indicates that plaintiffs had to pay only the rent to avoid eviction. Between October 2003 and October 2004, plaintiffs were faced with four summary dispossess complaints, all of which were pled in such a manner as to lead plaintiffs to believe they had to pay the full amount of rent plus extraneous charges to avoid eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">This complaint was filed in the Law Division on June 4, 2004, the same day both plaintiffs appeared in the Special Civil Part on summary dispossess complaints. On June 24, plaintiffs amended the complaint to add Scheckel as an individual defendant and allege that she and Feinstein violated federal laws and regulations governing Section 8 housing assistance programs; the New Jersey anti-eviction statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1a, New Jersey Court Rules and <em>Community Realty Mgmt. v. Harris, 155 N.J. 212, 714 </em>A.2d 282 (1998); the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1692 to 1692o; the New Jersey Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>sumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-1 to -156; and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-9 of the New Jersey Landlord/Tenant Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Defendants moved for summary judgment. On March 4, 2005, the motion was granted. In a written opinion, the trial judge correctly found that plaintiffs had standing to pursue their claims and that the issues were not moot by virtue of the dismissal of the summary dispossess complaints because the issues are \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review \u201d (citing <em>Hous. Auth. v. Jackson, </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>622, 631 (D.N.J.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The trial judge determined that neither 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(l) nor <em>Community Realty Mgmt. v. Harris, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>212, 714 A.2d 282 (1998), prohibit the acts of which plaintiffs complained. The court explained its reasons for dismissing each of the counts, except count four.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On count three, plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that defendants violated the FDCPA, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">Conceding [that] the true purpose of the Act is to provide protection to debtors from harassment, embarrassment, and inconvenience, and to provide consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuse, Plaintiffs urge the court to find that Defendants are \u201cdebt collectors\u201d as defined by the Act. The United States Supreme Court has held that the FDCPA\u2019s definition of \u201cdebt collector,\u201d Section 803(6), 15 <em>U.S.C. </em>Sec. 1692a(6), \u201capplies to attorneys who \u2018regularly\u2019 engage in consumer-debt-collection activity, even when that activity consists of litigation.\u201d <em>Heintz v. Jenkins, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>291, 299 [115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1489, 1490, 131 <em>L.ED.2d </em>395, 399] (1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">However, since the attorneys in this case are not \u201cregularly\u201d engaged in the collection of debts, they could not be \u201cdebt collectors\u201d as defined by the Act and by <em>Heintz. Id. </em>Here, the attorneys\u2019 principal business is not debt collection, but real estate and landlord tenant matters. Plaintiffs, in their complaints, are seeking possession of the premises, not collecting a debt. Summary dispossess proceedings based on late payment of rent are \u201cdesigned to secure performance of the rental obligation.\u201d <em>Vineland Shopping Center, Inc. v. Louis DeMarco, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>459, 469, 173 A.2d 270 (1961). Moreover, the attorneys signed the form on behalf of the firm and their client, the landlord corporation (Sasil), who is asserting his own rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>under the lease agreement, not the rights of another acquired party. Direct action by landlord creditors on their own debt \u2014 assuming an action for non-payment of rent would be considered collecting a debt \u2014 do not fall within the scope of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. <em>In re Cooper, </em>253 <em>B.R. </em>286 (Bankr. N.D.F1.2000). In addition, there is a myriad of legislation, case law, and court rales dealing with the landlord-tenant relationship that seek to protect the rights of tenants. In the area of landlord/tenant law, when a question arises, the Anti-Eviction Act is liberally construed, and all doubts are resolved in tenant\u2019s favor. <em>Carteret Properties v. Variety Donuts, Inc., </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>116, 127, 228 A2d 674 (1967); <em>See 447 Associates v. Miranda, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>522, 529, 559 A.2d 1362 (1989). The court simply does not see a need, and Plaintiff does not make out a ease for importing a federal law that is inapplicable to the facts in this case, was not designated to benefit the rights of tenants, and would have an enormous impact on present summary dispossess actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In this appeal, plaintiffs focus solely on the FDCPA<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claim against Feinstein and argue that (1) summary judgment must be reversed because the trial court ignored the plain language and purpose of the FDCPA and Feinstein is a \u201cdebt collector\u201d subject to the Act; (2) the trial court erred in finding that a summary dispossess action is not a debt collection; (3) a summary dispossess action is a direct or indirect attempt to collect a debt and, therefore, subject to the FDCPA; and (4) Feinstein\u2019s practices violate \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692f of the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We start our discussion of whether the FDCPA applies with a brief overview of summary dispossess actions. The summary dispossess statute is intended to \u201cafford landlords an expedited procedure to regain possession of the leased premises, thereby avoiding the delays ordinarily associated with common-law ejectment actions.\u201d <em>Hous. Auth. v. Little, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>274, 280, 639 A.2d 286 (1994). Possession of the premises is the only available remedy; money damages are not recoverable. <em>Ibid. </em>Unpaid rent is the only basis for summary eviction. \u201cA landlord is not entitled to evict based upon failure to pay any attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>fees, costs, or late charges, unless there is a lease provision which states that such fees are collectable as rent.\u201d <em>Harris, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 242, 714 A.2d 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The specific purpose of a summary dispossess proceeding is \u201cto secure performance of the rental obligation in actions based on nonpayment of rent.\u201d <em>Little, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 639 A.2d 286 (citing <em>Vineland Shopping Ctr., supra, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 173 A.2d 270). If the tenant tenders the rent prior to the final judgment in a proceeding based on nonpayment of rent, the summary remedy is no longer available to the landlord. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-55. Procedurally, \u201c[a] summary judgment for possession is enforced by a warrant of removal that cannot issue until three days after the entry of the judgment for possession.\u201d <em>Little, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 639 A.2d 286 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-57). \u201cThe warrant of removal, in turn, cannot be executed until three days after its issuance.\u201d <em>Ibid.; See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-10.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The FDCPA prohibits a \u201cdebt collector\u201d from engaging in \u201cany conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1692d. The Act applies to lawyers engaged in litigation seeking payment of consumer debts. <em>Heintz, supra., </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>at 294, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1490, 131 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 399. Indeed, \u201c[attorneys who regularly engage in debt collection or debt collection litigation are covered by the FDCPA and their litigation activities must comply with the requirements of the Act.\u201d <em>Piper, supra, </em>396 F.3d at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In <em>Heintz, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the broad issue of \u201cwhether the term \u2018debt collector\u2019 in the [FDCPA] applies to a lawyer who \u2018regularly,\u2019 <em>through litigation, </em>tries to collect consumer debts.\u201d 514 <em>U.S. </em>at 292, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1490, 131 L.Ed.2d at 398. There, the defendant law firm sued on behalf of a bank to collect on a defaulted loan. The Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">There are two rather strong reasons for believing that the Act applies to the litigating activities of lawyers. <em>First, </em>the Act defines the \u201cdebt eollector[s]\u201d to whom it applies as including those who \u201cregularly collect or attempt to collect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>directly or indirectly, [consumer] debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\u201d \u00a7 1692a(6). In ordinary English, a lawyer who regularly tries to obtain payment of consumer debts through legal proceedings is a lawyer who regularly \u201cattempts\u201d to \u201ccollect\u201d those consumer debts. <em>See, e.g., </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 263 (6lh ed. 1990) (\u201cTo collect a debt or claim is to obtain payment or liquidation of it, either by personal solicitation or legal proceedings\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\"><em>Second, </em>in 1977, Congress enacted an earlier version of this statute, which contained an express exemption for lawyers. That exemption said that the term \u201cdebt collector\u201d did not include \u201cany attorney-at-law collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client.\u201d Pub.L. 95-109, \u00a7 803(6)(F), 91 Stat. 874, 875. In 1986, however, Congress repealed this exemption in its entirety, Pub.L. 99-361, 100 Stat. 768, without creating a narrower, litigation-related, exemption to fill the void. Without more, then, one would think that Congress intended that lawyers be subject to the Act whenever they meet the general \u201cdebt collector\u201d definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">[/d at 294-95,115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1490-91,131 L.Ed.2d at 399.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The Court concluded that the FDCPA \u201capplies to attorneys who \u2018regularly\u2019 engage in consumer-debt-collection activity, even when that activity consists of litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1493, 131 <em>L.Ed. 2d </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">In <em>Piper, </em>the defendant law firm was retained by the City of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to collect payments for overdue water and sewer obligations. When notified by the City that the Pipers owed $252.71 in delinquent water bills, the law firm sent six letters and made numerous phone calls to them before initiating litigation. The notice provided to the Pipers stated, \u201cCivil Action \u2014 In Rem\u201d without further explanation. The law firm filed a writ of execution for a money judgment and ultimately obtained a judgment against the Pipers in the amount of $465.77. After the Pipers\u2019 home was scheduled for a sheriffs sale, they filed an action against the law firm alleging that its attempt to collect payment of the water and sewer bills violated the FDCPA and the Pennsylvania Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act. 396 F.3d at 229-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The Pipers\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction precluding the law firm from taking any action to facilitate the sheriffs sale was granted. <em>Id. </em>at 231-32. The law firm argued that it was not subject to the FDCPA because it was merely enforcing a lien in an <em>in rem </em>action. The Third Circuit rejected that argument on the ground that \u201cthe Pipers\u2019 consumption of water created a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>debt that could be collected in any action in assumpsit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234. The fact that a lien secured the debt did not change its character. <em>Ibid. </em>The court concluded that the law firm was subject to the FDCPA because (1) the Pipers\u2019 obligation \u201cfits the statutory definition of a \u2018debt\u2019 \u201d and (2) the law firm\u2019s \u201cactivities\u201d fit the statutory definition of a \u201cdebt collector.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The FDCPA defines a \u201cdebt\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">[A]ny obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">[15 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1692a(5).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The Act defines \u201cdebt collector\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">[Ajny person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">[15 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1692a(6)J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>did not. determine that it was improper to include late charges or any other charges classified as additional rent in the Complaint, but that it was improper to require a Section 8 tenant to pay late charges to avoid eviction. Therefore, we determined that it was proper to include late charges and legal fees in addition to basic rent in the summary dispossess Complaints for non-payment if there are contractual charges designated as additional rent under the lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">The question before us is whether a summary dispossess action constitutes the collection of a debt such that a law firm \u201cregularly\u201d engaged in the practice of filing summary dispossess actions is subject to the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">The trial court found that Feinstein was not a \u201cdebt collector\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA because it was not \u201cregularly\u201d engaged in the collection of debts. The record does not support that finding, however. There was no discovery prior to the summary judgment motion from which a determination could be made as to whether the firm \u201cregularly\u201d engaged in summary dispossess proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">Scheckel\u2019s certification in support of defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion infers, by virtue of her experience and expertise, that she does, indeed, \u201cregularly\u201d engage in the practice. Scheckel states in her certification that after reviewing <em>Harris, </em>the firm</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Defendant maintains that since summary dispossess actions are <em>in rem, </em>rather than <em>in personam, </em>and the landlord is seeking possession rather than a money judgment against the tenant, an attorney filing a summary dispossess action cannot be a \u201cdebt collector\u201d subject to the FDCPA. The Third Circuit rejected a similar argument in <em>Piper, </em>where, as stated above, the complaint sought foreclosure to enforce a lien for outstanding water and sewer bills. 396 F.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">A summary dispossess action is an <em>in rem </em>proceeding that, in effect, enforces a lien for outstanding rent. Rather than foreclosure of an ownership interest, the summary dispossess action forecloses the right to possession of the leased premises. In our view, there is virtually no difference between an <em>in rem </em>proceeding for foreclosure on outstanding water and sewer bills and a summary dispossess action for eviction on outstanding rent for purposes of the FDCPA. In both actions, payment of the outstanding debt will allow the debtor to avoid foreclosure or eviction. We hold, therefore, that a summary dispossess action is an action on a \u201cdebt\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1692a(5), and the attorney filing the action is a \u201cdebt collector\u201d subject to the FDCPA, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1692a(6), <em>if </em>the attorney \u201cregularly\u201d engages in the practice of filing summary dispossess actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Defendant argues that the notice requirements of the FDCPA are inconsistent with the summary dispossess proceeding, which is intended to \u201cafford landlords an expedited procedure to regain possession of leased premises.\u201d <em>Little, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 280, 639 A.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Under the FDCPA, a debt collector must, within five days of the initial communication, provide information regarding the debt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the creditor and notice that the debt will be considered valid unless the debtor disputes it within thirty days. The debt collector must also provide a statement that if the debtor notifies the debt collector within thirty days that the debt is disputed, \u201cthe debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of the judgment against the consumer.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1692g(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Defendant maintains that the FDCPA notice requirements would have the following effects on a summary dispossess proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">1) The attorney for the landlord must include the information from subsection (a) [of 15 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1692g] within the non-payment Complaint or in a separate notice to be served upon the tenant after the Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">2) The tenant will be notified in the Summons from the Special Civil Part, Landlord/Tenant Division when his Court date is and that he may lose possession of his apartment on that date. (See Appendix XI-B to the Rules Governing the Courts).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">3) Separate from that, the tenant will be notified that he has thirty days to dispute the amount claimed in the Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">4) Thus, if the trial date in the Landlord/Tenant action predates the thirty days, the tenant could be evicted prior to having the opportunity to dispute the debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">5) On the other hand, the Courts would be compelled to list matters for trial only after the thirty day period has expired, thereby, negating the summary process statutorily mandated in the State of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">6) Further, a savvy tenant could wait until the eve of the trial date and provide a written notice to the attorney indicating that he disputes some minimal amount of the rent and charges set forth in the non-payment Complaint. In doing so, the tenant would forestall his eviction as the attorney would be compelled to cease the Summary Dispossess proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Plaintiffs suggest that the complaint itself should serve as the initial notice and include the information required by the FDCPA. Defendant dismisses that suggestion as \u201cmak[ing] an absurdity of the FDCPA.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">In our view, the complaint may readily serve as the initial notice and include the information required by the FDCPA Allowing the tenant thirty days to dispute the amount owed is not unreasonable nor does it defeat the intent of the summary dispossess proceeding to provide prompt relief to the landlord. With respect to trial dates, we note that the four complaints against plaintiffs all had trial dates substantially later than thirty days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>complaints were filed; for example, the complaint filed on October 31, 2003 listed trial for December 15, 2003, and the complaints filed on April 28,2004 listed trial for June 4, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that \u201ca savvy tenant could wait until the eve of trial\u201d to provide notice that she disputes the amount set forth in the complaint. The \u201ceve of trial\u201d dispute is readily disposed of by filing a verified complaint that clearly distinguishes between the late charges and legal fees and the amount of actual rent the tenant must pay to avoid eviction. A verified complaint would satisfy the requirements of 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1692g(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We see nothing inconsistent with the FDCPA notice requirements and the intent of a summary dispossess action. Indeed, we consider the enhanced notice requirements as consistent with the intent of the anti-eviction statute and protections afforded to Section 8 tenants in 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437f, and the state statute requiring dismissal of the complaint for eviction upon payment of the actual rent due and owing, regai\u2019dless of any outstanding non-rent or extraneous charges. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Our holding here \u2014 that the FDCPA applies to attorneys prosecuting summary dispossess actions \u2014 is, of course, dependent on a finding that the attorney is a \u201cdebt collector\u201d within the definition of 15 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1692a(6). Such a finding may necessitate discovery to determine whether the attorney \u201cregularly\u201d engages in the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Here, there was no evidence before the trial court upon which to base such a finding \u2014 unless we consider Scheckel\u2019s certification which infers that essentially all of her practice involves prosecuting landlord/tenant complaints. We decline to conclude that Feinstein \u201cregularly\u201d engages in the practice on that basis. We, therefore, reverse the grant of summary judgment <em>on </em>count three of the complaint and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Finally, we would be remiss if we did not address the manner in which the complaints against these plaintiffs were drafted and prosecuted. Although this issue is not before us on appeal, we are struck by the fundamental unfairness of a complaint that characterizes as \u201crent\u201d the additional late charges and legal fees for which the tenant may be contractually liable under the lease but not required to pay to avoid eviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We are mindful that this issue has not been briefed or argued, but on its face, the failure to distinguish between the total amount due and the amount required to avoid eviction gives the appearance of a due process violation. \u201cIt is beyond question that any procedure which deprives an individual of a property interest must conform to the dictates of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Twp. of Montville v. Block 69, Lot 10, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 376 A.2d 909 (1977) (citations omitted). \u201cIn New Jersey, as elsewhere, \u2018[t]he essential components of due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>First Resolution Inv. Corp. v. Seker, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>502, 513-14, 795 A.2d 868 (2002) (quoting <em>Mettinger v. Globe Slicing Mach. Co., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>371, 389, 709 A.2d 779 (1998)). \u201cAt a minimum, due process requires that a party in a judicial hearing receive \u2018notice defining the issues and an adequate opportunity to prepare and respond.\u2019 \u201d <em>H.E.S. v. J.C.S., </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>309, 321, 815 A.2d 405 (2003) (quoting <em>McKeown-Brand v. Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>546, 559, 626 A.2d 425 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In our view, the complaints served on these plaintiffs do not provide adequate notice because they do not clearly distinguish between the amount the tenant must pay to avoid eviction and the extraneous charges due and owing under the lease. We, therefore, refer this matter to the Supreme Court Civil Practice Committee for consideration of possible amendments to the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of practice and review of the forms currently included in the appendix to the New Jersey Court Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">To summarize our ruling, we reverse the grant of summary judgment dismissing count three of the complaint against Fein-stein and remand for further proceedings; and we refer the summary dispossess pleadings to the Civil Practice Committee for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-10\"> The complaint against Rosalie Seheckel, individually, was dismissed by the trial court on the ground that she cannot be held individually liable \"for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>debts, obligations, or liabilities of the firm'\u2019'\u2019 pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-23.
