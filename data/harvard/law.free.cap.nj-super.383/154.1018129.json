(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Defendant appeals his convictions of third-degree attempt to obtain Pereocet, a controlled dangerous substance (CDS), by fraud, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-13 and 2C:5-1 (Count One); and third-degree forgery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-la(2) (Count Two). We are presented with the question, whether evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to defraud the State\u2019s regulatory program concerning the dispensing of prescription drugs by attempting to pass a forged prescription to a regulated pharmacy, satisfies the statutory requirement that the individual committed the act \u201cwith a purpose to defraud or injure\u201d another. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-la. We answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on both Counts. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, <em>Rule </em>3:20-1, asserting that the State failed to present evidence from which the jury could reasonably have determined that he possessed the requisite mens rea under the forgery statute. The motion was denied on September 15, 2004. On the same date, defendant was sentenced to ninety days incarceration at the Morris County Jail, to be served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>in the Sheriffs Labor Assistance Program<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (SLAP), and three years probation on the conviction for attempting to obtain a CDS by fraud (Count One). An identical sentence was imposed on Count Two, <em>to </em>run concurrent with the sentence on Count One. Appropriate assessments were also imposed. Defendant appealed. On February 4, 2005, an order was entered in the Law Division staying the sentence pending this appeal. Except to vacate the sentence imposed on Count Two, which should have merged with defendant\u2019s conviction on Count One, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In January 2002, defendant suffered severe accidental injuries, requiring him to undergo four surgeries between January 2002, and April 2003. Following the surgeries, defendant was prescribed Oxycontin and Percocet, and became addicted to the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On April 28, 2003, defendant\u2019s physician, Dr. Silk, delivered to defendant a completed prescription, to which a blank prescription form was accidentally attached. On the same date, defendant filled in the blank prescription form for ninety 10-mg Percocet pills in the name of a fictitious person, Steven Williams; forged Dr. Silk\u2019s signature; and presented the same to a clerk at the Morris Plains Pharmacy. The clerk presented the prescription to the pharmacist who recognized that the signature was forged. The clerk attempted to stall defendant while the police were summoned, but defendant left the store. Approximately five hours later, defendant returned to the pharmacy and was recognized by the clerk. The clerk again attempted to stall defendant, but defendant left the pharmacy a second time. The police arrived and apprehended defendant in his automobile outside the pharmacy. Defendant initially denied attempting to pass the forged prescription, but later admitted to the act. Defendant advised the police he had left the pharmacy because he felt remorseful, knowing that his actions were \u201cillegal\u201d and envisioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the possible impact that his actions could have on his family and employment, not because he thought he \u201cwas going to be apprehended or that [the pharmacist] called the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">On appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">THE CONVICTION OF FORGERY SHOULD HAVE MERGED INTO THE CONVICTION OF ATTEMPT TO OBTAINQ A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE BY FRAUD.

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE EVEN INDICATING THAT DEFENDANT INTENDED TO DEFRAUD OR INJURE ANYONE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">B. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS OR COULD HAVE BEEN AN INJURED PARTY AS A RESULT OF DEFENDANT\u2019S ACTIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">\n<em>POINT III.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">THE COURT GAVE THE JURY INADEQUATE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE REQUISITE MENS REA FOR A FORGERY CONVICTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-14\">\n<em>POINT IV.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-15\">THE COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO TAILOR THE CHARGE ON RENUNCIATION TO THE FACTS OF THE CASE CONSTITUTED PLAIN ERROR WARRANTING A REVERSAL. (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-16\">\n<em>POINT V.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-17\">THE COURT SHOULD REVERSE THE JURY\u2019S VERDICT ON COUNT ONE BECAUSE [THE] PROSECUTOR\u2019S WRONGFUL AND PREJUDICIAL REMARKS MADE DURING SUMMATION DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF A FAIR TRIAL. (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-18\">\n<em>POINT VI.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-19\">THE COURT SHOULD REVERSE THE JURY\u2019S VERDICT ON COUNT ONE AS TAINTED BY THE IMPROPER VERDICT ON COUNT TWO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">We have reviewed each of these arguments in light of the record and the pertinent law, and we conclude that the arguments presented under Points IV, V, and VI are without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). We find it necessary only to discuss defendant\u2019s arguments under Points I, II, and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal made at the end of the State\u2019s case, asserting that the State had not proffered any evidence <em>from </em>which the jury could have inferred that he possessed the requisite mens rea under the forgery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, or after all evidence has been presented, the court must, on motion by defendant or on its own initiative, grant a motion to acquit if \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to warrant a conviction.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:18-1. When a motion is made pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:18-1, the trial judge must deny the motion if \u201cviewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence direct or circumstantial,\u201d and giving the State the benefit of all reasonable inferences, \u201ca reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967). An appellate court will apply the same standard as the trial court to decide if a judgment of acquittal was warranted. <em>Stale v. Moffa, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>258, 263, 200 A.2d 108 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Although it is undisputed that defendant wrote a prescription for Percoeet prescribed to a fictitious person, forged Dr. Silk\u2019s name, and attempted to fill the prescription by presenting it to a registered pharmacist, defendant contends that under the forgery statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-la, the State was required to prove that he intended to injure or prejudice the rights of another, and the State failed to present such evidence. Defendant contends that the State\u2019s proofs failed because the only person who possibly could have been injured had the transaction been concluded, would have been the pharmacist, and only if defendant failed to pay for the drugs. Defendant asserts that it was always his intention to pay the pharmacist for the drugs, and therefore, the State\u2019s proofs failed to establish that he intended to injure or prejudice another person. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-la provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">A person is guilty of forgery if, with purpose to defraud or injure anyone, or with knowledge that he is facilitating a fraud or injury to be perpetrated by anyone, the actor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aby\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(2) Makes, completes, executes, authenticates, issues or transfers any writing so that it purports to be the act of another who did not authorize that act or of a fictitious person, or to have been executed at a time or place or in a numbered sequence other than was in fact the case, or to be a copy of an original when no such original existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The State is required to prove that a defendant who \u201cmakes, completes, [or] executes ... any writing so that it purports to be the act of another who did not authorize that act\u201d commits the act \u201cwith [the] purpose to defraud or injure anyone.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-la. We conclude that the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to infer that defendant acted with the purpose of defrauding another (\u201canyone\u201d) because the State may be an \u201cinjure[d]\u201d person under the statute. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 9, 277 A.2d 894 (App.Div.1971); <em>State v. Longo, </em>132 <em>N.J.L. </em>515, 519, 41 A.2d 317 (Sup.Ct.), <em>aff'd, </em>133 <em>N.J.L. </em>301, 44 A.2d 349 (E. &amp; A.1945). In <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant was convicted of uttering a forged driver\u2019s license to a police officer, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:109-1, the predecessor forgery statute. The pre-code statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">Any person who, with intent to prejudice, injure, damage or defraud any other person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">a. Falsely makes, alters, forges or counterfeits any record or authentic matter of a public nature or character, or any printed or written Instrument or indorsement, acceptance, transfer or assignment thereof; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">b. Utters or publishes as true, any such false, altered, forged or counterfeited matter, knowing the same to be false, altered, forged or counterfeited\u2014 Is guilty of a high misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial judge should have granted a motion for judgment of acquittal because \u201cthere was no proof that anyone was defrauded by said utterance.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>115 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 8, 277 A.2d 894. This court rejected that argument, concluding \u201cthe \u2018person\u2019 defrauded within the meaning of forgery statutes can be a governmental unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 277 A.2d 894. However, we reversed the conviction in <em>Johnson, </em>determining that the charge of uttering a forged driver\u2019s license should have been prosecuted under the motor vehicle statutes, not the general forgery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>In <em>Longo, </em>a Hudson County election official voted in the Republican primary, but, in order to conceal the party affiliation, changed the voting records to reflect that he had voted in the Democratic primary, and was convicted of forgery. On appeal, the defendant argued that there was no intent to injure a person. The court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">We think an intent to prejudice is clearly inferable from the factual situation presented in this ease. The legislature has, by the election laws, provided for the office of Commissioner of Registration and has provided that the record of votes cast by citizens in primary elections be kept, an incident of which is a notation of the party ballot voted by each such voter. It is the established public policy that such record be kept and that it be kept honestly and accurately. The altering or falsification of such a record is at least prejudicial to and a fraud upon the State. <em>[Longo, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 519, 41 A.2d 317.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On the other hand, in <em>State v. Weigel, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 462, 477 A.2d 372 (App.Div.1984), this court distinguished <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Longo, </em>and determined that the State was not an \u201cinjured person\u201d under the forgery statute because the State did not have a direct interest in the matter. Here, defendant similarly contends that the State is too far removed from the transaction for defendant to be found to have intended to injure the State. We determine otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Control, sale, and use of prescription drugs are highly regulated matters in the State of New Jersey. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-1 to -5.3. Control over the manner in which CDS is prescribed by medical providers and dispensed upon prescription by regulated pharmacists is part of the State\u2019s overall regulatory scheme controlling the use and sale of CDS. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>24:21-1 to -53 (New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substance Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:14-40 to -80 (New Jersey Pharmacy Practice Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-22.19 (prescription of Schedule II CDS); and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:65-1.1 to -11.7 (regulations pertaining to CDS). \u201cA prescription for a controlled dangerous substance may be issued only by an individual [licensed] practitioner.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>8:65-7.3(a). \u201cThe responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances is upon the prescribing practitioner, but a corresponding responsibility rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:65-7.4(a). We hold that the State has a direct interest in protecting its highly regulatory scheme controlling the prescription, sale, and use of CDS, and therefore, the State is a proper injured \u201cperson\u201d under the forgery statute when a defendant attempts to pass a forged prescription to a regulated pharmacy. We are satisfied that the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to infer that defendant acted with the purpose of defrauding the State\u2019s regulatory scheme governing the dispensing of CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Defendant, while acknowledging <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Longo, </em>requests that we reject their holdings, citing <em>State v. Raymo, </em>419 So.2d 858 (La.1982). We decline the invitation. In <em>Raymo, </em>like here, a defendant was charged under Louisiana\u2019s general forgery statute after forging a doctor\u2019s name to a prescription and attempting to use it to secure drugs for her personal use. On appeal from conviction of the charge, the Louisiana Supreme Court was presented with the question of \u201cwhether forgery may be committed without intent to injure or prejudice the rights of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858. The Court reversed, determining that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence that she attempted or intended to obtain either medical services from the doctor or the pharmacist without paying for them. She certainly intended to deceive the pharmacist, but she did not intend to injure or prejudice anyone\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860. Although Justice Lemmon\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Raymo </em>raised the issue of the State being an injured or defrauded party, <em>see id. </em>at 861 n. 2, the majority never raised nor discussed the issue. Because New Jersey courts have already recognized that the State may be a proper injured \u201cperson\u201d under the forgery statute, <em>Johnson, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 9, 277 A.2d 894, and <em>Longo, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 519, 41 A.2d 317, when the State has a direct interest in the matter, <em>Weigel, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 462, 477 A.2d 372, we determine <em>Raymo </em>to be of little precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Defendant also contends that the judge failed to adequately define the requisite mens rea for forgery in the jury instructions. On the issue of mens rea, the charge provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The second element that the Stale must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant acted with purpose to defraud or injure, or with knowledge that the defendant is facilitating a fraud or injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">A person acts purposefully with respect to the nature of his conduct, or the result of that conduct, if it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature, or to cause such a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">A person acts purposefully with respect to attendant circumstances if the person is aware of the existence of such circumstances, or believes or hopes that they exist!.] [\u201cW]ith purpose, [\u201dJ [\u201c]design,[\u201dl [\u201c]with design,!\u201d] or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">A person acts knowingly with respect to the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances if he is aware that his conduct is of that nature, or that such circumstances exist or he is aware of a high probability of their existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">A person acts knowingly with respect to the result of his conduct if he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result. L\u201cJKnowing[,\u201d] with knowledge!,\u201d] or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">To defraud means to deprive a person of property or any interest, estate, or right by deceit, artifice, trickery, or cheat. To injure means to cause any damage that may ensue to the good name, standing, position, or general reputation of the purported author of the statement. It may also mean to misrepresent, or injuriously affect the sentiments, opinions, conduct, character, prospects, interests, or rights of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">Purposefully or knowingly are stales of mind and cannot be seen and can only be determined by inference from conduct, words, or acts. Therefore, it is not necessary that witnesses be produced by the State to testily that a defendant said he purposefully or knowingly did something. His purpose or knowledge may be gathered from his acts, and his conduct, and from all he did and said at a particular time, and place, and from all the surrounding circumstances in the testimony given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Defendant contends that the \u201cmodel jury charge does not adequately distinguish between the act of being fraudulent, ie.[,] using an artifice of deceit to accomplish a purpose, and an intent to defraud, ie.[,] to harm or injure.\u201d Defendant asserts that a proper charge would have instructed the jury that in order to find him guilty, \u201cthey must find that he had a purpose to harm some person or entity.\u201d Defendant also contends that the statutory phrase \u201c \u2018with knowledge that he is facilitating a fraud or injury to be perpetrated by anyone\u2019 is not applicable to persons who act alone,\u201d and therefore, the State was required to prove \u201can intent\u201d to defraud. He asserts that a \u201cknowing\u201d state of mind only suffices when the actor works with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Correct charges are essential for a fair trial. <em>State v. Collier, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>117, 122, 447 A.2d 168 (1982). A jury instruction is \u201ca road map to guide the jury and without an appropriate charge a jury can take a wrong turn in its deliberations.\u201d <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2,15, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990). The applicable mens rea portion of the forgery statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">A person is guilty of forgery if, with <em>purpose </em>to defraud or injure anyone, or with <em>knowledge </em>that he is facilitating a fraud or injury to be perpetrated by anyone, the actor____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-1 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The judge instructed the jury that in order to convict, the jury must find that defendant acted with a purpose to defraud or knowledge that he was facilitating a fraud. By the plain language of the statute, the requisite mens rea for forgery is \u201cwith purpose to defraud\u201d or \u201cwith knowledge that he is facilitating a fraud.\u201d While the phrase \u201cto be perpetrated by anyone\u201d is primarily directed at multi-party frauds, it does not exclude the perpetrator who acts with knowledge individually. The actor himself/herself falls within the category of \u201canyone.\u201d Accordingly, \u201cknowledge\u201d that the actor\u2019s conduct will facilitate his/her own fraud is sufficient. We find no error in the jury instruction or in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument under Point I is not contested by the State. The State concedes that the convictions of forgery and attempt to obtain a CDS by fraud should have been merged for sentencing because the elements essential to convict for forgery were integral to convict on the attempt charge. We concur. <em>See State v. Cole, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>321, 325-30, 576 A.2d 864 (1990). We vacate the sentence on Count Two, and remand to the trial court to amend the judgment of conviction. The merger of the two convictions will not affect defendant\u2019s term of incarceration to be served at the Morris County Jail in SLAP because defendant\u2019s sentences were to be served concurrently. However, any assessments imposed for the conviction on Count Two must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The convictions and the sentence on Count One are affirmed; the stay of the sentence on Count One is vacated; the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>imposed on Count Two is vacated; and we remand for amendment of the judgment of conviction in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\"> The Sheriffs Labor Assistance Program is a community-service program run by the Morris County Sheriff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
