The demandant certainly has equity to support his title; and I trust the Court will be of opinion that the law also is in favor of it. Such construction must, however, be given to the deed, as will effectuate the intention of the parties, if it can be done consistently with the rules of law ; and to effectuate the intention of the parties to this deed, it must be construed to convey an estate of inheritance in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">The tenant\u2019s construction of the deed is, that it is a <em>bargain and sale, </em>vesting the legal estate in <em>Cumings </em>and the other grantees, during the life of <em>Hunt, </em>in trust for him, and the remainder to <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>heirs, who take as purchasers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-10\">Before considering the objections to this construction, I will consider the nature of a trust and use, with a view to show the difference between them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-11\">Trusts in <em>England </em>now are what uses were before the statute of 27 <em>Hen. </em>8. The object of that statute was to destroy the double property in land, which had been introduced by the invention of uses ; for this purpose enacting that the legal seisin and possession should be annexed to the use. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The statute was intended to destroy trusts as well as uses, both being mentioned in it, and being originally synonymous terms. But the strict construction, which was at first given to the statute, in a great measure defeated its extent; as it was determined that there were some uses not executed by it. Uses of course, under the name of trusts, have continued distinct from the legal estate. The courts of equity have interfered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>and supported them. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> A trust, then, is a use not executed by the statute of uses. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\">In England, by the construction given to the statute, [ * 191 ] a * use cannot be limited upon a use. Hence it followed that, in a deed of bargain and sale to <em>A, </em>for the use of <em>B, </em>the use was not executed by the statute, but was considered a trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-6\">The inconveniences resulting from the rigid construction given to the statute of uses in <em>England, </em>have been in a great degree obviated in this commonwealth by the statute of 1783, <em>c. </em>37, which dispenses with the ceremony of livery of seisin. A deed, therefore, made pursuant to the provisions of that statute, will now operate as a feoffment, so far as to limit a use upon a use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">The construction contended for on the part of the tenant is open to several objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-8\">The legal estate is in one, while another has the use; thereby creating a double property. Suppose <em>Cimings </em>and the other trustees to have died during the life of <em>Hunt, </em>the remainder could never have vested, as there would have been no person <em>in esse </em>to take. <em>Nemo est hares viventis. </em>In that event, the remainder would be contingent, and the inheritance would be in suspension or abeyance ; which is never allowed but in cases of absolute necessity. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> The remainder being contingent, no alienation could take place in the lifetime of the ancestor. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">To prevent these inconveniences, the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s </em>case was adopted \u2014 \u201c When the ancestor, by any gift or conveyance, takes an estate of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance, an estate is limited, either mediately or immediately, to his heirs, in fee or in tail, in such cases, the words <em>his heirs </em>are words of limitation of the estate, and not words of purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-10\">Another objection is, that we have no court, to which a <em>cestui que trust </em>could resort, to compel a trustee to a specific performance of the trust. It may be said that the <em>cestui que trust </em>might have an action at common law against the trustee. But this would not provide a specific performance of the trust; and of course the intention of the parties could not be effectuated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-11\">[ * 192 ] * The words \u201c their discretion,\u201d used in the <em>habendum </em>of the deed, will not aid the tenant in his construction ; as whatever was or would have been a trust at common law is since the statute of uses executed. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> Thus a devise to trustees and their heirs, in trust to permit <em>A </em>to take the profits for his life, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>afterwards to stand seised to the use of the heirs of <em>A\u2019s </em>body ; held to be an estate tail. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">The demandant\u2019s construction is, that the deed operates by way of feoffment, by which <em>Hunt </em>takes an estate of inheritance ; or as a release by way of <em>mitter le </em>droit, to pass all <em>Simonds\u2019s </em>right or in terest in the premises to <em>Cumings </em>and others, for the use of <em>Hunt</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">If it operate as a feoffment, the word <em>heirs </em>is a word of limitation, and not a word of purchase. The statute of uses executes a freehold estate in <em>Hunt; </em>and he takes the remainder at common law. The freehold and the remainder are conveyed by the same deed at the same instant, and are of the same nature. Is not the same estate conveyed by the deed, that would have been conveyed, if <em>Hunt </em>had been enfeoffed for life to his own use, with remainder to his heirs ? In that case, could there have been a doubt, but that <em>Hunt </em>would have taken an estate of inheritance ? If there were any difference in the nature of the particular estate and the remainder, <em>heirs </em>would be a word of purchase. There is no difference in the nature of the two estates. They are both legal estates; one executed by the statute of uses, the other by the common law; both being of the same nature, but differently executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">If the deed operate as a release, by way of <em>mitter le droit, </em>to pass <em>Simonds\u2019s </em>right or interest to <em>Cumings </em>and others for the use of <em>Hunt, </em>the word <em>heirs </em>is unnecessary, as no words of limitation are required in a release, that enures by way of <em>mitter le droit. </em><footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">It may be said by the tenant, that the deed could not operate as a release, because <em>Cumings </em>and others were not seised, so that a use could be raised to <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-9\">*But it may be answered, that when the deed was [ * 193 ] made, <em>Hunt </em>was in the possession of the premises conveyed, claiming an estate of some kind ; that the deed was made for his benefit, and is to be taken most strongly against <em>Simonds, </em>and in favor of <em>Hunt. </em>The consideration expressed in the deed being paid by <em>Cumings </em>and others to <em>Simonds </em>for the use of <em>Hunt, </em>who then had the possession, the tenant, claiming under <em>Simonds, </em>;s estopped to say that <em>Cumings </em>and the others were not seised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-10\">Whether, then, the deed shall be considered to operate as a feoffment or a release, <em>Hunt </em>took thereby an estate of inheritance, and the demandant is entitled to judgment according to the verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-11\">\n<em>Richardson.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A42\">It is apparent, from a bare perusal of the deed in question, that the motives, which led to the adoption of that particular mode of conveyance, must have been to keep the legal estate out of the control of <em>Josiah Hunt, </em>and within the control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and under the direction of the selectmen of <em>Hollis, </em>during <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>life. The language of the <em>habendum, </em>that the selectmen are to hold the premises for the use of <em>Hunt, </em>at their discretion, during his life, is too clear to be misunderstood. This discretion is wholly inconsistent with a vested estate in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-5\">The demandant\u2019s first position is, that this conveyance is to be construed as a feoffment; that the grant to <em>Cumings </em>and others, selectmen of <em>Hollis, </em>and their successors, gives them a fee ; that the use limited to <em>Hunt </em>for life is executed in him by the statute of uses ; that in the phrase, <em>\u201c </em>then to his heirs forever,\u201d the word <em>heirs </em>is used, not as <em>designatio persanes, </em>but as a word of limitation; and that therefore <em>Hunt </em>took by the deed a vested estate of inheritance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-6\">If these positions are true, the conclusion is correct. For it is admitted, as a settled principle of law, that if an estate be granted to a man for life, remainder to his heirs, or to the heirs of his body, this is (according to the words) either a fee simple or fee [ * 194 ] tail executed in such tenant of the * freehold. This rule, however, has exceptions, which it will be important to consider hereafter in the discussion of the present question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-7\">But this construction attempted by the demandant cannot, it is apprehended, be supported; because there are no words in the instrument, that can create an estate of inheritance in <em>Cumings </em>and others. A grant to a man and his successors gives him an estate for life only. <footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark> The case of the chantry priest (Co. <em>Lit. </em>9, 6,) is exactly in point. <em>Littleton </em>says, the word <em>heirs </em>only makes an estate of inheritance in all feoffments and grants. And <em>Coke, </em>in his commentary on those words, enumerates the exceptions which he says the law makes to the rule. The exceptions he enumerates clearly prove the rule applicable to the case at bar. The reason the law is so precise to prescribe certain words to create an estate of inheritance, is for avoiding uncertainty, the mother of contention and confusion ; and surely this is a good reason. It is believed that there is no modern case contrary to the law, as laid down on this point by <em>Littleton </em>and <em>Coke.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-8\">The estate of <em>Cumings </em>and others, then, is only for life. And it may be considered as a general rule, that the seisin of the feoffee, releasee, &amp;c., must be commensurate with the use declared thereupon ; or, in other words, <em>cestui que use </em>cannot have an estate in the use more extensive than the seisin out of which it is raised. <footnotemark>(10)</footnotemark> It is then clear that <em>Hunt </em>and his heirs could not take, by way of use, an estate greater than for the life of <em>Cumings, Whiting, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Goss. </em>Of course, the first ground taken for the demandant must be abandoned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\">The demandant\u2019s second position is, that the deed of <em>Simonds </em>is to be construed as a feoffment to <em>Cumings </em>and others, during the life of Hunt, to <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>use ; that this use is executed in <em>Hunt </em>by the statute of uses ; that the remainder passed, by way of feoffment at common law, directly from <em>Simonds </em>to <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>heirs; and that <em>Hunt </em>thus took a vested estate of inheritance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\">*But, admitting these premises to be true, the con- [ * 195 ] elusion does not follow. It was before admitted, as a rule of law, that when an estate is given to one for life, remainder to his heirs, he has a vested estate of inheritance. It now becomes important to state the exceptions to that rule, and the grounds and reasons of those exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">Those exceptions seem all to turn upon a distinction in the use of the word <em>heirs, </em>laid down in 3 <em>Salk. </em>292, that the words <em>heirs or issue, </em>when used to denote <em>a single person, </em>or so as to be only <em>designatio persona, </em>are words of purchase only; but when <em>collective, </em>they are words of limitation. One exception is, when the words <em>heirs or issue </em>have words of limitation annexed to them ; in such case they are used only as <em>designatio persona, </em>as where a devise was to <em>W. R. </em>for life, remainder to his heirs, and the heirs female of their bodies. .Here the heirs of <em>W. R. </em>take as purchasers; otherwise the inheritance would vest in <em>W. R., </em>and not in his heirs, which would be clearly contrary to the intent of the testator. Another exception is, where the estate for life is that of a trustee ; and as an example of this exception, suppose <em>Simonds </em>had conveyed by feoffment to <em>Cumings </em>and the others, during the life of <em>Hunt, </em>to the use of <em>Hunt </em>for life, remainder to the heirs of <em>Cumings </em>and the others. In this case, the words; <em>heirs of Cumings,\u201d </em>&amp;c. could not be construed as words of limitation,' but the heirs of <em>Cumings, </em>&amp;c. would take by purchase. The reason is obvious. The words, by which the remainder is conveyed, denote a beneficial estate; it would therefore be absurd to construe them as words only intended to limit another species of estate, which contained no beneficial interest. A third exception is, where the person entitled to the beneficial interest for life has not legal seisin of the freehold. Suppose <em>Simonds </em>to have conveyed by bargain and sale to <em>Cumings </em>and others, during the life of <em>Hunt </em>to <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>use for life, remainder to the heirs of <em>Hunt; </em>this would have been an example of this last exception; for as no use can be limited to arise out of a use, it follows that no use can be limited upon the legal estate of the bargainee. <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>estate, * therefore, must in this [ * 196 ] case be merely that of <em>cestui que trust: </em>then, as the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>in the remainder conveyed to the heirs must be intended to be the legal estate, if any, the word <em>heirs </em>must be construed a <em>designatio personae, </em>and not a limitation of <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>estate. Because it would seem to be absurd to construe words, intended to designate the persons who are to take a legal estate, as a mere limitation of the estate of a <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-5\">To apply the principles which seem to govern these exceptions, to the case before <em>the </em>Court:\u2014if <em>the </em>use <em>were </em>executed by the statute in <em>Hunt, </em>his estate was that of a <em>cestui que use, </em>and words limiting his estate must of necessity be limitations of the use ; but, by the position taken by the demandant, the word <em>heirs </em>is used to designate who is to take, not the use, but the direct legal estate; how, then, are the words <em>his heirs </em>to be construed as words of limitations ? Indeed, it seems to make no difference whether the use were executed in <em>Hunt </em>or not, because it was not the in.tent of the statute of uses to alter the mode of construing conveyances, but to join the legal estate and the use together. The only effect of the statute in this case would be to give <em>Hunt </em>the same estate in the land which he had in the use ; and his estate in the use being only for life, the statute of course could not execute in him any greater estate. Had <em>Simonds </em>conveyed to <em>Cumings </em>and others, and their heirs, to the use of <em>Hunt </em>for life, remainder to his heirs, it would seem, in such case, that he would have had an inheritance in the use, and the statute would have executed the use accordingly. But, unless the words <em>his heirs </em>can be construed as limiting <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>estate in the use, it seems very clear, that this case cannot be affected bj the statute of uses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">The tenant\u2019s position is, that the court may and ought to construe this deed as a feoffment, bargain and sale, or other species of conveyance, as may best fulfil the intention of the parties to it; that it ought to be construed as a bargain and sale, vesting in <em>Cumings </em>and others the legal estate during the life of <em>Hunt, </em>in L * 197 ] trust to permit him, during his life, to take * the profits, and passing the legal estate in the remainder directly from <em>Simonds </em>to <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>heirs as purchasers ; and this construction will give complete effect to the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">There is a consideration expressed in the deed to be paid in money by <em>Cumings </em>and others. This is sufficient to raise a use to them, which the statute of uses would execute in them. The limitation of the use to <em>Hunt </em>is, it is true, void in law ; but it is held in chancery to be a trust, which in conscience ought to be performed. <footnotemark>(11)</footnotemark> It is also true that we have no court of chancery, to compel the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>forrnance of such a trust; yet still, if the parties to a deed should deem it more proper and prudent to trust a legal estate to the conscience, honor, and honesty of three men, to dispose of die profits of the same for the use of an individual, whose capacity or habits perhaps render him unfit to have the control of real estate, there seems to be no good reason why such construction should be given to the conveyance, as wholly to defeat their intentions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\">It may perhaps be objected that <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>heirs, being strangers to the consideration, cannot take the remainder by way of bargain and sale. But <em>Cumings </em>and others may well be intended to have paid the consideration, as well on account of <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>heirs, as on their own account, which would be sufficient. <footnotemark>(12)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b167-12\"> 1 <em>Rep. </em>124, <em>a.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b168-13\"> 1 <em>Mk.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0C\">(after reciting the substance of the report of the trial, and stating the question reserved.) This cause has been very well argued on each side. The counsel for the tenant contends, that as the selectmen of <em>Hollis </em>were not a corporation to take in succession, and as the estate conveyed to them was for the use of <em>Josiah Hunt, </em>it vested in him by the statute of uses; but as the grantees took only a life estate, a life estate only vested in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">* It is therefore necessary to determine what estate [ * 198 ] the selectmen of <em>Hollis, </em>the immediate grantees, took under <em>Simonds\u2019s </em>deed. If they took an estate for the use of <em>Josiah Hunt </em>and his heirs, they took only a life estate ; for it is very clear that they are not a corporation. But if they took an estate in trust for <em>Hunt </em>and his heirs, then the legal estate of the trustees shall be commensurate with the equitable estate of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>which in this case is a fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Having no court to compel the specific performance of a trust, it is a general rule to * consider estates conveyed in trust, as estates conveyed to use, if it be not repugnant to the manifest intent of the grantor. If it be, it is considered as a trust estate, and the trustee is answerable for damages, as on an implied <em>assumpsit </em>to the <em>cestui que trust </em>that he would execute the trust \u2014 a remedy certainly very inconvenient, frequently very inadequate, and resorted to from necessity, because no court is competent to compel a specific performance of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Now, what is the manifest intention of <em>Simonds, </em>in this conveyance to the selectmen ? They are to hold the lands for the use of <em>Josiah </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Hunt, </em>but at their discretion. It could not therefore be an estate for the use of Hunt; for then the use being immediately executed, <em>Hunt </em>would hold the estate during his life, not subject to any control or discretion of the selectmen. Further, they are to hold for the use of <em>Hunt, </em>and if after his decease any estate should remain, it is to go to his heirs. <em>Simonds </em>therefore contemplated that the trustees were able to sell a part, if not the whole. He therefore could not mean that the legal and equitable interest in the estate should unite in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">For these reasons we are of opinion, that the selectmen, who were the immediate grantees, took the legal estate in trust for <em>Josiah Hunt </em>and his heirs. Whether they could lawfully convey any part of the estate under this deed by the terms of it, although it was clearly contemplated, is not now before us; as they in fact con- [ * 199 ] veyed no part of the * premises. As the estate of the grantees was in trust, it must be commensurate to the trust, and therefore was an estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\"><em>Josiah Hunt </em>had then an equitable fee simple, which he might lawfully devise ; and upon his death, his widow had under his will the same equitable estate, which the judgment creditor and his assigns may lawfully claim against her. And no person can set up the legal estate against the equitable estate, but the trustees, or some persons claiming under them.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">But in this case, neither the tenant nor <em>Simonds\u2019s </em>heirs claim under the trustees; as to them, therefore, the equitable estate of <em>Josiah Hunt, </em>his devisee, and her assigns, they having the actual possession, is sufficient to maintain this action. For the actual possession is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a legal seisin; and a stranger to the trust shall not be permitted to control this evidence, by proving the existence of the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Let judgment therefore be entered on the verdict, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\"> [If the selectmen took in their politic capacity, it would seem, that the words \u201c successors,\" in this case, might be as available, as in the case of a dean and chapter, bishop, parson, or vicar. (2 Bart. 11.) But, at any rate, it is quite clear, that if they took any thing, according to the intent of the grantor, they took in trust for <em>Hunt, </em>for and during his life, and for his heirs after his death. What the learned judge means, when he says, that <em>Joseph Hunt </em>had an equitable fee simple, is not very in telligible.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
