We are satisfied it is not. Had the action been by a party to the original suit, perhaps it would have been local. But of this we give no opinion. Here, however, a stranger to that suit complains of an injury. The action is, doubtless, transitory; for the plaintiff cannot be presumed to know whether the goods were taken under color of office or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>Plea in bar adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
