J., at the sittings after the last October term, in this county, the signatures of the promisers and endorser being admitted, the note was read in evidence. The defence was usury, to prove which the defendant offered to swear <em>Joel Wellington, </em>the other promiser, he having released him. To this the plaintiff objected, on the ground that he was ignorant of the fraud, and that if a party to a fraudulent negotiable security could be a witness to defeat * it in the hands of an innocent purchaser, the tendency [ * 200 ] would be, not to suppress, but to encourage fraud. The <em>chief justice </em>refused to permit <em>Wellington </em>to be sworn, in order to have the question settled; and a verdict being returned for the plaintiff, the defendant moved for a new trial, upon the judge\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-8\"><em>Bigelow, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFd\">argued that <em>Wellington </em>ought to have been admitted, since the plaintiff, by bringing his action against <em>Coolidge </em>alone, had chosen to consider the note a several one, and thus to put <em>Wellington </em>wholly out of the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-9\"><em>Dana, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyA\">cited the case of <em>Churchill </em>vs. <em>Suter. </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b175-10\"> <em>4 Mass.
