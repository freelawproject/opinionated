The defend ant accordingly entered the action; and, after a continuance, the plaintiff, having obtained leave to amend his declaration, offered a new count, which contained a more particular description of the close in which the trespass was originally alleged to have been committed, but sets forth a supposed different trespass, <em>viz. </em>the erecting of twenty rods of stone wall thereon, but on the same day alleged in the first declaration. This amendment, being objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, was not admitted by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">The action being brought by appeal to this Court, the parties agreed, that if the Court here were of opinion that the said amendment was inadmissible, the plaintiff should become nonsuit; otherwise the action should stand for trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-7\"><em>Hopkins, </em>of counsel for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apns\">insisted that the amendment was properly rejected in the court below, because that court had jurisdiction of the action only in virtue of the recognizance entered into before the justice of the peace, upon the defendant\u2019s plea of soil and freehold in the close. The amendment proposed substitutes another action, not within the scope and effect of the recognizance. * Had the parties gone to trial on [ * 441 ] the former declaration, the plaintiff never could have recovered. He ought not now to avoid the defence, by alleging an injury totally distinct from that, to which the defendant had been before called on to answer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-8\"><em>Dana </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b375-11\"> 1783, <em>e. </em>42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b375-9\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"An-\">This being the same close, the defence will not be varied by the amendment offered.
