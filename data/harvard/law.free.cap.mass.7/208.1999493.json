Hubbard </em>was arrested by the sheriff of <em>Suffolk. </em>The execution in the original action was directed to the sheriffs of <em>Suffolk </em>and <em>Hancock, </em>and to the coroners of <em>Suffolk, </em>there being at that time no sheriff in the county of <em>Suffolk. Benjamin Homans, </em>a coroner of <em>Suffolk, </em>returned it with <em>non est inventus.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">The defendant demurred to the <em>scire facias, </em>and the plaintiff joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-10\"><em>Dana, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAC\">objected that the execution was not put into the hands of the sheriff of' <em>Hancock, </em>in which county <em>Hubbard </em>has his home.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>Fay </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b183-4\">But it was answered by <em>the Court, </em>that it had been long a settled practice to deliver the execution to the same officer who took the bail.
