The second section of that statute precludes a defendant, in an action of trespass brought before a justice, to offer any evidence that may bring <em>the title </em>of real estate in question. And, by the seventh section, a defendant, in all civil actions triable before a justice of the peace, except such actions of trespass, wherein he means to avail himself, by pleading <em>the title </em>of himself, or any other person, <em>&amp;c., </em>shall be entitled to all evidence under the general issue, which by law he might avail himself of under any special plea in excuse or justification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-8\">In this case, the evidence offered by the defendants, and refused by the Court, was not such as might bring the <em>title </em>of the estate in question. The evidence was only of a <em>right </em>or easement in the land, perfectly consistent with the plaintiff\u2019s title to it. Such evidence they were entitled to produce under the general issue, by the seventh section, above cited. Twenty years\u2019 use of an easement is a good bar to trespass. Here the defendant offered evidence of the use of the way for twenty years before the action was brought.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-9\"><em>King, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axa\">cited and relied on the case of <em>Spear </em>vs. <em>Bicknell, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> as decisive of the question before the Court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\"> <em>Mass. Rep. </em>125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b331-10\"><em>Per </em>Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AFM\">The defendants, in the trial of the original action, offered, in excuse of the trespass which had been proved, evi dence of the existence, and ol the occupation by themselves and others, of a private way in the <em>locus in * quo, </em>[ * 387 ] for twenty years before the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">It is true, that twenty years\u2019 occupation of a way or other easemen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>is a sufficient bar to an action of trespass. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But the twenty years are to be reckoned from the date of the supposed trespass, and not from the commencement of the action brought for it. So that, if the evidence had been admissible in the case, it would not have been a sufficient bar to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">But, whether the evidence offered would have been a good defence or not, we are all of opinion, that the defendants could not avail themselves of it, under the general issue, in this case. In <em>Spear </em>vs. <em>Bickwell, </em>we held an easement in the land of another to be within the provisions of the statute of 1783, c. 42, although in common parlance it be not called real estate. We still think the opinion there given to be the true construction of the statute; and it follows from it, that the defendants, in the case brought before us by this writ of error, had no right to give evidence of such an easement, unless specially pleaded. If it were otherwise, a defendant in trespass would always have it in his power, by pleading the general issue before a justice, to oust this Court of its appellate and final jurisdiction, in cases wherein it was clearly the intention of the legislature that such jurisdiction should remain to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Let the judgment be affirmed, with costs for the defendant in error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"><em> </em>[It is presumptive evidence of a grant of the right of way, but the possession itself cannot be pleaded in bar. 2 <em>Stark.
