In February, 1802, <em>Davenport </em>died, and the plaintiff was duly appointed his administrator. In two or three years after <em>Davenport's </em>death, the plaintiff and <em>Rawson </em>ad justed all the concerns of the copartnership, except a demand against the <em>British </em>government, and the demand against the <em>French </em>govern ment, for the proceeds of the cargo above mentioned ; and it was agreed between them, that whatever should be recovered on account of these claims, should be equally divided between the plaintiff and <em>Rawson. </em>The company of <em>Rawson &amp;f Davenport </em>was solvent until the death of <em>Davenport, </em>and <em>Rawson </em>continued solvent until August, 1805, when he absconded, being indebted to <em>Davis </em>more than the amount of the proceeds of half of the cargo as finally recovered. In 1806, under the <em>Louisiana </em>treaty, <em>Davis </em>received from the <em>United States, </em>on account and for the proceeds of the cargo taken by the <em>French, </em>as before mentioned, 3095 dollars 93 cents, the bills therefor being in the name of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Rawson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">* The verdict was taken for one fourth part of that [ * 258 J sum, being one half of the proceeds of the part of the cargo belonging to <em>Rawson &amp;/\u25a0 Davenport; </em>the action being brought upon the ground, that, by the death of <em>Davenport, </em>and other circumstances in the case, there was such a severance of the property as entitl\u00e9d the plaintiff to recover <em>Davenport\u2019s </em>due proportion. There was no evidence of an assent on the part of the defendant to this severance, nor was there any formal notice of it to him, although it appeared, that about the time of the commencement of this suit, or since, he had been informed of the adjustment, which had taken place between the administrator and <em>Rawson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">If, upon these facts, the Court should be of opinion that this action could be maintained, it was agreed that judgment be rendered on the verdict; otherwise the plaintiff to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-7\"><em>Parker, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACyH\">argued that he was entitled to his action, on the ground that this money had come to the defendant\u2019s hands long after the dissolution of the copartnership by the death of <em>Davenport, </em>and after the final adjustment of all the partnership accounts, while the parties were solvent. A surviving partner, bjthe law merchant, has no interest in the debts due to the copartnership, but to collect and pay them over as due. But this debt was never in fact due to the copartnership. The action is brought on the promise of the defendant, which the law implies, from his receipt of money belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The circumstance of the bills being drawn in favor of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Rawson, </em>makes no difference in the case, nor is it easy to discern why they were so drawn. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-5\"><em>Jackson, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax2\">insisted that no person but <em>Rawson, </em>could legally demand this money of the defendant. Its having been received after the dissolution of the copartnership, and the adjustment of their accounts, makes no difference in the rights or duties of the parties. The claim was always in <em>Rawson </em>[ <em>* </em>259 J after <em>Davenport\u2019s </em>death, and * the remedy in every case of a joint debt survives. The case cannot be distinguished from that of a bond due at the dissolution of the copartnership, and an agreement that when the money should be received, it should be divided between the partners. In that case, if one of the partners died, it would hardly be suggested that an action would tie for his administrator to recover a moiety of the sum due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">This principle was recognized by the Court in the case of <em>Austin </em>vs. <em>Walsh; </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> although the defendant there, having agreed to a severance of the interest of the joint creditors, was held responsible to one of them separately.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\"> <em>Com.
