But he contended more seriously on the other point, that <em>Ichabod Elis, </em>to whom the assessment and warrant were committed, was not authorized by law to collect the taxes for the year 1808. For this he relied on the general statute of 1785, <em>c. </em>70, respecting the power and duty of collectors. By the 16th section of that act, any parish is empowered to choose, annually in the month of March, one or more <em>collectors of all such rates or assessments as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>shall be granted or agreed upon by such parish; </em>the plain meaning of which provision, he insisted, was, that a collector had authority to collect such taxes only as might be granted or agreed upon after he was in office ; whereas the case here finds these taxes, for which the plaintiff was imprisoned, were granted and agreed upon during the year preceding that for which the collector was appointed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>J. Richardson </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b85-6\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">Two grounds have been taken in support of this action. The first relates to the authority of the assessors, one of whom lived upon and owned a farm in the adjoining town of <em>Wal pole, </em>which farm was owned and occupied in February, 1794, by one <em>Enoch Ellis, </em>who was, by the private statute of 17'83, c. 27, with several other persons named in the act, together with their polls and estates, set off from <em>Walpole </em>and annexed to the third parish in <em>Dedham, </em>to which parish the act declares they shall <em>forever </em>thereafter be considered as belonging, there to do duty and enjoy parish privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The effect of this act was permanently to alter the boundaries of\" the parish, so far as to include therein the lands then owned by the persons named in the act, and to make every person afterwards living upon those lands, or upon any part of them, members of the parish in <em>Dedham, </em>although as to municipal duties and rights they continued to be inhabitants of <em>Walpole.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">It follows, then, that <em>Richards, </em>one of the assessors, who owned and lived upon the farm which, at the date of the act *of 1784, belonged to <em>Enoch </em>Ellis, was eligible as an [ * 92 ] assessor of the parish, and, when chosen and sworn, was legally authorized to execute the duties of that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The second point applies to the authority of the collector; and a provision of the statute of 1785, <em>c. </em>70, for the choice and appointment of collectors, and for ascertaining their power and duty, has been cited in support of this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">But the meaning of the provision is misconceived. When the statute gives authority to collectors to collect all such assessments as <em>shall be </em>granted or agreed upon, it intends all such assessments as should be granted or agreed upon after the passing of the law; and not after the appointment of the collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Neither of the points made for the plaintiff being in our opinion sufficient to support his action, the defendants are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
