The defendant had, by a memorandum in writing not under seal, agreed with <em>Rounds, </em>that if the latter would pay the defendant five hundred and twenty-two dollars ninety-seven cents, at two instalments [ <em>* </em>362 ] * the last of which was within three years from the date of the conveyance, he would convey to <em>Rounds </em>all the right to the land which he, the defendant, had under <em>Rounds\u2019s </em>deed to him; the plaintiff then offered to prove that the contract, although disguised as a purchase of, and a contract to reconvey land, was, in truth, a mere loan of money upon a usurious agreement. He also stated that, except the said conveyance of land to the defendant, he had no evidence to prove that the defendant had received any thing whatever of <em>Rounds, </em>upon or towards the said loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">Whereupon the judge directed a nonsuit, with liberty to the plaintiff to move to have the same set aside, and a new trial granted, if the said direction should, by the Court, be determined to be wrong.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">At the last May term, in this county, <em>Holmes, </em>of counsel for the plaintiff, moved the Court to set aside the nonsuit; and he urged that this was an indirect but gross attempt to evade the wholesome provisions of the law against excessive usury. Here was a loan of money, and a conveyance of land made as a pledge to secure the repayment, with usurious interest. Pursuant to the contract, the pledge has become forfeited, and the defendant has an absolute title to the land. If he is not answerable in this action, the law seems to have furnished no method in which oppression of this kind can be reached. The forfeiture of the land is equivalent to the payment of the money by <em>Rounds. </em>Although originally intended only as a security for the payment of the money and the usurious interest agreed upon, yet, being forfeited, and the whole power of redeeming it gone from <em>Rounds, </em>it has become payment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-7\"><em>King, </em>for the defendant, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFW\">that no money having been paid, there was no fulfilment of an usurious contract, if such a one had been made. It is essential to the nature of a loan, that the thing borrowed is at all events to be restored; <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and it is settled, that evidence of usury shall not be given, in a prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>for the penalty, unless the money has been actually and wholly paid. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">* If the plaintiff recovers in this action, the defendant [ * 363 ] is exposed not only to lose the money loaned by him, but also to forfeit the land, and the amount of the loan by way of penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-6\">But the defendant has a right to say that this was an actual sale; and because <em>Rounds </em>might think the land worth more than the consideration paid, the defendant gave him the right of preemption. This right he should have pursued; and when he had paid the money, if the agreement was corrupt and usurious, he would not then have been without his remedy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-7\"><em>Holmes, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFHP\">By the very act of selling the land, <em>Rounds </em>was disabled from raising the money to redeem it. <em>Non constat </em>that the defendant will ever lose the land; and as to the money, there is no pretence that he has a claim to recover it in addition to the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-8\">If a simple practice of this kind is sufficient to avoid the forfeiture for usury, the provision of law inflicting the forfeiture may as well he repealed, for it will in every case be evaded.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> 3 <em>Wils. </em>395, <em>Murray </em>vs. <em>Harding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b313-14\"> 1 <em>Hawk. P. C. c. </em>82, \u00a7 27</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The cause stood over to this term for advisement, and now</p>\n<author id=\"b313-10\">Parsons, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Afj\">delivered the opinion of the Court, after stating the action and the substance of the</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The propriety of the judge\u2019s direction at the trial is the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">The agreement may be usurious, and the conveyance made by <em>Rounds </em>to the defendant, as a part of such agreement, may be void; but the penalty is not incurred unless the lender, in fact, under the agreement, corruptly receive above the sum of six pounds for giving day of payment for one hundred pounds for a year, or after that rate; in which case he shall forfeit the full value of the money or thing loaned. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel has accordingly argued that three hundred and fifty dollars were loaned, and * that the conveyance of the land, by <em>Rounds, </em>to the [ * 364 ] defendant, was a receipt by him of usurious interest for giving day of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">But we are satisfied that this argument ought not to prevail, because it is founded on an erroneous idea of the agreement. If the conveyance of the land was a payment of interest, in consideration of giving day of payment of the principal sum of three hundred and fifty dollars, then, under this agreement, <em>Rounds, </em>after the agreement, remained indebted to the defendant in that sum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>But the manifest intent of the parties was, that, on the defendant\u2019s receiving this conveyance from <em>Rounds, </em>the latter was discharged from any demands the defendant had against him on account of this loan. <em>Rounds </em>might repurchase the land of the defendant on an usurious payment of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We are therefore satisfied, on the plaintiff\u2019s own statement, that the land was received by the defendant, not as a payment of usuri pus interest, but as a security \"for the repayment of the three hundred and fifty dollars, with usurious interest. And as a repayment of this sum, or of any interest thereon, has never been made the penalty, to recover which this action was sued, has not been incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As it is very clear that <em>Rounds, </em>on proving the case stated by the plaintiff, may avoid his conveyance of this land, the conclusion is equally clear, that this conveyance must be considered as a security for the repayment of the money borrowed, with the illegal interest, and not as an actual payment of that interest, or any part thereof. A nonsuit of the plaintiff was, therefore, in our opinion, very properly directed by the judge, and the defendant may have judgment upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\n<em>Cost for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
