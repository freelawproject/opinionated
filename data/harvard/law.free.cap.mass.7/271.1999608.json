And he cited <em>Toiler\u2019s law of executions, </em>24, to show that the title of the executor relates back to the death of the testator, and therefore it was not essential that in * this case the trustee [ * 272 j was summoned before probate of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">For the principal point he relied on the case referred to by <em>Sewall, </em>J., in delivering his opinion in the case of <em>Wentworth </em>vs. <em>Whittemore; </em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where \u201can executor, who was summoned as the trustee of a legatee, to whom a legacy was given, payable at the end of one year from the decease of the testator; although the executor, in his answer to the usual interrogatory, stated that he was not certain there would be any thing in his hands for the payment of legacies, after he should have paid the debts of the testator ; yet the action was sustained, and the executor adjudged to be a trustee within the statute.\u201d This was a much stronger case than that at bar, for here there is no question as to assets.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>J. T. Austin, </em>for the trustee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMN\">argued that an executor can in no case be held as the trustee of a legatee in virtue of a pecuniary legacy. Such a legacy is neither goods, effects, or credits belonging to the legatee. Nor can it be said of such a legacy that the legatee has intrusted or deposited the legacy with the executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-8\">The eleventh section of the statute of 1794, c. 65, giving this process, provides that if the person summoned as trustee die pending the proceedings, his executor or administrator shall be liable, &amp;c. But the executor or administrator of an executor is a stranger to the will of the first testator, and can never, as such, represent the first executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-9\">The whole reason of the case of <em>Wilder </em>vs. <em>Bailey </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> applies as well to the case of an executor, as of a sheriff summoned as trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-10\">Again; it depends on many contingencies, whether this legacy will ever be payable. At the time the process was commenced, it was uncertain whether Mr. <em>Allen </em>would accept the trust; or if he accepted, the judge of probate might not see fit to give him the execution of the will; or he might not offer sufficient sureties ; or the will might* not have been proved ; a posterior [ * 273 ] will might have been produced; or the testator might be proved incapable of making a testament; and if the will was proved, and the executor duly appointed, still the estate might not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>exceed the debts; or a posthumous child might be born. It has-been well settled, that a contingent demand cannot be the subject of this process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-5\">Further, executors are not compellable to pay legacies, without receiving a bond from the legatee to refund in certain cases; but if they may be held as trustees to the legatee, then they must pay the legacies without such security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-6\">The case cited from 1 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>was while contingent demands and moneys in the hands of sheriffs were held subject to this process, and it was also after probate of the will.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-7\"><em>Sullivan, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajg\">The case of moneys in the hands of sheriffs, and other public officers, rests on a very different principle. The law places the money in their hands, and this process, if binding, would prevent the execution of their duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-8\">It appears here, from the answer of the trustee, that he has assets, and that he holds himself bound to pay this legacy; so the demand cannot be considered as contingent.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b237-11\"> 1 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>472.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b237-13\"> 3 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>289</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The opinion of the Court <em>(absente Parsons, </em>C. J.) was delivered, as follows, by</p>\n<author id=\"b238-10\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKs\">The question in this case is, whether an executor, before probate of the will, can be summoned, and afterwards charged as the trustee of one to whom a pecuniary legacy is given by his testator, he having sufficient assets to pay all debts and legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Formerly, executors, under the circumstances of Mr. <em>Allen, </em>as disclosed by his answers, were adjudged trustees; and so also were officers, who had in their hands money collected on executions. This, however, was done under the provincial statute on this subject ; between which and the act now in force there is considerable difference. By the statute now in force, \u201cgoods, effects, and credits, intrusted and deposited\u201d in the hands of a stranger, are [ * 274 ] attachable. * Now, pecuniary legacies, in the hands of an executor, are not goods or effects; and it is equally clear that in no proper sense can they be denominated credits. Without the relation of a creditor and a debtor, there can be no such thing as a credit; but a legatee can in no proper sense be said to be the creditor of a testator; nor a testator, merely as such, the debtor of a legatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">This question, in relation to an officer having money in his hands, collected on an execution, was fully considered in the case of <em>Wilder </em>vs. <em>Bailey, </em>mentioned at the bar; and the principles, which governed that case, apply with equal force to the case under consideration. In neither case is there a <em>credit; </em>nor was the subject, attempted to be attached, <em>intrusted </em>or <em>deposited, </em>in the sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of the act, in the hands of a person summoned as trustee. And it may he added, that the judgment provided in this process would be different from judgments in other cases against executors. In this case, to conform to the statute, it must be <em>de bonis propriis, </em>whereas in other cases it is <em>de bonis testatoris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The same principles, which were adopted in the case of <em>Wildet </em>vs. <em>Bailey, </em>have been again recognized this term in the case of <em>Chealy </em>vs. <em>Brewer. </em>On the whole, we are all of opinion that Mr. <em>A lien </em>must be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We have laid no stress on the circumstance in this case, that the service of the summons was before the probate of the will; because we are of opinion, that if the service had been after the probate, Mr. <em>Allen </em>could not have been adjudged a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\n<em>Trustee discharged</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
