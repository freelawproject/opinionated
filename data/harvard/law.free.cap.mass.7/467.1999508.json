The father of the pauper was duly settled in <em>Greene </em>before the birth of the pauper, which was on the 10th of January, 1782. After the pauper had attained the age of 21 years, and before the expenses now demanded were incurred, the father removed with his family, of which the pauper was one, into <em>Monmouth, </em>and there gained a settlement. In January, 1807, the father again removed with his family to <em>Collegetouin </em>plantation, and there lived until and after the 28th of February, 1807, on which day the said plantation was incorporated into a town by the name of <em>Dixmont. </em>It was further proved that said pauper, ever since he was three years old, has been a cripple, and wholly incapable of doing any work, or of gaining his support; but that his mind was not impaired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">It was also in evidence, that the overseers of <em>Greene, </em>about six years ago, and before the father had gained a settlement in <em>Morumouth, </em>at the request of the overseers of <em>Monmouth, </em>removed the pauper to <em>Greene, </em>and have ever since maintained him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-9\">The defendants had leave of Court, although opposed by the plaintiffs, to bring into Court, on the common rule, and lodge with the clerk for the use of the plaintiffs, the sum of 24 dollars, being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the amount of the expenses incurred in the support of the pauper up to the time of the notice given as aforesaid, and for two months next following; and also another sum of 129 dollars, being the plaintiff\u2019s costs of suit to that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">[#409] *A verdict was found for the plaintiffs for the sum demanded by them, subject to the opinion of the Court on the foregoing facts ; it being agreed, that if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs are by law entitled to maintain this action, or that the defendants are barred, from contesting the pauper\u2019s settlement by reason of the notice aforesaid, and the omission to answer or object to the same, the verdict should stand, and judgment be entered thereon, deducting the 24 dollars paid into Court by the defendants. But if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs are not by law entitled to maintain their action, the verdict should be set aside, and a nonsuit entered. In either case the plaintiffs were to receive the sums paid into Court by the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-6\">Mellen, of counsel for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_S\">was very clear that the pauper had no legal settlement in <em>Monmouth. </em>When his father acquired his settlement there, this son was of full age, and so could gain no derivative settlement from his father. The plaintiffs rely on the estoppel furnished by the statute upon the lapse of two months from the notice without removal or objections. But in the case of <em>Leicester </em>vs. Rehoboth, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> where the money had been paid, the defendants were not estopped to deny the settlement in an action for posterior expenses. The defendants, having here paid the money before verdict, with all costs, are equitably entitled to the benefit of that decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-7\">Upon a suggestion from the Court, that if the position taken by <em>Mellen </em>were correct, yet the defendants were not within it; for the verdict was still against them, notwithstanding the money brought into Court by them: <em>Mellen </em>then moved that the verdict might be set aside, in order that the defendants might have opportunity to bring in the whole sum.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\"> 4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b400-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam..</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AoXg\">We cannot grant the motion. We must govern ourselves by principles settled. The plaintiffs have a right to the benefit of the estoppel in this last stage of the cause. [ * 470 ] Perhaps, if the defendants had, during the trial, * brought into Court the whole sum due from them, with the costs, and thus complete justice had been done, we might then have thought them, on equitable considerations, within the principle of the decision in the case of <em>Leicester </em>vs. <em>Rehoboth, </em>and might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ordered a stay of proceedings; or, if the plaintiffs had objected to that course, the cause might have been again sent to the jury, who would have found a verdict for the defendants; so that no judgment would have been entered to bar them upon the question of settlement, as to any further expenses. But we cannot now set aside the verdict, for the purpose of giving them an opportunity of paying into Court what that verdict has proved to be due from them, without consent, the plaintiffs being entitled to the benefit of the agreement made in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Let the verdict be amended by deducting the <em>24 </em>dollars paid, and let judgment be then entered upon it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
