Yet the defendants, not regarding their said promise, but contriving to defraud the plaintiffs in this behalf, subtilely deceived them in this, that the said schooner at the time aforesaid was not of the length, depth, and breadth, nor of'the burden aforesaid; but was of such *a length, depth, and breadth, and of the [ * 285 ] burden only of sixty-one tons; and so the defendants, by means of their said false affirmation and promise, had greatly injured and defrauded the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-9\">The defendants pleaded that they never promised, &amp;c.; on which an issue was joined, and tried before <em>Parker, </em>J., at the last November term in this county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-10\">At the trial, the plaintiffs produced a bill of sale of said schooner from the defendants, not under seal, which stated her to be of the largest admeasurement mentioned in the declaration, with a warranty of the property, and also a deposition of one <em>Bishop, </em>proving that the vendors, by their agent at the time of the bargain and sale, represented and promised the plaintiffs that the vessel was in fact of such dimensions and burden; also the depositions of sundry persons, which proved that she was of less dimensions and burden than she was represented to be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The judge instructed the jury that the said evidence was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to their verdict for damages, and did not maintain the issue on the part of the plaintiffs, observing that there was no evidence that the defendants knew of the difference in the admeasurement, or that their affirmation to the plaintiffs respecting the same was untrue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiffs filed their exceptions to the directions of the judge, and on that ground moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-6\">And now <em>Parker, </em>in support of his motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYpM\">cited the case of <em>Suart </em>vs. <em>Wilkins, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> to show that this was the proper form of declaring; and he relied on the evidence of <em>Bishop, </em>to prove an express warranty, and the other evidence stated, to show the breach of the warranty. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b248-10\"> <em>Doug. </em>18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"A_E\"> 1 <em>Salk. </em>3, 211. \u2014 2 <em>Comyns on Contract, </em>274.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b248-7\"><em>Sewall, </em>J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUS\">likened this to the case of <em>Powell </em>vs. <em>Clark.
