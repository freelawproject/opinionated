Esq., to whom administration of his estate had been committed, moved at that term to be admitted to prosecute the action. He was accordingly admitted, <em>de bene esse, </em>by <em>Parker, </em>J., who satin the trials of that term. A verdict was found for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court on the right of the administrator to prosecute the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">* The cause stood over to this term ; and now, <em>Aylwin, </em>[ * 318 ] of counsel for the plaintiff, contended that this action survived to the administrator, by the rules which had hitherto been applied in the exposition of the statute of 4 <em>Edio. </em>3, <em>c. </em>7, <em>de bonis asportatis. </em>It has been repeatedly decided, that all wrongs done to <em>the estate </em>of the testator, come within the equity of this statute, and that for them an executor may bring his action. Thus an action of debt lies by an executor against a jailer for an escape on execution in the testator\u2019s lifetime; <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> though it has been doubted whether it lay foi; an escape of mesne process. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> It has also been adjudged, that an executor might bring a writ of <em>Ravishment of ward, Ejectione firma, </em>and <em>(fiare impedit. </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-9\">If these cases are to be classed among those which are considered as wrongs to <em>the estate </em>of the testator or intestate, there can be no doubt that the case at bar falls within the same class ; as it appears that the original judgment on which the execution issued, was for a debt due to the intestat\u00e9, which has been lost by the non-feasance of the deputy of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-10\">The statute <em>de bonis asportatis </em>has always received a liberal construction in favor of executors, according to Lord Chief Justice <em>Holt, </em>m the case of <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Grey, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> which case virtually decides that this action survives.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-11\">&amp; <em>K. Williams </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyS\">The case of <em>Williams </em>vs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Grey </em>decides only that, where goods were taken by virtue of a <em>fieri facias </em>to the amount of \u00a3100, and the officer returned that he had levied goods but to half that value, an action survived to the executor for this false return. And this case was evidently within the equity of the statute <em>de bonis asportatis. </em>For the goods, when taken by the officer, became <em>quasi </em>the property of the creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">It is not contended, that debt or case may not be sustained by an executor for an escape committed in the lifetime of the creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">For the body of a debtor, while in execution, is in the [ * 319 ] nature of a pledge for the payment of * the debt. To deprive the creditor of this pledge, by suffering an escape, is doing an injury to his estate, which an equitable construction of the statute may well remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-7\">In the case at bar, neither the property of the debtor nor his body were taken on the execution ; nor is there any allegation in the declaration, that either could have been taken, or that the officer assumed, and took upon himself to serve the execution. No authorities have been produced to the Court, and it may be hence inferred that none can be found, where an action for a mere <em>nonfeasance </em>has been held to survive to the executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-8\">The administrator in this case is not without his remedy. The judgment against the original debtor is still in full force, and an action thereon will restore the plaintiff to his right, and furnish him with the most honest remedy.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\"> <em>Platt\u2019s case, Plowd. </em>34. \u2014 <em>Fitz. </em>N. <em>B. </em>121, <em>a.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b275-13\"> <em>Latch. </em>167, <em>Lemason </em>vs <em>Dixon </em>\u20141 <em>Roll.
