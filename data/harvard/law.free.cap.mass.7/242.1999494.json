Upon the conviction of the defendant, I thought him entitled to have this question examined, as the result might be some mitigation in his punishment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-9\">The <em>chief justice, </em>and <em>Justice Parker</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWzu\">have advised with me upon the question, and the sentence now to be pronounced is in consequence of our concurrence in the opinion, that the crime of robbery is technically described in this indictment, and that the prisoner at the bar is legally convicted of that offence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-10\">By a recent statute of this commonwealth, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> the punishment of robbery has been mitigated, and for the pains of death, confinement to hard labor for life has been substituted ; and the offender liable to this punishment is thus described: \u2014 \u201c Any person who shall by force and violence, * or other assault, and [ * 243 ] putting in fear, feloniously steal, rob, and take from the person of another, any money or goods,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-11\">This clause of the statute admits, perhaps, of some uncertainty in the construction. \u201c <em>Putting in fear </em>\u201d may be so connected with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the preceding words, as to become an essential circumstance in describing the offence of robbery; as well when the assault is accompanied with actual force and violence, as when it is by a constructive force, as by menaces; and if putting in fear was essential in an indictment at the common law, the words of the statute are not sufficiently explicit to establish a construction, changing the definition of the crime or the form of the indictment in this respect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">This point has been carefully examined. Sergeant <em>Hawkins, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> in defining the crime of robbery, seems to make the phtting in fear the circumstance which distinguishes the crime of robbery from any other larceny from the person ; and for this he cites Lord <em>Coke </em>and Lord <em>Hale, </em>who give the same definition. But in commenting upon the several parts of their definition, it is expressed by all of them, that without putting in fear, <em>or violence, </em>it is not robbery ; and that upon proof of violence the law implies fear, <em>in odium, spoliatoris. </em>Sergeant <em>Hawkins </em>also states, that no robbery is within the statute, by which the offence is made punishable with death without benefit of clergy, but such as is alleged in the indictment to have been committed in or near the highway, and <em>to have put the person robbed in fear; </em>and for this last <em>dictum </em>he cites <em>Dyer\u2019s </em>reports (page 224.) The citation refers to a short note, which is to this effect: \u2014\u201c that one was indicted, for that, with force and arms, at, &amp;c., in the highway there, forty shillings in money he feloniously took from the person of <em>J. S. </em>And he had his clergy; for it is not robbery, unless the person be put in fear, as by assault and violence.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiD\">[ * 244 ] * <em>Blackstone, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> defines robbery \u201c the felonious and forcible taking from the person of another, of goods or money to any value, by violence, <em>or putting him, in fear. </em>And he observes that previous violence, <em>or putting in fear, </em>is the criterion that distinguishes robbery from other larcenies; and that it is not indeed necessary, though usual, to lay in the indictment that the robbery was committed by putting in fear ; it is sufficient, if laid to be done by violence.\u201d This was the opinion of Justice <em>Foster </em>in delivering the opinion of the judges in the case of <em>M\u2019Daniel &amp; Al.; </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> and was also the opinion of the twelve judges, as it is explicitly stated in <em>Donnally\u2019s </em>case, <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> by Justice <em>Wittes, </em>in delivering their opinion, according to the report of that case in <em>Leach. </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> And Baron <em>Eyre, </em>in his argument of the same case, as it is reported in <em>East, </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> says that in the old precedents of indictments for robbery, the putting in fear is not alleged.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b211-12\"> <em>Stat. </em>1804, <em>c. </em>142, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> 1 <em>Hawk.
