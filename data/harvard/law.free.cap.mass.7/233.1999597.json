This objection was overruled by the judge, and he directed the jury to find for the plaintiff; and their verdict was so taken-, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the report of the judge of the afore-recited facts; it being agreed at the trial that the plaintiff might file any new counts upon the same facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">The cause was briefly argued at the last November term in this county, by <em>Prescott </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Story </em>for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-8\">\n<em>Story</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY3l\">contended that this was a promise to pay the debt of another, within the statute of frauds, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and our statute being a copy of the <em>English, </em>statute as to this point, <em>English </em>authorities upon their statute are applicable here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-9\">In the case of <em>Wain &amp; Al. </em>vs. Warlters, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> it was held that no person could by the statute of frauds be charged upon any promise to pay the debt of another, unless the <em>agreement </em>on which the action is brought, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing; by which word <em>agreement </em>must be understood the <em>consideration </em>for the promise as well as the promise itself; and therefore, where one promised in writing to pay the debt of a third person, without stating on what consideration, it was holden that <em>parole </em>evidence of the consideration was inadmissible, &amp;c. This doctrine was recognized in the case of <em>Egerton </em>vs. <em>Matthews &amp; Al.; </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> and both the cases are cited and their principles adopted in the case of <em>Sears </em>vs. <em>Brink </em>and <em>Brink, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> in the Supreme Court of <em>New York. </em>And indeed \\f this statute does not support the principle contended for, its pro visions are nearly vacated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>* <em>Prescott, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP2\">urged that this was a very [ * 235 ] common mode of contracting, and if judgment cannot be had upon this undertaking of the defendant, the statute, instead of protecting persons against fraud, will itself be an engine of fraud in vacating <em>bon\u00e2 fide </em>engagements. Here the forbearance is a valid consideration, and, under the agreement at the trial, it is as if the consideration and the promise had been written over the defendant\u2019s name. <em>Strout </em>was the defendant\u2019s agent as to this point, and if he did not execute his authority duly, it is chargeable to his principal, who shall not now avail himself of it to avoid his honest engagement. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">The action stood continued for advisement to this term.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\"> 1788, <em>c. </em>16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AY3\"> 5 <em>East\u2019s Rep. </em>10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"ACn\"> 6 <em>East\u2019s Rep. </em>307.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"ARL\"> 3 <em>Johns.

But we are of opinion that the defendant\u2019s signature upon the back of the note, with the authority given by him to the witness to write over the signature a sufficient guaranty, and such guaranty being accordingly written by the witness pursuant to the authority, may be considered as a memorandum signed by the party, within the intent of the statute, as fully as if it had been written in the defendant\u2019s presence immediately after the signature. And parole evidence was as well admissible to prove this authority, as it is in any case upon a promise in writing, to prove the hand-writing of the party making the promise ; a parole authority in this case being in law sufficient, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\"><em> </em>[The report of the evidence discloses no such authority, but, on the contrary, a refusal of the party to do more than sign his name.
