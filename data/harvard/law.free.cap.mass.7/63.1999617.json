Here, that had not been done, and the plaintiff\u2019s demand, for which this action was instituted, remains in the same state as before the defendant was summoned as trustee. The plaintiff is still liable to <em>Henry </em>for his whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>debt, notwithstanding the proceedings which have been had against the defendant, as the trustee of the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\">* <em>Smith, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ats\">argued that his client, having [ * 65 ] been charged in execution for the debt which the mortgage now sued was made to secure, considered himself discharged, as against the plaintiff, from both the note and the mortgage. Should the land demanded be unequal in value to the note, <em>Cary </em>may yet bring his action on the latter, and the defendant be liable to a second commitment in execution for the same cause of action. For if the plaintiff can now recover on the mortgage, no reason can be given why he shall not recover on the note also, if the mortgage is an insufficient security. If <em>Henry\u2019s </em>release has any effect, it should seem to be a discharge, as well against <em>Cary </em>as against <em>Henry. </em>But it is apprehended that the release, being since the commencement of the present action, cannot alter the rights of the parties as they then existed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">The plaintiff is entitled to his judgment. There is no defence at law; and since the release was given, thereis none in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
