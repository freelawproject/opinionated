Afterwards, on or about the 8th of May, 1804, upon the second bill\u2019s coming to maturity, * the said <em>Williams </em>re- [ * 287 ] ceived from <em>Bolton, </em>the drawee, the amount of the first bill, 316\u00a3, 2s. <em>8d., </em>in part payment of the second, passing the said sums to the defendant\u2019s credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-9\">The protests for non-acceptance having been remitted to the defendant, he sent <em>Keefe </em>to <em>St. Lucia, </em>to demand payment of the bills of the plaintiffs, who paid the same on the 25th of July, 1804, receiving <em>Keefe\u2019s </em>full discharge. Part of the said payment was made in the promissory note of one <em>John Viges, </em>for 386\u00a3, 2s. <em>5d., St. Lucia </em>currency, not endorsed by the plaintiffs, and payable in six months from the date. <em>Keefe </em>left the said note in the hands of an agent for collection ; but it appeared that, although payment had been demanded, a part only of the sum due by it had been paid, and that <em>Viges </em>had become insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-10\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, for the sum received by <em>Williams, </em>with interest thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-11\">The judge reports, that the defendant resisted payment on the ground that <em>Viges\u2019s </em>note had not been paid,, notwithstanding due diligence had been used to recover it; and that if the jury ought to have been instructed, that the said note, so taken by <em>Keefe, </em>should be deducted from the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant, a new trial was to be granted ; otherwise judgment was to be rendered on the verdict, with additional interest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Jackson, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY9\">contended that if the plaintiffs, upon the facts in this case, had a right to recover any thing of the defendant, they could not recover in this form of action. If the plaintiffs have any claim on the defendant, it must arise out of the transactions in <em>St. Lucia, </em>which were posterior to the receipt of the money by Mr. <em>Williams, </em>in <em>England. The </em>payment by mistake took place at <em>St. Lucia; </em>and as far as that was made in the promissory note of <em>Viges, </em>it was not money received by the defendant. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">But, independent of the objection to the form of action where an existing debt is discharged by an article which proves of [ * 288 ] no value, the creditor may consider it as a nullity, *and the debt revives, or rather has never been extinguished. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-6\"><em>The Solicitor-General, </em>for the plaintiffs, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhA\">1. That the documents in the case showed that <em>Viges\u2019s </em>note was accepted by the defendant\u2019s agent as payment at the time he received it. <em>Keefe </em>gave his receipt as for so much cash, and the promisor being then solvent, it probably was estimated to be equal to cash. By our law, a negotiable security, given in consideration of a simple contract debt, extinguishes the debt; <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> although this may not be law in <em>England </em>or in <em>New York, </em>whence the defendant has produced all his authorities. But, in the case of <em>Richardson </em>vs. <em>Rickman, </em>cited in the case of <em>Kearslake </em>vs. <em>Morgan, </em>Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said that a negotiable bill accepted by the party was payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">2. The defendant had elected to consider this note as payment He had treated it as his own, by giving time to <em>Viges, </em>and by receiving a part of the amount a long time after it was due. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Tatlock </em>vs. <em>Harris, </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> <em>Butter, </em>J., said, \u201c Suppose <em>A </em>owes <em>B </em>100\u00a3, and <em>B </em>owes <em>C </em>100\u00a3, and the three meet, and it is agreed between them that <em>A </em>shall pay <em>C </em>100\u00a3 ; <em>B.\u2019s </em>debt is extinguished ; \u201d which, is precisely the case before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">3. The note has become payment by the defendant\u2019s neglect to enforce the payment of it. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-9\"><em>Dexter, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaQ\">insisted, 1. That the note did not extinguish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>defendant\u2019s demand upon the plaintiff. 2. That the defendant, never having obtained payment of the money due on the note, cannot be answerable to the plaintiffs therefor. 3. If the defendant is so answerable, yet the money cannot be recovered in this form of action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> <em>Esp.

J.) was afterwards delivered in substance, as follows, by</p>\n<author id=\"b251-6\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atj\">The first point for our consideration ir. this case, is the nature of the action. Where one man has in his hands money, which, according to the rules of equity and good conscience, belongs to and ought to be * paid to another, [ * 280 ] this is the proper form of action for its recovery. If, then, at the commencement of this suit, the defendant held money, which <em>ex cequo et bona </em>he ought not to have retained from the plaintiffs, they are entitled to recover. This must depend on the facts appearing in the documents referred to by the judge in his report of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">It will not be necessary to mention the names of the persons, who acted as the agents at the different times and places, in which the transactions occurred ; since, in contemplation of law, their actions are the actions of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">From the facts, which I shall proceed to state, the plaintiffs in sist that they are entitled to recover a sum of money equal to that which was paid on the bills in <em>England; </em>that amount being, at the time of the commencement of the action, in the hands of the defendant, which belonged to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The plaintiffs at <em>St. Lucia, </em>being indebted to the defendant, drew their bills for the balance upon <em>London, </em>which, being remitted to his agent there, was protested for non-acceptance, and the protests transmitted to the defendant. Afterwards, when the bills became payable, they were paid in part, and received by the defendant. A sum equal to the money so paid is what is claimed by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">After this there were other transactions between these parties. More goods were sold by the defendant to the plaintiffs. When this was done, an account was stated between them, and a balance due to the defendant was struck. In this account, the bills, which had been drawn, were not taken into consideration at all, but treated as mere nullities. Some little time afterwards, it appears by the documents, that the note of <em>Viges </em>was <em>received </em>by the defendant, and payable to his agent, in discharge of the balance previously due to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">As this balance, if paid, was a full discharge of every thing due to the defendant, independently of the money he * received in <em>London, </em>it becomes important to deter- [ * 290 J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>mine whether <em>Viges\u2019s </em>note, under the circumstances, was a <em>)payment </em>of that balance. For if it was, then the moment it was received, the money, which had been paid in <em>London, </em>ought no longer to be retained by the defendant, because it belonged to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Now, we can, none of us, perceive any difference between this case and the common one where a note of a third person is received in discharge of a stated balance of a merchant\u2019s or shopkeeper\u2019s account. If I am indebted to a merchant, and wish to discharge what I owe him, by procuring a man who is indebted to me to give his note for the balance, and it is so agreed by all concerned, and in execution of this agreement, the note of one, who may be supposed my debtor, is received for the balance due from me, made payable to my creditor, and that balance discharged by him, \u2014 no one, I believe, ever supposed, that if he ultimately failed to get the money on his note, he could recur to me <em>on the original contract, </em>and enforce payment, provided there was no unfairness on my part; and none is suggested or proved in the case before us. It is, in principle, like the case of a purchase of a horse, or any other property. A man purchases a horse, and by agreement the promissory note of a third person is received by the seller for the price agreed upon All is conducted honestly between the parties. It was never imagined, I believe, that, upon the failure of the promisor, the seller could resort to the buyer, and recover of him the price of the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">There is no evidence, from any thing proved to have been said, at the time that <em>Viges\u2019s </em>note was received by the defendant, at whose risk it should be ; nor in my opinion is it necessary on the part of the plaintiffs ; because, from receiving the note, under the circumstances, it must be considered as payment, unless the contrary be made to appear as the agreement of the parties. Immediately, then, on the payment of the balance of the defendant\u2019s account [ * 291 ] by other * means than the money which he had received in <em>London, </em>that money belonged to the plaintiffs, and this is the proper form of action to recover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Thus far we are all agreed : but for myself, I have no hesitation in believing, even if it had been proved that <em>Viges\u2019s </em>note was received at the risk of the plaintiffs, that the evidence, which the documents referred to in the report exhibit, would be decisive against the defendant, by proving that, before the commencement of the action, he had made the note his own, and that therefore it must be considered as payment. Those facts are, that it had been permitted, after it became due, to lie for more than three years, without any effort to collect <em>it; </em>and this under an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>relative to the payment of interest, made without the consent or knowledge of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><em>The Court </em>then observed, that on examination it appeared that the verdict had been taken for too much money; but, as this was a mere mistake, not taken notice of by either party at the trial, it could be no ground for setting aside the verdict, if the surplus should be released by the plaintiffs, which was accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
