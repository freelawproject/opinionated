This witness further stated he did not go down there to make any arrest, and further that he heard the appellant clicking the pistol on the gallery. The appellant took the stand and testified that when the witness and himself got down to Mrs. Simpkins\u2019 house he got out on one side of the buggy and the witness on the other, and that he saw the pistol of the witness lying on the seat of the buggy, and the witness having gone on into the house he carried the pistol from the buggy to the house some eighteen or twenty feet and gave it to the witness; that he thought the witness had forgotten the pistol and he carried it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Hnder this state of the facts the appellant requested the court to charge the jury that if the defendant took the pistol from the buggy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>and carried it to the gallery, and only had it in his possession about a minute, and that his purpose was to carry the pistol and hand it to the marshal, and that as soon as he reached the gallery he did deliver it to him, the defendant would not be guilty and that they would acquit. This request was made in several different charges presented to the court by appellant\u2019s counsel and were all refused and bills of exception were reserved. Under this state of the case we are inclined to think that the court erred in not giving the charge as requested. The court had omitted to instruct on this phase of the case in his general charge. This case differs from the case of Schuh v. State, decided at this term. In that case, while the possession was of short duration, yet the conduct of the defendant showed an unlawful carrying, while in this case appellant\u2019s contention is that his possession was momentary and for an innocent purpose and in aid of a person authorized to carry same, and this view of the case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">For the omission to give the charge requested, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
