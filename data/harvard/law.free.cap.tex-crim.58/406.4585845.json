The appellant took the stand and testified that he did let the witness have the whisky, but some time before that the witness came to him and asked him to order some whisky for him and stated that he did not have any money and for the appellant to advance the money for him and order him a pint of whisky. The appellant says that he did this and that when the witness came on the day in question he let him have the whisky and the witness paid him. The proof shows local option was in effect in Camp County.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">The only ground in the motion for new trial is that the judgment is not supported by the evidence. We are not authorized to disturb the verdict of the jury on a controverted issue. The jury believed the testimony of the witness for the State and did not believe appellant\u2019s theory of the matter. We would not feel justified in disturbing the verdict of the jury on the ground of the insufficiency of the testimony and finding no error in the record the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
