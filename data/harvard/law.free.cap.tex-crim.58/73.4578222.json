Following Marshall v. State, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 205.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b97-13\">Appeal from the County Court of Cherokee. Tried below before the Hon.

Among other things, the motion in arrest of judgment attacks the indictment because it fails to allege that Cherokee County was the county of appellant\u2019s residence, and that the indictment is vicious for this reason inasmuch as the law requires that a verification license shall be filed for record in the county of the physician\u2019s residence. This point is well taken. See Marshall v. State, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 205, 119 S. W., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
