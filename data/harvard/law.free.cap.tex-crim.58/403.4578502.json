It may be conceded that the application shows diligence. This was the second application for a continuance. The qualification to the bill of exceptions overruling the motion for continuance, by the judge, states that the application was made orally and that the appellant stated that the witness Flora Pollard heard the conversation mentioned and that other witnesses were present at the time. One of the requisites of an application for continuance is that the facts expected to be proven by the absent witness can not be proved by any other source known to the applicant. How, if this conversation was had in the presence of the other witnesses, Andrew Bell and Van Pollard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>then he was able to prove it by other witnesses and he would not be entitled to a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">On the trial of the case appellant placed several witnesses on the stand, to wit: Bud Biggers, Bob Malone, Nancy Beese and Andrew Bell, all of whom testified that they were present at Van Pollard\u2019s house and that Flora Pollard was present and that they heard prosecuting witness say to Alice Lewis that appellant had never sold him any whisky. When the judge\u2019s explanation, with the statement of facts, are taken together it will be seen that the same facts were proven by other witnesses, and, therefore, being a second application for continuance it was addressed to the discretion of the court and was prop' erly overruled. Also upon another ground, and that is, the object and purpose of the testimony was to impeach the State\u2019s witness, Alex Lewis, by proving statements contradictory to what he testified on the witness stand. A continuance is never permissible to secure testimony for impeaching purposes. We, therefore, hold the court below did not err in refusing to grant a continuance. The application was made for a continuance, as before stated, for the witness Flora Pollard.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We find in the record bill of exceptions No. 2, which complains that the court, in overruling the application, stated in the presence and hearing of the jury that the witness Flora Pollard and Andrew Bell had run away together. It is claimed that this statement was prejudicial to appellant because Andrew Bell was a material witness for the defense and that the same would have a tendency to discredit said Bell before the jury. The court states in his qualification to this bill that the remark was made to the clerk, Mr. Smith, while the judge was on the bench, and not to the juryj and that he does not think the jury heard the remark, as it was not intended for them. In'the absence of an affidavit that the jurors heard the remark or in some way showing that this remark got to the jury, was heard by them and in some way affected their verdict, or that they considered same in discrediting the witness Bell, we are inclined to think that the bill of exceptions is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The other bills of exceptions relate to the orders of the Commissioners Court putting prohibition in effect. These can not now be considered, as they show prohibition has been in effect in that county for several years and no contest has been made or is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">We have examined the record, and finding no error of- a prejudicial character, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">March 2, 1910.</p>\n<author id=\"b429-12\">McCORD, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ACDz\">At a former day of this term the judgment of the lower court in this case was affirmed. The State, through her Assistant Attorney-General, has filed a motion to set aside the judgment of affirmance and that the judgment of the trial court be reformed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>and the ease then be affirmed. An inspection of the record will show that the jury assessed the appellant\u2019s punishment at a fine of $25 and twenty days in jail. The judgment of the court below, as found in the record, after reciting the verdict of the jury, stated: \u201cIt is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that the State of Texas do have and recover of the defendant, Elbert Gipson, said fine of $25 and all costs for which let execution issue.\u201d The judgment being incomplete, the State\u2019s motion to set aside the affirmance is granted and the judgment is here reformed to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"143\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAggAAACPAQAAAAC3rR6HAAAHHklEQVR4nO2ZQW8cSRWAv+5p2b0i8tQGJIzk2O0c0B5AspCQQuTNVIQPK8SJH4AiDigHDuZmpCguZ03sA2IjceGAiBUQZ86rFVshgZ0DKBGXZSW0aTuW4l0BW5M1bI/V08Whu6dnpsfdM+s9gMg7uGteVX1+VfXq1atux1InXlxZ7dYC6FVXT0BA1RAe1gEiXV1v6dqWHZB4yQ5LSTEsbo8NQuAwR8YGOo7jF2aa6lHEN+8AEOaa7gYYKBbAqR6Ex1YjK+RMQNy490F1vwEbushhjQG4tawKjaJKXAhGVAocBrlRNcFUVk8gLogRK3aBJJyGwMjWWAfcICi3PYXQhAT28DkutM/z1TyhWz0L4BJwfL/3ve7Xgz8DuH2DrKTrvyOPvlJLOJw1xJYYqcDa5IIPEHLy+L6PDgtXO43g9368+I2uAbuoIbmk8pqjCG/+rnm2XUfwuMcM/uyj95dDiNcePN0FCGi8denyNZQv6wguR2BBpz50C9ZhARYOAy8BWKgjOKq/hwxE+bBDwA03TY1DAm60nmRFFYFTbEQ9R69mW6aEv5+z4EQQo7JtlYqP8yFCdWtHQUPD3B3AVYU6CQC2eY9A1BIIFPbnlJy7I4APVO1EuDAPJwFgd6E/jhAFq/yG+erTAtwE0nCsWR8CNxMSdnk3Gd9xsKkHHeBaqhB5jQJtBfVeXYxetUcr3wAiMaot2aCyc80bsiCArg0IVE1/cNGxwo0ANFgb5DURvFbfH1zCiDgxgPahOGeQ3WRbP+nVLQVu43qHtg2CTy4+UcBlCcDvQmLiuP3hv3rfqbWhexFHLHBy9UCA1+5dEGDX9tWF87uvOF1VezJ7XNtxbvsXr8qWY6Hh3Mgiiv6hx7PwF/JzfjUAnkZDJ7eN/9201i7Fm/HSo0y1U3l2U1k7CWGSHKZuJl8QXhD+Hwlnvl98BjbIz8qGfX//5eDTEXT6COPB5GAqgkwfQXEecT/gFl2BA5NEuQfZ8/Ui3qlmgg0bCa2potwVXsuLdzcSocIrCeFUqzmYoqzyA2Z/y00zpT/onGWIlW7beGtKj1L9UpTghvigpiK09fBvAURTEb4wUE7zBYfSKKrv8SH8HgDHxwGDLRNO3Mo0VvK2AuBOfg31pxqFa0BpAK49NJjjLrI0k7Nz908nOBF2MUzLu0APHouSDerLpxMMsGwA2BeAPM/HQXkU4ekEcYNEDrQKPC+RJcK4LHoxLyQRbADQuA6IuIEuLuy5tC+VCPkSG9kPmaseQMKYnSXFGOtVVlgqHDsGOptWTLaz/Df7pb5uETiQJ9fLXj0usnvvjBqTZr5/WlG3y3tzXCLd6Jug85IBhPIjZ8zuDsYYkXm66E97eucQOGN297j7SHe+rAuFBQ/K/tCU5dbR97OCSz6ZorC2vBYHZYQaLLYBgv7N5qBEUGEJ0MmeBjzUWwASP8HEm+hwlOD3o2khWZsjtQVvi5sAeo0bMoqAMeeFLGkyq97raHg/Zf4BdvnRy7y6qyfZWZkEoNzDAMCJfQ8l8R+K0s56iYunERp/+xUOcg0gvOs6rMzMEFyd5txM5VFR3LR686lT/5Z13IYfkCnyhzMQquV/LBM7A0H/F9jwgpDKSTVh78w2XN9yet5hfcNKWWiErWLTh3OtTlV8GBWXgVPNSmAv4qOpRpE0Y/TgG8QdPZrH6GpC+sK5EDu/IEfajP4uEQYySAkEcyxXdikTzNC/SfA5P9xG1xH+qoYbeZyb0gb6NiRFcWpCIWPSoGpmn2BV2jtLrRRAtykms8FARz3fcw7aqXfr850Le92v4ZMcV3bOCALAaGMI9S9TpSE+iv7SO4mOb9YTSJpvPHkazyw92HkstGOtsUnLMc7OfiPCvr6f3jOr90VHBfAl81C+Elx6nlLD5syqGxKVc+ZT5gEIlL+A9M4BypECP/DoemoCAC7n0iRFkf9BAQnCDL10rSB8Xj0mzV1eigGst51me26NO/cJRgJSCridqnrKgD0pfEXWEIgIgH98N1eteAD229R90esT0CFwnJu81U6vMe0wb6OpktxS3Z80lX6qE7UvqgcJAcgvJhQngwW/7ptBLl66ZJkJNltAB+dd1W+zVmfDyp0QMM/JZi4CMNF6ANCT9fMggNx3HPA0JBjwSVDEYd0o3PwyWPz7LIADMh2JrCYIc2AhVFE2Cjc0JETEJHSjpereAO7zTvDPV1efict7uwIDmEO71Ip/nUTNeKNb27/vD28GdpuIe+B0vgXhV5UVvg/jb27DhJ+07M8+kSsymP/mrucBOtEE/rznes6stX/UdW8Xy7m9ubJpk1bro5ZtZprqGHXK7WBp8EddlKuX6lg3njDBpaOGMI2MJ0zyZbSaMM0oxt+z9pcHo4Mw09swjUxAsOJTEJYGB1GdFE9igx+ckWBrIkz9ndc2qqN2vQ3OT6vr/wOxh0MrCss2YQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"520\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">This day this cause was called for trial, and the State by her attorney and the defendant in person both announced ready for trial, and the defendant, Elbert Gipson, pleaded himself not guilty to the information filed herein, and a jury, to wit: J.
