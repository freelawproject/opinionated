We think the indictment is subject to the objection made. It merely alleges he did then and there unlawfully engage in and pursue the occupation and business of selling intoxicating liquors in said county. It does not negative the fact that he was engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquors except as permitted by law. The Act of the Thirty-first Legislature, p. 284, creating this offense, is as follows: \u201cIf any person shall engage in or pursue the occupation or business of selling intoxicating liquors <em>except as permitted by law </em>in any county, justice precinct, city, town or subdivision of a county in which the sale of intoxicating liquors has been or shall hereafter be prohibited under the laws of this State, he or she shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary for not less than two nor more than five years.\u201d The exception therein contained is in the enacting clause, and is essentially descriptive of the offense, and under all the authorities such exception must be negatived. State v. Duke, 42 Texas, 455; State v. Clayton, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 410. In this State an occupation tax is levied on persons selling whisky, as by law for certain purposes they are authorized to do, in local option counties and precincts. See Laws of 1897, p. 223. And we have quite uniformly enforced the penalties provided by law for a violation of this occupation statute. Snearley v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 507; Snead v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 583, 117 S. W. Rep., 983, where all the statutes and authorities touching this matter are exhaustively considered and treated. Cunningham v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 522, and Robinson v. State, 75 S. W. Rep., 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Believing and holding as we do that the indictment charges no offense against the law, it becomes unnecessary to consider the other questions raised, and it is, therefore, ordered that the judgment of conviction be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">McCord, Judge, not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
