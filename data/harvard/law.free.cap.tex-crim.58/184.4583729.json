Article 357 of the Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>thus defines this offense: \u201cFornication is the living together and carnal intercourse with each other, or habitual carnal intercourse with each other without living together, of a man and woman, both being unmarried.\u201d It will be noticed that the charging part of the information is not in accord with the statute. Fornication, under the statute, is constituted in one of two ways, either living together and having carnal intercourse with each other, or habitual intercourse without living together, of a man and woman, both being unmarried. It is requisite in order to charge an offense in the information or indictment for the pleader to follow the statutory definition of such offense, and set out its essential ingredients in the pleadings. This was not done in this instance, and, therefore, the information does not charge the offense defined by the statute. See Jones v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">There are other questions in the case suggested for revision, but inasmuch as the information fails to charge the statutory offense the judgment is reversed and the prosecution is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
