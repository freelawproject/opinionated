This being a local law, it was essential to prove the precedent steps required by the law of the land. In order to admit such proof the information must in terms declare that the essentials of the law were complied with. We may infer perhaps that the Commissioners Court of Montague County passed an order directing an election to be held for the purpose of determining whether or not horses, mules, jacks, jennets and cattle should be permitted to run at large in the county, but it is evident that'this is not directly and positively alleged in the information. We think that the motion to quash on this ground should have been sustained, and that under the information filed no conviction can be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
