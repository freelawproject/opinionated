This ease involves two distinct constitutional issues, both arising from statements made by a young woman who refused to identify herself to police officers who were dispatched to the scene on the report of a man with a gun. The young woman identified defendant as the person who earlier had pointed a shotgun at her and directed the officers to the location of the discarded shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The first issue is whether the police had probable cause to arrest defendant. The Appellate Division concluded that defendant\u2019s arrest violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution and, accordingly, suppressed an incriminating statement made by defendant to police after his arrest. We conclude that the on-scene identification by a citizen informant and corroborative discovery of the shotgun gave the officers probable cause to arrest defendant, and therefore defendant\u2019s volunteered statement should not have been suppressed as the product of an unlawful arrest. We therefore reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s suppression of defendant\u2019s incriminating statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The second issue is whether the admission of the young woman\u2019s statement at trial violated defendant\u2019s right of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because the police did not secure the woman\u2019s name and address, she could not be called as a witness at trial. Her identification of defendant as the person wielding the shotgun\u2014 the critical piece of the State\u2019s case\u2014was introduced through the testimony of two police officers. The Appellate Division determined that the woman\u2019s hearsay statement was testimonial and defendant had never been given the opportunity to cross-examine her, and thus the admission of the statement violated the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>mands of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>813, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). The appellate panel essentially found that the out-of-court statement was testimonial because at the time the unidentified woman made the statement to the police she was not witnessing or experiencing the type of ongoing emergency, as illustrated in <em>Davis, </em>that would provide an exception to the constitutional right of confrontation. <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 827-28, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2276-77, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240-41. Three members of the Court agree that the woman\u2019s hearsay statement was testimonial and inadmissible, and three members do not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the admission of the statement could not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see State v. Macon, 31 N.J. </em>325, 340, 273 A.2d 1 (1971), the judgment of the Appellate Division reversing defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed by an evenly divided Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Defendant was charged by a Hudson County grand jury in a two-count indictment with second-degree possession of a shotgun with the purpose to use it unlawfully against the person or property of another, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a), and third-degree knowingly possessing the shotgun without having first obtained a firearms purchaser identification card, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(c)(l). In a pretrial motion, defendant claimed that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him and therefore subjected him to an unreasonable seizure in violation of his constitutional rights. He sought to suppress a statement that he allegedly made after he was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\n<em>Suppression Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Anthony Ruocco of the Jersey City Police Department testified that on February 12, 2005, at approximately 1:00 a.m., he and Officer William Sullivan, as well as other police units, responded to a report of a man with a shotgun- at 199 Bidwell Avenue in Jersey City. On his arrival, Officer Ruocco observed approximately three black males, including defendant, in the area of 199 Bidwell Avenue and was approached by a young black woman. She looked to be eighteen- or nineteen-years old, and \u201ccame from around the corner.\u201d The woman told Officer Ruocco that defendant had pointed a shotgun in her direction (she apparently was with a group of people), and that defendant uttered words to the effect of, \u201cGet off the corner.\u201d She also stated that she saw defendant throw the shotgun underneath a black Cadillac. As the woman spoke to Ruocco, \u201cshe was shaking a little bit\u201d and her \u201cvoice was elevated.\u201d Officers Sullivan and Chet Mecca then recovered the shotgun from underneath the Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">After Officer Ruocco arrived at the scene, officers approached and questioned defendant about the report of the shotgun. Following the young woman\u2019s statement and the discovery of the shotgun, defendant was placed in the back of a police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The young woman told Officer Ruocco that she lived in the area but nothing else about herself. She said she did not want to speak with any detectives or become involved in the case \u201cbecause she -was seared for her safety.\u201d Officer Ruocco did not get her name, address, or telephone number. The young woman just \u201cleft [and] walked away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Officer Ruocco transported defendant in the backseat of a patrol car to the district police station. Officer Ruocco did not consider defendant to be under arrest at that point; however, if defendant had refused to go, he would have placed him under arrest for obstruction. At the police station, Officer Ruocco escorted defendant from the car. Once inside the station, according to Ruocco, defendant commented to him, \u201cWhat the problem, you guys don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>do your job. So I went inside and got my shotgun.\u201d At that point, Ruocco placed defendant under arrest, handcuffed him, and gave him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Defendant testified, presenting a different account from the one described by the nameless witness and Officer Ruocco. Defendant explained that on the night in question he was involved in activities related to his grandmother\u2019s recent death. That evening, he had gone to church and brought food to his home at 204 Bidwell Avenue, where family and friends were gathering. At the time the police arrived, he was standing outside his home. A police officer approached him and asked him if \u201canything [was] going on.\u201d Later, an officer told him he was \u201cunder arrest for having a gun.\u201d He then was handcuffed and taken to the police precinct. Defendant denied possessing the shotgun found under the Cadillac, pointing that weapon at anyone, or making the incriminating statement attributed to him by Officer Ruocco.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The court found Officer Ruoeco\u2019s credibility \u201cto be excellent.\u201d The court concluded that the police engaged in a lawful investigative detention based on the statement of the citizen informant and the discovery of the shotgun. It further determined that based on defendant\u2019s \u201cspontaneous\u201d admission to possessing the shotgun, the police had probable cause to arrest him. Accordingly, the court denied the motion to suppress defendant\u2019s incriminating statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">\n<em>The Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">After jury selection, defendant challenged the admissibility of the non-appearing woman\u2019s statement to Officer Ruocco\u2014identifying defendant as the person wielding the shotgun\u2014on hearsay and confrontation grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court determined that the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>was admissible under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">At trial, the State presented three witnesses. Officer Ruoeco testified that he and Officer Sullivan were dispatched to the area of 199 Bidwell Avenue in Jersey City on the report of a man with a shotgun. On their arrival, defendant was standing in front of 199 Bidwell Avenue. While Officer Sullivan \u201cwas holding [defendant],\u201d Officer Ruocco was approached by an eighteen- or nineteen-year-old black woman who \u201ccame from around the corner.\u201d She told the officer that she was standing on the corner (apparently with others) when defendant \u201cpointed a shotgun at their direction and stated get off the corner.\u201d She also \u201cstated that the shotgun was thrown under a black Cadillac.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Officer Sullivan gave a somewhat different account. Officer Sullivan testified that after he and Officer Ruocco arrived at the scene, a black female walked across the street and approached him. She said, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s him,\u201d pointing to defendant, \u201che\u2019s the one with the gun.\u201d The two officers then told defendant to halt, and he replied, \u201cWhat do you want me for?\u201d Simultaneously, the woman advised the officers that the gun was underneath a black Cadillac. With Officer Ruoeco in control of defendant\u2014ten feet from the Cadillac\u2014and the arrival of another police ear, Officer Sullivan retrieved the unloaded shotgun from underneath the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">According to Officer Sullivan, the woman stated that she did not want to be a witness, and therefore he did not get her name. Fearing that people on the street might become disruptive, Officers Sullivan and Ruocco immediately transported defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the district police station. Officer Sullivan explained that the shotgun was not dusted for fingerprints because of defendant\u2019s reported admission to Officer Ruocco. However, Officer Sullivan testified that in his presence defendant denied owning or having anything to do with the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Last, Detective Daniel Diaz of the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office testified that the shotgun recovered under the Cadillac was operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Defendant presented two witnesses, both friends, Tarieka Hatcher and Vladimir Thomas. Ms. Hatcher, a postal employee, testified that on the evening in question she met defendant and his friend, Vladimir Thomas, at a bar. Defendant had attended a funeral earlier in the day. They carried out champagne to bring to defendant\u2019s home near the corner of Bidwell Avenue and Martin Luther King Drive, where a number of people were on the street. She was in close proximity to defendant, near his home on Bidwell Avenue, until the time of his arrest. She never saw him in possession of a shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Mr. Thomas, a carpenter, testified that on February 12, 2005, he too was in the company of defendant, first at the funeral, later at the bar, and afterwards in front of defendant\u2019s home on Bidwell Avenue. He described the \u201carea [as] a drug comer.\u201d He recalled that he was in defendant\u2019s presence on Bidwell Avenue for all but the few minutes he was inside a nearby food store. As he left the store, he observed the police handcuffing defendant. At no point did he see defendant in possession of a shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">At the trial\u2019s conclusion, the jury found defendant guilty of third-degree knowingly possessing a shotgun without first having obtained a firearms purchaser identification card.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced defendant to an extended term of imprisonment, impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ing a ten-year term with a five-year period of parole ineligibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7 and 2C:44-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The Appellate Division reversed defendant\u2019s conviction, finding two separate grounds of error. First, the appellate panel determined that, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the warrant-less detention of defendant, near his home, was the equivalent of an arrest and had to be supported by probable cause. Relying largely on <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>266, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000), the panel found that the woman\u2019s accusation that defendant had pointed a shotgun at her, even though corroborated by the discovery of the gun where she said it was discarded, did not satisfy the constitutional standard for probable cause. It concluded that there was no \u201creason to believe\u201d that the woman, \u201cwho refused to identify herself or give a statement, was speaking the truth.\u201d It conjectured that, under the circumstances, the woman\u2019s motive for identifying defendant might have been to \u201cexact[ ] revenge upon or otherwise harass[ ] a seemingly innocent person.\u201d Having reasoned that defendant was unlawfully seized by the police, the panel then held that defendant\u2019s \u201calleged confession\u201d was a direct result of the unconstitutional seizure and had to be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The panel next determined that the woman\u2019s hearsay statement to Officers Ruocco and Sullivan\u2014that defendant pointed a shotgun in her direction, told the group she was with to get off the corner,' and discarded the weapon under a Cadillac\u2014was introduced in violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as construed by <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36,124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>813, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), and this Court\u2019s <em>recent </em>decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>in <em>State ex rel. J.A., </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>324, 949 A.2d 790 (2008). The panel noted that, under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, a testimonial hearsay statement is inadmissible \u201cunless there is a showing that the declarant is unavailable, and that the defendant had a previous opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d (Citing <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 68, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203). The panel applied the facts to <em>Davis\u2019s </em>definition of a testimonial statement\u2014a statement given to the police when there was no \u201congoing emergency\u201d and where the primary purpose of the police questioning was to \u201cprove past events potentially relevant to [aj later criminal prosecution.\u201d (Quoting <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 822, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2273-74, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237). In particular, the panel held that the woman\u2019s hearsay statement was made when the suspect no longer possessed the weapon or posed a danger and \u201cfor the purpose of identifying defendant to the police so that he could be subject to criminal prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\u201cBecause the tipster\u2019s statements constituted the sole remaining evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d the panel reversed his conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The State filed a petition for certification raising two distinct issues. The first issue is whether the police had probable cause to arrest defendant. The second issue is whether the non-testifying woman\u2019s statement to the police, implicating defendant in a crime, was a testimonial statement as defined in <em>Davis </em>and therefore barred by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>We granted certification. <em>State v. Basil, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>475, 983 A.2d 201 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Appellate Division concluded that defendant was the subject of an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution and therefore suppressed the alleged statement made by defendant while in police custody.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The key issue is whether the warrantless arrest of defendant was constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The Fourth Amendment permits a police officer to make a warrantless arrest of a defendant in a public place provided the officer has probable cause to believe the defendant committed a crime. <em>See Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>366, 370, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>795, 799, 157 L.Ed.2d 769, 774 (2003).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Probable cause is the touchstone for determining the validity of the arrest in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Probable cause cannot be defined with scientific precision, <em>State v. Evers, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>355, 381, 815 A.2d 432 (2003), because it is a \u201c \u2018practical, nontechnical conception\u2019 \u201d addressing \u201c \u2018the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>213, 231, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2317, 2328, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, 544 (1983) (quoting <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 <em>U.S. </em>160, 175-76, 69 <em>S.Ct. </em>1302, 1310-11, 93 <em>L.Ed. </em>1879, 1890-91 (1949)). \u201c[P]robable cause is a fluid concept\u2014turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts\u2014not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d <em>Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 232, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2329, 76 L.Ed.2d at 544. Although probable cause is more than a mere suspicion of guilt, it is less than the evidence necessary to convict a defendant of a crime in a court of law. <em>See Brinegar, supra, </em>338 <em>U.S. </em>at 175, 69 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1310, 93 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1890; <em>State v. Davis, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>16, 23-24, 231 A.2d 793 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>1054, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>805, 19 L.Ed.2d 852 (1968). Between those two extremes, it is safe to say that a police officer has probable cause to arrest a suspect when the officer possesses \u201ca well grounded suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>204, 211, 777 A.2d 60 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Brinegar, supra, </em>338 <em>U.S. </em>at 175, 69 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1310, 93 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1890 (\u201cThe substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In determining whether there was probable cause to make an arrest, a court must look to the totality of the circumstances, <em>Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 238, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2332, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 548; <em>State v. Moore, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>40, 46, 853 A.2d 903 (2004), and view those circumstances \u201cfrom the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer,\u201d <em>Pringle, supra, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>at 371, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 800, 157 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 775 (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>690, 696, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1657, 1661-62, 134 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>911, 919 (1996)). In assessing the facts available to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>police officer, important considerations are the witness\u2019s veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge. <em>See Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 233, 238, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2329, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d at 545, 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Generally speaking, information imparted by a citizen directly to a police officer will receive greater weight than information received from an anonymous tipster. <em>See State v. Amelio, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>207, 212, 962 A.2d 498 (2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>2402, 173 L.Ed.2d 1297 (2009). Thus, an objectively reasonable police officer may assume that an ordinary citizen reporting a crime, which the citizen purports to have observed, is providing reliable information. <em>See State v. Stovall, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>346, 362, 788 A.2d 746 (2002). Our courts have distinguished between an identifiable citizen, who is presumed to be reliable, and an anonymous informer whose reliability must be established. <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 506, 517 A.2d 859 (1986). The distinction is \u201cgrounded in common experience\u201d because we assume that an ordinary citizen \u201cis motivated by factors that are consistent with law enforcement goals.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The distinction is also grounded in common sense. \u201c[W]hen a tip is made in-person, an officer can observe the informant\u2019s demeanor and determine whether the informant seems credible enough to justify immediate police action without further questioning.\u201d <em>United States v. Palos-Marquez, </em>591 F.3d 1272, 1275 (9th Cir.2010). Moreover, \u201can in-person informant risks losing anonymity and being held accountable for a false tip.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-4(a) (\u201cA person who knowingly gives or causes to be given false information to any law enforcement officer with purpose to implicate another commits a crime of the fourth degree.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We now apply those principles to the relevant facts to determine whether defendant\u2019s \u201cseizure\u201d ran afoul of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Officer Ruocco\u2014whose credibility the trial court found to be excellent\u2014testified that he responded to 199 Bidwell Avenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>based on a dispatcher\u2019s report of a man with a shotgun.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On his arrival at the scene, he was approached by a young black woman, who had come from around the corner. She told the officer that defendant, who was standing nearby, had pointed a shotgun at her, that he had told her and the group she was with to \u201cget off the corner,\u201d and that he had thrown the shotgun underneath a black Cadillac. The young woman was an identifiable citizen and purported to give information from her personal knowledge regarding events that occurred minutes earlier. This was a face-to-face encounter that allowed the officer to make an on-the-spot credibility assessment of the citizen informant. Importantly, the young woman\u2019s reliability was immediately corroborated by the discovery of the shotgun in the precise location where she said it was discarded. <em>See Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 241-42, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2334, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 550-51 (\u201crecognizfing] the value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">That the young woman would later refuse to give any identifying data about herself out of an expressed fear for her safety does little to diminish the reliability of the information when it was given. The young woman could not have known when she provided the information to Officer Ruocco that he would not take her into custody as a material witness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:104-2, -5, or later seek her out to involve her in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">From the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, the combination of an identifiable citizen\u2019s account of events that she witnessed firsthand minutes earlier and the discovery of corroborative physical evidence\u2014the shotgun with which she was purportedly threatened\u2014in the location she described provided probable cause to arrest defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>This ease is not like <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>266, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1375, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>254 (2000), which was heavily relied on by the Appellate Division. In <em>J.L., </em>the police received an anonymous call alleging that a young black male wearing a plaid shirt was standing at a particular bus stop armed with a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377, 146 L.Ed.2d at 258-59. Two police officers were dispatched to the bus stop and observed J.L., a young black male wearing a plaid shirt, and two other black males standing there. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377, 146 L.Ed.2d at 259. The officers did not observe the three engaged in any \u201cillegal conduct\u201d or \u201cthreatening or otherwise unusual movements\u201d; nor did they notice the presence of a firearm. <em>Ibid. </em>The officers frisked all three and found a gun in J.L.\u2019s pocket. <em>Ibid. </em>J.L was charged with \u201ccarrying a concealed firearm without a license and possessing a firearm while under the age of 18.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The United States Supreme Court concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment and therefore upheld the suppression of the gun. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 274, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377-78, 1380, 146 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 259, 262. The Court determined that the \u201canonymous tip\u201d lacked the requisite indicia of reliability necessary to justify a stop and frisk because \u201c[a]ll the police had to go on ... was the bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 274, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1379, 1380, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 260, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Although <em>J.L. </em>involved a Terry<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> stop and frisk, which requires only that a police officer have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to conduct a limited search, <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>119, 123-24, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 675-76, 145 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>570, 576 (2000), the case before us involves dramatically different facts that clearly provided the police with probable cause to arrest. Here, unlike <em>J.L., </em>the police dealt with a citizen informant, who reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>that a shotgun had been pointed at her, who provided the basis of her knowledge, and who directed the officer to the location of the gun. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the police had a well-grounded suspicion that defendant had committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We conclude that, under both the Fourth Amendment and Article I, Paragraph 7 of our State Constitution, the police had probable cause to arrest defendant, and therefore defendant\u2019s alleged spontaneous admission to Officer Ruocco did not occur during an unlawful seizure. Given our holding it makes little difference whether one characterizes defendant\u2019s custodial status as an investigative detention, as did the trial court, or the equivalent of an arrest, as did the Appellate Division. We note, however, that the police detained defendant, who was standing in front of his home, placed him in a patrol car against his will, and transported him to a local police precinct \u201cfor further investigation.\u201d The degree of the restraint on defendant\u2019s freedom constituted, for Fourth Amendment purposes, an arrest, triggering the probable-cause requirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Hayes v. Florida, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>811, 816, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1643, 1647, 84 L.Ed.2d 705, 710 (1985) (holding that police cannot \u201cforcibly remove a person from his home or other place in which he is entitled to be and transport him to the police station, where he is detained, although briefly, for investigative purposes\u201d without probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">We next must decide whether the introduction of the young woman\u2019s hearsay statement to the police implicating defendant in a crime violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The young woman\u2019s out-of-court statement identifying defendant as the gunman was the critical piece of evidence in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ing whether defendant was guilty of unlawfully possessing the shotgun. She was not called as a witness, presumably because she was \u201cunavailable\u201d due to the State\u2019s inability to locate her. The police officers at the scene allowed her to leave without obtaining any identifying information because she expressed fear for her safety. Moreover, defendant never had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The essential issue that divides defendant and the State is whether the woman\u2019s account to the police was a testimonial or nontestimonial statement. If the statement was testimonial, it is inadmissible because defendant had no prior opportunity to cross-examine the woman. If the statement was nontestimonial, it is admissible because the constitutional right to confrontation does not apply to a nontestimonial statement that falls within a recognized hearsay exception, e.g., the excited-utterance exception, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We now turn to the precise issue raised in the State\u2019s petition\u2014 whether the unavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statement was testimonial and therefore barred by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him____\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because \u201c[t]he right of confrontation is an essential attribute of the right to a fair trial,\u201d a defendant must be given \u201ca fair opportunity to defend against the State[\u2019]s accusations.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>State v.

For that reason, the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation \u201cexpresses a preference for the in-court testimony of a witness, whose veracity can be tested by the rigors of cross-examination.\u201d <em>State ex rel. J.A., </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>324, 342, 949 A. 2d 790 (2008).

Washington, </em>the United States Supreme Court declared that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause prohibited the use of an out-of-court testimonial statement against a criminal defendant unless the witness was unavailable and the defendant was given a prior opportunity to cross-examine her. 541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 50-53, 68, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 1363-65, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 192-94, 203 (2004); <em>see also State v.

The Court made clear that the ultimate goal of the Confrontation Clause is to test the reliability of testimonial evidence in \u201cthe crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199; <em>see also J.A., supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 342-43, 949 A.2d 790. The Court reasoned that the Clause \u201creflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence ..., but about how reliability can best be determined.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 61, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Thus, the Confrontation Clause proscribes \u201cthe use of out-of-court <em>testimonial </em>hearsay, untested by cross-examination, as a substitute for in-court testimony.\u201d <em>J.A., supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 949 A.2d 790. Out-of-court statements interdicted by the Confrontation Clause include both testimonial statements elicited by the police during interrogations, <em>see Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>at 51-52, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193, and testimonial statements volunteered to the police, <em>see Davis v.

Out-of-court nontestimonial statements, although subject to a State\u2019s hearsay rules, were \u201cexempted ... from Confrontation Clause scrutiny.\u201d 541 <em>U.S. </em>at 68, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1374, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 203. The Crawford Court left for another day a more \u201ccomprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">That day came two years later. In the companion cases of <em>Davis v. Washington </em>and <em>Hammon v. Indiana, </em>the Supreme Court applied the principles of <em>Crawford </em>and defined in greater detail the distinction between nontestimonial and testimonial statements. 547 <em>U.S. </em>813, 822, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2266, 2273-74, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>224, 237 (2006). \u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In contrast, statements \u201care testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The Court illustrated the application of those definitions in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon. </em>In <em>Davis, </em>the victim made a telephone call to 9-1-1 and spoke to an emergency operator while her former boyfriend\u2014the defendant\u2014was beating her. <em>Id. </em>at 817-18, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270-71, 165 L.Ed.2d at 234. The victim identified her assailant to the operator as the domestic violence was ongoing. <em>Id. </em>at 818, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2271, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 234. During the 9-1-1 call the defendant fled from the victim\u2019s home. <em>Ibid. </em>Within four minutes of the 9-1-1 call, the police arrived, observing the victim\u2019s \u201cshaken state\u201d and physical injuries to her body. <em>Id. </em>at 818, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235. At trial, the victim did not testify, but her statements to the 9-1-1 operator were admitted as the primary evidence against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 818-19, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Court determined that the statements made by the victim to the 9-1-1 operator were nontestimonial for among the following reasons: (1) the statements were elicited \u201cto resolve the present emergency, rather than simply to learn ... what had happened in the past\u201d; (2) the victim \u201cwas speaking about events as they were actually happening, rather than \u2018describ[ing] past events\u2019 \u201d; and (3) the victim\u2019s \u201ccall was plainly a call for help against a bona fide physical threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827-28, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2276-77, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240 (citations and emphasis omitted). Viewed objectively, the operator\u2019s questioning of the victim \u201cindicate[d] its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Importantly, in <em>Davis, </em>the Court noted that once \u201cthe operator gained the information needed to address the exigency of the moment, the emergency appears to have ended,\u201d and therefore \u201c[i]t could readily be maintained\u201d that the victim\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>after the defendant\u2019s flight were testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 828-29, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 241. Through an in limine procedure, the Court instructed, portions of a statement that are testimonial should be redacted from those portions that are otherwise nontestimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 829, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In stark contrast stand the facts in <em>Hammon. </em>There, the police responded to the scene of a \u201creported domestic disturbance\u201d\u2014the home of the wife/vietim and her husband/defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 819-20, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2272, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235-36. By the time the police arrived, the domestic-violence incident was over. <em>Ibid. </em>The police separated the victim from her husband, and then the wife gave a statement to the police describing what had occurred. <em>Ibid. </em>She also detailed the domestic violence incident in a \u201cbattery affidavit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The victim did not appear at the defendant\u2019s trial, but her statement to the police and her battery affidavit were introduced against him. <em>Id. </em>at 820-21, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2272-73, 165 L.Ed.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The Court concluded that the victim\u2019s statement to the police and in the affidavit describing the domestic-violence events were testimonial for among the following reasons: (1) the police interrogation of the victim \u201cwas part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct\u201d; (2) the police inquiry was not an effort to determine \u201c \u201cwhat [was] happening,\u2019 but rather \u2018what happened\u2019 \u201d; and (3) \u201cthere was no immediate threat\u201d to the victim because she had been separated from her abuser and therefore \u201cno emergency [was] in progress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829-30, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 242. \u201cObjectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 242. Unlike in <em>Davis, </em>in which the victim\u2019s statement to the 9-1-1 operator was \u201ca call for help,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 827, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240, the statement in <em>Hammon </em>was a recounting of past events and thus \u201can obvious substitute for live testimony,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 830, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>We applied the principles enunciated in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>in <em>J.A., supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 347-51, 949 A.2d 790. In that case, we held that a non-testifying witness\u2019s statement to the police, recounting a robbery and the flight of the perpetrators that occurred several minutes before the witness gave the statement, was clearly testimonial and therefore inadmissible because defendant \u201cdid not have a prior opportunity to cross-examine [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347-48, 949 A.2d 790. We found the case analogous to <em>Hammon, </em>as \u201c[t]here was no ongoing emergency\u2014no immediate danger\u2014 implicating either the witness or the victim, both of whom were in the company of police officers at the time of the \u2018interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 949 A.2d 790. The primary purpose of the interrogation of the witness in <em>J.A. </em>was \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to [a] later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, 949 A.2d 790 (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we distilled from Davis that a non-appearing witness\u2019s \u201cnarrative to a law enforcement officer about a crime, which once completed has ended any \u2018imminent danger\u2019 to the declarant or some other identifiable person, is testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 949 A.2d 790 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Courts have given varied interpretations to the ongoing-emergency language of <em>Davis. </em>Some courts have narrowly construed an \u201congoing emergency\u201d to cases involving a \u201cbona fide physical threat\u201d requiring help, reasoning that \u201c[i]f merely obtaining information to assist officers in the field renders the statements nontestimonial, then virtually any hearsay statements made by crime victims in response to police questioning would be admissible\u2014a result that does not comport with <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis.\u201d State v.

As will be discussed in more detail later, that scenario is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The government bears the burden of proving the constitutional admissibility of a statement in response to a Confrontation Clause challenge. <em>See Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>805, 816, 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>3139, 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 652-53 (1990), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 67-68, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1373-74, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 202-03; <em>Ohio v.

Therefore, we must determine whether the State has met its burden. With <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>as our backdrop, and mindful that the State bears the burden of establishing an exception to the constitutional right of confrontation, we now apply those legal principles to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We conclude that the non-testifying witness\u2019s statement implicating defendant was testimonial, that is, the statement was the equivalent of bearing witness against defendant. Here, defendant was denied the opportunity of confronting his accuser. The State has not shown that this case presents the type of ongoing emergency, described in <em>Davis, </em>that would justify an end run around the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">It is undisputed that the police responded to 199 Bidwell Avenue on the report of a man with a shotgun. According to Officer Ruocco, Officer Sullivan was \u201cholding\u201d defendant, who was standing in front of 199 Bidwell, when the young woman came from around the corner and approached Officer Ruocco. She identified defendant as the person who, earlier, had pointed a shotgun at her and told her, and apparently others in her group, to get off the corner. She also told the officers that defendant had thrown the shotgun under a Cadillac. With defendant already detained, the police retrieved the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">According to Officer Sullivan, after his arrival at the scene, along with Officer Ruocco, the woman crossed the street and approached him. She said, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s him,\u201d pointing to defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u201che\u2019s the one with the gun.\u201d (She obviously knew that defendant was not armed with the shotgun because she directed the police to the gun\u2019s location). The two officers then told defendant to halt, and he replied, \u201cWhat do you want me for?\u201d Simultaneously, the woman advised the officers that the gun was underneath a black Cadillac. With Officer Ruocco in control of defendant\u2014ten feet from the Cadillac\u2014and the arrival of another police cai\u2019, Officer Sullivan retrieved the unloaded shotgun from underneath the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">To be sure, there were some differences in the testimony presented by Officers Ruocco and Sullivan, but none that would change the outcome of our analysis. In both accounts, the witness <em>returned </em>to the scene\u2014after she saw the presence of the police\u2014 to assist in an investigation into past criminal conduct. <em>See Davis, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 829-30, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 242. This was not a cry for help as in Davis in which an assault against the witness was ongoing. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240. In both accounts, the witness knew that the shotgun was under the Cadillac when she spoke with the officers. In both accounts, like in <em>Hammon, </em>the witness was separated from defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 830, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 242. Given Officer Ruocco\u2019s testimony, when the witness spoke to him, she apparently could see that an officer was \u201cholding\u201d defendant and knew that the shotgun was under the Cadillac, and therefore \u201cthere was no immediate threat\u201d to her or the police. <em>Ibid. </em>Even Officer Sullivan\u2019s testimony does not suggest that the woman had an objective reason to fear an imminent attack: as she spoke to the police, she was separated from defendant, the shotgun was under a ear and away from defendant, and the police were close to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Whatever differences there may be between the testimony of Officers Ruocco and Sullivan, the State bore the burden of proof and cannot now repudiate its key witness, Officer Ruocco, who testified both at the suppression hearing and at trial, and whose credibility at the suppression hearing the trial court found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>excellent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It was Officer Ruocco\u2014not Officer Sullivan\u2014to whom the woman stated that defendant had earlier pointed a shotgun at her. When she made that statement to Officer Ruocco, the witness was relating \u201cwhat happened,\u201d and therefore recounting past events\u2014\u201can obvious substitute for live testimony,\u201d as in <em>Hammon. Ibid. </em>Thus, unlike the factual scenario in <em>Davis, </em>the witness here, in describing the earlier gun-pointing incident, was not \u201cspeaking about events as they were actually happening\u201d or \u201ccalling] for help against a bona fide physical threat.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 827,126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240 (emphasis omitted). All in all, \u201cthe primary ... purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 830, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 <em>L.Ed,.2d </em>at 242, and therefore the non-testifying witness\u2019s statement about how she was threatened with a gun was testimonial and inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><em>State v. Lopez, </em>974 So.2d 340 (Fla.2008), provides a scenario strikingly similar to the facts before us. In <em>Lopez, </em>the police were dispatched to an apartment complex where the alleged victim told one officer that the defendant had attempted to abduct him at gunpoint. <em>Id. </em>at 343. The defendant was standing twenty-five yards away in a parking lot. <em>Id. </em>at 347. The victim told another officer that the gun used in the attempted abduction was still in the victim\u2019s car. <em>Id. </em>at 343. The police searched the car and found \u201ca loaded .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver under the front passenger seat.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The police then advised the defendant of his rights and questioned him. <em>Ibid. </em>In determining that the victim\u2019s statement was testimonial, the Florida Supreme Court emphasized that the victim and his alleged abductor were separated from each other when the police arrived, the gun \u201cpresent[ed] no immediate danger\u201d because it was in the car, and the \u201c \u2018pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>mary purpose of the interrogation [was] to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347 (citing <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 822, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2274, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">On the other hand, this case is factually distinguishable from those relied on by the State in its petition. Those cases involve a witness contemporaneously identifying an armed man returning to the scene, who seemingly presents a dire threat to the public or police, <em>Arnold, supra, </em>486 F.3d at 179-80,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a witness providing information about \u201can armed assailant, who had just shot an unarmed individual in public in broad daylight,\u201d and was on the loose, <em>Ayer, supra, </em>917 A.2d at 225,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and a mortally wounded witness who provides information about the shooter, <em>Nieves</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Andino, supra, </em>872 N.E.2d at 1188-89.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Some of those cases have been decided by deeply split courts with the majority offering a questionable interpretation of <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis. </em>We need not pass on the merits of those cases because the facts before us do not address an on-the-loose gunman or a fatally wounded witness.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">To too broadly construe the definition of a nontestimonial statement for Sixth Amendment purposes would swallow the constitutional \u201cpreference for the in-court testimony of a witness,\u201d <em>J.A., supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 949 A.2d 790, and eviscerate the procedural protections provided by the Confrontation Clause. We also should proceed with caution before finding an out-of-court statement to be nontestimonial when the statement is the critical piece of evidence in an identification case. The perils of identification testimony, even when the witness is subject to robust cross-examination, have been well documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Identification was the paramount issue in this case, and yet the woman who witnessed the events was not in court to respond to the most basic questions concerning her credibility or the reliability of her observations. For example, we do not know how far the young woman was from defendant or how many other persons were on the street at the time she made her observations; the lighting conditions from her vantage point; the degree of her attentiveness; whether she had problems with her eyesight; or whether she had used alcohol or drugs, or had ulterior motives or even had a criminal record. <em>See generally State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 239-40, 536 A.2d 254 (1988) (noting factors to be considered in determining reliability of witness identification); Gary L. Wells &amp; Elizabeth <em>A. </em>Olson, <em>Eyewitness Testimony, </em>54 <em>Ann. Rev. Psychol. </em>277, 280-85 (2003) (discussing factors which relate to accuracy of eyewitness identification). We will never know the answers to those significant questions because the woman was not presented as a witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The concerns raised here are important because eyewitness testimony, even when presented in court with the complete panoply of protections afforded by due process, is far from foolproof. Indeed, \u201c[m]isidentifieation is widely recognized as the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions in this country.\u201d <em>State v. Delgado, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>48, 60, 902 A.2d 888 (2006). To open wide the door to hearsay identifications made by non-testifying witnesses might exponentially increase the likelihood of misidentifications. <em>Crawford </em>explains that the Confrontation Clause \u201creflects a judgment\u201d that the right to confront and cross-examine one\u2019s accusers is the proper method to determine the reliability of evidence. 541 <em>U.S. </em>at 61, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199. That right cannot be nullified unilaterally because the police allow a seemingly reluctant or even frightened witness to walk away.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">It is understandable why the young woman (who was courageous enough to step forward) might not want to become a State\u2019s witness in a criminal prosecution\u2014fear being one reason. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>not understandable why police officers would not take the most elemental steps to preserve evidence for a future trial. One of the great challenges facing the law enforcement community is to persuade reluctant or frightened witnesses to testify. For the most part, the police and prosecutors do all within their means to bring their witnesses to court. That did not happen here.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">A police officer is not helpless when a person, who claims to have witnessed a crime, refuses to provide her identification. Under such circumstances, the officer is empowered to take that person into custody as a material witness. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:104-1 to -9. In most instances, the mere threat of possible arrest as a material witness should produce the necessary identification. Unfortunately, the Confrontation Clause issue here comes to us for no reason other than that the police chose not to determine the witness\u2019s identity.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Condoning the practice would give a perverse incentive to the police not to obtain basic identifying information from its star witness. We cannot overlook the cost to the system of justice by the State\u2019s failure to take reasonable steps to produce the one witness whose testimony was critical to defendant\u2019s fate. Not securing the name and address of the State\u2019s key witness\u2014but using the statement of that witness to convict the accused\u2014makes hollow defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Our dissenting colleagues would remand to the trial court. <em>Infra </em>at 607, 998 A.2d at 493. However, a remand to the trial court to resolve the Confrontation Clause issue would serve little purpose at this point. Officers Ruocco and Sullivan gave their testimony in March 2006, recounting events from a year earlier\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>events that lasted minutes at most. A remand will not settle the conflict in their testimony, even if that conflict were meaningful. We must accept that they have different recollections.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The trial court found Officer Ruoeeo\u2019s testimonial credibility \u201cexcellent\u201d at the suppression hearing. Officer Ruocco\u2019s trial testimony followed closely the testimony he gave at the suppression hearing. Given that background, we can hardly expect that the trial court would call into question the credibility of Officer Ruoceo\u2019s trial testimony on the Confrontation Clause issue, or find that Officer Sullivan\u2019s more limited recollection is superior to that of Officer Ruoeco\u2019s. To the extent that the characterization of the woman\u2019s statement as testimonial or nontestimonial depends on whether one believes Officer Ruocco or Officer Sullivan, the State cannot conceivably meet its burden of establishing an exception to the Confrontation Clause. The officers\u2019 testimony, taken together (conflicts and all), leads to one inescapable conclusion\u2014the State has not met its constitutional burden. See <em>Wright, supra, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>at 816, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 652-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">At the suppression hearing, the State was content to live with Officer Ruocco\u2019s testimony, which is the basis for the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the shotgun. The State also must be content to live with his testimony as it relates to the Confrontation Clause issue. With the officers\u2019 recollections fixed, how would the trial court pick and choose between the fine distinctions in their accounts? Accepting the whole of the two officers\u2019 testimony, the State did not meet its burden of proving that the unavailable witness\u2019s statement was nontestimonial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Exceptions to constitutional rights\u2014including exceptions to the Confrontation Clause\u2014must be narrowly drawn. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Benfield, </em>593 <em>F. </em>2d 815, 821 (8th Cir.1979) (noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201c[a]ny exception [to the Confrontation Clause] should be narrow in scope and based on necessity or waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We conclude that the non-appearing witness\u2019s testimonial statement was inadmissible. The admission of the statement had the clear capacity to cause an unjust result, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, and was not harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 340, 273 A.2d 1 (1971) (\u201c[A] new trial shall be ordered if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the constitutional error contributed to the verdict.\u201d). Defendant\u2019s conviction, therefore, must be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In conclusion, we reverse the part of the judgment of the Appellate Division that suppressed defendant\u2019s verbal admission to the police on the ground that defendant was arrested without probable cause. The judgment of the Appellate Division holding that the non-appearing witness\u2019s statement implicating defendant in a crime was a testimonial statement barred by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause is affirmed by an evenly divided Court. The Appellate Division\u2019s judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and we remand to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\"> Only six members of the Court sat on this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\"> <em>Miranda v.

Four members of the Court reasoned that the police acted in response to an \"ongoing emergency\u201d and that the police officer's questions were \"reasonable efforts to assess what had happened to cause [the victim's] injuries and whether there was any continuing danger to the others in the vicinity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190. Three members of the Court found that the victim's statements implicating defendant \"were not elicited by an interrogation designed to assist [the officers] in meeting an ongoing emergency,\u201d but rather, \"to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191 (Jones, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> We note that the United States Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in <em>People v.

The record before us offers two versions of what occurred in the minutes after an anonymous 9-1-1 call was placed to the Jersey City police at about 1:00 a.m. on February 12, 2005. The caller reported a male with a shotgun at 199 Bidwell Avenue. In one version, which my colleagues accept, the police arrived soon after the 9-1-1 call and secured the scene, thereby eliminating any ongoing danger posed by a shotgun on a public street. As a result, certain statements at the time by an unidentified woman would be testimonial and thus inadmissible under <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">However, according to another version that is also based on testimony in the record, a visibly shaking woman approached two police officers immediately upon their arrival at the scene and told them defendant pointed a shotgun at her and told her to get off the corner. She also explained that defendant threw the shotgun underneath a nearby black Cadillac. During that brief discussion, the officers were with the woman, not the defendant. Only afterward did one of the officers head toward defendant and take control of him. From the moment the police arrived, one or two other males were also in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In the latter version, the woman spoke to police when both the alleged assailant and his nearby shotgun were unsecured. On a public, city street at 1:05 a.m., with two or three people other than the police near the shotgun, the shotgun and its owner presented an ongoing emergency. Accordingly, the woman\u2019s excited utterances would be nontestimonial and admissible under <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Both versions of events are based on the trial testimony of the two officers on the scene. The trial judge made no factual findings about their relevant and apparent inconsistencies for good reason: no party raised any <em>Crawford </em>question at the trial level. The issue first surfaced in defendant\u2019s reply brief to the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In reaching its decision on the <em>Crawford </em>issue, my colleagues, like the Appellate Division, found that all danger had passed by the time the woman spoke to the police. That pivotal factual finding should not be made by appellate court judges who did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>hear the live testimony presented. <em>See State v. Robinson, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>1,15, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009); <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 244, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007). Instead, this case should be remanded to the trial court to make proper findings and analyze them under <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny. To the extent my colleagues take a different approach, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Certain facts are not in dispute. An anonymous person placed a 9-1-1 call to the police and reported a male with a shotgun at 199 Bidwell Avenue in Jersey City. Officers Ruocco and Sullivan responded to the scene \u201cprobably [within] a couple of minutes\u201d of getting the call. An unidentified woman who appeared to be about eighteen or nineteen years old walked right up to Officer Ruocco, pointed at defendant, and said that defendant had \u201cpointed a shotgun at me\u201d and \u201ctold us to get off the corner.\u201d She added that defendant had thrown the shotgun underneath a nearby black Cadillac. The frightened woman, who said she lived in the area and wanted no part of any police action out of fear for her safety, refused to give her name or a formal statement and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Ruocco described the woman at the pretrial hearing as follows: \u201c[S]he was shaking a little bit. She was scared. And her tone of voice was elevated, too.\u201d At trial, Ruocco presented similar testimony: \u201cShe was shaking. She was pretty excited. She ha[d] a high tone of voice. She was scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Equipped with that information, the police then searched under the Cadillac and retrieved a shotgun. Soon after, the police transported defendant to a nearby police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Those facts provide sufficient support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the woman\u2019s statements were \u201cexcited utterances\u201d within the meaning of <em>Rule </em>803(c)(2). Defendant accepted that ruling and did not file a cross-petition challenging it.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Under <em>Rule </em>803(c)(2), (1) \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition,\u201d (2) \u201cmade while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition,\u201d and (3) \u201cwithout opportunity to deliberate or fabricate\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule. <em>State ex rel. J.A., </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>324, 340, 949 A.2d 790 (2008) (citing <em>State v. Branch, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 365, 865 A.2d 673 (2005)). To evaluate whether a statement qualifies as an \u201cexcited utterance,\u201d courts look to a number of factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">(1) the amount of time that transpired between the initial observation of the event and the subsequent declaration of the statement; (2) the circumstances of the event; (3) the mental or physical condition of the declarant; (4) the shock produced; (5) nature of the statement; and (6) whether the statement was made voluntarily or in response to a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\"><em>[Buda, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 949 A.2d 761 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In light of those factors and the record in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the woman\u2019s spontaneous comments were an excited utterance. As noted above, the record reveals that police arrived within a couple of minutes of receiving a 9-1-1 report of a male with a shotgun, that the assailant reportedly pointed the shotgun at a woman and ordered her off the corner\u2014a patently startling event\u2014and that she was still visibly shaking and scared when she approached and volunteered information to police. It is significant that only minutes passed between the initial event and the woman\u2019s spontaneous comments to police on the scene. <em>Compare J.A., supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 340-41, 949 A.2d 790 (noting that witness who followed attackers and then waited for police \u201cfor a few minutes\u201d before making statement \u201cpresumably\u201d acted \u201cwithout having had the \u2018opportunity to deliberate or fabricate\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)), <em>with Branch, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 365-66, 865 A.2d 673 (finding statements made to investigator fifteen to twenty minutes after burglary, after seven-year-old had discussed incident with her mother and another officer, were inadmissible). Moreover, the continuous presence of an unsecured, nearby shotgun presented a source of continuing stress to the woman during the intervening moments. <em>See Buda, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 297, 949 A.2d 761. Accordingly, the trial court acted well within its discretion in finding that the woman\u2019s comments constituted an excited utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The relevant facts relating to defendant\u2019s belated <em>Crawford </em>challenge are not as clear. My colleagues embrace one account. Other facts in the record are equally important and present a different version.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In particular, Officer Ruocco testified that \u201cimmediately upon arrival,\u201d an unidentified woman \u201ccame right up to me.\u201d At the time, he noticed two or three African-American males\u2014defendant and one or two others\u2014in the area of 199 Bidwell. At trial, Ruocco stated that he <em>\u201cbelieve[d]\u201d </em>that Officer Sullivan \u201cwent over to ... Mr. Basil at which time I was approached by a witness\u201d\u2014 the woman. (Emphasis added.) Six pages later in the transcript, Ruocco offered somewhat different, more definitive testimony about his partner: Sullivan \u201cwas holding Mr. Basil while I was approached by a witness.\u201d As to that critical question, my colleagues appear to rely only on Ruoeco\u2019s latter version\u2014and no other testimony in the record. <em>See ante </em>at 578-80, 597-99, 998 A.2d at 476-78, 487-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Officer Sullivan, however, provided clearer, direct testimony at trial about what he did:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Q: Can you tell us what happened when you arrived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">A: We arrived on the corner of Bidwell and MLK, and we went to\u2014about maybe twenty yards up from the corner and we saw people walking away from the cornel-. <em>A girl came out and pointed and said that\u2019s him, he\u2019s the one with the gun.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">Q: ... <em>What did you do then after that, after that statement had been model</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">A: <em>We told the male to halt </em>and come here, which he said what do you want me for, like that <em>and she said that the gun was underneath the car. So we went over to him. </em>We [brought] him over towards the car. He was about ten feet away from the car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We [brought] him over and we told him, you know, let\u2019s pat him down, and with that, P.O. Ruocco had him under control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">[(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">Sullivan next testified that another police ear arrived, and that he went to the rear of the black Cadillac and found a shotgun underneath the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>In other words, according to Sullivan, whom Ruocco credited with responsibility for controlling defendant, defendant was not restrained until (1) <em>after </em>the woman pointed him out and (2) <em>after </em>she told police that a shotgun was underneath the ear. Only then did police gain control over defendant and the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Those differences in the record matter a great deal. I agree with my colleagues that once the police had defendant and the scene under control, the danger that he would grab the shotgun and use it was over. But up until that point, the situation remained an ongoing emergency: a shotgun was loose on a public street, and someone who revealed he might use it was still unrestrained. As a result, the inconsistencies in the record are significant for purposes of a <em>Crawford </em>challenge because they mark the line between an ongoing emergency and one that has passed, between addressing a dangerous situation and relaying facts about past events. Those inconsistencies must be resolved to determine whether the witness\u2019s hearsay statements are testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">My colleagues ably describe <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny, which need not be recapped at length. In short, under <em>Crawford, </em>\u201c[testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial [may be] admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 59, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1369, <em>158 L.Ed.2d </em>at 197. In other words, if a witness does not testify at trial, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>testimonial </em>statements are barred under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause unless they were previously tested by cross-examination, even if those statements would satisfy a hearsay exception. <em>See id. </em>at 61, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199; <em>Buda, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 949 A.2d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Two years later, the Supreme Court clarified the meaning of \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d in the consolidated cases of <em>Davis v. Washington </em>and <em>Hammon v. Indiana, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>813, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). As the Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArM\"><em>[Id. </em>at 822, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2273-74, <em>165 L.Ed.2d </em>at 237.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">With those guiding principles in mind, it is essential to return to the facts in the record. When the police arrived on the scene, they knew only of a report of a male with a shotgun at 199 Bidwell Avenue. They did not know which of the two or three men gathered at that location had the weapon or where the gun was. At that moment, assuming that the 9-1-1 call was accurate\u2014as the police were required to do\u2014there was an unsecured shotgun in the vicinity of several unknown males, and someone\u2014who was both unknown and unrestrained\u2014either in possession of or near the weapon. That situation presented an ongoing emergency on a public street. Up until the time defendant was restrained or the shotgun secured, he had the capacity to retrieve the gun and use it; the mere presence of police officers at a distance would not necessarily stop a determined person from acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The victim supplied additional information. She related (1) where the gun was\u2014under a Cadillac\u2014and (2) who threw it there after pointing it at her\u2014defendant Basil, who was still nearby.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>And she gave that information to the police. Only then, according to Officer Sullivan, did the police effectively defuse the ongoing danger. They restrained defendant and retrieved the gun only after hearing the woman\u2019s statements. According to Officer Ruocco\u2019s conflicting account, Sullivan restrained defendant earlier than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">If Officer Sullivan\u2019s recollection of his own activities is correct, then it would appear that the purpose of the woman\u2019s spontaneous statements to police was to enable them to meet an ongoing threat posed by the presumably loaded shotgun and an unsecured assailant who had shown that he might use it against others. On the other hand, if Officer Ruocco\u2019s recollection of what Sullivan was doing, while Ruoeco was listening to the woman, is accurate, the danger had indeed passed and the woman\u2019s statements are more appropriately considered a description of past events for use at a later prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\"><em>Hammon </em>offers useful guidance on that dichotomy. In <em>Hammon, </em>the police arrived on the scene of a completed marital dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 819, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2272, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235. The alleged assailant, the husband, was in the kitchen; the wife was alone on the porch. <em>Ibid. </em>The presence of the police eliminated any emergency from the moment they arrived because they knew who the relevant players were and provided protection by actively separating them. <em>Id. </em>at 819-20, 830, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2272, 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235, 242. The wife\u2019s statements, under the circumstances, recounted past events and were thus testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 830, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 242. Imagine, however, if the wife had told police as they approached the house, \u201cMy husband just pointed a shotgun at me and has it with him in the kitchen.\u201d Like the woman\u2019s words in the case before us, that statement might well have been designed to defuse a pending emergency and could have been admissible under <em>Crawford. See id. </em>at 832, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2279, 165 L.Ed.2d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\"><em>United States v. Arnold, </em>486 F.3d 177 (6th Cir.2007) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 <em>U.S. </em>1103, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>871, 169 L.Ed.2d 736 (2008), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>is also instructive. In <em>Arnold, </em>a visibly shaken and upset victim told police responding to her 9-1-1 call that the defendant had threatened her with a gun and then, when the defendant returned to the scene, exclaimed, \u201cthat\u2019s him, that\u2019s the guy that pulled the gun on me\u201d and \u201che\u2019s got a gun on him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180. The Sixth Circuit found that the victim\u2019s unprompted words both before and after the defendant arrived on the scene were intended simply to get police protection from a man with a gun during a precarious, ongoing emergency. <em>Id. </em>at 190-92. The court found that the arrival of the police alone did not end the emergency. <em>Id. </em>at 190. As a result, the court concluded that the victim\u2019s excited utterances were nontestimonial and therefore admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 190-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Other state courts have addressed Confrontation Clause issues about the admissibility of victims\u2019 statements made to police, which are tied to an existing emergency. <em>See, e.g., Long v. United States, </em>940 A.2d 87, 97-98 (D.C.2007) (concluding that victim\u2019s statements to police that defendant cut his face, and exclamation \u201cThere she is,\u201d after spotting assailant, were nontestimonial because they were \u201cfrantic,\u201d \u201cthe situation was uncertain,\u201d and \u201c[v]iewed objectively, [the officerj\u2019s questions were designed to find out whether there was any continuing danger and respond to the situation with which he was confronted\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>State v. Warsame, </em>735 <em>N.W.2d </em>684, 692 (Minn.2007) (finding that statements of domestic violence victim to officer that her boyfriend had beaten her, made after victim \u201cleft her home and took to the street with injuries at a time when she was in obvious distress and when [her boyfriend] was still at large,\u201d were nontestimonial); <em>State v. Hembertt, </em>269 <em>Neb. </em>840, 696 N.W.2d 473, 483 (2005) (concluding that statements of upset, crying domestic violence victim that defendant attacked her and threatened her with knife were nontestimonial because they \u201cwere not made in anticipation of eventual prosecution, but were made to assist in securing the scene and apprehending the suspect\u201d); <em>State v. Ayer, </em>154 <em>N.H. </em>500, 917 A.2d 214, 225 (2006) (finding that inculpatory statements made to police without prompting by defendant\u2019s hysterically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>crying wife after shooting were nontestimonial because information related to \u201can armed assailant, who ... was loose, and could have remained in the immediate vicinity or could have gone elsewhere in search of other victims\u201d); <em>State v. Ohlson, </em>162 <em>Wash. </em>2d 1, 168 <em>P.3d </em>1273, 1274-75, 1281 (2007) (en banc) (finding that statements taken by police from \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cshaken up\u201d minors five minutes after defendant yelled slurs at them and nearly hit them with his car multiple times were nontestimonial because there was \u201cevery reason to believe ... that [defendant] might return\u201d and \u201csituation presented an ongoing emergency\u201d at least until officer \u201ccompleted her initial triage of the situation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Those courts \u201chave almost uniformly held that statements made to police officers responding to an emergency call for help were, at the initial stage of the encounter, not testimonial, because they were intended to help officers assess the situation and secure the scene.\u201d <em>Hembertt, supra, </em>696 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 483 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court anticipated that very outcome in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>when it observed that officers responding to an emergency \u201cneed to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to them own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim ... [which] may <em>often </em>mean that \u2018initial inquiries\u2019 produce nontestimonial statements.\u201d 547 <em>U.S. </em>at 832, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2279, 165 L.Ed.2d at 243 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In the cases discussed above, reviewing courts had the advantage of a clear record. We do not. And it is not appropriate for an appellate court to choose among differing eyewitness accounts contained in a cold transcript. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 974 A.2d 1057; <em>Elders, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 243-44, 927 A.2d 1250 (stating that in reviewing motion to suppress, \u201c[a]n appellate court \u2018should give deference to those findings of the trial judge which are substantially influenced by his opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the \u201cfeel\u201d of the ease, which a reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>court cannot enjoy.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161, 199 A.2d 809 (1964))). We did not hear the testimony of Officers Ruoceo and Sullivan; the trial court did. The trial judge is therefore in a far better position to evaluate that testimony<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and answer the pivotal questions raised by defendant\u2019s post-trial <em>Cranford, </em>challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I would therefore remand to the trial court to find the relevant facts and apply them to the principles discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">My colleagues suggest that it is too late to remand to the trial court, noting the difficulty of evaluating events more than four years after trial. <em>See ante </em>at 603-04, 998 A.2d at 491-92. Yet their remedy suggests a double-standard: they would remand for an entirely new trial, nearly five and one-half years after the events in question, even though the relevant facts appear to be in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Ideally, the issue before us should have been sorted out at trial, when memories were fresher, in response to a proper, focused objection. Instead, defendant voiced a hearsay objection to the admission of the woman\u2019s statements to the police. He relied on <em>State v. Alston, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>102, 112, 711 A.2d 363 (App.Div.1998), which held that a detective\u2019s \u201ctestimony as to the substance of an anonymous phone call was inadmissible hearsay which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>violated [defendants\u2019] Sixth Amendment right to be confronted by the witnesses against them.\u201d Defendant even specifically quoted to the trial court a passage from <em>Alston </em>decrying the hearsay nature of the testimony in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 711 A.2d 363. The trial court, however, reminded the parties that he had already found that the statement was an excited utterance\u2014and thus admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Like all hearsay objections, defendant\u2019s touched on the Confrontation Clause in that hearsay cannot be cross-examined. Defendant\u2019s two-word reference to the Confrontation Clause was offered in that context; it had nothing to do with <em>Crawford. Cf. ante </em>at 579 &amp; n. 3, 998 A.2d at 477 &amp; n. 3. In any event, objections \u201cmust be supported by the articulation of specific reasons,\u201d <em>State v. Nelson, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 250, 723 A.2d 627 (App.Div.1999) (citation omitted), and no reasons based on <em>Crawford </em>were offered until long after the trial ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">My colleagues conclude that the witness\u2019s statements were testimonial and note that reversal would be required, in any event, based on the State\u2019s failure to meet its burden of proof as to the statements\u2019 admissibility. <em>See ante </em>at 596-97, 598-99, 604-05, 998 A.2d at 487-88, 488-89, 491-92. That burden is, of course, on the State. But it elevates form over substance to entertain defendant\u2019s objection two and one-half years after trial yet not allow a judge to make a finding based on evidence already in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">I agree with my colleagues that it is far preferable to have witnesses testify in open court so that they may be subjected to cross-examination. We know from this ease, though, that the witness was visibly frightened and refused to give her name or address or get involved further because she was scared for her safety. As this Court recognized last term, \u201cthe climate of fear that prevails in some crime-infested neighborhoods [has] undermined law enforcement\u2019s ability to prosecute even murder eases.\u201d <em>State v. Byrd, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>319, 340-41, 967 A.2d 285 (2009). In such instances, we must turn to New Jersey\u2019s <em>Rules of Evidence </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>eases interpreting the Confrontation Clause to determine what, if any, portion of statements made to police by frightened witnesses may be introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">My colleagues take an additional step. They criticize the police by concluding they \u201cchose not to determine the witness\u2019s identity.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 603, 998 A2d at 491. The record does not support that view. Testimony at the suppression hearing and at trial reveals that the police attempted to get more information from the woman, and tried to get her to speak to detectives and give them a statement, but she refused to cooperate out of fear. It is unrealistic to suggest, as my colleagues do, that police should threaten visibly nervous, shaking witnesses who report violent crimes with arrest on a material witness warrant. <em>See ante </em>at 603, 998 A.2d at 491. That approach, if not used sparingly, would result in less, not more, cooperation from the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">For the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent from my colleagues\u2019 <em>Crawford </em>analysis and their rejection of the jury\u2019s verdict based on the present state of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Justices RIVERA-SOTO and HOENS join in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\"><em>For reversal in Part as to parts I, II, and IV of the </em>Opinion\u2014 Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, WALLACE, RIVERA-SOTO and HOENS\u20146.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\"><em>For affirmance in Part as to part III of the Opinion, the Court being </em>divided\u2014Justices LaVECCHIA, ALBIN and WALLACE\u2014 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\"><em>For dissent as to Part </em>III\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justices RIVERA-SOTO and HOENS\u20143.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\"> Because the Court is evenly divided on this issue, there is no majority opinion on the point, and the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling stands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\"> It appears that Sullivan was referring to the Cadillac, in that Ruocco testified that the Cadillac was approximately ten feet away from defendant. However, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>is not clear from the transcript precisely where all the principals were located with respect to one another or the Cadillac. We do not know, for example, whether defendant or the police were closer to the shotgun while defendant was free and unrestrained. That information may have been presented to the trial court and jury because, during cross-examination, Sullivan was asked to make notations on a chart and identify where the police car was parked (in the middle of the street), where defendant was standing, and where the woman came from when she approached the police. However, the chart is not part of the record on appeal, and without a clear record, it is difficult to conclude, as my colleagues do, that the danger had passed once the police arrived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> The first statement goes to the existence of an emergency, and the latter to its intensity, which was certainly heightened by the presence of a potential gunman on the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> My colleagues note that \u201c[tjhe court found Officer Ruocco\u2019s credibility \u2018to be excellent.\u2019 \u201d <em>See ante </em>579, 587, 586-87, 604, 998 A.2d at 477, 481, 481-82, 491. The trial court did so in the context of comparing Ruocco's and defendant's testimony at the suppression hearing. At no point did the trial court make a credibility finding on the difference between Ruocco's and Sullivan's trial testimony, which lies at the heart of the <em>Crawford </em>dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\"> Because defendant did not raise the <em>Crawford </em>issue at trial, review of any error at this point would be for plain error, that is, whether the error was \u201cof such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:7-5; <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Moreover, <em>Crawford </em>implicates constitutional questions under the Confrontation Clause, so the appropriate plain error analysis would address whether any constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>J.A., </em>supra, 195 <em>N.J. </em>at 351, 949 A.2d 790; <em>State v.
