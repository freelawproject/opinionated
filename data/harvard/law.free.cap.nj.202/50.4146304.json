The tenure charges were filed based on the accusations of C.W., a former student of Young\u2019s, who claimed that he and Young engaged in sexual activity on two occasions. Prior to the District having filed the tenure case, the Department of Children and Families (DCF) made an independent determination that the charges were unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">On this appeal we are asked to interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a to determine whether it precludes a school district from taking disciplinary action against a teacher after DCF has found that a complaint of child abuse or neglect against that teacher is unfounded. We hold that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a does not bar the later institution of disciplinary charges against a teacher where DCF has investigated and declared allegations of child abuse unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Gilbert Young, Jr. was a certified and tenured teacher in the School District of the Borough of Roselle, Union County (District). On February 15, 2007, a former student of Young\u2019s, C.W., was visiting the high school nurse in her office and told the nurse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>about an alleged sexual incident with Young. After school officials were contacted, the police were notified and responded to the school. C.W. gave a preliminary statement to the police. The accusation related to events occurring during the 2004-2005 school year, although at the time of the investigation, C.W. stated to the police that the timeframe of the alleged abuse was in January or February 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">On February 15, 2007, C.W.\u2019s vice-principal called DCF to inform the agency about C.W.\u2019s accusations against Young. DCF began its investigation of the charges of sexual abuse, interviewing, among other witnesses, C.W., his mother and Young. On May 9, 2007, DCF issued a written report finding C.W.\u2019s allegations to be unfounded, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Sexual Abuse/Sexual Penetration was unfounded regarding the actions of the Teacher Gilbert Young, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. [C.W,] sustained no injuries as a result of this incident. Although [C.W.] reported that he and Mr. Young engaged in sexual genital contact on one occasion, there was not enough information gathered to corroborate the allegations. The actions of Gilbert Young placed [C.W.] at no risk of harm and were not to the degree required by statu[t]e to find sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">On October 11, 2007, the District filed tenure charges against Young with the Department of Education, Bureau of Controversies and Disputes (Department) under the Tenure Employees Hearing Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-10 to -18.1. The charges sought to remove Young from his employment as a tenured teacher for \u201cunbecoming conduct or other just cause.\u201d The two charges were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">Charge I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">In or about December 2004 or January 2005, Young drove C.W. home after school on a couple of occasions. On one such trip, Young drove C.W. to Warinanco Park instead of bringing him home. It was dark at the time. Young turned off the motor and kissed C.W., putting his tongue in his mouth. He also caressed and touched his body, including his genitals, over his clothing. After 15 or 20 minutes, Young drove C.W. to a location near C.W.\u2019s house and dropped him off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The foregoing conduct by Young constitutes conduct unbecoming a teaching staff member and/or other just cause for dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">Charge II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">In or about January or February 2005, C.W. was staying at his grandmother\u2019s home in Irvington, New Jersey for a weekend visit. Young telephoned at approximately 5:30 a.m. and informed C.W. that he would pick him up in front of the house. Shortly thereafter, Young arrived and C.W. left with him in Young\u2019s vehicle. After stopping at a CVS store in Roselle to pick up a prescription for Young\u2019s daughter, they proceeded to the daughter\u2019s house to drop it off, and then to the Linden Motor Inn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">After checking in, Young parked the car and he and C.W. entered a room at the Inn. Shortly thereafter, Young and C.W. disrobed and started Idssing. They eventually engaged in oral and anal sex. Later, Young drove C.W. back to his grandmother\u2019s house. The foregoing conduct by Young constitutes conduct unbecoming a teaching staff member and/or other just cause for dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">On October 25, 2007, Young filed an answer, denying the charges and asserting affirmative defenses. The Department then transmitted this matter to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL), where it was filed on October 29, 2007, for hearing as a contested ease pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-11 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(b). Prior to the hearing, Young filed a motion to dismiss all charges pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a. He claimed that the complaint investigated by DCF, which was determined to be unfounded, precluded the District from bringing tenure charges predicated upon the same allegations. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) reserved decision on the motion until the completion of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">At the hearing, the following testimony was adduced regarding the first charge. Young first met C.W. in January of 2002 when C.W. entered the District as a seventh grader and was assigned to Young\u2019s mathematics class. Young testified that later that school year, he referred C.W. to the Pupil Assistance Committee (PAC), comprised of several school staff members, to assist C.W. with academic and behavioral issues. During the PAC\u2019s meeting with C.W., Young brought C.W. into the hallway, at which point C.W. told Young that he was a homosexual and that he was engaged in internet communications with an older male. Young encouraged C.W. to share this information with the entire PAC and C.W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>complied. C.W.\u2019s biological parents attended the next PAC meeting. C.W.\u2019s mother told the PAC that her concern was how to improve C.W.\u2019s academic performance; as such, Young volunteered to tutor C.W. after school. C.W. participated in Young\u2019s tutoring group through the end of the 2001-2002 school year. Young also testified that the following school year C.W. entered the eighth grade, which was housed two blocks away, and he continued to attend tutoring sessions with Young. During the 2004-2005 school year, when C.W. was in tenth grade, he continued to visit Young in his classroom after school a few times a week. C.W. would usually do his homework and then walk home.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On October 22, 2004, C.W. left a handwritten note for Young that stated \u201cI love you daddy\u201d and had X\u2019s and O\u2019s written on it. Young conferred with a colleague and decided not to report the note to school administrators or to C.W.\u2019s parents. Young informed C.W. that the note was inappropriate and told him not to give him a similar note again. However, on November 5, 2004, C.W. wrote Young a similar note that also expressed his love. Young did not report the note, and again told C.W. that the note was inappropriate and to stop writing such notes. C.W. denied that Young told him not to give him notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Also during the fall of 2004, C.W. called Young and sent him text messages. Young explained that he gave his cell phone number to students whom he tutored in case they needed to be let into the school building because the tutoring sessions were held after regular school hours and the door to the school was at times locked. However, Young testified that he did not give his phone number to C.W.; rather, C.W. obtained the number on an occasion when Young left the classroom and left his cell phone on the desk. C.W. called Young and told him how he obtained the phone number; Young responded by telling C.W. not to call him again. However, during the fall of 2004, C.W. called Young and told him that he had just gotten out of the shower and had a towel wrapped around him. Young did not report that phone conversation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>school officials. Young also received two or three text messages from C.W. that he did not report.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Whether at the request of C.W.\u2019s mother, as Young claimed, or of C.W. himself, as C.W. claimed, Young drove C.W. home from tutoring on several occasions. C.W. claimed that in or about December 2004, during one of the rides, Young drove C.W. into Warinanco Park, parked his vehicle and began groping C.W. by placing his hands on C.W.\u2019s genitalia over C.W.\u2019s clothing. Young then turned C.W.\u2019s face towards him and kissed C.W. Young denied the incident ever occurred. Young claimed that he stopped tutoring C.W. in November 2004 because C.W. no longer came to see him and that the last time he drove C.W. home was in November 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The facts that comprise the second charge against Young are similarly in dispute. Young testified that on December 31, 2004, he was at church and received a call from his daughter asking him to pick up medicine for her son. After locking the church, Young left and went home. Upon arriving home, Young made telephone calls, including one to his daughter. Around 2:00 a.m., Young was on his way to the CVS pharmacy when he received a phone call from C.W. asking for a ride to his grandmother\u2019s house. Young refused and told C.W. that he was on his way to the CVS pharmacy to pick up a prescription for his daughter. Young returned home, made additional phone calls, and went to bed around 3:30 a.m. Young\u2019s daughter, NaTia, called Young around 6:15 a.m. to tell him that his two nephews had a fight and that one of the nephews hit NaTia in her face. Young went to NaTia\u2019s apartment and when he arrived around 6:45 a.m., the police were already there.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Young testified that NaTia was upset and had been crying. Young took NaTia to the Linden Motor Inn, which was less than a mile from NaTia\u2019s apartment, so that she could rest and not be concerned about his nephew showing up. Young explained that he was concerned for NaTia\u2019s safety, even though his nephew inadvertently hit NaTia and she was not bruised. Young did not want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>to bring NaTia to his house because Young\u2019s nephew would often sleep in his attic; however, the nephew did not have a key to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Young testified that as he was pulling into the driveway of the Linden Motor Inn his cell phone rang and it was C.W. asking for a ride. Young responded, \u201cLook boy, I am at the Linden Motor Inn in a crisis with my daughter I don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d and hung up the phone. Young then filled out registration cards that said the check-in time was 7:10 a.m., and paid for a two-hour stay. While NaTia remained at the motel, Young went to pick up his grandchildren from NaTia\u2019s neighbor. Young then picked up NaTia around 9:00 a.m. and took her back to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Young\u2019s telephone records showed several calls made and received during the early-morning hours of January 1, 2005. Young claimed that the call he received at 2:02 a.m. was from C.W. asking for a ride while Young was on his way to a CVS pharmacy. According to Young, the call at 6:17 a.m., which appeared on the bill as \u201cincoming\u201d with no telephone number designated, came from his daughter, who was calling about the altercation. He claimed that the call at 7:06 a.m., which again appeared only as \u201cincoming\u201d with no telephone number designated, came from C.W. again asking for a ride. The phone records also showed that between 7:06 a.m. and 8:59 a.m., Young neither made nor received any calls. Young stated that after he received the telephone call from C.W. while pulling into the motel, he never again received a telephone call or text message from C.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">NaTia testified about the events of the night of December 31, 2004, and the early-morning hours of January 1, 2005. She corroborated Young\u2019s statements about her calling Young to pick up a prescription, the altercation between Young\u2019s nephews and her being inadvertently hit, Young\u2019s coming to her home around the time the police were there, dropping her children off at her neighbor\u2019s, going to the motel, and Young\u2019s receiving a call en route to the motel. NaTia\u2019s neighbor also testified that in the early hours of January 1, 2005, NaTia, who was crying, dropped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>her children off with her and Young picked the children up later that same morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">C.W. testified to a very different set of events that occurred on January 1, 2005. C.W. testified that on December 31, 2004, he had been out with his father and his father dropped him off at his grandmother\u2019s house in Irvington around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. C.W. said he called Young around 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. and that Young, who had just arrived home from church, agreed to call C.W. back. Pursuant to a later conversation between the two that morning, Young drove to C.W.\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house around 6:00 a.m. and picked up C.W. Young then drove to a CVS drug store in Roselle, where he got medication for his daughter. He then drove to his home and went inside, while C.W. remained in the car. About five minutes later, they drove to Young\u2019s daughter\u2019s apartment. C.W. described the location of both Young\u2019s and his daughter\u2019s residences. C.W. testified that once they arrived at Young\u2019s daughter\u2019s apartment he stayed in the ear, and Young brought the medicine inside. About five minutes later, Young returned and they drove to the Linden Motor Inn. Young cheeked in and then the two entered a room on the first floor. While there, Young performed oral and anal sex on C.W., which C.W. claims he initially resisted but after Young would not let go, he did not resist further. C.W. then informed Young that he wanted to go home, after which Young got dressed and returned C.W. to his grandmother\u2019s house in Irvington. After that event, C.W. testified that he did not have any further contact with Young, except one time when C.W. saw Young while he was visiting the high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">At the hearing, a detective from the Roselle Police Department testified that because C.W. initially could not remember the name of the motel, on February 21, 2007, officers made a surprise visit to C.W.\u2019s high school and took C.W. out of class and asked him to lead them to the motel. C.W. then directed them to the Linden Motor Inn, which was located about two or three miles from Roselle. Although C.W. did not know the name of the motel, he knew where it was located. When the officers pulled into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>motel driveway, C.W. directed them to the back parking lot. He then pointed to a room on the first floor where the alleged incident occurred. The officer noted that the entry into the room was from the outside of the building. The police then procured a receipt signed by Young for Room 106 from 7:10 to 9:10 a.m., on January 1, 2005. The police later confirmed that the license plate number on the receipt matched Young\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">As a preliminary matter, the ALJ found \u201cthat <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a did not inhibit the District from bringing tenure charges for unbecoming conduct and other just cause\u201d because \u201cnothing in the statute precludes charges separate and apart from \u2018child abuse or neglect\u2019 as the basis for tenure charges.\u201d Additionally, the ALJ determined that the District did not rely on the DCF investigation at the hearing but \u201cproduced its own witnesses and documents in support of its charges, focusing on the conduct of [Young], which had a tendency to destroy public respect and confidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The ALJ also made credibility assessments, finding the testimony of C.W. to be \u201ccredible and compelling\u201d as he \u201cwas clear and straightforward in recounting the events involved [and] had nothing to gain by his testimony and no evidence of ill will or ill motive was presented.\u201d The ALJ also found the investigating detective to be \u201ccompelling and credible.\u201d In contrast, the ALJ considered Young \u201clacking in credibility\u201d for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">His accounts of disclosing his trips to C.W., one to the CVS pharmacy and the other to the Linden Motor Inn, were totally incredulous. His daughter\u2019s testimony was similarly not believable in light of the several inconsistencies between her testimony and his. Both claimed it was his or her own idea for her to go to a motel, they were at odds about when she was to be picked up at the motel, and she could not recall the exterior of the motel, when, according to her, the events leading her to the motel were traumatic. Equally incredulous was that [Young], who only lived a short distance from his daughter\u2019s apartment, took his daughter to a motel rather than to his house, because of \u201cconcerns\u201d about his nephew, E.C., who had accidentally hit his daughter and who had no key or other access to [Young\u2019s] home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">Of compelling importance was the lack of testimony from the police officer who was present at NaTia Young\u2019s apartment during the early-morning hours of January 1, 2005. NaTia Young claimed that he arrived at the same time as [Young], [Young] also claimed that while he was there, he spoke with the officer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Yet that officer never testified to corroborate [Young\u2019s] presence at the apartment, nor was anything mentioned in his police report about [Young\u2019s] presence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The ALJ concluded that the District met its burden on the charges of conduct unbecoming and other just cause, and that although Young was not prosecuted criminally and the allegations of sexual abuse/sexual penetration were not substantiated by DCF, his \u201cactions were violative of the trust placed in him as a teacher. His conduct, both in the park and at the motel, was not the \u2018high degree of exemplary behavior\u2019 expected of him [(internal citation omitted)].\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ recommended that Young be removed from his teaching position.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The Commissioner of Education (Commissioner) adopted the ALJ\u2019s decision, sustaining the tenure charges and terminating Young\u2019s employment. In doing so, the Commissioner responded in detail and rejected all of Young\u2019s exceptions that challenged the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations as arbitrary, capricious and not based on substantial evidence, and asserted that the District did not carry its burden to prove the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Additionally, the Commissioner rejected Young\u2019s statutory preclusion challenge, noting that no action was taken against Young as a result of the DCF investigation and that the tenure case was based on facts generated by an independent police investigation that was more thorough than the DCF investigation and on information collected by the Roselle Board of Education (Board) in anticipation of tenure charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">The Appellate Division affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s final determination, also finding that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a did not preclude the filing of tenure charges in this matter; that \u201cthere was substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings\u201d; and that there was \u201cno improper shifting of the burden of proof or other legal error that would justify disturbing the agency\u2019s determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">We granted Young\u2019s petition for certification, 201 <em>N.J. </em>145, 988 A.2d 565 (2009), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">At the heart of this case is Young\u2019s claim that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a requires the dismissal of the tenure charges against him. To resolve that question of interpretation, some basic principles come into play. When interpreting a statute, our main objective is to further the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Bosland v. Warnock Dodge, Inc., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>543, 553, 964 A.2d 741 (2009) (citing <em>D'Annunzio v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>110, 119, 927 A.2d 113 (2007); <em>Daidone v. Buterick Bulkheading, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>557, 565, 924 A.2d 1193 (2007)). To discern the Legislature\u2019s intent, courts first turn to the plain language of the statute in question. <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005) (citing <em>Lozano v. Frank DeLuca Constr., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>513, 522, 842 A.2d 156 (2004)). In reading statutory language, courts will give words their ordinary meaning absent any direction from the Legislature to the contrary. <em>Serv. Armament Co. v. Hyland, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>550, 556, 362 A.2d 13 (1976) (citing <em>Safeway Trails, Inc. v. Furman, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>467, 487, 197 A.2d 366 (1964)). \u201cIf the plain language leads to a clear and unambiguous result, then [the] interpretive process is over.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>189, 195, 927 A.2d 543 (2007) (citing <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Where the plain meaning does not point to a \u201cclear and unambiguous result,\u201d the court then considers extrinsic evidence from which it may glean the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Bedford v. Riello, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>210, 222, 948 A.2d 1272 (2008) (citing <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492-93, 874 A.2d 1039). Included within the extrinsic evidence rubric are legislative history and statutory context, which may shed light on the drafters\u2019 motives. <em>Aponte-Correa v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>318, 323, 744 A.2d 175 (2000) (citing <em>Twp. of Pennsauken v. Schad, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>156, 170, 733 A.2d 1159 (1999)). Likewise, interpretations of the statute and cognate enactments by agencies empowered to enforce them are given substantial deference in the context of statutory interpretation. <em>Matturri v. Bd. of Trs., Judicial Ret. Sys., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>368, 381, 802 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>A.2d 496 (2002) (citing <em>R &amp; R Mktg., LLC v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>170, 175, 729 A.2d 1 (1999)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">Even when the language of the statute is ambiguous and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah9\">the Legislature has not addressed the precise question of statutory meaning, [we]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">may not simply impose [our] own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 381-82, 802 A.2d 496 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Kasper v.

Blair, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>330, 338, 288 A.2d 855 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">An overview of the statutes that cover DCF investigations and tenure charges and how those statutes relate to one another is instructive. New Jersey mandates reporting suspected child abuse to DCF. <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.10 (\u201cAny person having reasonable cause to believe that a child has been subjected to child abuse or acts of child abuse shall report the same immediately to the Division of Youth and Family Services by telephone or otherwise.\u201d). A teacher constitutes a \u201cparent or guardian\u201d under Title 9. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(a). According to <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21(c), an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d is defined in pertinent part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">A child less than 18 years of age whose parent or guardian, as herein defined, (1) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon such child physical injury by other than accidental means which causes or creates a substantial risk of ... protracted impairment of physical or emotional health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ; ... (3) commits or allows to be committed an act of sexual abuse against the child; (4) or a child whose physical, mental, or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of being impaired as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>result of the failure of his parent or guardian, as herein defined, to exercise a minimum degree of care____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">DCF\u2019s statutory obligation \u201c[u]pon receipt of any such report\u201d of abuse or neglect is to take immediate action \u201cto insure the safety of the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11. In other words, quickly removing the child from harm\u2019s way is a particular focus of the statute. Part and parcel of DCF\u2019s charge is to \u201cinitiate an investigation within [twenty-four] hours\u201d and report to the child abuse registry within seventy-two hours. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11. First, DCF conducts an initial investigation to determine if a formal investigation is necessary. The standards for evidence collection are set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-2.4 to -2.5. At that initial stage there are two possible findings: substantiated or unfounded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201cSubstantiated\u201d means a finding when the available information, as evaluated by the child protective investigator, indicates by a preponderance of the evidence that a child is an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:133-1.3 because the alleged child victim has been harmed or placed at risk of harm by a parent or guardian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cUnfounded\u201d means a finding when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">i. There is not a preponderance of evidence that the alleged child victim was harmed or placed at substantial risk of harm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">ii. There is not a preponderance of evidence indicating that a parent or guardian and child were involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">A formal investigation must be commenced unless the \u201cchild protective investigator\u201d makes a finding of \u201cunfounded at the conclusion of the initial investigation.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-2.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">If the alleged abuse or neglect is committed by a tenured school employee, whether or not in connection with his official duties, that conduct might also cause a school board to commence disciplinary action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">No person shall be dismissed or reduced in compensation, (a) if he is or shall be under tenure of office, position or employment during good behavior and efficiency in the public school system of the state, ... except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct, or other just cause, and then only after a hearing held pursuant to this subartiele, ... after a written charge or charges, of the cause or causes of complaint....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-10. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-5 (stating that a tenured school employee \u201cshall not be dismissed or reduced in compensation except for inefficiency, incapacity, or conduct unbecoming such a teaching staff member or other just cause\u201d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Unbecoming conduct involves a different standard than the Title 9 abuse-or-negleet standard and has been defined as conduct \u201cwhich has a tendency to destroy public respect for [government] employees and confidence in the operation of [public] services.\u201d <em>Karins v. City of Atl. City, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>532, 554, 706 A.2d 706 (1998) (citation omitted). Unbecoming conduct may include \u201cany conduct which adversely affects the morale or efficiency of the [department.]\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). The touchstone of the determination lies in the certificate holder\u2019s \u201cfitness to discharge the duties and functions of one\u2019s office or position.\u201d <em>In re Grossman, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 29, 316 A.2d 39 (App.Div.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Title 18A mandates official actions and proceedings that provide employees significantly more rights and protections than do Title 9 initial investigations. A district initiates charges by filing a written statement of evidence under oath. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-11; <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:3-5.1. A majority of the board must vote within forty-five days on whether there is probable cause to credit the evidence, and if credited, whether such charge is sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction of salary. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A6-11 to - 13. An employee has fifteen days to submit a written response and if the Commissioner determines the charge is sufficient to warrant dismissal, the case is referred to the OAL within ten days. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Because of the due process concerns that inform tenure proceedings, the urgency that is built into DCF\u2019s investigation is absent. That is because the DCF process is focused on the safety of the child, whereas the tenure action concentrates on the conduct of the employee. Indeed, in a tenure ease it is the employee\u2019s inefficiency, incapacity or misconduct that is at the heart of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">With that as a backdrop, we turn to the words of the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">When a complaint made against a school employee alleging child abuse or neglect is investigated by the Department of Children and Families, the department shall notify the school distinct and the employee of its findings. Upon receipt of a finding by the department that such a complaint is unfounded, the school district shall remove any references to the complaint and investigation by the department from the employee\u2019s personnel records. A complaint made against a school employee that has been classified as unfounded by the department shall not be used against the employee for any purpose relating to employment, including but not limited to, discipline, salary, promotion, transfer, demotion, retention or continuance of employment, termination of employment or any right or privilege relating to employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">According to Young, the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d refers to the substance of the accusation itself, which may not be used against an employee in further disciplinary proceedings. The District and the Commissioner counter that \u201ccomplaint\u201d is a reference to the school official\u2019s mandatory report to the DCF, and that that is distinct from the police investigation and the separate compilation of evidence in support of tenure charges, which are \u201cseparate causes of action, pursuant to separate legal authority, and effectuated by separate proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The parties\u2019 dueling interpretations regarding whether \u201ccomplaint\u201d refers to the underlying allegations, as Young asserts, or to the actual complaint made to DCF regarding alleged child abuse and neglect, as the District and the Commissioner claim, fairly demonstrate an ambiguity in the plain language of the statute; indeed, on its face, it can be read either way.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Thus we turn to the legislative history surrounding the enactment of the statute in 1995. The Senate Education Committee\u2019s statement to the proposed legislation said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">The bill provides that when a complaint made against a school employee alleging child abuse or neglect is investigated by the Division of Youth and Family Services, the division shall notify the school district and the employee of its findings. If the division\u2019s finding is that the complaint is unfounded, the school district <em>must </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>remove any references to the complaint and the investigation from the employee\u2019s personnel records, and the complaint may not be used against the employee for any purpose relating to employment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">[S. <em>Educ. Comm. Statement to Assemb., No. 510, </em>206th Leg. (N.J. 1994) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Although that sparse history suggests, to some extent, an intent to remove physical references to a DCF complaint from a school employee\u2019s file, it does not resolve the ambiguities surrounding the use of the term \u201ccomplaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">We return then to basic principles of statutory interpretation and, in particular, the great deference we accord to the administrative agencies charged with enforcing particular legislation. <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 436-37, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992). Indeed the agency\u2019s construction is a substantial factor to be considered in divining the meaning to be ascribed to a statute. <em>Smith v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 25-26, 527 A.2d 843 (1987); <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. &amp; Energy v. Gloucester, </em>866 <em>F.Supp. </em>826, 832 (D.N.J.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Here, the agency has weighed in on the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a and declared that it does not bar subsequent tenure charges where DCF has concluded that an abuse complaint is unfounded. Because the statute is ambiguous as to the issue presented, \u201cthe question for the [C]ourt is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Kasper, supra, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>at 581, 754 A.2d 525 (citation omitted). Here, the Commissioner found that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoM\">statute requires that no action be taken against a school employee on the basis of a complaint or abuse made to the DCF if that agency determines that the complaint is unfounded. It also mandates that in the case of a DCF finding of \u201cunfounded,\u201d all reference to the DCF complaint and investigation be removed from the employee\u2019s file. In the present case, no action was taken against respondent as a result of the DCF investigation and apparently no reference to it remains in respondent\u2019s file. Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a has been satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">We conclude that that is a permissible construction of the statute and thus concur with the Appellate Division that the Commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>er properly determined that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a did not preclude the filing of tenure charges in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Here, DCF\u2019s investigation determined, at least in part, that because C.W. \u201csustained no injuries\u201d and was not placed \u201cat risk of harm\u201d that Young\u2019s behavior did not meet the statutory definition of abuse or neglect. Had nothing further occurred, Young was entitled to have his record scrubbed of any reference to the unfounded accusation and that accusation could not be used against him for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">However, that did not bar the District, in cooperation with the police, from conducting a full independent investigation that uncovered additional evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that supported the filing of tenure charges based on conduct unbecoming a teacher. That exercise of the District\u2019s supervisory power over a school employee was entirely unremarkable. <em>See Karins, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 554, 706 A.2d 706; <em>In re Grossman, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 316 A.2d 39. Indeed, it would be anomalous to hamstring the District solely because of a less than complete investigation by DCF or one whose focus was different from the focus in a tenure case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Furthermore, an interpretation of a statute should not lead to an absurd result. <em>Schad, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 170, 733 A.2d 1159. Young\u2019s assertion that <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-7a bars the District from initiating any disciplinary action after DCF issued an investigative determination of \u201cunfounded\u201d would effectively prohibit school districts from disciplining a teacher for unbecoming conduct merely because it did not rise to the level of abuse or neglect under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">For example, DCF might conclude that sexual contact between a student and his former teacher does not constitute abuse or neglect under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21c because of the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the student or because the formal student-teacher relationship had passed. That is a far cry from suggesting that it is not conduct unbecoming a school employee. <em>See, e.g., In re Ivan Piedra, </em>Agency Dkt. No. 0708-176, <em>Exam\u2019rs, </em>(March 31, 2009) (revoking teacher\u2019s certificates and finding that \u201cacts of engaging in a sexual relationship with a student, regardless of [the student\u2019s] age, are inexcusable\u201d). Yet, Young\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a would bar a school district from investigating such a claim and from disciplining a teacher simply because its report of suspected abuse to DCF was ultimately declared unfounded under the statute DCF is charged with enforcing. We do not consider that interpretation a reasonable one. Indeed it is inconceivable to us that the legislature intended that a school district with overwhelming evidence of sexual wrongdoing on the part of a teacher, developed after its own investigation, would be powerless to act because DCF found no violation of the abuse and neglect statute. Rather, we agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s contrary conclusion that the Commissioner\u2019s construction of the statute is a permissible one entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">VIL</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We finally consider Young\u2019s claim that the decision of the Commissioner was not based on substantial credible evidence in the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Generally, an appellate court does not substitute its judgment of the facts for that of an administrative agency. <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int'l, Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 587, 538 A.2d 794 (1988). In reviewing administrative adjudications, an appellate court must undertake a \u201ccareful and principled consideration of the agency record and findings.\u201d <em>Riverside Gen. Hosp. v. N.J. Hosp. Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>458, 468, 487 A.2d 714 (1985). \u201cIf the Appellate Division is satisfied after its review that the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom support the agency head\u2019s decision, then it must affirm even if the court feels that it would have reached a different result itself.\u201d <em>Clowes, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 538 A.2d 794.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">Stated differently, if the agency\u2019s finding \u201c \u2018is clearly a mistaken one and so plainly unwarranted that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction, then, and only then, [the appellate court] should appraise the record as if it were deciding the matter at inception and make its own findings and conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)). In the same vein, the choice of accepting or rejecting testimony from witnesses resides with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>administrative agency, and so long as that choice is reasonably made it is accorded deference on appeal. <em>Renan Realty Corp. v. State Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, Bureau of Hous. Inspection, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>415, 421, 442 A.2d 614 (App.Div.1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\"><em>[Campbell v. N.J. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>579, 587-88, 781 A.2d 1035 (2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Young challenges the agency\u2019s credibility assessments and findings, contending it ignored the significance of some facts and gave improper weight to others. For example, Young believes that the evidence supports his credibility and discredits C.W.\u2019s, and that a finding to the contrary was clearly mistaken. Young also contends that the Commissioner improperly shifted the burden of proof to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">We find those arguments unpersuasive. As the Commissioner declared, and the Appellate Division noted, the ALJ had the \u201copportunity to observe C.W. and [Young] at the OAL hearing. He was able to make determinations about the viability of each witness\u2019s testimony and about both the overall internal consistency of witness testimony, and its consistency with <em>all </em>of the evidence presented at the hearing.\u201d We are satisfied, as was the Appellate Division, that there was substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and likewise \u201cdiscern no improper shifting of the burden of proof or other legal error that would justify disturbing the agency\u2019s determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-11\"> The prosecutor's office declined to prosecute Young because at the time of the alleged sexual incident C.W. was sixteen years old and Young was not currently his teacher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-10\"> After DCF determined the allegations were unfounded, the District forwarded the DCF investigator receipts from the motel where the alleged sexual incident occurred, which DCF did not have during its investigation; however, the investigator declined to re-open the investigation of Young.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b93-13\">Justice RIVERA-SOTO,</author>\n<p id=\"Aal\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">This case presents a horrifying, revolting factual setting: a teacher\u2014a professional entrusted with the well-being of students-preyed on a student for sexual gratification. Yet, particularly in light of the gruesome nature of these charges, our role as judges demands that it be irrelevant whether it is personally gratifying to sustain Gilbert Young\u2019s removal as a teacher, or personally abhorrent to retain him in that position of trust. In this case, the Court\u2019s task is to interpret faithfully and with fidelity a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>duly adopted by the Legislature. If that statute is clearly written, we are obliged to enforce it as written. <em>State v. Gandhi, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>161, 177, 989 A.2d 256 (2010) (\u201c \u2018If the plain language leads to a clear and unambiguous result, then our interpretive process is over.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Richardson v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>189, 195, 927 A.2d 543 (2007) (citation omitted))); <em>Patel v. NJ Motor Vehicle Comm\u2019n, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>413, 419, 982 A.2d 445 (2009) (same); <em>Klumb v. Bd. of Educ. of Manalapan-Englishtown Reg\u2019l High Sell. Dist., Monmouth County, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>14, 24, 970 A.2d 354 (2009) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The statute at issue is clear, unequivocal, and leads to an unambiguous result. It provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\"><em>[a] complaint </em>[alleging child abuse or neglect] made against a school employee <em>that has been classified as unfounded </em>by the [Department of Children and Families] <em>shall not be used against the employee foe- any pmpose relating to employment, </em>including but not limited to, <em>discipline, </em>salary, promotion, transfer, demotion, retention or continuance of employment, <em>termination of employment or any right or privilege relating to employment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\"><em>IN.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The meaning of that plain language cannot be the subject of dispute: regardless of the wisdom of the legislative choice, the Legislature has made the self-evident judgment that a child abuse or neglect complaint against a school employee classified as \u201cunfounded\u201d cannot\u2014in the statute\u2019s mandatory language, <em>shall </em>not\u2014 be used to discipline a school employee. And, obviously, what the Legislature has decreed cannot be done affirmatively certainly cannot be done indirectly. Yet, that is precisely the result condoned by the majority. By cloaking the disciplinary charges as \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d when the charges are firmly and exclusively rooted in the original but declared-unfounded child abuse or neglect complaint, the Court has permitted that which the Legislature explicitly forbade, thus rendering that statute utterly superfluous and meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">It is uncontested that a complaint alleging child abuse or neglect was made against Young. It is also uncontested that the Department of Children and Families classified that complaint as \u201cun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>founded.\u201d The only question remaining, then, is whether that complaint and/or the facts giving rise to it<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> can be used to support disciplinary action against a teacher or whether, as unequivocally mandated by the Legislature, that complaint \u201cshall not be used against the employee for any purpose relating to employment, including but not limited to, discipline, ... termination of employment, or any right or privilege relating to employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Seeking to avoid the inevitable, the majority struggles mightily to proclaim an ambiguity in the statute. Yet, this statute is plainly written; there is no ambiguity in it. The only obstacle to its enforcement according to its explicit terms is an understandable disquiet in the result mandated by the direct application of this straightforward and unambiguous statute, a disquiet I too share.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">That said, it is not this Court\u2019s task to decide whether a statute duly adopted by the Legislature is wise. If plainly written, it is this Court\u2019s obligation to enforce a statute\u2014any statute\u2014as the Legislature has written it. Regardless of how unpalatable the result, the statute before us is clear, unequivocal and unambigu-</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ous. Therefore, in the circumstances presented in this case, our obligation is and remains clear: the statute should be enforced as written, and its correction should be left to the Legislature, the body that created it. Said again: if the plain words of a statute fail to achieve the Legislature\u2019s goals, it is for that branch of government to fix its own mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LONG, LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, WALLACE and HOENS\u20146.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014RIVERA-SOTO\u20141.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\"> Any attempt to differentiate between a complaint and the facts giving rise to a complaint is utter sophistry; a complaint without facts is meaningless. <em>See, e.g., R. </em>4:5-2 (requiring that any \u201cpleading ... shall contain a statement of the facts on which the claim is based\u201d); <em>see also Spring Motors Distribs., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. 22, </em>29-30, 465 A.2d 530 (App.Div.1983) (holding that, \"[t]o be adequate, a [complaint] must contain a statement of facts on which a claim is based, showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u201d), <em>affd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>555, 489 A.2d 660 (1985). That, however, should not end the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Due respect for the statute's plain language does not leave the school district powerless. If the allegations of the unfounded complaint nevertheless were sufficient to sustain Young's prosecution, the proper course was simple: a referral should have been made to the local investigative and prosecution authorities, and an ensuing independently secured conviction\u2014an event entirely independent of the earlier unfounded abuse and neglect complaint\u2014more than sufficiently supports tenure charges. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-10 (authorizing discipline of tenured teacher for \u201cjust cause\u201d). That is the proper remedy here, one that avoids neutering the clear provisions of this statute by relegating it to the immaterial status of a record-purging device.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-14\"> The tenure charges against Young should have been foreclosed by the application of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a.
