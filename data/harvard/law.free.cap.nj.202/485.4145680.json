Defendant spoke no English, and the police had no reason to believe that he did. Yet in a good faith, but surreal, effort to inform defendant of the consequences of refusing to submit to a breath test, a police officer read aloud a detailed, eleven-paragraph, standard statement\u2014all in English. When defendant confirmed in Spanish that he did not understand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the bizarre encounter continued as the officer read yet another two paragraphs in English to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The police later candidly acknowledged that defendant did not understand what was read to him. Defendant was nonetheless convicted of refusing to submit to a breath test both in municipal court and on de novo review at the trial court, and his conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We now address the interplay between the two relevant statutes involved in this appeal: (1) the implied consent law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2, which (a) provides that by taking to the State\u2019s roadways, drivers impliedly consent to submit to a breath test to measure the level of alcohol in their blood, and (b) further requires that they be informed of the consequences of refusing to submit to such a test; and (2) the refusal statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a, which provides penalties for arrested motorists who refuse to submit to that test. Because we find that the statutes require proof that law enforcement officials <em>inform </em>motorists of the consequences of refusal by conveying information in a language the person speaks or understands, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We defer to the Attorney General and the chief administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) to determine how law enforcement can best comply with the requirements of the statutes. In that regard, we acknowledge and encourage the initiative begun by the Attorney General to translate the standard statement into foreign languages and post written and audio translations on a website for use by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The facts are not in dispute. At approximately 10:00 p.m. on September 20, 2007, Officer Shane Lugo of the Plainfield Police Department responded to the scene of a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, the officer saw two vehicles that had collided and were both facing the same direction. Defendant was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the rear car with the engine running. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>damaged front end of his car was touching the other car\u2019s rear bumper.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The officer approached defendant and asked for his credentials in English. According to the officer, defendant did not understand him, so he repeated the request in Spanish. Defendant produced his license, registration, and insurance card in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">As they spoke, the officer smelled alcohol coming from defendant and noticed that he slurred his speech. The officer asked defendant to get out of the car and walk to the curb. Defendant stumbled out of his vehicle and braced himself against it as he made his way to the side of the road; once he let go of the car and began to walk, he swayed back and forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The officer, speaking in English, tried to get defendant to perform some field sobriety tests. According to the officer, defendant appeared to listen as he leaned against a tree for support, but he did not understand. Based on the odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath, his slurred speech, and swaying, the officer believed that defendant was under the influence of alcohol and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The officer next transported defendant to the police station. When they arrived, Officer Anthony Berlinski, a certified Alcotest operator, observed defendant for twenty minutes in the booking area. Both officers then brought defendant to \u201cthe Alcotest room,\u201d where a breathalyzer test could be administered using an Alcotest 7110 machine to measure defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration. (A thorough description of how the Alcotest machine works can be found in <em>State v. Chun, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>54, 75-84, 943 A.2d 114 (2008).) A video recorder captured the events in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">At this point, Officer Lugo read defendant the contents of a document titled \u201cDivision of Motor Vehicles Standard Statement for Operators of a Motor <em>Vehicle\u2014N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e)\u201d (standard statement). Specifically, the officer read aloud the following in English:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>1. You have been arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10% or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">2. You are required by law to submit to the taking of samples of your breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in your blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">3. A record of the taking of samples, including the date, time, and results, will be made. Upon your request, a copy of that record will be made available to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">4. Any warnings previously given to you concerning your right to remain silent and your right to consult with an attorney do not apply to the taking of breath samples and do not give you the right to refuse to give, or delay giving, samples of your breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in your blood. You have no legal right to have an attorney, physician, or anyone else present for the purpose of taking breath samples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">5. After you have provided samples of your breath for chemical testing, you have the right to have a person or physician of your own selection, and at your own expense, take independent samples and conduct independent chemical tests of your breath, urine, or blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">6. If you refuse to provide samples of your breath you will be issued a separate summons for this refusal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">7. Any response that is ambiguous or conditional, in any respect, to your consent to taking of breath samples will be treated as a refusal to submit to breath testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">8. According to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a, if a court of law finds you guilty of refusing to submit to chemical tests of your breath, then your license to operate a motor vehicle will be revoked by the court for a period of no less than six months and no more than 20 years. The Court will also fine you a sum of no less than $250.00 [sic] and no more than $1,000.00 for your refusal conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">9. Any license suspension or revocation for a refusal conviction will be independent of any license suspension or revocation imposed for any related offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-13\">10. If you are convicted of refusing to submit to chemical tests of your breath, you will be referred by the Court to an Intoxication Driver Resource Center and you will be required to satisfy the requirements of that center in the same manner as if you had been convicted of a violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50, or you mil be subject to penalties for failure to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-14\">11. I repeat, you are required by law to submit to taking of samples of your breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in your blood. Now, will you submit the samples of your breath?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">The form provides space for an answer after that last paragraph. When the officer finished reading paragraph eleven, defendant shook his head and pointed to his eye. The officer recorded defendant\u2019s answer on the document as \u201cshook head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Because defendant\u2019s response was considered ambiguous, the officer read aloud the following additional paragraphs in English:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">I have previously informed you that the warnings given to you concerning your right to remain silent and your right to consult with an attorney do not apply to the taking of breath samples and do not give you a right to refuse to give, or to delay giving samples of your breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in your blood. Your prior response, or lack of response, is unacceptable. If you do not unconditionally agree to provide breath samples now, then you will be issued a separate summons charging you with refusing to submit to the taking of samples of your breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in your blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Once again, I ask you, will you submit to giving samples of your breath? Defendant responded, \u201cNo Entiendo\u201d\u2014Spanish for \u201cI do not understand.\u201d The officer noted defendant\u2019s answer on the form as follows: \u201cI speak Spanish \u2018No Entiendo.\u2019 \u201d Officer Lugo later testified that he did not believe defendant understood what was read to him and had no reason to believe defendant spoke English.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In addition to reading the standard statement, both officers gestured to defendant to demonstrate how to use the Alcotest machine. On three or four occasions, the officers pointed to the machine and cupped their hands in an effort to show defendant what he needed to do. Defendant did not follow the officers\u2019 pantomimed efforts. Defendant was issued summonses for driving while intoxicated (DWI), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, refusal to submit to a breath test, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a, and careless driving, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">At a trial in Plainfield Municipal Court on December 18, 2007, the court heard testimony from Officers Lugo and Berlinski and viewed the videotape of events in the Alcotest room. Defendant also testified through a Spanish interpreter. It is undisputed that he does not speak English. Defendant claimed that he was not under the influence of alcohol on the night of his arrest; instead, he said that he took two Percocet tablets about fifteen to twenty minutes before driving to treat pain associated with an eye injury that he sustained five months before his arrest. Defendant testified that Percocet makes him feel sleepy and dizzy. He also stated that he did not understand what was read to him at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>police station and that he had taken his driver license exam in Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On January 29, 2008, the municipal court judge announced his findings. Based solely on Officer Lugo\u2019s observations of defendant, the court found him guilty of DWI. The court also found him guilty of refusing to submit to a breath test. The municipal court judge noted that Officer Lugo properly read the standard statement, that there was no precedent requiring that the statement be read in Spanish, and that defendant refused to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Prior to sentencing, the court merged the careless driving offense into the DWI violation. The court then suspended defendant\u2019s license for the minimum period of seven months on the refusal violation, and for three months, to run concurrently, on the DWI conviction. The court also imposed various fines and monetary assessments. The court stayed its sentence for twenty days to allow defendant to seek further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Defendant sought a trial de novo in the Superior Court. He focused his challenge on the refusal violation and conceded at oral argument that there was credible evidence as to the DWI offense. After conducting its review on June 6, 2008, the trial court convicted defendant. The court found that although defendant did not understand the standard statement read to him, there was no basis to require that it be read in Spanish. It was sufficient, the court concluded, to read the statement in English. The court imposed the same sentence and stayed it pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Defendant filed an appeal limited only to the refusal conviction. <em>State v. Marquez, </em>408 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 279, 974 A.2d 1092 (App. Div.2009). His DWI conviction, therefore, remains intact and will not be affected by the outcome of this case. Defendant once again argued that he could not be guilty of refusal because he does not understand English. <em>Ibid. </em>The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 974 A.2d 1092. The panel explained that \u201cthe law does not require a translation of the standard statement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e)\u201d and that \u201cdefendant gave his implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>consent to submit to a breath test when he obtained his New Jersey driver\u2019s license.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the Appellate Division found that due process was satisfied but recommended that the MVC prospectively consider \u201chaving the standard statement translated into Spanish and perhaps other prevalent foreign languages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 288, 974 A.2d 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for certification. 200 <em>N.J. </em>476, 983 A.2d 201 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Defendant argues that he was not \u201cinformed\u201d of the consequences of refusing to submit a breath sample, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), because the standard statement was read to him in English. He also submits that hearing the standard statement read aloud in a language he did not understand is the functional equivalent of not hearing it at all. Defendant contends that the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling renders section 50.2(e) meaningless. In addition, he maintains that due process entitles him to a translation of the standard statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The Union County Prosecutor argues that defendant has no right to refuse to take a breath test in light of the implied consent statute. As a result, he maintains that there is no constitutional dimension to section 50.2(e) and that defendant\u2019s due process rights were not violated when he was informed of the consequences of refusal in English. Because consent is implied, the State argues, it does not matter whether defendant spoke English and could understand the standard statement; the statute only requires that the statement be read. The State also maintains that the police showed defendant how to use the Alcotest machine, but defendant refused to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Prior to oral argument, the Attorney General entered this appeal and filed a supplemental brief on behalf of the State. The Attorney General contends that to sustain a refusal conviction, there is no requirement that police obtain an interpreter to read the standard statement in languages other than English. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Attorney General also maintains that there is no statutory requirement or constitutional right to have the implied consent warnings translated into other languages. In the event a defendant claims that he is not guilty of refusal because of a genuine inability to understand English, the Attorney General submits that a court may consider the defendant\u2019s language barrier as an affirmative defense, for which the defendant should bear- the burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We granted amicus curiae status to the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU). The ACDL argues that, at a minimum, the standard statement should be read in any language that the MVC offers the driver license exam. In addition, the ACDL urges that officers should be required to make a good faith, reasonable effort to communicate the standard statement in a manner that motorists can understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The ACLU argues that the Appellate Division\u2019s decision frustrates the intent of the Legislature to \u201cinform\u201d motorists of the consequences of refusal. The ACLU also asserts that the State\u2019s failure to translate the standard statement into Spanish was fundamentally unfair and violated due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">After oral argument, the Attorney General advised the Court of a new policy initiative to post written and audio versions of the standard statement in nine foreign languages on a website law enforcement officials can access. The MVC offers the written driver test in the same languages.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The statutory scheme at the heart of this case has evolved over many decades. Throughout that time, the Legislature\u2019s primary purpose has been \u201cto curb the senseless havoc and destruction caused by intoxicated drivers.\u201d <em>State v. Tischio, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>504, 512, 527 A.2d 388 (1987). To that end, the Legislature first criminalized drunk driving in 1921, <em>L. </em>1921, c. 208, \u00a7 14, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, and in 1951 put in place a presumption that anyone operating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>vehicle with a blood-alcohol level of .15% was intoxicated, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>89:4-50.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>L. </em>1951, <em>c. </em>23, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Enforcement was undermined, though, because drivers did not have to submit to blood-alcohol tests and faced no penalties if they refused to do so. <em>State v. Wright, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>488, 498, 527 A.2d 379 (1987). Refusal rates nationally were as high as 92%. <em>Ibid. </em>(citation omitted). In New Jersey, the State Police reported that the refusal rate in 1964-65 was 26.5%. <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As a result, in 1966, the Legislature enacted both an implied consent law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.2, and a refusal statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.4. <em>L. </em>1966, c. 142, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4; <em>see State v. Macuk, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11-13, 268 A.2d 1 (1970). The former deemed that all motorists operating a vehicle on a public road had consented to the taking of breath samples, which would be tested for blood-alcohol content, <em>L. </em>1966, c. 142, \u00a7 2; the latter authorized a six-month license revocation if a driver refused to participate in the breath test. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4. The simultaneous passage of those laws was designed to encourage people arrested for drunk driving to submit a breath sample and to enable law enforcement to obtain objective scientific evidence of intoxication. <em>See Bean v. Strelecki, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>310, 313, 244 A.2d 316 (App.Div.1968); <em>see also Macuk, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 13, 268 A.2d 1; <em>State v. Conners, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>500, 510, 311 A.2d 764 (Cty.Ct.1973); N.J. Motor Vehicle Study Comm\u2019n, <em>Report </em>136 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The initial version of the statutes did not direct officers to inform motorists of the consequences of refusal. That requirement was added in 1977 as part of a series of amendments to the law. <em>L. </em>1977, c. 29, \u00a7 3. The modifications stemmed from a 1975 report issued by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Study Commission. <em>See Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 500-01, 527 A.2d 379. That study found no evidence that drivers had \u201cbeen deterred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>excessive drinking before driving\u201d and estimated that at least 25% of those arrested for drunk driving refused the test. N.J. Motor Vehicle Study Comm\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>at 136, 147. Indeed, it was advantageous for an offender to refuse the test because the six-month penalty for refusal was \u201cso much shorter than any penalty imposed [for drunk driving] except for a first \u2018impaired\u2019 offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150-51. A second offender, for example, faced \u201ceither a two or ten year revocation, depending on his record\u201d if charged with driving while under the influence. <em>Id. </em>at 147. Yet \u201c[b]y refusing the test, he deprive[d] the state of objective evidence of intoxication\u201d and risked only a six-month suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 147-48. In short, the refusal statute\u2019s penalties were insufficient to deter drunk driving or cause motorists arrested for that offense to submit breath samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In response, the Legislature adopted certain recommendations made by the Study Commission. In 1977, the Legislature changed the penalty to ninety days\u2019 license revocation for a first offense and added a one-year revocation for a second refusal. <em>See L. </em>1977, c. 29, \u00a7 4. Because of the more stringent penalty, the Legislature added a requirement that police officers \u201cinform the person arrested of the consequences of refus[al].\u201d <em>See L. </em>1977, c. 29, \u00a7 3; <em>see also </em>S. 1423 (Sponsor\u2019s Statement), 197th Leg. (N.J. Feb. 24, 1977) (noting that S. 1423 implements recommendation of Motor Vehicle Study Commission Report); N.J. Motor Vehicle Study Comm\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>at 151. The Legislature also amended the implied consent law to require that the Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) prepare a standard statement to be read to motorists. <em>L. </em>1977, c. 29, \u00a7 3. (DMV is now known as the Motor Vehicle Commission.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In 1981, the Legislature revised both statutes again. <em>See L. </em>1981, c. 512, c. 537. Among other changes, it transferred jurisdiction for refusal cases from the Office of Administrative Law and the DMV to the municipal courts, <em>see L. </em>1981, c. 512, \u00a7 2; Assem. 2293 (Sponsor\u2019s Statement), 199th Leg. (N.J. Dec. 8, 1980), and it raised the penalties for refusal to six months\u2019 license suspension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>for a first offense and two years for subsequent offenses, <em>see L. </em>1981, c. 537, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, at the request of the Governor, the Legislature adopted the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof for refusal cases. <em>L. </em>1981, c. 512, \u00a7 2; Letter from Governor Brendan Byrne to the Assembly re: Assembly Bill No. 2293(SR) (Jan. 4,1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In <em>State v. Cummings, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>84, 95, 875 A.2d 906 (2005), this Court held that because refusal cases are quasi-criminal in nature and subject to double jeopardy principles under <em>State v. Widmaier, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>475, 500, 724 A.2d 241 (1999), the proper burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">To evaluate defendant\u2019s claim, we look to the Legislature\u2019s intent expressed through the implied consent and refusal statutes. Legislative intent \u201cis the paramount goal when interpreting a statute and, generally, the best indicator of that intent is the statutory language.\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">We therefore begin with the terms of the statutes. We read the words chosen by the Legislature \u201cwithin their context\u201d and give them \u201ctheir generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1. To accomplish that, we read the statutes in their entirety and construe \u201ceach part or section ... in connection with every other part or section to provide a harmonious whole.\u201d <em>Bedford v.

The implied consent law today reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle on any public road, street or highway or quasi-public area in this State <em>shall be deemed to have given his consent to the taking of samples of his breath </em>for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in his blood; provided, however, that the taking of samples is made in accordance with the provisions of this act and at the request of a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that such person has been operating a motor vehicle in violation of the provisions of R.S.39:4-50 or section 1 of P.L. 1992, c. 189 (C.39:4-50.14).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">(b) A record of the taking of any such sample, disclosing the date and time thereof, as well as the result of any chemical test, shall be made and a copy thereof, upon his request, shall be furnished or made available to the person so tested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">(c) In addition to the samples taken and tests made at the direction of a police officer hereunder, the person tested shall be permitted to have such samples taken and chemical tests of his breath, urine or blood made by a person or physician of his own selection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">(d) The police officer shall inform the person tested of his rights under subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">(e) No chemical test, as provided in this section, or specimen necessary thereto, may be made or taken forcibly and against physical resistance thereto by the defendant. <em>The police officer shall, however, inform the person arrested of the consequences of refusing to submit to such test in accordance with section 2 [(N.J.S.A.394-504a)J of this amendatory and supplemental~y act. A standard statement, prepared by the chief administrator, shall be read by the police officer to the person under arrest.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">The refusal statute provides in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">(a) ... the municipal court shall revoke the right to operate a motor vehicle of any operator who, after being arrested for a violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 1 of P.L. 1992, c. 189 (C.39:4-50.14), shall refuse to submit to a test provided for in section 2 of P.L. 1966, c. 142 (0.39:4-50.2) when requested to do so, for not less than seven months or more than one year unless the refusal was in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a second offense under this section, in which ease the revocation shall be for two years or unless the refusal was in connection with a third or subsequent offense under this section in which case the revocation shall be for ten years____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\"><em>The municipal court shall determine </em>by a preponderance of the evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whether the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on the public highways or quasi-public areas of this State while the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic, hallucinogenic, or habit-producing drug or marijuana; whether the person was placed under arrest, if appropriate, and <em>whether he refused to submit to the test upon request of the officer; </em>and if these elements of the violation are not established, no conviction shall issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">To identify all of the elements of a refusal offense, we must look at the plain language of both statutes because although they appear in different sections, they are plainly interrelated. Focusing on what police officers must say to motorists helps demonstrate that point. In essence, the refusal statute requires officers to <em>request </em>motor vehicle operators to submit to a breath test; the implied consent statute tells officers <em>how </em>to make that request. In the language of the statutes, to be convicted for refusal, judges must find that the driver \u201crefused to submit to the test <em>upon request of the officer.\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a(a) (emphasis added). That test, as explicitly noted in the refusal statute, is the one \u201cprovided for in section 2 of P.L. 1966, c. 142 (0.39:4-50.2)\u201d\u2014the implied consent law. The implied consent statute, in turn, directs officers to read a standard statement to the person under arrest for the specific purpose of <em>informing </em>\u201cthe person arrested of the consequences of refusing to submit to such test in accordance with section 2 <em>[{N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.4a)].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Thus, the statutes not only cross-reference one another internally, but they also rely on each other substantively. They must therefore be read together. Otherwise, police looking at section 50.4a in isolation could seemingly choose any words they might prefer to \u201crequest\u201d that a driver submit to a breath test. Yet the Legislature in section 50.2(e) pointedly tells officers (a) that they \u201cshall ... read\u201d a statement prepared by the MVC chief administrator to motorists, and (b) why they must do so. To find that the two statutes are independent of one another in this context would in effect read section 50.2(e) out of existence. That approach would violate accepted norms of statutory construction because \u201ccourts are to avoid constructions that make statutory provisions ... meaningless.\u201d <em>Paper Mill Playhouse v. Millburn Twp., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>503, 521, 472 A.2d 517 (1984); <em>see also G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 172, 723 A.2d 612 (1999); <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 68, 389 A.2d 465 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">To the extent <em>Wright </em>suggests a different approach, it does so in a very different context that does not apply here. <em>Wright </em>addressed \u201cwhether a defendant may be convicted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test without proof that he actually was operating a motor vehicle at the time of his arrest.\u201d <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 527 A.2d 379. In analyzing that question, the Court looked to differences in language in the above two statutes about <em>operating </em>a vehicle and noted the following distinction: section 50.2 deems that \u201c[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle\u201d has given consent, whereas section 50.4a applies to situations when an \u201carresting officer had probable cause to believe that the person had been driving.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 502, 527 A.2d 379. The former statute, the Court explained, addresses actual drivers; the latter covers people \u201cwho may or may not have been driving but ... [are] reasonably suspected of having been driving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 502-03, 527 A.2d 379 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (quoting with approval dissenting opinion in Appellate Division). In that context, the Court concluded that \u201ceach statute is self-contained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>527 A.2d 379. By contrast, to identify how police are to ask motorists to submit to a breath test, the two statutes must be read in tandem.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">A careful reading of the two statutes reveals four essential elements to sustain a refusal conviction: (1) the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; (2) defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated; (3) the officer requested defendant to submit to a chemical breath test and informed defendant of the consequences of refusing to do so; and (4) defendant thereafter refused to submit to the test. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), 39:4-50.4a(a); <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 527 A.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\"><em>Wright </em>listed all but the third element.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It did not consider the specific statutory requirement in section 50.4a that an officer <em>request </em>a motorist submit to a chemical test, an issue that was not in dispute in the case. Although the issue is squarely presented today, the dissent repeatedly chooses to strip that plain language in the refusal statute of meaning. <em>Wright </em>focused instead on whether a motorist could be convicted of refusal without proof of having actually operated a vehicle. It therefore mentioned only in passing that the officer \u201cadvised [defendant] of his rights, and asked him to submit to a breathalyzer test,\u201d <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 491, 527 A.2d 379, and did not address the issue in reciting the elements of refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Cases decided after <em>Wright </em>have spoken more about the requirement that officers inform motorists of the consequences of refusal. In <em>Widmaier, </em>for example, the Court grappled with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>defendant\u2019s conditional response to the standard statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 480, 483-86, 724 A.2d 241. The defendant agreed to take the test but wanted his attorney present. <em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 724 A.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In its review of the statutory landscape, the Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">[t]he Legislature has required that a standard statement be read to any defendant subjected to the test. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e). By doing so, <em>the Legislature has provided a procedural safeguard to help ensure that defendants understand the mandatory nature of the breathalyzer test, </em>their limited rights to counsel for purposes of the test, and the need for unequivocal, affirmative consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 489, 724 A.2d 241 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The Court went on to find that defendant had failed to consent and that \u201canything substantially short of an unconditional, unequivocal assent to an officer\u2019s request that the arrested motorist take the breathalyzer test constitutes a refusal to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 724 A.2d 241 (quoting <em>State v. Bernhardt, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 219, 584 A.2d 854 (App.Div.1991)). The Court then urged the MVC \u201cto consider revising the standard statement to further ensure that suspects understand that an ambiguous or conditional answer to a request to submit to a breathalyzer test will be deemed a refusal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 724 A.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\"><em>Wright </em>and <em>Widmaier </em>left unaddressed whether the reading of the standard statement is a necessary element of a refusal conviction. The Appellate Division, in <em>State v. Duffy, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>609, 612-13, 792 A.2d 555 (App.Div.2002), concluded that the statement must be read to obtain a conviction. In <em>Duffy, </em>an opinion authored by then-Judge Wallace, a defendant offered equivocal responses to the standard statement. He said that he would take the test but was sick, that he thought he could take it, and that he would take the test under duress. <em>Id. </em>at 610-11, 792 A.2d 555. The officer interpreted defendant\u2019s responses as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>refusal and did not read the required additional statement. <em>Id. </em>at 612, 792 A.2d 555. For that reason, the Appellate Division reversed the refusal conviction. It found that \u201cthe failure to inform defendant that his response was considered a refusal, and that unless he replied yes he would be cited for a refusal, [was] a fatal defect in the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612-13, 792 A.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Court returned to the refusal statute in <em>Cummings, </em>when it found that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the proper standard for refusal cases. <em>Cummings, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 89, 875 A.2d 906. That ruling, the Court explained, \u201cshould have no discernable adverse effect\u201d on prosecutions that required the following: \u201cPolice officers still must provide defendants the standardized statement of the consequences for the failure to submit to a breathalyzer test required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e)\u201d and meet the other three requirements recited above. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 875 A.2d 906. \u201cSave for the burden of proof, nothing has changed.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Kim, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>260, 267, 989 A.2d 864 (App.Div. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We also note that the Attorney General\u2019s written guidelines for the prosecution of refusal violations list similar elements to the four-part standard outlined above: \u201c(1) a person; (2)[w]as operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, or vessel; (3)[t]he person was arrested, on probable cause, for a DWI violation; [and] (4)[t]he person refused to submit to chemical breath testing, <em>after the law enforcement official read the Standard New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission ... Statement for that offense to that person.\u201d </em>Office of the Att\u2019y Gen., <em>Attorney General\u2019s Guideline: Prosecution of DWI &amp; Refusal Violations </em>4-5 (Jan. 24, 2005) (emphasis added), <em>available at </em>http://www.state.nj.us/oag/dcj/ agguideAl-10jd-dwi-2005.pdf.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Accordingly, consistent with the plain language of the statutes and the case law, we find that refusal convictions require proof that an officer requested a motorist to submit to a chemical breath test and informed the person of the consequences of refusing to do so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The fact that motorists are deemed to have implied their consent, pursuant to section 50.2(a), does not alter that conclusion. Sections 50.2(e) and 50.4a nonetheless impose an obligation on officers to inform drivers of the consequences of refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We turn our attention now to the third element of a refusal violation\u2014the obligation that police \u201crequest\u201d motorists to submit to a test and \u201cinform\u201d them of the consequences of refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">For ease of reference, we repeat the relevant language of the implied consent statute: \u201cThe police officer shall ... inform the person arrested of the consequences of refusing to submit to such test in accordance with <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a]. A standard statement, prepared by the chief administrator, shall be read by the police officer to the person under arrest.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">To determine what that means in the context of a driver who does not speak or understand English, we again begin with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>plain language of the statute. \u201cTo inform\u201d means \u201cto communicate knowledge to\u201d and \u201cmake acquainted.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1160 (3d ed. 1993). \u201cInform implies the imparting of knowledge, especially of facts or events necessary to the understanding of a pertinent matter.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">By its own terms, therefore, the statute\u2019s obligation to \u201cinform\u201d calls for more than a rote recitation of English words to a non-English speaker. Knowledge cannot be imparted in that way. Such a practice would permit Kafkaesque encounters in which police read aloud a blizzard of words that everyone realizes is incapable of being understood because of a language barrier. That approach would also justify reading aloud the standard statement to a hearing-impaired driver who cannot read lips. We do not believe that the Legislature intended those absurd results. Rather, its directive that officers \u201cinform,\u201d in the context of the implied consent and refusal statutes, means that they must convey information in a language the person speaks or understands.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">To the extent there is any ambiguity in the statute, the legislative history and interpretive case law provide additional guidance. The relevant language in section 50.2(e) was added to the statute in 1977. <em>L. </em>1977, <em>c. </em>29, \u00a7 3. As recounted earlier, the Legislature implemented a number of recommendations made by the Motor Vehicle Study Commission in its September 1975 Report. S. 1423 (Sponsor\u2019s Statement), 197th Leg. (N.J. Apr. 26,1976). Specifically, the Commission recommended more stringent penalties for a second refusal. N.J. Motor Vehicle Comm\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>at 153. For that very reason, the Commission also recommended that \u201cpolice should be required to warn the driver of the possible consequence of refusing to submit to a chemical test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151. In other words, notwithstanding that drivers are deemed to consent to a breath test by law, the Commission wanted to offset potential, harsher consequences by conveying knowledge of them to drivers at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Widmaier </em>is once again instructive. In that case, the Court not only described the standard statement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u201ca procedural safeguard to help ensure that defendants understand the mandatory nature of the breathalyzer test,\u201d but also encouraged the MVC to revise the statement \u201cto further ensure that suspects understand that an ambiguous or conditional answer to a request to submit to a breathalyzer test will be deemed a refusal.\u201d <em>Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 489, 498-99, 724 A.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Although <em>Widmaier\u2019s </em>pronouncement arose in a different context, its import is clear: motorists must be reminded that a breath test is mandatory, and the Legislature\u2019s chosen safeguard was meant to help ensure that defendants understood that fact\u2014even though they had already impliedly consented to the test. To read the statement in a language a driver does not speak is inconsistent with that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">This Court in <em>State v. Badessa, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>303, 314, 885 A.2d 430 (2005), identified a related goal of the statute: the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of having an officer advise a driver of the penalties for refusal \u201cis to impel the driver to take the test so that the State will have the evidence necessary to prosecute a DWI charge.\u201d That aim, likewise, is not met by reading words in a language the driver does not understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In essence, reading the standard statement to motorists in a language they do not speak is akin to not reading the statement at all. The latter scenario renders a conviction defective. <em>See Duffy, supra, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 612-13, 792 A.2d 555. It makes no sense that English speakers will be acquitted if incomplete warnings are read to them in English, <em>see ibid., </em>yet foreign-language speakers can be punished on the basis of empty warnings that fail to inform them. Such an approach is not faithful to the text of section 50.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The parties have called attention to a Law Division decision in 1976, <em>State v. Nunez, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 351 A.2d 813 (Law Div.1976), which is not persuasive. In <em>Nunez, </em>a defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress the results of a breath test because he did not understand his right, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c), to have an independent test performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Subsection (e), at issue here, did not exist when <em>Nunez </em>was decided. The legislative objectives that animate subsection (e) thus played no role in the decision. <em>Nunez </em>is therefore distinguishable. That said, section 50.2(d) required that officers \u201cshall inform\u201d motorists of the right to an independent test. The State trooper read a statement in English to that effect but reported that the defendant did not speak or understand English; the defendant, a native Spanish speaker, contended he did not understand. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32, 351 A2d 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In two sentences, the trial court explained that \u201c[ijnform\u201d means \u201cto give information to impart knowledge\u201d and declared that the trooper \u201cdid give the information to Nunez.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33-34, 351 A.2d 813. However, the trial court did not explain how reading a statement in a language the listener did not speak could impart knowledge in any meaningful way. <em>Nunez </em>was not appealed and has not been adopted by this Court. Its evaluation of subsections (c) and (d) is not convincing authority in this matter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Relying on the plain language of section 50.2(e), the Legislature\u2019s reasons for adding that section, and prior case law on point, we find that to \u201cinform,\u201d within the meaning of the implied consent and refusal statutes, is to convey information in a language the person speaks or understands.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">What, then, is the practical impact of the requirement that police officers \u201cinform\u201d motorists of the consequences of refusal?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Obviously, reading the standard statement in English to motorists who speak English will suffice. If people cannot hear or do not speak or understand English, however, some other effort must be made to \u201cinform\u201d them \u201cof the consequences of refusing to submit.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A, </em>39:4-50.2(e). Providing a written document to hearing-impaired individuals in a language they understand will ordinarily suffice. Addressing non-English speakers, though, is more complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Many different languages are spoken in our State. According to statistics for the court year 2007-08, 87,766 court events required translation services in 81 languages. N.J. Judiciary, Admin.

We defer to the executive branch agency, specifically, to the chief administrator of the MVC, to fashion a proper remedy with the assistance of the Attorney General. The Legislature authorized the MVC to develop the standard statement, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), and we have consistently deferred to the MVC regarding it. <em>See State v. Spell, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>537, 539-40, 959 A.2d 1209 (2008) (referring procedure outlined by Appellate Division for consideration by MVC); <em>Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 498-99, 724 A.2d 241 (recommending that DMV supplement standard statement to address conditional response by motorist); <em>Leavitt, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 541-42, 527 A.2d 403 (recommending that DMV revise standard statement \u201cto advise the suspect that his right to consult with an attorney before giving any oral or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>written statement does not give him the right to refuse to give (or to delay giving) the breath sample when requested\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Faced with a similar problem, which had constitutional overtones, we encouraged the Attorney General to develop \u201cappropriate bilingual <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u201d to communicate those rights to non-English speaking defendants. <em>State v. Mejia, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>475, 503, 662 A.2d 308 (1995). In doing so, we recognized \u201cthat law-enforcement officials cannot print <em>Miranda </em>warnings for all linguistic minorities. But that should not prevent the State from preparing cards for the larger segments of the non-English speaking population.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We recognize the same practical constraints today, in light of the statistics recounted earlier, and make a similar recommendation. In order to meet the requirements of the statute, we encourage the MVC and the Attorney General to develop methods to translate and communicate the standard statement to motorists who do not speak English.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We understand that the Attorney General has already taken substantial steps in that regard. After oral argument in this case, the Attorney General advised the Court that (1) it has arranged for certified translated versions of the standard statement to be prepared\u2014in both written and audio form\u2014in the nine foreign languages in which the MVC offers the written driver\u2019s test, namely, Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), French, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish; (2) it has posted translated written and audio files on its website, http://www. njpdresourees.org; and (3) it was sending an advisory to all police departments to notify them of those developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s initiative, if properly utilized, will enable law enforcement to inform nearly all drivers in New Jersey of the consequences of refusal. Motorists who took the driver exam in one of the nine foreign languages would be covered. We defer to the MVC to determine what to do about the small percentage of additional motorists who would not be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>We recognize that complications may arise even with the use of translated written documents and audio files. For example, drivers may ask police officers follow-up questions that will go unanswered. For those encounters, officers should communicate the additional statement that is given any time a motorist provides an ambiguous or conditional response. <em>See Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 724 A.2d 241; Standard Statement, H1f 12-13, <em>ante </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">However, given the need to collect samples quickly and the large number of potential languages involved, it is not practical to expect that interpreters will be available on short notice in all cases. Precious time would be wasted in locating and transporting police officers or interpreters able to \u201cread\u201d the standard statement in a particular language, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), and we do not construe the statute so narrowly as to require that approach. As noted in <em>Wright, </em>\u201c[w]e have consistently given a broad interpretation to the drunk driving laws when a narrow interpretation would frustrate th[e] legislative policy\u201d of curbing drunk driving. <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 497, 527 A.2d 379 (citing <em>Tischio, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>504, 527 A.2d 388 and <em>State v. Mulcahy, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>467, 527 A.2d 368 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We add the following. It is no defense to a refusal charge for drivers to claim that they were too drunk to understand the standard statement. <em>See State v. Quaid, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 537, 412 A.2d 1087 (Law Div.1980). In other words, it is not necessary for the State to prove that a driver actually understood the warnings on a subjective level. <em>Cf. Widmaier, supra, 157 N.J. </em>at 498, 724 A.2d 241 (\u201c[D]efendant\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant in determining whether the defendant\u2019s responses to the officer constitute a refusal to take the test.\u201d). If properly informed in a language they speak or understand while sober, drivers can be convicted under the implied consent and refusal statutes. Voluntary, excessive drinking cannot and does not void the statutes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Indeed, that type of voluntary behavior is fundamentally distinct from a person\u2019s utter lack of ability to understand a foreign language.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">To that end, warnings given in English will presumably be competent. Police, though, may choose to ask if a suspect speaks English.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction will depend on the facts of a particular case. Once again, the State is required to prove the four elements of refusal beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, if a person established that she spoke only Italian, and was not informed of the consequences of refusal in that language, she could not be convicted under the refusal statute. Nonetheless, she could be convicted of the independent offense of DWI based on the observations of the officer and any other relevant evidence\u2014as occurred in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Defendants who claim that they do not speak or understand English must bear the burden of production and persuasion on that issue. <em>See Leavitt, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 542, 527 A.2d 403 (explaining that defendant should bear burden of persuasion to establish claim of confusion without resolving whether claim may be asserted); <em>State v. Sherwin, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 518, 566 A.2d 536 (App.Div.1989) (noting defendant failed to offer affirmative evidence of confusion, \u201cmuch less earr[y] his burden of persuasion on the issue\u201d). That information is peculiarly within the possession of the defendant, not the State. <em>Cf. Kim, supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 269, 989 A.2d 864. In addition, this approach will help separate feigned claims from real ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">In this case, it is undisputed that defendant does not speak English. As a result, Officer Lugo\u2019s reading of the standard statement to him in English failed to \u201cinform\u201d defendant of the consequences of refusal, as required. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s refusal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In light of that outcome, we do not reach defendant\u2019s constitutional due process claim. <em>See Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>81, 109, 609 A.2d 11 (1992) (Pollock, J., concurring) (\u201c[C]onstitutional questions should not be reached and resolved unless absolutely imperative in the disposition of the litigation.\u201d (quoting <em>State v.

Our responsibility in identifying the elements of a statute, though, is to interpret the precise language the New Jersey Legislature used in crafting this State's laws, in light of the legislative history. The Legislature did not direct that officers take objectively reasonable steps to inform defendants; rather, it specifically mandated that officers read a particular statement, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), and it made conviction dependent on whether a defendant refused to submit to a test \"upon request of the officer,\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a(a).

My disagreement goes to the core conclusion reached by my colleagues in the majority. I simply do not agree that the procedural safeguards imposed by the implied consent law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2, are an additional substantive element of the offense of refusing to submit to a chemical breath test that the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to sustain a refusal conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a. The majority mistakenly transforms the procedural safeguards of the implied consent law into a substantive right under the refusal statute, and makes the fact that motorists on New Jersey\u2019s roadways have given their implied consent to chemical breath tests entirely meaningless. In my view the two statutes can be harmonized and effect given to both, which is the goal we should strive to achieve. The Legislature intended that the procedural requirements of the implied consent law would be followed by police officers. In determining whether that procedural requirement has been satisfied, I would focus on whether the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>officers made reasonable efforts under the attendant circumstances to inform the defendant of the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical breath test, in accord with the statutory language of the implied consent law. The novel interpretation announced today by the majority eviscerates the implied consent statute, a result that is at odds with the salutary policies intended by having an implied consent condition imposed on all licensed drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The Legislature\u2019s primary motivation in enacting drunk driving laws in New Jersey was \u201cto remove intoxicated drivers from our roadways and thereby \u2018to curb the senseless havoc and destruction\u2019 caused by them.\u201d <em>State v. Chun, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>54, 71, 943 <em>A.2d </em>114 (2008) (quoting <em>State v. Tischio, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>504, 512, 527 A.2d 388 (1987)). That senseless havoc and destruction saw more than 11,000 people lose their lives across the United States in 2008 as a result of intoxicated drivers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., <em>Traffic Safety Facts 2008 Data: Alcohol-Impaired Driving </em>1 (2008), <em>available at </em>http://www-m-d.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/ 811155.PDF. This Court consistently has interpreted New Jersey drunk driving laws \u201cboth broadly and pragmatically to ensure that the Legislature\u2019s intent is effectuated.\u201d <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 71, 943 A.2d 114 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The issue raised in this case requires a focus on the relationship between the two statutes commonly referred to as the refusal statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a, and the implied consent law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2. Because the analysis in this ease requires the interpretation of legislation, we must be mindful not only of the manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>which this Court traditionally has construed drunk driving laws, but also of established principles of statutory construction, namely that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">[w]hen construing a statute, our primary goal is to discern the meaning and intent of the Legislature. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>325, 332, 963 A.2d 281 (2009) (citation omitted). In most instances, the best indicator of that intent is the plain language chosen by the Legislature. <em>See DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\"><em>[State v.

Bd. of Educ., </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>14, 32, 970 A.2d 354 (2009). Indeed, \u201cwhen cognate laws are passed, a presumption of at least equal force is present that they were intended to become part of a consistent whole unless they or parts of them are expressly or impliedly incompatible.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. N.J. State Highway Auth., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>393, 401, 255 A.2d 266 (1969). Thus, so long as it is possible, we do not interpret one statute in a manner that strips another statute of its meaning. <em>See Paper Mill Playhouse v. Millburn Twp., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>503, 521, 472 A.2d 517 (1984) (\u201c[Construction that will render any part of a statute inoperative, superfluous or meaningless, is to be avoided.\u201d (quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The text of the refusal statute sets forth the elements required for a refusal conviction.

Plainly put, \u201c[a] person suspected of driving while intoxicated has no right to refuse to take a breathalyzer test.\u201d <em>State v. Stever, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>543, 561, 527 A. 2d 408 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The implied consent law represents the Legislature\u2019s effort to coerce motorists to submit to a chemical breath test, which is precisely why the penalties for refusing to submit to such a test have been made more stringent over time. <em>See generally Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 500-02, 527 A.2d 379. We have described the implied consent law not as a source of substantive rights, but rather as \u201ca procedural safeguard.\u201d <em>Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 489, 724 A.2d 241. It was not intended, as the majority suggests, to make defendants aware that they had a right to refuse to submit to a chemical breath test, but rather just the opposite: the implied consent law was intended \u201cto help ensure that defendants understand the <em>mandatory nature </em>of the breathalyzer test.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). Given that understanding of the implied consent law as a prophylactic measure, its remedial purpose, and its central importance to combating drunk driving in New Jersey, I cannot dismiss its primary feature\u2014that all motorists in New Jersey have consented to submit to chemical breath tests\u2014as easily as does the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">That said, the refusal statute and the implied consent law are interrelated. And, I do not quarrel with the majority\u2019s characterization that \u201cthe refusal statute requires officers to <em>request </em>motor vehicle operators to submit to a breath test; [and] the implied consent statute tells officers <em>how </em>to make that request.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 500-01, 998 A.2d at 430. However, that tidy characterization does not mean, as the majority contends, that the requirements imposed by the implied consent law must be imported and incorporated as an element of the refusal statute that the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to sustain a refusal conviction. More is required to reach such a new and novel parsing of these statutes than the mere fact that they are interrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Equally important is how and why the two statutes are related, which is \u201cto facilitate drunk driving investigations,\u201d by enabling \u201cthe enforcing authorities to reach out during the very short window in time during which the scientific evidence of intoxication is available.\u201d <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 502, 527 A.2d 379 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The majority\u2019s interpretation undermines that purpose by reading into the refusal statute a requirement found nowhere in its text, and at the same time eviscerates the rationale behind the implied consent law that gives it its force. Respectfully, the primary flaw in the majority\u2019s reasoning is that it disregards the entire foundational basis for our implied consent law, namely that \u201c[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle on any public road, street or highway or quasi-public area in this State shall be deemed to have given his consent to the taking of samples of his breath for the purpose of making chemical tests to determine the content of alcohol in his blood.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(a). Under the majority\u2019s approach, that basic purpose to the implied consent law contains no residual force: a defendant must understand the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical breath test before he or she can be convicted of refusal. Thus, the majority mistakenly transforms the procedural safeguards of the implied consent law into a substantive right under the refusal statute, and makes the fact that motorists on New Jersey\u2019s roadways have given their implied consent to chemical breath tests entirely meaningless. That result does damage to both statutes and ignores the directive to, whenever possible, give equal force to separate statutes that are part of a common statutory scheme, <em>see Jacobs, supra, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>at 401, 255 A.2d 266, and not to interpret one statute so as to render the other inoperative, <em>see Paper Mill Playhouse, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 521, 472 A.2d 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The two statutes can be read in harmony and full effect can be given to both, without one undermining the other, by simply following a first principle of statutory construction, which directs the focus on the plain text of each statute, <em>see DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039. Under that approach, it is clear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>as discussed previously, that the Legislature named three, and only three, elements comprising the offense for refusing to submit to a chemical breath test under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.4a: (1) that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant was operating a vehicle while intoxicated; (2) that the defendant was arrested for that offense; and (3) that the defendant refused to submit to the test. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a; <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 527 A.2d 379; <em>Badessa, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 312, 885 A.2d 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The implied consent law imposes the distinct procedural requirement that \u201c[t]he police officer shall ... inform the person arrested of the consequences of refusing to submit to such test in accordance with <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e). It is possible to give effect to that statutory language without finding that it is incorporated as a substantive element of a refusal conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a. The majority makes much of the dictionary definition of the word \u201cinform,\u201d but ignores the remainder of the statutory language and the context in which that word is used. The implied consent law does not state that <em>\u201cthe driver must be informed </em>of the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical breath test\u201d or any like variation. Instead, the statute\u2019s view is from the perspective of the police officer\u2014the person who is doing the informing\u2014and not on the person who is being informed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e) (\u201cThe police officer shall ... inform the person arrested____\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its terms impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>procedural requirement on police officers to \u201cinform\u201d a defendant and it is silent concerning any requirement that a defendant understand the information being imparted, which is entirely sensible where the defendant is, by definition, intoxicated and potentially incapable of understanding the information conveyed by the police officer due to that intoxication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In understanding what is required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), the analysis must be anchored in that statutory language. In determining whether a police officer has \u201cinform[ed] the person arrested of the consequences of refusing to submit to [a chemical breath] test,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), the legislative intent was to focus on the actions of the police officer because he or she is the actor addressed by the statutory language. Thus, one need only deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>mine whether <em>the officer </em>made objectively reasonable efforts to inform the defendant under the circumstances. Such a standard is not only faithful to the statutory language, but also has the advantage of being sensible and workable, as evidenced by the adoption of a like construction in other states. <em>See State v. Garcia, </em>756 N.W.2d 216, 223 (Iowa 2008) (\u201cWe adopt a reasonableness standard, which requires a law enforcement officer who has asked a person suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol to submit to chemical testing, under the circumstances facing the officer at the time of the arrest, to utilize those methods which are reasonable and would reasonably convey Iowa\u2019s implied consent warnings.\u201d); <em>State v. Piddington, </em>241 Wis.2d 754, 623 N.W.2d 528, 534-35 (2001) (requiring \u201cthe arresting officer under the circumstances facing him or her at the time of the arrest, to utilize those methods which [are] reasonable, and would reasonably convey the implied consent warnings\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Respectfully, the majority goes too far in requiring that police officers \u201cmust convey information in a language the person speaks or understands.\u201d <em>ante </em>at 507, 998 A.2d at 434. Courts across the country that have considered this issue have reached the same conclusion. <em>See, e.g., People v. Wegielnik, </em>152 <em>Ill.</em>2d 418, 178 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>693, 605 N.E.2d 487, 491 (1992) (refusing to require that warnings be given in language spoken by defendant because \u201c[w]e find no meaningful distinction between a motorist who cannot comprehend the statutory warnings because of injury or intoxication, and one who does not understand them due to insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>English language skills\u201d); <em>Yokoyama v. Comm\u2019r of Pub. Safety, </em>356 N.W.2d 830, 831 (Minn.Ct.App.1984) (\u201cAlthough making an interpreter available when possible is desirable, finding an interpreter is not absolutely necessary and should not interfere with the evidence-gathering purposes of the implied consent statute.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>Martinovic v. Commonwealth, </em>881 A.2d 30, 36 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2005) (\u201c[WJhen motorists are limited by their understanding of the English language, thereby allegedly preventing them from \u2018knowingly\u2019 refusing the test, we still hold that those motorists \u2018knowingly\u2019 refused the test absent some other verifiable impediment. Otherwise, anyone who speaks little to no English can automatically claim that he or she did not understand the ... warnings and avoid the consequences of refusing a chemical test, just as anyone who is drunk could automatically claim that he or she was too drank to understand the ... warnings and avoid the consequences of refusing a chemical test.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">An objective test to determine whether the officer made reasonable efforts to \u201cinform\u201d the defendant would not require translation into multiple languages. Such a test would, however, satisfy the Legislature\u2019s desire for that procedural step in such motor vehicle stops. Naturally, translation would minimize any difficulties encountered in satisfying a reasonableness test: translation of the statement would per se satisfy the reasonableness standard that should be applied. Therefore, although I recognize the beneficial effects to be achieved from the Attorney General\u2019s efforts to translate the standard statement into other languages, I see no basis for imposing that requirement as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Indeed, the majority\u2019s decision breaks with our history of deferring to the Motor Vehicle Commission\u2019s (MVC) interpretation of the drunk driving statutes, particularly when the standard statement is in issue, a deference required as a matter of legislative choice. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e) (\u201cA standard statement, prepared by the director [of the MVC], shall be read by the police officer to the person under arrest.\u201d); <em>State v. Spell, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>537, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>539-40, 959 A.2d 1209 (2008) (\u201c[T]he Legislature has vested in the Chief Administrator of the [MVC] ... the authority to determine the contents and procedure to be followed in respect of that standard statement____ [I]n keeping with the express legislative allocation of responsibilities set foi\u2019th in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), we refer the procedure outlined by the Appellate Division to the Chief Administrator of the [MVC] for consideration.\u201d). Although the majority speaks of deferring to the MVC, that claimed deference lacks substance in light of the thrust of its opinion that requires that the standard statement be given to a suspected drunk driver in the language that the driver speaks. Our drunk driving statutes, which were enacted to protect the public from \u201cthe senseless havoc and destruction\u201d caused by drunk drivers, <em>Tischio, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 512, 527 A.2d 388, do not require translation and any reading of the statutory scheme that would require translation is unfaithful to the text and the purpose underlying our statutory scheme to eliminate drunk drivers from the highways and byways of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Applying that standard in the review of the police officers\u2019 actions in this matter would require a focus on the actions of the officers under the circumstances to determine whether the officers made objectively reasonable efforts to inform the defendant of the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical breath test. First, it is noteworthy that the police officers were aware that defendant did not speak English. Indeed, one of the officers spoke to defendant in Spanish. When the officers were attempting to explain the procedure for providing a breath sample and, then proceeded to read to him the standard statement, defendant indicated that he did not understand what was being asked of him or read to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Despite the fact that one of the officers spoke some Spanish to defendant, the officer did not make an effort to further communicate with defendant in Spanish even though he later testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>he did not believe that defendant understood what was read to him and believed that defendant did not speak English.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, the officers mimicked how to use the Alcotest machine in a futile charade. In this scenario, where one of the officers in the room was able to communicate with defendant in his native language, but did not do so, I cannot find that the police officers made an objectively reasonable effort to satisfy the legislative desire that the officer convey to defendant the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical breath test. That prophylactic reminder is intended to coeree compliance with giving a breath sample. The courts ought to compel officers to engage in objectively reasonable efforts to accomplish that legislative preference for compliance. However, I would not superimpose that procedural right as a substantive element for a refusal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">A fact-sensitive analysis is necessary and, had the factual circumstances been different, I might not reach the same conclusion. For example, had the defendant spoken another language that was unfamiliar to the attending police officers, the officers should not be required to track down an interpreter of the pertinent language, for numerous reasons, not the least of which is the evanescent nature of the evidence in drunk driving cases. The chemical breath test must be administered shortly after an arrest in order to obtain an accurate reading because any delay may see the evidence disappear as the body processes and eliminates the alcohol. <em>See Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 488, 724 A.2d 241 (\u201cIn adopting the unequivocal consent rule, courts have acknowledged that delays in performing breathalyzer tests would lead to inaccurate results and would eviscerate the very purpose of the DWI statutes.\u201d); <em>see also Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 76, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The majority, by requiring that police officers \u201cmust convey information in a language the person speaks or understands,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 507, 998 A.2d at 434, makes non-English speakers immune to prosecution for violating the refusal statute unless and until the standard statement is translated into the language spoken by each of those individuals. As the majority points out, in the 2007-08 court year alone, eighty-one different languages were spoken in our courts. <em>Ante </em>at 510, 998 A.2d at 436. The fact that some of those languages are uncommon cuts against, and not in favor of, the majority\u2019s holding that information must be conveyed in a language that the defendant speaks or understands because it will simply not be feasible to hire or find translators for those occurrences. Moreover, it is one thing to accommodate non-English speaking persons in scheduled test-taking situations or during orderly court proceedings, it is quite another to expect law enforcement officials on the streets or patrolling our roads to have constantly at-hand a means of access to whatever language is spoken by a person who has obtained a license to drive a motor vehicle. It is particularly incongruous that in our motor vehicle licensure test-taking, we ensure that the applicant can utilize his or her spoken language to confirm their understanding that by obtaining a motor vehicle license he or she gives implied consent to be tested for drunk driving. Yet round-the-clock translation must be available to police officers on patrol to reconfirm that understanding, again, when that person is suspected of violating the drunk driving laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Immunizing people from refusal convictions, unless a translator or a written translation is provided at the motor vehicle stop and breath-testing, logically makes it more difficult to prosecute them for driving while intoxicated because the most concrete and important piece of evidence\u2014blood alcohol content\u2014will not be available to the police or the prosecutor. <em>See Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 527 A.2d 379 (\u201cWithout a breathalyzer test, police were denied a method of reliably distinguishing those motorists who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>were drunk from motorists who displayed symptoms of drunkenness that were actually attributable to other causes.\u201d). In a state in which 154 persons were killed by intoxicated drivers during 2008 alone, <em>see Traffic Safety Facts 2008 Data: Alcohol-Impaired Driving, supra, </em>at 6 tbl. 4, I cannot sanction such a result. Furthermore, a decision that absolves individuals of violating the refusal statute plainly ignores the fact that by driving a motor vehicle on a public roadway in New Jersey that individual has consented to providing chemical breath tests when there is probable cause for a police officer to believe that the individual was intoxicated. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(a). Although there has been a decrease in the number of drivers who refuse to provide breath samples due in part to the implied consent law, as of 2005 almost one in five drivers in New Jersey arrested on suspicion of drunk driving still refused to consent to a chemical breath test. <em>See </em>Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., <em>Refusal of Intoxication Testing: A Report to Co-ngress </em>5 (2008), <em>available at </em>http://www. nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/Traffic%20Injury%20Control/Articles/ Associated%20Files/811098.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In light of the overall purpose behind our drunk driving statutory scheme, and the clear words of both the refusal statute and the implied consent law, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s judgment to the extent that it holds that the requirements imposed on police officers by the implied consent law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.2 are a substantive element of a refusal offense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a that must be proven by the prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain such a conviction. Based on an analysis of the statutory requirement that \u201c[t]he police officer shall ... inform the person arrested of the consequences of refusing to submit to [a chemical breath] test,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.2(e), I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the focus was meant to be on the defendant and whether he or she was subjectively \u201cinform[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Rather, the plain language of the statute focuses on the police officer and the objectively reasonable, procedural steps he or she must take to inform a suspected drunk driver of the consequences of refusal in order to fulfill that coercive purpose intended by the procedurally required statement. I find no basis in the statute for compelling, as the majority does, that the Attorney General translate the standard statement into an unspecified number of languages other than English, in readiness for the many variations of languages spoken by persons in the populace. I therefore dissent from that part of the majority\u2019s holding. However, because in this case the police officers did not take objectively reasonable efforts to inform defendant, as I believe they procedurally were required to do, a prophylactic response is required and I would not sustain this conviction. I therefore concur in the ultimate judgment that reverses this conviction. Respectfully, however, I must disavow the majority\u2019s reasoning in support of its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Justices RIVERA-SOTO and HOENS join in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\"><em>For reversal and </em>vacation\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LONG, ALBIN and WALLACE\u20144.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\"><em>Concurring in part; dissenting in </em>part\u2014Justices LaVECCHIA, RIVERA-SOTO and HOENS\u20143.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\"> The term \"intoxicated drivers\" refers to those drivers with a blood alcohol content (BAC) above the legal limit of 0.08, a BAC that has been adopted by every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico as per se evidence of intoxication. <em>See </em>Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., <em>Traffic Safety Facts 2008 Data: Alcohol-Impaired Driving </em>1 (2008), <em>available at </em>http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot. gov/Pubs/81115 5.PDF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> The majority, in its discussion of <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>488, 527 A.2d 379, and <em>State v.

Here, defendant concedes that he was read the standard statement in its entirety; his only argument is that he could not understand it. Thus, the majority's discussion of <em>Cummings </em>is mostly irrelevant. The majority's reliance on the Appellate Division's decision in <em>State v.

Yet, in giving such great weight to a tool created by the Attorney General to assist lay and attorney law enforcement participants in presentations of DWI and Refusal prosecutions, the majority, at the very least, should acknowledge that the same office that it cites in support of its \"element\" finding further directs that \u201cthe content of the Standard Statement <em>cannot be altered or changed in any manner, </em>and <em>cannot be translated to any other language.\u201d </em>Office of Att'y Gen., <em>Revision, Standard DWI Refusal Statement, Effective April 26, 2004 2 </em>(April 27, 2004) (emphasis in original), <em>available at </em>http://www. state.nj.us/oag/dcj/agguide/refusalmemo042004.pdf. That position is at odds with the conclusion that the majority draws from the Attorney General's perplexing guidelines reference. In my view, the Attorney General\u2019s inartful reference in the guidelines is in error, has no support in our prior case law, and was disavowed through the Attorney General's contrary position in this matter.
