The trial court placed her on probation, imposed $220 in fees and fines, and ordered that if an outstanding debt remained at the end of her probation, the amount due would go to collections without further order of the court. Due\u00f1as contends that imposing the fees and fine without considering her ability to pay violates state and federal constitutional guarantees because it simply punishes her for being poor. We agree. \"Whatever hardship poverty may cause in the society generally, the judicial process must make itself available to the indigent; it must free itself of sanctions born of financial inability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Preston v.

Accordingly, we reverse the order imposing court facilities and court operations assessments, and we remand the case to the trial court with directions to stay the execution of the restitution fine until the People prove that Due\u00f1as has gained an ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Due\u00f1as is a married mother of two young children. She has cerebral palsy, and because of her illness she dropped out of high school and does not have a job. Due\u00f1as's husband is also unemployed, although occasionally he is able to obtain short-term work in construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The family of four receives $350 per month in CalWorks cash benefits and $649 per month in CalFresh food stamps benefits. Due\u00f1as uses all the money she receives to take care of the children, but she cannot afford basic necessities for her family. She has no bank account and no credit card. She owns only her clothing and a mobile phone, and her mobile phone service is frequently disconnected because she cannot afford the $40 per month payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The family has no home of their own; they alternate between staying at Due\u00f1as's mother's home and the home of her mother-in-law. The electricity was cut off to her\n   mother-in-law's home because the family could not afford to pay the bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Prior Legal Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When Due\u00f1as was a teenager, she received three juvenile citations. She could not afford to pay the $1,088 she was assessed for these citations. Because she could not pay her debt, her driver's license was suspended. Due\u00f1as was unable to have her driver's license reinstated because she could not afford the fees, and she did not qualify for the state amnesty program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the next several years, Due\u00f1as suffered three misdemeanor convictions for driving with a suspended license and one conviction for failing to appear on a driving without a license case. In these cases, Due\u00f1as was offered the ostensible choice of paying a fine or serving jail time in lieu of payment. Each time, she could not afford the fees, so she served time in jail-a total of 51 days across four cases. Additionally, she was sentenced to 90 days in jail for driving with a suspended license. In total, Due\u00f1as was sentenced to 141 days in jail for driving with a driver's license that had been suspended because she had been unable to pay her juvenile citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Even after serving her jail time, Due\u00f1as remained liable for court fees associated with each misdemeanor conviction. In one case, she was also ordered to pay attorney fees. She was unable to pay those amounts, and they were sent to collections. Due\u00f1as receives letters from collection agencies, but she has no way to pay off her debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B. Present Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 13, 2015, Due\u00f1as pleaded no contest to another misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended license ( Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601.1, subd. (a) ) based on a plea agreement that conditioned the consequences for the conviction on whether she obtained a valid driver's license by the time of the sentencing hearing. If Due\u00f1as returned to court on the date of sentencing\n   without a valid license, she would be fined and sentenced to 30 days in jail. If Due\u00f1as returned with a valid license, however, the court would place her on 36 months summary probation and impose a $300 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the February 22, 2016 sentencing hearing, Due\u00f1as did not have a valid driver's license and was prepared to surrender that day. The court asked if Due\u00f1as wished to \"save money and convert the $300 [fine] to 9 days of county jail,\" and her counsel said, \"Yes. She doesn't have the ability to pay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Due\u00f1as on 36 months summary probation on the condition that she serve 30 days in county jail and pay $300, plus a penalty and assessment, or that she serve 9 additional days in custody in lieu of paying the $300 fine. The court imposed a $30 court facilities assessment under Government Code section 70373, a $40 court operations assessment under Penal Code section 1465.8, and a $150 restitution fine under Penal Code section 1202.4. The trial court also imposed and stayed a probation revocation restitution fine. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Due\u00f1as asked the court to set a hearing to determine her ability to pay \"the attorney fees [she had previously been assessed] and court fees.\" She advised the court that she was homeless and receiving public assistance. The court said such a hearing could be held in the future, if needed: \"She has three years to pay them. If it gets near the time where she can suffer a consequence as a result of not paying them, which would almost never be the case, we can set a hearing at that time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Citing Penal Code section 987.8, subdivision (b), which provides that a court may\n   order a defendant who has been represented by a public defender to pay attorney fees only if the court determines he or she has the present ability to pay all or part of the cost of legal assistance, Due\u00f1as again asked the court to conduct an ability to pay hearing. The court asked if it had to hold the hearing before it imposed fees or only to have a hearing \"before she suffers the consequences of not being able to pay them.\" Due\u00f1as advised the court that as a matter of due process, \"before you can impose the fees there must be an ability-to-pay hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After what the court described as \"searching for some sort of case law\" to support Due\u00f1as's position, the court declared it would hold an ability to pay hearing. The court imposed \"all the other fines and fees,\" and ordered that Due\u00f1as serve her 39 days in county jail, see the court's financial evaluator, and return to court in three weeks for an ability to pay hearing on the attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Due\u00f1as pointed out that she would be unable to serve her sentence and see the financial evaluator within three weeks. Her counsel suggested that given\n   that Due\u00f1as was homeless, \"it might be simpler to do it here in court\" rather than require her to see the financial evaluator. The court said that it did not make sense for it to \"sort through the documents myself\" and that she should \"avail herself of the expertise of the financial evaluator.\" The court offered some flexibility in setting the date of the hearing but cautioned, \"I don't want to get into the habit of having litigants determine what day they want to come back.\" The court also stated its belief, which was inaccurate, that if Due\u00f1as were to be unable to appear for the hearing, the fees and fines would not be sent to collections or transformed into a civil judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the March 17, 2016 ability to pay hearing, the court reviewed Due\u00f1as's uncontested declaration concerning her financial circumstances, determined that she lacked the ability to pay the previously-ordered attorney fees, and waived them on the basis of her indigence. The court concluded that the $30 court facilities assessment under Government Code section 70373 and $40 court operations assessment under Penal Code section 1465.8 were both mandatory regardless of Due\u00f1as's inability to pay them. With respect to the $150 restitution fine, the court found that Due\u00f1as had not shown the \"compelling and extraordinary reasons\" required by statute ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (c) ) to justify waiving this fine. The court rejected Due\u00f1as's constitutional arguments that due process and equal protection required the court to consider her ability to pay these fines and assessments, and ordered her to pay $220 by February 21, 2019. The trial court told Due\u00f1as that, \"[i]f in the end you're not able to pay, you won't be punished for it. Those [sums] will go to collections without any further order from this court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The superior court appellate division affirmed the trial court's order. We granted Due\u00f1as's petition to transfer the case to the Court of Appeal. ( Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1002.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Raising money for government through law enforcement whatever the source-parking tickets, police-issued citations, court-imposed fees, bills for court appointed attorneys, punitive fines, incarceration charges, supervision fees, and more-can lay a debt trap for the poor. When a minor offense produces a debt, that debt, along with the attendant court appearances, can lead to loss of employment or shelter, compounding interest, yet more legal action, and an ever-expanding financial burden-a cycle as predictable and counterproductive\n   as it is intractable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Rivera v. Orange County Probation Dept.\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351453,5927150\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1103/\">\n    832 F.3d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1112, fn. 7.) The record in this matter illustrates the cascading consequences of imposing fines and assessments that a defendant cannot pay.\n   As the trial court noted, this matter \"doesn't stem from one case for which she's not capable of paying the fines and fees,\" but from a series of criminal proceedings driven by, and contributing to, Due\u00f1as's poverty. Unable to pay the fees for citations she received when she was a teenager, Due\u00f1as lost her driver's license. Like many who are \"faced with the need to navigate the world and no feasible, affordable, and legal option for doing so\" (\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Haslam\n   </em>\n   (M.D.Tenn. 2018)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527046\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/329/475/\">\n    329 F.Supp.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521 ), she broke the law and continued to drive. As a result, Due\u00f1as now has four misdemeanor convictions for driving without a valid license. These, in turn, have occasioned new fines, fees, and assessments that she is unable to pay. As the trial court described it, the repeat criminal proceedings have caused her financial obligations to \"snowball.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Due\u00f1as argues that laws imposing fines and fees on people too poor to pay punish the poor for their poverty. These statutes, she asserts, are fundamentally unfair because they use the criminal law, which is centrally concerned with identifying and punishing only blameworthy decisions, to punish the blameless failure to pay by a person who cannot pay because of her poverty. The laws, moreover, are irrational: they raise no money because people who cannot pay do not pay. We conclude that due process of law requires the trial court to conduct an ability to pay hearing and ascertain a defendant's present ability to pay before it imposes court facilities and court operations assessments under Penal Code section 1465.8 and Government Code section 70373. We also hold that although Penal Code section 1202.4 bars consideration of a defendant's ability to pay unless the judge is considering increasing the fee over the statutory minimum, the execution of any restitution fine imposed under this statute must be stayed unless and until the trial court holds an ability to pay hearing and concludes that the defendant has the present ability to pay the restitution fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I.

Code, \u00a7 70373 ].) Both were enacted as parts of more comprehensive legislation intended to raise funds for California courts. Penal Code section 1465.8 was enacted in 2003 as part of a law that increased a number of\n   court-related fees, including small claims court filing fees, civil litigation filing fees, civil motions fees, and appellate filing fees; it also imposed new court fees, such as a fee for complex litigation, probate filing fees, and a fee for certain court reporter services. (Assem. Republican Bill Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1759 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.).) Originally, Penal Code section 1465.8 provided that its purpose was \"[t]o ensure and maintain adequate funding for court security\" (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 25); in 2011 the Legislature amended the statute to specify that the purpose was \"[t]o assist in funding court operations.\" (Stats. 2011, ch. 40, \u00a7 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Government Code section 70373 was enacted in 2008 as part of a law that raised funds for court facilities by increasing existing fees or imposing new fees in trust and estate proceedings; for the violation of license, registration and mechanical requirements of the Vehicle Code; for certain parking offenses; and for persons attending traffic violator school. (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Sen. Bill No. 1407, Stats. 2008, ch. 311.) Government Code section 70373 provides that its purpose is \"[t]o ensure and maintain adequate funding for court facilities.\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373, subd. (a)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although it enacted these fee-generating statutes to raise funds for court operations and facilities, the Legislature has recognized the deleterious impact of increased court fees on indigent people. The Legislature has declared that \"our legal system cannot provide 'equal justice under law' unless all persons have access to the courts without regard to their economic means. California law and court procedures should ensure that court fees are not a barrier to court access for those with insufficient economic means to pay those fees.\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68630, subd. (a).) The Legislature has also declared that \"fiscal responsibility should be tempered with concern for litigants' rights to access the justice system. The procedure for allowing the poor to use court services without paying ordinary fees must be one that applies rules fairly to similarly situated persons, is accessible to those with limited knowledge of court processes, and does not delay access to court services.\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68630, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, the Legislature has provided for fee waivers for indigent litigants at the trial and appellate court levels that excuse them from paying fees for the first pleading or other paper, and other court fees and costs,\n   including assessments for certain court investigations. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68631.) Government Code section 68632 grants permission to proceed without paying costs to those receiving certain public assistance benefits, to those whose monthly income is 125 percent or less of government poverty guidelines, and to those who \"cannot pay court fees without using moneys that normally would pay for the common necessaries of life for the applicant and the applicant's family.\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 68632, subdivisions (a) - (c).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While this protective mechanism lessens the disproportionate burden that these fundraising fees present to indigent litigants in the civil context, the Legislature neither instituted nor rejected a corresponding safeguard for assessments attached to a criminal conviction. Both Government Code section 70373 and Penal Code section 1465.8 are silent as to the consideration of a defendant's ability to pay in imposing the assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B. For Those Unable to Pay, These Assessments Inflict Additional Punishment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The \"constitutional guaranties of due process and equal protection both call\n   for procedures in criminal trials which allow no invidious discriminations between persons and different groups of persons. Both equal protection and due process emphasize the central aim of our entire judicial system-all people charged with crime must, so far as the law is concerned, 'stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every American court.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

The Magna Carta prohibited civil sanctions that were disproportionate to the offense or that would deprive the wrongdoer of his means of livelihood. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Yet, although Penal Code section 1202.4 permits the court to waive imposition of a restitution fine if it finds \"compelling and extraordinary reasons\" why the fine should not be imposed, the statute expressly states that inability to pay the fine does not qualify:\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A defendant's inability to pay shall not be considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a restitution fine.\" ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (c).) This provision is at odds with the policy articulated in Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (a) : \"Restitution shall be consistent with a person's ability to pay.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a result of Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (c) 's prohibition on considering the defendant's ability to pay the minimum fine, the criminal justice system punishes indigent defendants in a way that it does not punish wealthy defendants. In most cases, a defendant who has successfully fulfilled the conditions of probation for the entire period of probation has an absolute statutory right to have the charges against him or her dismissed. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.4, subd. (a)(1).) The defendant must be \"released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense with which he or she has been convicted,\" with the exception of driver's license revocation proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .; Veh. Code, \u00a7 13555.) But if a probationer cannot afford the mandatory restitution fine, through no fault of his or her own he or she is categorically barred from earning the right to have his or her charges dropped and to relief from the penalties and disabilities of the offense for which he or she has been on probation, no matter how completely he or she complies with every other condition of his or her probation. Instead, the indigent probationer must appeal to the discretion of the trial court and must persuade the\n   court that dismissal of the charges and relief from the penalties of the offense is in the interest of justice. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.4, subd. (a)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In this statutory scheme, therefore, the wealthy defendant is offered an ultimate outcome that the indigent one will never be able to obtain-the successful completion of all the terms of probation and the resultant absolute right to relief from the conviction, charges, penalties, and disabilities of the offense. At best, indigent defendants who cannot pay their restitution fine can try to persuade a trial court to exercise its discretion to grant them relief, despite their failure to comply with all terms of probation; at worst, they are deprived of relief, with all the collateral consequences that the legislation was designed to avoid. This result arises solely and exclusively from their poverty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The statutory scheme thus results in a limitation of rights to those who are unable to pay. The heart of the due process inquiry is whether it is \"fundamentally unfair\" to use the criminal justice system to impose punitive burdens on probationers who have \"made all reasonable efforts to pay the fine or restitution, and yet cannot do so through no fault of [their] own ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 461 U.S. at p. 668,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/#p667\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)
