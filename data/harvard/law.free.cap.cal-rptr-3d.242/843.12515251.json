A jury found her guilty of assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1) ) and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (force-likely assault) ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subdivision (a)(4) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court placed her on probation. Aguayo appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is our second opinion in this appeal. In our original opinion, we rejected the sole issue Aguayo initially asserted: that we must vacate her conviction for force-likely assault because it is a lesser included offense of assault with a deadly weapon. Aguayo then filed a petition for rehearing in which she challenged the reasoning of our original opinion and asserted a new argument based on legislation enacted while this appeal was pending. Specifically, she argued that newly enacted sections 1001.35 and 1001.36, which grant trial courts the discretion to place defendants with mental disorders into pretrial diversion, apply retroactively to her case. We\n   granted Aguayo's petition on the newly asserted issue and received supplemental briefing from the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this opinion, we once again reject the lesser-included-offense argument Aguayo originally raised. The portions of this opinion addressing that issue are substantively identical to our original opinion. As to the new issue, which is now pending before the California Supreme Court on its own motion (see\n   <em>\n    People v. Frahs\n   </em>\n   (2018)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514926\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/238/483/#p791\">\n    27 Cal.App.5th 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (\n   <em>\n    Frahs\n   </em>\n   ) [finding the statutes retroactive], review granted Dec. 27, 2018, S252220), we conclude the mental health diversion legislation applies retroactively. We further conclude Aguayo has made a showing of potential eligibility sufficient to warrant a remand for further proceedings. Accordingly, we conditionally reverse the judgment for the limited purposes specified in the Disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the afternoon of August 8, 2017, 43-year-old Veronica Aguayo was working on her bicycle in her parents' yard. Her 72-year-old father (Father) turned on the sprinklers to water the plants, accidentally wetting Aguayo's cell phone charger. Aguayo began yelling expletives and insults at Father, who turned around to go back inside because he \"didn't want to hear her mouth calling [him] names.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Father turned, Aguayo hit him on the back with her bicycle lock and chain. Father grabbed the lock to prevent Aguayo from hitting him again, but as they struggled over the lock, Father slipped and let go of the chain. Aguayo then hit Father with the chain and lock about 15 times on the arms, chest, and head. Father again grabbed the lock, and during a struggle for possession, Aguayo fell to the ground, pulling Father with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the ground, Aguayo began \"hollering\" for her mother (Mother) inside. Aguayo then grabbed a small ceramic pot and threw it at Father, striking his head exactly where he had previously had two brain surgeries. Father fell on top of Aguayo, grabbed a rock to hit her with, but thought better of it and threw the rock away. However, the rock ricocheted off the house and hit Aguayo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Father got up to go back in the house, and another struggle ensued for possession of the chain and lock, which Father apparently won. As Aguayo picked up a rock to hit Father, Mother emerged from the front door and warned, \"Don't do that.\" Aguayo discarded the rock, and Father tossed the chain and lock toward her. Aguayo picked up the chain and lock, and rode off on her bicycle. The whole encounter lasted between five minutes (according to Mother) and 30 minutes (according to Father), during which Father estimated he was hit about 50 times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mother called 911, and police and paramedics responded. Father was evaluated at the hospital and released with only minor treatment. Police apprehended Aguayo a few hours later during an unrelated traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Aguayo was charged with three offenses: (1) elder abuse, with deadly-weapon and great-bodily-injury enhancement allegations (\u00a7\u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1), 1192.7, subd. (c)(23), 12022, subd. (b)(1); count 1); (2) assault with a deadly weapon, with an enhancement allegation that she \"personally used a dangerous and deadly weapon, to wit: bicycle chain/lock\" ( \u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1), 1192.7, subd. (c)(23) ; count 2); and (3) force-likely assault ( \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4) ; count 3). After deliberating less than two hours, the jury found Aguayo guilty on both assault counts, and found true the deadly-weapon-use allegation attached to count 2. The jury was unable to reach a\n   verdict on the elder abuse count, which the court ultimately dismissed at the prosecutor's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although Aguayo was presumptively ineligible for probation, the court found she had untreated mental health issues that constituted unusual circumstances warranting probation. Accordingly, the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Aguayo on three years' formal probation with a variety of terms and conditions, including that she spend 365 days in local custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite having suspended imposition of sentence, the court sentenced Aguayo concurrently on counts 2 and 3, but stayed the sentence on count 3 under section 654.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Aguayo appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Aguayo's Lesser-included-offense Challenge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Aguayo contends we must vacate her conviction for force-likely assault because it is a lesser included offense of assault with a deadly weapon.

As instructed, the elements of assault with a deadly weapon are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"1. The defendant did an act with a deadly weapon other than a firearm that by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to a person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"2.

[\u00b6] The People are not required to prove that the defendant actually intended to use force against someone when she acted. [\u00b6] No one needs to actually have been injured by defendant's act. But if someone was injured, you may consider that fact, along with all the other evidence, in deciding whether the defendant committed an assault, and if so, what kind of assault it was.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The elements of both offenses are, thus, substantially similar\n   <em>\n    except for\n   </em>\n   the first element of assault with a deadly weapon (doing an act with a deadly weapon), and the first and second elements of force-likely assault (doing an act that would probably result in the application of force to a person where the force is \"likely to produce great bodily injury\"). Force-likely assault, then, is only a lesser included offense of assault with a deadly weapon if every assault with a deadly weapon requires that the defendant use the weapon in a\n   way that is likely to produce great bodily injury.

We are not persuaded. In\n   <em>\n    Jose S\n   </em>\n   ., a former ward of the juvenile court sought to seal his juvenile criminal record, which included an admission of assault with a deadly weapon (a knife).

The juvenile court concluded his record was ineligible for sealing because his assault conviction was a disqualifying offense under the statutory sealing scheme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1112-1113,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513586\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/801/\">\n    219 Cal.Rptr.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) On appeal,\n   the appellant argued (for the first time) his assault conviction was not disqualifying because the sealing statute enumerated assault with a firearm and force-likely assault, but not assault with a deadly weapon (the offense he admitted). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1121,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513586\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/801/\">\n    219 Cal.Rptr.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In rejecting this argument, our court noted the juvenile court was authorized to consider not only the allegations of the charging document, but also the facts and circumstances of the actual offense.

In that light, our court concluded the juvenile court was justified in concluding the defendant's assault with a deadly weapon \"amounted to\" and \"encompasse[d]\" force-likely assault because the evidence supported the factual finding that \"[t]he knife used by [the minor] was capable of causing, and did cause, great bodily injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1122-1123,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513586\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/801/\">\n    219 Cal.Rptr.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In that sense, the manner in which the minor committed the assault with a deadly weapon was also likely to produce great bodily injury and, thus, was tantamount to a force-likely assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Jose S.,\n   </em>\n   we are not authorized to consider the facts and circumstances of the offense.

This argument fails for several reasons. First, \"[o]rdinarily, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Aguayo has given us no reason to depart from this practice. Second, Aguayo has not sufficiently developed the argument or supported it with citations to supporting legal authority.
