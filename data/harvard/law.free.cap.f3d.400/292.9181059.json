Feldman d/b/a Charles Feldman Investments.\u201d That district court order considered Kaufman\u2019s appeal from the decision of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Brownsville Division, in bankruptcy case 90-01254-B-l in Chapter 11 styled \u201cCharles B. Feldman d/b/a Charles B. Feldman Investments, Debtor\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>filed January 27, 2003, in which the bankruptcy court concluded that Kaufman lacked \u201cstanding to object to this Settlement Agreement\u201d under consideration therein, and found that such Settlement Agreement \u201chas been entered into in good faith, is in the best interest of the Estate and is the settlement of doubtful and disputed claims and meets the elements\u201d set forth in <em>Protective Committee for Independent Stockholders of TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc. v. Anderson, </em>390 U.S. 414, 88 S.Ct. 1157, 20 L.Ed.2d 1 (1968). In its order, the district court reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court by holding that \u201cKaufman has standing to challenge the Motion of Approval of Compromise and to Approve Settlement Agreement and has standing to file this appeal.\u201d The district court, however, affirmed the conclusions of the bankruptcy court that \u201cthe settlement of doubtful and disputed claims\u201d for $25,000 was \u201centered into in good faith\u201d . and \u201cwas in the best interest of the Estate.\u201d Kaufman timely appealed the decision of the district court to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the reply briefs, the record excerpts and relevant portions of the record itself. We review findings of fact by the bankruptcy court under the clearly erroneous standard and decide issues of law <em>de novo. In re Hickman, </em>260 F.3d 400, 401 (5th Cir.2001). For the reasons stated by the district court in its order entered under date of March 25, 2004, we AFFIRM the order of the district court that concluded Kaufman had standing to appeal and we AFFIRM the order of the district court that affirms the decision of the bankruptcy court to approve the Compromise and Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
