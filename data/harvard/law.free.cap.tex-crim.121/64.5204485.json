The proof showed a private residence occupied by Mr. Hamons and his sisters. We think no variance appears between the allegation and the proof in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-24\">The testimony shows that on Sunday night, August 9, 1931, before retirement, Miss Nellie Hamons hooked the back screen door of the house.. The other doors and screens were also closed. When the family awoke the next morning the back screen door was unhooked and tracks were discovered on the ground outside this door. A rifle and a sealer, that is, a tool used for canning and sealing fruits, vegetables, etc., \u2014 were missing. The articles in question were found in possession of appellant by the officers, and were returned to Mr. Hamons the following Thursday. Appellant\u2019s defense to the proposition of guilt based on possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of recently stolen property was, \u2014 that he bought the rifle and sealer from \u201cone of the Stewart boys.\u201d The proof showed that some mile or two from appellant lived a family of Stewarts in which there were five boys, some of them grown. The state, to meet appellant's claim, showed to the satisfaction of the jury, apparently, that none of the Stewart boys were in the neighborhood on the Sunday night that the property was stolen, but that all of them were out of the county, had been and were for some time prior and subsequent to the alleged loss of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We find five bills of exception in the record, each of which has been carefully examined. As above stated, we think there is no variance between the allegation as to the ownership of the burglarized house and the proof. Bill of exception No. 2 complains of the refusal of a requested charge submitting the theory that appellant would not be guilty if he bought the gun and sealer from any of the Stewarts or any other person. The court pertinently and correctly submitted appellant\u2019s defense based on said proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">There is complaint also by a bill of exception of the court\u2019s definition of \u201centry.\u201d Taking the whole charge of the court, we think the definition referred to not incorrect, and also that under the facts it would be incapable of any harm to the accused if not technically correct. There was no question but that who ever entered the house did so by the use of whatever force might have been necessary to unhook the screen door which was found open the next morning after the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Bill of exception No. 4 presents further complaint of the court\u2019s charge regarding entry, but in our opinion same shows no error. The remaining bill presents complaint of the charge of the court for instructing the jury to find appellant guilty if they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that he entered the private residence of Ernest Hamons and therefrom took the property in question. We think this charge followed the indictment and was justified by the proof before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b93-11\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"At1\">There was found in appellant\u2019s possession some of the property which had been taken from the burglarized house. It was appellant\u2019s testimony that he bought this property from \u2019 one of the Stewart boys. The court told the jury if they believed appellant bought it from \u201ca Stewart boy.\u201d or had a reasonable doubt thereof, to acquit him. He claims that the court should have told the jury if he bought it from a Stewart boy \u201cor any other person\u201d he should be acquitted. In the charge given the court covered the issue made by appellant\u2019s testimony, which was that he bought the property from one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the Stewart boys. The only thing he claimed to be uncertain about was whether it was George Stewart or another of the Stewart boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
