This instrument recites that affiant has good reason to believe, etc., but omits the phrase \u201cand does believe.\u201d The inclusion of this last named allegation is statutory. Article 222, subdivision 2, C. C. P. (1925). Its omission from a complaint is fatally defective, as has been held in numbers of cases. Smith v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 411, 76 S. W., 436; Tompkins v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 77 S. W., 800; Green v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 50, 136 S. W., 467; Smith v. State, 103 Texas Crim. Rep., 228, 280 S.
