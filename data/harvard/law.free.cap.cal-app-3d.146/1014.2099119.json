J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aos\">In this original proceeding petitioners ask us to resolve an apparent conflict in Code of Civil Procedure sections 2037 and 1141.24<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>regarding their right to expert witness discovery after arbitration but before trial. We find no conflict on the facts presented, but must issue the writ for reasons explained herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Section 2037<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides for pretrial expert witness discovery. Section 1141.24,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> however, proscribes post arbitration pretrial discovery without \u201cgood cause\u201d and \u201cleave of court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The sections at first seem incompatible. Petitioners, plaintiffs below in a personal injury action, elected to have the matter removed to arbitration pursuant to section 1141.11, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Orange County Superior Court rule 31, section 3, (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After arbitration they filed a request for trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>de novo. (\u00a7 1141.20.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, defendants served their initial demand to exchange lists of expert witnesses relying on section 2037. Plaintiffs responded and defendant moved for an ex parte order shortening time for the taking of the designated expert\u2019s deposition. The trial court denied the motion finding (1) insufficient \u201cgood cause\u201d for allowing the deposition under section 1141.24 and (2) section 1141.24 is a \u201cspecific\u201d section and thus controls the more \u201cgeneral\u201d provisions of section 2037.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The trial court was misled by counsels\u2019 failure to state the issue properly. Even in their briefs before us neither party addressed the statutory scheme which controls the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The judicial arbitration act was designed to expedite and streamline the resolution of smaller civil actions by use of arbitration hearings providing \u201ca simplified and economical procedure for obtaining prompt and equitable resolution\u201d of such actions. (\u00a7 1141.10, subd. (b)(1).) The Judicial Council was directed to implement the purposes of judicial arbitration by promulgating rules controlling practice and procedure in all actions submitted to arbitration. (\u00a7 1141.14; see Cal. Rules of Court (hereafter rules), rules 1600-1617.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The legislation established three methods of bringing a case to arbitration: (1) upon stipulation of the parties (\u00a7 1141.12, subds. (a) and (b)(i)); (2) upon filing of an election to arbitrate by the plaintiff (\u00a7 1141.12, subd. (b)(ii)) and (3) upon court order (\u00a7\u00a7 1141.11 and 1141.16, subd. (a)). The first two methods are consensual or voluntary; the last one is compulsory or mandatory. <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Vido Artukovich &amp; Son, Inc. </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 60, 64 [190 Cal.Rptr. 64].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The method selected for bringing the case to arbitration affects the time frame within which the action will be placed on the arbitration hearing list. For example, in cases submitted to arbitration upon stipulation of the parties \u201can arbitrator shall be assigned to hear [the action] within 30 days from the time of its submission to arbitration.\u201d (\u00a7 1141.16, subd. (d); rule 1601(a) provides such cases \u201cshall be placed on the arbitration hearing list forthwith.\u201d) Similarly, cases involving an election to arbitrate by the plaintiff \u201cshall be submitted to arbitration at an earlier time\u201d (\u00a7 1141.16, subd. (c); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>rule 1601(b) further provides that plaintiff\u2019s written request electing arbitration \u201cshall be filed at the time the at-issue memorandum is filed, or at such later date as is permitted by the court.\u201d) By way of contrast, cases not involving a stipulation or election to arbitrate proceed to a mandatory conference held \u201cno later than three months after the at-issue memorandum is filed and no later than 90 days before the date set for trial, whichever occurs first\u201d (\u00a7 1141.16, subd. (a); rule 1601(c)), wherein the court determines its suitability for mandatory arbitration (e.g., amount in controversy, substantiality of prayers for equitable relief, etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">It is within this statutory framework that we must interpret the application of section 1141.24, prohibiting postarbitration discovery, to the case under review. Section 1141.24 refers to \u201c[C]ases ordered to arbitration pursuant to section 1141.16(a), ... no discovery shall be permissible after an arbitration award except by leave of court upon a showing of good cause.\u201d Section 1141.16, subdivision (a), deals exclusively with cases submitted to arbitration by court order pursuant to a mandatory conference. Here plaintiffs elected arbitration. Cases submitted to arbitration upon plaintiff\u2019s election are not controlled by section 1141.16, subdivision (a), but do explicitly fall into the category of cases grouped under section 1141.16, subdivision (c), namely, those cases \u201c[Submitted to arbitration . . . upon the written request of all plaintiffs. ...\u201d Thus, postarbitration discovery is <em>not </em>precluded since the case was submitted to arbitration by plaintiff\u2019s election and not pursuant to a mandatory conference as provided by section 1141.16, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We decline to enter the discovery thicket of court-ordered section 1141.16, subdivision (a), arbitrations since it is not necessary to the resolution of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">A writ of mandate shall issue directing the trial court to amend its order denying defendant\u2019s motion and to enter a new and different order granting the taking of the deposition requested. The alternative writ is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Crosby, J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Section 2037 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">\u201c(a) Not later than the 10th day after a trial date is selected or 70 days prior to the date set for the commencement of trial, whichever is later, any party may serve on any party a demand to exchange lists of expert witnesses.
