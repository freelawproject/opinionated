Waite also pleaded guilty to one count of assault with the intent to commit rape (\u00a7 220, a crime not subject to sentencing under \u00a7 667.6), a full term for which was imposed pursuant to the general determinate sentencing statute, section 1170. Relying upon the mandate in section 667.6, subdivision (d), the trial court imposed each forcible sex crime sentence consecutive to the others <em>and </em>consecutive to the full term given for the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Waite claims the sentencing court reversibly erred by imposing the <em>full consecutive </em>four-year term for the assault with intent to commit rape instead of the one-third midterm designated by section 1170.1, subdivision (a) for \u201csubordinate\u201d terms, and in failing to consider referring him to the California Youth Authority (CYA) even though he was 19 years of age and eligible. For the following reasons, we conclude once a prison term is imposed for a forcible sex crime under the <em>specific </em>consecutive sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>provisions of section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d), it may not serve also as a \u201cprincipal\u201d term to which sentences imposed for other crimes under the <em>general </em>determinate sentencing scheme (\u00a7\u00a7 1170 and 1170.1) may be deemed \u201csubordinate\u201d pursuant to section 1170.1. We also find the trial court must be presumed to have properly considered and rejected referring him to CYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Waite concedes the sentencing court was required to impose full consecutive terms for each forcible sex crime conviction because each involved a separate victim on a separate occasion (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (d)). He contends, however, because his assault conviction must be sentenced under section 1170.1, and carries a lesser term than any of the forcible sex crime convictions, it must be deemed a \u201csubordinate\u201d term as defined in that section and imposed at <em>one-third </em>the middle term rather than as a <em>full </em>term. The sentencing court specifically stated it was relying on the sentencing scheme outlined in dictum in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ottombrino </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 574, 588, footnote 4 [179 Cal.Rptr. 676].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this method of computation, all terms imposed under section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d) are segregated and totaled, and all terms imposed under section 1170.1 are separately and independently totaled and the sums imposed consecutively to each other. Where several convictions are to be imposed consecutively within the non-section 667.6 category, the \u201cprincipal\u201d term is selected by comparing length of terms imposed only for those convictions within that category. This will always result in one full sentence for a \u201cprincipal\u201d term being selected from the nonsection 667.6 category, which then becomes part of the aggregate term under section 1170.1 to which each full term from the section 667.6 category is consecutively served. Where, as here, assault is the only conviction not punishable under section 667.6, subdivision (d), and constitutes the entire term within the nonsection 667.6 category, the court had no discretion to treat it as a \u201csubordinate\u201d offense as defined in section 1170.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Our analysis of sections 667.6 and 1170.1 establishes the terms imposed under section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d), are independent and separate from those terms computed under section 1170 or 1170.1. Thus, the trial court here correctly sentenced Waite to the sum of the respective totals of the separate computations.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The essence of Waite\u2019s claim is that sections 1170.1 and 667.6 when read together are replete with ambiguities which must be construed in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>favorable to him, not unfavorably as was done in <em>Ottombrino. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 814, 828 [176 Cal.Rptr. 521, 633 P.2d 186].)  When a penal provision is part of a general legislative scheme, it \u201cshould be construed with reference to the entire statutory system of which it forms a part in such a way that harmony may be achieved among the parts . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 30, 40 [127 Cal.Rptr. 122, 544 P.2d 1322].)  Here, since each statutory provision was either added or amended by the identical legislation in a single document (Stats. 1979, ch. 944, p. 3252), we presume the Legislature intended both sections to be fully effective. Guided by the foregoing, we conclude the language of the provisions when read in harmony is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">As background, we summarize the relevant statutory scheme. Section 669 is a general authorizing and procedural statute regarding sentencing for multiple convictions. Section 1170 sets forth the legislative findings and the basic provisions of the determinate sentencing law regarding imposition of terms for specific offenses. Section 1170.1 is the <em>general </em>computational statute providing a method or scheme for calculating respective lengths of consecutive terms for multiple convictions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 748, 751-752, 754 [165 Cal.Rptr. 764].) On the other hand, subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 667.6 are <em>specific </em>computational statutory provisions applying only to the imposition of full, separate and consecutive terms for certain multiple forcible sex crimes. Where a defendant is convicted of certain multiple sex offenses against separate victims, or against the same victim on separate occasions, a full, separate and consecutive term for each must be imposed pursuant to subdivision (d). Where the defendant is convicted of multiple violent sex offenses against the same victim on the same occasion, the court has discretion to impose a full, separate and consecutive term for each under subdivision (c), in lieu of using the formula contained in section 1170.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Waite claims there is confusion regarding the joint application of section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and section 1170.1, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>(a)* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> suggesting there is an apparent conflict, or at least ambiguous overlapping language, between the language of the two statutes. We address each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">1. Waite asserts section 1170.1 subdivision (a)\u2019s reference to sections 12022.3 and 12022.8, enhancements which can be imposed only upon conviction of one of the substantive offenses which, under proper circumstances, may be punished under section 667.6, implies sections 667.6 and 1170.1, subdivision (a) are not necessarily separate and distinct because the former is included within the latter. However, in light of subdivision (c) of section 667.6, it is apparent the references to those enhancements are necessary because section 1170.1 is the governing statute if the trial court exercises its discretion not to sentence one or more multiple forcible sex crimes under section 667.6, subdivision (c), or only a single violent sex offense has been committed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>2. Waite further contends the apparent conflict or confusion emanating from a joint reading of sections 667.6 and 1170.1, subdivision (a) is compounded by the latter\u2019s definitions of \u201caggregate term\u201d and \u201cprincipal term.\u201d An aggregate term is defined as \u201cthe sum of the principal term, the subordinate term and any additional term imposed pursuant to Section 667.5, 667.6, or 12022.1.\u201d  In dictum in <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 742, 746 [192 Cal.Rptr. 101], this court stated a section 667.6 \u201coffense\u201d constitutes an \u201cadditional term,\u201d as defined in section 1170.1. It does not. In light of parallel references to sections 667.5* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 12022.1<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> within the definition of additional term, the reference to section 667.6<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> applies only to its subdivision (a) and (b) enhancements. These sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tion 667.6, subdivisions (a) and (b) enhancements are of the same special character as those in section 667.5 and section 12022.1. Each permits the court to impose additional years of imprisonment to a sentence because of felony convictions suffered by a defendant either before (\u00a7\u00a7 667.5, 667.6) or after (\u00a7 12022.1) committing those crimes for which sentence is currently being imposed. This differentiates this class of enhancements from those enhancements which increase prison terms based upon a defendant\u2019s conduct during the specific crimes for which sentence is being imposed. Our construction, limiting the meaning of \u201cadditional term\u201d to these specific enhancements and not including base terms, is consistent with the reference in section 1170.1, subdivision (f), to the enhancements set forth in the subdivision (a) definitions of principal and additional terms, including sections <em>667.5, 667.6, </em>12022, <em>12022.1, </em>12022.3, 12022.5, 12022.6, 12022.7 and 12022.8. The Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cadditional terms\u201d in conjunction with enhancements and not base terms is again reflected within section 1170.1, subdivision (d).* ******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, California Rules of Court, rule 405(c) defines an \u201cenhancement\u201d as \u201can additional term of imprisonment added to the base term. \u201d An enhancement is not a separate crime or offense; thus, the reference to section 667.6 in the definition of aggregate and additional terms in section 1170.1 is necessarily limited to subdivisions (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">3. Waite meritlessly claims the apparent ambiguity is enhanced by defining a \u201cprincipal term\u201d in section 1170.1, subdivision (a), as \u201cthe greatest term of imprisonment imposed by the court <em>for any of the crimes,\u201d </em>apparently including (or at least not excluding) crimes sentenced under section 667.6. He asserts this language conflicts with the direction in section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d) that \u201c[sjuch term shall not be included in any determination pursuant to section 1170.1.\u201d First, we emphasize the definition of aggregate term does not include as an \u201cadditional term\u201d an offense for which sentence is imposed under section 667.6, subdivision (c) or subdivision (d). Second, the phrase \u201cany of the crimes\u201d refers only to those crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>governed by the computational provisions of section 1170.1 and its definition of an aggregate term. Oifenses punished under section 667.6, subdivisions (c) or (d) do not fall within the definition of aggregate term of section 1170.1, subdivision (a), because subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 667.6 expressly exclude their terms from any determination pursuant to section 1170.1. Because these sentencing schemes provide for separate and independent computations, the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>determination\u201d must be construed to include any factor within the formula used to compute the aggregate term, including the principal term, the subordinate term, and the additional term.  As a statutory rule of construction, it is settled \u201c[a] specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern a general provision, even though the general provision standing alone would be broad enough to include the subject to which the specific provision relates.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, 521 [156 Cal.Rptr. 450, 596 P.2d 328]; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 713, 723-724 [123 P.2d 505].) Consequently, it was unnecess\u00e1ry for the Legislature to include exclusionary language in the general statute, section 1170.1, subdivision (a), because it specifically and expressly excluded crimes sentenced under section 667.6 by express language within that specific legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In summary, sections 1170.1 and 667.6 are merely computational sentencing statutes, each designed for use when imposing consecutive sentences on those who commit forcible sex crimes as defined in sections 261, 264.1, 286, 288, 288a and 289. Which sentencing statute applies depends upon whether more than one forcible sex crime was committed and the circumstances surrounding those crimes. If only one of the multiple crimes is a forcible sex offense, it must be sentenced under section 1170.1 as a \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201csubordinate\u201d term with the other crimes. If more than one of the listed forcible sex crimes are sentenced together and they involve the same victim on the same occasion, the court has its option to sentence under either section 1170.1 or section 667.6, subdivision (c). Where the forcible sex crimes involve separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions, the court must sentence these crimes consecutively pursuant to section 667.6, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Therefore, the Legislature has enacted separate computational statutes for determining consecutive sentences. Section 1170.1, subdivision (a) is a general computational provision, and subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 667.6 each contains an exception to the general rule directing the trial court to calculate consecutive terms for forcible sex offenses independently and separately from the section 1170.1 general determination of an aggregate term, including its subparts. Sentences imposed under section 667.6, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>divisions (c) and (d) are independent and separate from, and may not be used in any sentence computation pursuant to, section 1170.1. Because computations under section 1170 or 1170.1 and those under subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 667.6 are to be made separately, a defendant\u2019s total sentence is obtained by adding together the sum of each computation. Accordingly, Waite was properly sentenced.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">At sentencing, neither Waite, the probation officer, nor the prosecution discussed the availability of an alternative CYA commitment. In these circumstances, the trial court had a duty to consider such referral on its own motion <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 755, 762 [83 Cal.Rptr. 411, 463 P.2d 763]) and, on this silent record, we must presume the sentencing court performed its official duty. (Ibid.; Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.) Further, although the probation report listed numerous factors potentially justifying a CYA commitment, the trial court need not state reasons for rejecting a Youth Authority commitment of a defendant who is over 18 at the time crimes are committed <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bracamonte </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 936, 940 [187 Cal.Rptr. 525]; Advisory Com. com. to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 443) and we can imply a finding of unsuitability of such a commitment from the fact a defendant is sentenced to state prison. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lujan </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 166, 170 [178 Cal.Rptr. 122].)

As to <em>Stought, </em>Waite mischaracterizes the facts within the case by stating Stought received \u201ctwo full consecutive terms for two forcible sex offenses and an eight-month consecutive term (i.e., one-third the middle base term) for <em>false imprisonment. \u201d </em>He then claims this sentence is not consistent with our holding because, if false imprisonment is indeed in a separate category from the forcible sex offenses, it would be served in full. However, <em>Stought </em>did not consider the sentencing issue and, more importantly, the two sex offenses were not (as inferred) each imposed fully consecutive under section 667.6. Rather, one was imposed as a principal term under section 1170.1 to which the false imprisonment was made a consecutive subordinate term. The other forcible sex crime was imposed consecutively to the total section 1170.1 sentence as a full consecutive term under section 667.6, subdivision (c). Thus <em>Stought, </em>although not discussing our issue, approved a sentence fully consistent with our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Moreover, our analysis is fully consistent with the recent decision of the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>34 Cal.3d 335, discussing the interrelationship of the specific sentencing scheme within subdivision (c) of section 667.6 and the general sentencing procedures of section 1170.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
