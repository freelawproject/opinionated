Any excess remaining after satisfaction of those amounts may be claimed by the former owners of the property. This appeal presents a single question: If the sole claimant to the excess proceeds is a party who had only a fractional ownership interest in the property before its sale by the state, is that party entitled to the entire excess, or only part of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The facts in this case are undisputed. Plaintiff and appellant First Corporation is the assignee of Loraine Powers, who had owned a one-seventh interest in a particular parcel of real property. That parcel was sold at a public tax sale on February 18, 1978, for $8,789.69 more than the delinquent taxes, interest and penalties on the secured roll for that property. Appellant filed a timely claim for the excess proceeds pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code sections 4674 and 4675<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was the sole claimant to the excess proceeds. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Clara approved appellant\u2019s claim in the amount of $1,259.67 only, which represents one-seventh of the excess proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Appellant petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel the board of supervisors to pay it the whole amount of the excess. That petition was denied by the superior court, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Section 4674 provides that the excess proceeds remaining after the unpaid tax assessments on the property and certain other charges are paid shall be held on account of the parties of interest in the property. Such proceeds may be claimed by the \u201cparties of interest,\u201d as defined in section 4675. Any excess proceeds which are unclaimed within one year of the tax sale are to be distributed to the taxing agencies which had unpaid assessments against the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">When appellant filed its claim for the excess proceeds, section 4675 required that the excess proceeds be distributed to parties of interest who had filed timely claim for them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>The distribution of excess proceeds to claiming parties of interest is a fairly recent legislative innovation. Before January 1, 1977, former section 4674 provided that all excess proceeds were to be distributed to the taxing agencies which had had unpaid assessments against the property. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1102, \u00a7 2, p. 2352.) The parties of interest had no rights in the excess proceeds. <em>(Chesney </em>v. <em>Gresham </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 120, 131 [134 Cal.Rptr. 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Appellant raises two contentions to support its claim to the entire excess proceeds. First, it contends that section 4675 \u201cclearly requires distribution of all excess proceeds\u201d to it as a claimant under subdivision (b) of section 4675. Second, it claims that certain public policy considerations compel distribution of the entire excess proceeds to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">There is language in section 4675 which indicates that both partial and total distributions of the excess proceeds to claimants were contemplated by the Legislature when it enacted the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This language does not, by itself, indicate the basis on which the appropriate distribution will be determined. There is other language, however, which does define appellant\u2019s rights in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Section 4674 says that the excess proceeds shall be deposited in the delinquent tax sale fund \u201con account of, and may be claimed by\u201d the parties of interest. Section 4675 says that excess proceeds shall be distributed only to the parties of interest who have claimed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>We hold that the parties\u2019 rights to the excess proceeds are created at the moment when the tax-delinquent property is sold by the state for an amount greater than the assessments on the property, and the excess proceeds come into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\u201cClaim\u201d is defined as \u201cto demand delivery of [something] by or as if by right.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1970) p. 414.) It has also been said that \u201c \u2018Claim\u2019 in its primary meaning, is used to indicate the assertion of an <em>existing right. </em>\u201d <em>(Mellus </em>v. <em>Potter </em>(1928) 91 Cal.App. 700, 704 [267 P. 563], italics in original.) The parties of interest therefore have a right to some share of the excess proceeds when the excess proceeds come into existence. The making of a claim for them is merely a request for their distribution on the basis of an existing right to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Inasmuch as the parties have a right to the proceeds even without claiming them, the question is who should succeed to these rights in the absence of their assertion by the filing of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The right to receive the proceeds and to claim them is property because it is an obligation which may be possessed and used to the exclusion of others. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 654, 655.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">A review of statutory provisions dealing with unclaimed property reveals a general rule that when rights to property are simultaneously created in several parties, the claiming parties do not succeed to the rights of the nonclaiming parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Property which is distributable in the course of the liquidation or dissolution of a business, and which is unclaimed by the owner within six months after the date of final distribution or liquidation, escheats to the state. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1517.) This means that shareholders in a corporation which is in liquidation have neither a right to unclaimed amounts owing to creditors, nor a right to the assets distributable to, but unclaimed by, other shareholders of the same class.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Similarly, a \u201cdividend, profit [or] distribution . . . held or owing by a business association for or to its shareholder, . . . member, ... or other security holder, or a participating patron of a cooperative,\u201d if unclaimed by the person to whom it is due, escheats to the state. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1516, subd. (a).) Thus, an unclaimed dividend payable to a shareholder is available neither to the business itself, nor to the other shareholders who claimed the dividends which were declared on their shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Unclaimed property \u201cheld in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of another person\u201d escheats to the state if it remains unclaimed for seven years after it becomes payable. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1518, subd. (a).) This would arguably apply in a situation where the terms of a trust instrument required the trustee to make periodic, identical payments to each member of a class of beneficiaries. If one beneficiary failed to claim the payments due her, those unclaimed payments would neither be returned to the corpus of the trust, nor be divided among the beneficiaries who had claimed their payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">If the entire balance of an estate is not distributed to known heirs, legatees or devisees entitled to succeed to it, the probate court must distribute the undistributed portion to the state. Any such property which is unclaimed after five years vests absolutely in the state. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1027.) It is not available for distribution to others who shared in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In <em>Estate of Costa </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 735 [241 P.2d 621], the decedent died intestate, leaving two savings accounts. The savings account balances were deposited in the state treasury. A great-nephew appeared and claimed those funds. The decedent had left neither descendants, ancestors nor spouse. He had five siblings, only one of whom, the claimant\u2019s grandmother, was known to have come to the United States from their birthplace in the Azores. Since the decedent\u2019s heirs, aside from the claimant\u2019s grandmother and her line, were nonresident aliens who had never appeared to claim their shares, the court held that their shares passed to the state, and the claiming great-nephew was entitled to only one-fifth of the amount on deposit with the state. <em>(Id., </em>109 Cal.App.2d at pp. 741-742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The principle common to all of these situations leads us to the conclusion that the other parties of interest under subdivision (b) of section 4675 were entitled to a share of the excess proceeds in proportion to their former ownership interest in the tax-delinquent property. Their ownership of a share of the excess proceeds was created when the excess proceeds came into existence. When they failed to file claims in assertion of their existing rights, appellant did not succeed to their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Appellant\u2019s second contention does not compel a different interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Appellant argues that the public policy, as embodied in the 1976 amendment of section 4674 and enactment of section 4675, dictates that the proceeds should be distributed to parties of interest, and not to the taxing agencies, whenever possible. This interpretation is incorrect. The statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>amendments do not create a presumption that the excess proceeds must be distributed to parties of interest if any means can be found to do so. Rather, they provide that the taxing agencies shall not take any portion of the excess proceeds which are properly claimed by the parties of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Nor may appellant take the entire excess proceeds to protect the rights of \u201cunknown partial interest holders.\u201d The statute specifies that a party\u2019s right may be asserted only by that party or its assignee. Appellant is the assignee of the rights of one who had owned a one-seventh undivided interest in the property. Appellant may assert only the rights arising out of the former one-seventh interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the lapse of rights through failure to assert them works an escheat, is incorrect. Property can \u201cescheat\u201d only to the state, and not to local governments. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1300, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Kline, P.
