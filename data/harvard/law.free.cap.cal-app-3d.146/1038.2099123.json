(L &amp; M) of an appurtenant easement for sewer and storm drainage across property owned by Frank E. Ferreira (Ferreira) and Milgen Investment Company (Milgen). L &amp; M then filed an eminent domain action to acquire the easement under the authority of Civil Code section 1001 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1245.325.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ferreira and Milgen unsuccessfully petitioned the superior court to invalidate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>Council\u2019s resolution of consent and to declare Civil Code section 1001 unconstitutional. The court also found in favor of L &amp; M in the eminent domain action and entered a judgment of condemnation for the easement. Ferreira and Milgen appeal both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Among their many arguments Ferreira and Milgen contend Civil Code section 1001 and section 1245.325 are unconstitutional both on their face and as applied. They also argue the Council denied them due process in the hearings it conducted before consenting to L &amp; M\u2019s proposed condemnation, and again challenge the validity of the Council\u2019s resolution of consent. Finally, Ferreira and Milgen argue the lower court erroneously applied the legal rather than market rate of interest to their condemnation award. As we shall explain, we reject these arguments and affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">We narrate the facts in some detail because of the substantial evidence review required by Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s challenge to the validity of the Council\u2019s resolution of consent. (See part III C, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">In 1978 L &amp; M purchased 10.9 acres of essentially undeveloped hillside property in Chula Vista commonly known as Villa San Miguel for $1,115,000. The property slopes downward in a northerly and northeasterly direction. Ferreira owns or controls all the property on Villa San Miguel\u2019s northern and eastern borders. Vehicular access to Villa San Miguel is from the southwest via Hilltop Drive. Stands of mature palm, pine and eucalyptus trees populate the property in the higher elevations near its southern border.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">In late 1978 L &amp; M began to prepare a tentative map for the construction of 18 expensive homes at Villa San Miguel. Chula Vista city planners set several guidelines for L &amp; M\u2019s project, including the preservation of the property\u2019s mature trees and rural character and the avoidance of extensive grading. These guidelines, combined with the property\u2019s topography, precluded gravity sewerage and drainage to Hilltop Drive. Consequently, L &amp; M\u2019s tentative map proposed locating a sewer easement across Ferreira property north of Villa San Miguel. Drainage was to be onsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">In early 1979 the Chula Vista Planning Commission and the Council held separate public hearings on L &amp; M\u2019s tentative map. Ferreira and his attorney each spoke at both hearings in opposition to L &amp; M\u2019s project. They criticized the lack of offsite drainage for the project and described a history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>of flooding and drainage problems on Ferreira properties resulting from rain water flowing north off of Villa San Miguel. They also claimed L &amp; M\u2019s proposed sewer easement would interfere with existing underground utilities. The Council approved L &amp; M\u2019s tentative map after L &amp; M agreed to provide offsite drainage and to relocate the sewer easement across a vacant lot northeast of Villa San Miguel. The lot is 0.89 acres in size and had a 1978-1979 assessed value of $10,600. Ferreira and Milgen own the lot through a partnership in which Ferreira acts as the managing partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Following the Council\u2019s approval of the tentative map, L &amp; M and Ferreira discussed locations for a sewer and storm drainage easement across Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s property. L &amp; M proposed three locations and Ferreira proposed one. After negotiations proved fruitless, L &amp; M sought Council consent to its condemnation of an easement across Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s property. The Council noticed a hearing on L &amp; M\u2019s proposed condemnation and then postponed the hearing for three weeks at Ferreira\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The postponed hearing convened on August 14, 1979. The hearing transcript is lengthy and shows Ferreira and his attorney each participated extensively, as did Ferreira\u2019s engineer. The Council heard testimony and received maps and diagrams describing three alternatives: a \u201cred easement\u201d location proposed by L &amp; M, a \u201cblue easement #1\u201d location proposed by Ferreira and a \u201cno-condemnation\u201d proposal by Ferreira for development of Villa San Miguel with gravity sewerage and drainage to Hilltop Drive. Ferreira also presented his plans to develop a 27-unit apartment complex on his and Milgen\u2019s property, and described the initial work (site planning and retaining wall) he had completed on that project. After the parties completed their comments, the Council closed the public hearing and deferred taking action for two weeks to allow its staff additional time to study Ferreira\u2019s development plans and blue easement #1 proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">On August 28, 1979, the Council reconvened. Ferreira and his attorney again were present. Council staff presented an evaluation of the three alternatives discussed on August 14. The staff also commented on a \u201cblue easement #2\u201d location Ferreira proposed to them during the two-week continuance. After the staff\u2019s comments, and without allowing further public testimony, the Council adopted the staff\u2019s recommendation to approve L &amp; M\u2019s condemnation of a 10-foot wide sewer and storm drainage easement at Ferreira\u2019s blue easement #1 location. One week later the Council unanimously adopted a corresponding resolution of consent. (\u00a7\u00a7 1245.330, 1245.360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>The Council rejected Ferreira\u2019s no-condemnation proposal because it would have required importing 80,000 cubic yards of fill costing more than $500,000 and clustering the 18 homes near Hilltop Drive rather than spreading them out on large lots. The Council also rejected Ferreira\u2019s blue easement #2 proposal because it would have violated a city ordinance requiring open space above easements, thus creating a serious service and maintenance problem for the city. As between the red easement and blue easement #1 proposals, the Council selected the latter alternative after Ferreira\u2019s attorney testified on August 14 that it would \u201ccreate the least damage\u201d to development plans for Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s property and would \u201cnot in any way interfere with the highest and best use of that property.\u201d L &amp; M estimated its condemnation and utility installation costs at the blue easement #1 location would be $106,000, approximately double its estimated costs at the red easement location.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In September 1979 L &amp; M filed an action to condemn the easement approved by the Council and deposited the probable compensation for the easement. (\u00a7 1255.010.) In October L &amp; M obtained an order for possession of the easement as of mid-November. (\u00a7 1255.410.) Ferreira and Milgen did not withdraw the deposited compensation (\u00a7 1255.210) or seek a stay of the order for possession. (\u00a7\u00a7 1255.420, 1255.430.) Instead, they petitioned the superior court in December for a writ of mandate (\u00a7 1094.5) ordering the Council to rescind its resolution of consent and declaring Civil Code section 1001 unconstitutional. In May 1981 the lower court entered a judgment on an order denying Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s petition. Five months later the court entered a judgment for L &amp; M condemning the easement approved by the Council. That judgment required L &amp; M to pay Ferreira and Milgen $8,400 compensation for the easement plus 7 percent legal interest on that amount from mid-November 1979. (\u00a7 1268.310, subd. (c).) One month after the judgment of condemnation was entered L &amp; M deposited the balance due Ferreira and Milgen under the judgment. (\u00a7 1268.110.) Sometime after making that deposit L &amp; M took possession of the condemned easement. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Constitution a lit y of Private Condemnation Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">\n<em>Legislative History and Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">In 1975 the Legislature enacted a thoroughly revised and recodified eminent domain law. (\u00a7 1230.010 et seq.) Before that enactment former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>Civil Code section 1001 authorized private persons to condemn private property for any public use listed in former section 1238. (Stats. 1970, ch. 662, \u00a7 1, pp. 1285-1288; Recommendation Proposing the Eminent Domain Law (Dec. 1974) 12 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1974) p. 1634.) The 1975 eminent domain law abolished all private condemnation authority, except for that exercised by privately owned public utilities and five types of quasi-public entities. (Recommendation Relating to Condemnation for Byroads and Utility Easements (Oct. 1975) 13 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1976) p. 1475.) The Legislature considered the former law constitutionally suspect because it seemed to authorize private condemnation for predominantly private purposes. (Sen. Legis. Com. com., 1976 Repeal of \u00a7 1238, 19 West's Ann. Code Civ. Proc., pp. 452, 463, 465-466.) With the advent of the new law private persons seeking the extension of utility service to their property could request the appropriate public entity undertake the necessary condemnation on their behalf. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 452, 456, 468.) This approach, however, proved unworkable due to the reluctance or unwillingness of many public entities to condemn utility easements on behalf of private persons. (Recommendation Relating to Condemnation for Byroads and Utility Easements (Oct. 1975) 13 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 1476.) Consequently, the Legislature in 1976 restored private condemnation authority to owners of private property for the limited purpose of acquiring appurtenant easements to provide utility service to their property. This authority, codified in Civil Code section 1001 and section 1245.325, is designed to serve \u201c. . . the function of opening what would otherwise be landlocked property to enable its most beneficial use. As a practical matter, land to which utility service cannot be extended . . . cannot be developed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1475-1476, fn. omitted.) Toward that end, Civil Code section 1001 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">\u201c(a) As used in this section, \u2018utility service\u2019 means water, gas, electric, drainage, sewer, or telephone service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-7\">\u201c(b) Any owner of real property may acquire by eminent domain an appurtenant easement to provide utility service to the owner\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">\u201c(c) In lieu of the requirements of Section 1240.030 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the power of eminent domain may be exercised to acquire an appurtenant easement under this section only if all of the following are established:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">\u201c(1) There is a great necessity for the taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">\u201c(2) The location of the easement affords the most reasonable service to the property to which it is appurtenant, consistent with the least damage to the burdened property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>\u201c(3) The hardship to the owner of the appurtenant property, if the taking is not permitted, clearly outweighs any hardship to the owner of the burdened property.\u201d In like manner, section 1245.325 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">\u201cWhere an owner of real property seeks to acquire an appurtenant easement by eminent domain pursuant to Section 1001 of the Civil Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">\u201c(a) The person seeking to exercise the power of eminent domain shall be deemed to be a \u2018quasi-public entity\u2019 for the purposes of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">\u201c(b) In lieu of the requirements of subdivision (c) of Section 1245.340, the resolution required by this article shall contain a declaration that the legislative body has found and determined each of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-8\">\u201c(1) There is a great necessity for the taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-9\">\u201c(2) The location of the easement affords the most reasonable service to the property to which it is appurtenant, consistent with the least damage to the burdened property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-10\">\u201c(3) The hardship to the owner of the appurtenant property, if the taking is not permitted, clearly outweighs any hardship to the owner of the burdened property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">\n<em>Facial Constitutionality\u2014Great Necessity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">To prevent abuses which had been possible under the former eminent domain law, the Legislature made the new private condemnation authority subject to several limitations. (Recommendation Relating to Condemnation for Byroads and Utility Easements (Oct. 1975) 13 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 1476-1477.) One of those limitations is that a \u201cgreat necessity\u201d must exist for the proposed taking. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1001, subd. (c)(1); \u00a7 1245.325, subd. (b)(1).) This limitation replaces the usual \u201cpublic interest and necessity\u201d requirement (\u00a7\u00a7 1240.030, subd. (a), 1245.230, subd. (c)(1), 1245.340, subd. (c)(1)) with a stricter standard applicable only to the private condemnation of utility easements. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1001, subd. (c); \u00a7 1245.325, subd. (b); see Cal. Law Revision Com. coms., 1976 addition, 7 West's Ann. Civ. Code (1982 ed.) \u00a7 1001, p. 573 and 19 West's Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1982 ed.) \u00a7 1245.325, p. 606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">Ferreira and Milgen contend Civil Code section 1001, subdivision (c)(1) and section 1245.325, subdivision (b)(1) are unconstitutionally vague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>because they do not contain a specific standard for determining when a \u201cgreat necessity\u201d exists for the private condemnation of a utility easement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   We consider this argument in light of the principles that \u201c. . . enactments should be interpreted when possible to uphold their validity [citation], and . . . courts should construe enactments to give specific content to terms that might otherwise be unconstitutionally vague. [Citations.]\u201d (Associated <em>Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 598 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038].) We must, of course, look to legislative intent in providing such content so that the purpose of the statutes will be achieved. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shirokow </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 301, 306-307 [162 Cal.Rptr. 30, 605 P.2d 859].)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">As noted above, the Legislature enacted Civil Code section 1001 and section 1245.325 to enable the development of private property to its most beneficial use. Whether and how utility service can be provided to a piece of property typically depend on a number of factors, including applicable land use regulations, environmental impacts of development, anticipated service requirements, physical characteristics of the property and various cost/benefit considerations. Usually these requirements can be satisfied and utility service provided without resort to private condemnation. Occasionally, however, the necessary conditions for providing service without condemnation cannot all be met.  Here, for example, Ferreira\u2019s no-condemnation proposal would have required importing 80,000 cubic yards of fill costing more than $500,000 and clustering the 18 homes near Hilltop Drive rather than spreading them out on large lots. This approach would have violated development and environmental guidelines established by Chula Vista city planners and would have been inordinately expensive in light of total project development costs which, at the time of trial, were expected to reach approximately $6.8 million. Under these circumstances, Ferreira\u2019s no-condemnation proposal was not a reasonably acceptable means for providing utility service to Villa San Miguel. Stated another way, a \u201cgreat necessity\u201d existed for L &amp; M\u2019s condemnation of a sewer and storm drainage easement across Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s property because, without such an easement, Villa San Miguel could not be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">As illustrated by this case, determining whether a \u201cgreat necessity\u201d exists for the private condemnation of a utility easement does not turn on a comparative evaluation of condemnation and noncondemnation alternatives. \u201cGreat necessity\u201d does not exist when a condemnation alternative is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>preferable than a reasonably acceptable noncondemnation alternative. Under such circumstances a piece of property is not \u201cotherwise\u201d landlocked. (See Recommendation Relating to Condemnation for Byroads and Utility Easements (Oct. 1975) 13 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 1475-1476.) \u201cGreat necessity\u201d exists only when a condemnation alternative is the sole reasonably acceptable means for providing utility service to a piece of property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This interpretation is consistent with the rationale of <em>Linggi </em>v. <em>Garovotti </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 20 [286 P.2d 15], a landmark private condemnation case which explained a \u201csomewhat stronger showing\u201d of necessity must be made for the private condemnation of a utility easement. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 27.) Although the Supreme Court held Linggi\u2019s general allegation of necessity for his proposed sewer easement was sufficient to survive a demurrer, it observed Linggi upon a trial \u201c. . . might be denied the easement which he is endeavoring to obtain if [an] other remedy is available to him which would be less injurious to private property. For example, the evidence may show that the proper public authorities have not been asked to enlarge the present facilities in [front of Linggi\u2019s property] and make that line adequate to carry off all of the sewage from Linggi\u2019s property. [Citation.]\u201d (Ib<em>id.) </em>Thus, Linggi would be denied his proposed easement if a reasonably acceptable noncondemnation alternative was available to provide sewer service to his property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because such an alternative was not available here, the Council correctly determined a \u201cgreat necessity\u201d existed for L &amp; M\u2019s condemnation of a sewer and storm drainage easement across Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\n<em>Facial Constitutionality\u2014Public Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Ferreira and Milgen next point out Civil Code section 1001 and section 1245.325 do not require utility easements be taken only for public uses. They argue these omissions violate the United States and California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Constitutions in two ways. First, the omissions violate the Constitutions\u2019 requirements that private property be condemned only for public uses. (U.S. Const., Amends. V, XIV, \u00a7 1; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19; see generally McDonald &amp; Noll, <em>Review of Selected 1976 California Legislation </em>(1977) 8 Pacific L.J. 165, 462-463.) Second, the omissions create two groups of property owners: those subject to takings by quasi-public entities whose powers of eminent domain are limited to public uses (\u00a7 1245.320), and those subject to takings by quasi-public entities whose condemnation powers are not so limited. (\u00a7 1245.325.) This classification denies the second group of property owners the equal protection of the laws. (U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).) In considering these arguments we must construe the challenged statutes in context and harmonize them with companion provisions of an overall statutory system. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shirokow, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The above arguments wrongly assume public use requirements should have been included in Civil Code section 1001 and section 1245.325. In these statutes the Legislature empowered private property owners to acquire utility easements by eminent domain. These provisions thus constituted a legislative declaration that the private condemnation of utility easements is for a public use. (\u00a7 1240.010.) It was therefore unnecessary to include requirements which such takings satisfy by definition. Even so, the Legislature did include public use requirements applicable to such takings in other provisions of the new eminent domain law. Civil Code section 1001, subdivision (c) supplants the specific requirements of section 1240.030. However, it does not abrogate the fundamental public use limitation applicable to all takings by public and quasi-public entities. (\u00a7\u00a7 1240.010, 1245.380; see Law Revision Com. com., 1976 addition, 7 West's Ann. Civ. Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1001, p. 573.) Similarly, section 1245.325, subdivision (b) supplants only the requirements of section 1245.340, subdivision (c). The public use limitation of section 1245.340, subdivision (a) still applies to all takings by quasi-public entities. (See Law Revision Com. com., 1976 addition, 19 West's Ann. Code Civ. Proc., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1245.325, p. 606.) Civil Code section 1001 and section 1245.325 are not facially unconstitutional for allowing the condemnation of private property for private uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">\n<em>Contitutionality as Applied\u2014Public Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Ferreira and Milgen further argue Civil Code section 1001 and section 1245.325 are unconstitutional as applied in this case. They argue L &amp; M will profit from its development of an exclusive residential neighborhood, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>and thus its condemnation of their property is for a private rather than a public use. There is no question, however, that L &amp; M intends to use its easement to provide sewer and storm drainage service to Villa San Miguel. \u201c[I]t is clear that the ordinary taking of private property for the purpose of constructing storm drainage systems is a taking for a public use.\u201d <em>(Bauer </em>v. <em>County of Ventura </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 276, 284 [289 P.2d 1]; see also <em>Marin </em>v. <em>City of San Rafael </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 591, 595 [168 Cal.Rptr. 750]; 2A Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d rev. ed. 1981) \u00a7 7.5155, p. 7-179.) Condemnation of private property to provide sewer service also is a taking for a public use.

If that act was adjudicative rather than legislative, then procedural due process requirements apply <em>(Horn </em>v. <em>County of Ventura </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 612-613 [156 Cal.Rptr. 718, 596 P.2d 1134]) and judicial review of the Council\u2019s decision to consent is by administrative (\u00a7 1094.5) rather than traditional (\u00a7 1085) mandamus. (St<em>rumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 34-35, fn. 2 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29].) Arguably, the function the Council performed by its act was, in substance, the exercise of its power of eminent domain. (See \u00a7 1245.330.) That power is an inherent attribute of sovereignty <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Oakland Raiders, supra, </em>32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 64; 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Constitutional Law, \u00a7 529, subd. (a), p. 3828) and its exercise is a legislative act under both federal <em>(Joiner </em>v. <em>City of Dallas </em>(N.D.Tex. 1974) 380 F.Supp. 754, 764-766, 769-771, affd., 419 U.S. 1042 [42 L.Ed.2d 637, 95 S.Ct. 614], rehg. den., 419 U.S. 1132 [42 L.Ed.2d 831, 95 S.Ct. 818]; see generally 1 Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d rev. ed. 1981) \u00a7 4.11, pp. 4-138 to 4-153) and California Law <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chevalier </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 299, 304 [340 P.2d 598]; <em>Wulzen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1894) 101 Cal. 15, 21 [35 P. 353]). Thus, under one line of cases, the Council\u2019s act was legislative. (Pi<em>tts </em>v. <em>Perluss </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 824, 834 [377 P.2d 83]; <em>City of Chula Vista </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 472, 486 [183 Cal.Rptr. 909]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hidden Valley Mun. Water Dist. </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 271, 280 [63 Cal.Rptr. 889].) Given, however, the particularity of the Council\u2019s decision and the small size and number of parcels involved and relatively few property owners aifected, its act may have been adjudicative. (Pa<em>cific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 168 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306]; <em>Horn </em>v. <em>County of Ventura, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 612-614; but see <em>Arnel Development Co. </em>v. <em>City of Costa Mesa </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 511, 514, 516-519, 522-523 [169 Cal.Rptr. 904, 620 P.2d 565].) Faced with this uncertainty the Council took the prudent course by treating its act as adjudicative. (See <em>Mountain Defense League </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 723, 729 [135 Cal.Rptr. 588].) Because we conclude the Council\u2019s decision to consent withstands scrutiny under the stricter standards applicable to adjudicative acts, we do not resolve the threshold classification issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">\u201cDue process principles require reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before governmental <em>deprivation </em>of a significant property interest. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Horn </em>v. <em>County of Ventura, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 612, citing California and federal cases, italics added.) Such principles apply to temporary as well as final deprivations of property. <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>Small Claims Court </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 661, 666-667 [105 Cal.Rptr. 785, 504 P.2d 1249], citing California and federal cases).  Viewed from a practical standpoint, the Council\u2019s act in consenting to L &amp; M\u2019s condemnation did not deprive Ferreira and Milgen, even temporarily, of any interest in their property. The final deprivation resulted from the entry of the lower court\u2019s judgment of condemnation. Before that, no temporary deprivation occurred. Although L &amp; M obtained an order for possession as of mid-November 1979, Ferreira and Milgen challenged that order through their mandamus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>proceeding (see Assem. Legis. Com. com., 1975 addition, 19 West's Ann. Code Civ. Proc., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1255.410, pp. 705-706) and remained in possession until after L &amp; M deposited the balance due them under the judgment of condemnation. Thus the practical effect of the Council\u2019s act was simply to authorize L &amp; M to commence a private condemnation action against Ferreira and Milgen. In that action L &amp; M bore the burden of proving the propriety of its proposed taking. (See <em>Linggi </em>v. <em>Garovotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d at p. 27; Recommendation Relating to Condemnation for Byroads and Utility Easements (Oct. 1975) 13 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 1477; compare \u00a7 1245.250.) Ferreira and Milgen do not contend the lower court denied them a reasonable opportunity to be heard during the trial of L &amp; M\u2019s condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">As noted above, the Council treated its decision to consent as an adjudicative act, and even though there was no deprivation of property, procedural due process requirements applied. <em>(Horn </em>v. <em>County of Ventura, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 612-613.) Ferreira and Milgen argue the Council denied them due process by not allowing them to discuss the blue easement #2 proposal at the August 28 hearing. They concede they had a reasonable opportunity to be heard regarding the three alternatives considered on August 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">There is an inherent tension in a hearing procedure such as the Council conducted between encouraging a full exploration of utility service alternatives and reaching a timely decision regarding whether to adopt a resolution of consent. The basic issues the decisionmaking agency (\u00a7 1245.310) should address through such a procedure are whether to consent to a proposed taking and, if so, to determine the appropriate location for the taking. The Council considered both issues on August 14. Having received adequate notice and a three-week postponement of the August 14 hearing, and having previously negotiated with L &amp; M regarding its proposed condemnation of a utility easement across their property, there was no reason for Ferreira and Milgen to present to the Council on August 14 anything less than a comprehensive statement of their position. They did in fact contest both the necessity and appropriate location for L &amp; M\u2019s proposed condemnation. Having spoken to the basic issues to be addressed, the fact Ferreira and Milgen later had another idea for a different location does not mean they had a due process right to another hearing. (See <em>Dami </em>v. <em>Dept. Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>(1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 144, 151 [1 Cal.Rptr. 213].) To hold they had such a right would be to hold the requirement of a reasonable opportunity to be heard includes the right, in effect, to have the last word in a decision making agency\u2019s hearing procedure. Were that the law, decisions regarding whether to adopt resolutions of consent could be endlessly delayed by the inadvertent omissions or deliberate strategies of prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>condemnees. Due process cannot become a vehicle for bringing the process of government to a halt. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Council\u2019s hearing procedure did not violate Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s due process rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">\n<em>Validity of Council\u2019s Resolution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">An administrative decision which \u201csubstantially affects fundamental vested rights\u201d <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 144 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]) invokes judicial review under the independent judgment rule of section 1094.5. Other adjudicative acts are subject to review under that section\u2019s substantial evidence test. <em>(Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at pp. 32, 44-45.)  We are satisfied Ferreira\u2019s and Milgen\u2019s interests in their property represented \u201cfundamental vested rights.\u201d (See <em>Unterthiner </em>v. <em>Desert Hospital Dist. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 285, 294-296 [188 Cal.Rptr. 590, 656 P.2d 554]; <em>Mountain Defense League </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d at pp. 728, 730.) The Council\u2019s act in consenting to L &amp; M\u2019s condemnation, however, did not \u201csubstantially affect\u201d those rights because, as explained above (see part III B), it did not deprive Ferreira and Milgen of any interest in their property. (See ibid.; see also <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at pp. 144-147.) Consequently, the substantial evidence test applies to our review of the Council\u2019s decision to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">In applying the substantial evidence test \u201c. . . a reviewing court . . . must scrutinize the record and determine whether substantial evidence supports the administrative agency\u2019s findings and whether these findings support the agency\u2019s decision. In making these determinations, the reviewing court must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative findings and decision.\u201d <em>(Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12].) So long as they are sufficient to apprise a reviewing court of the basis for the agency\u2019s decision <em>(id., </em>at pp. 514, 517, fn. 16), the necessary findings may be formal or informal and may be contained in the agency\u2019s order or decision. <em>(Hadley </em>v. <em>City of Ontario </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 121, 128 [117 Cal.Rptr. 513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">The Council\u2019s findings appear in the text of its resolution of consent. We have reproduced that resolution in an appendix to this opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>with paragraph numbers added in brackets for easy reference. The findings contained in the resolution satisfy all applicable statutory requirements and thus support the Council\u2019s decision to consent. Paragraphs 6 through 9 generally describe the public uses to be served by L &amp; M\u2019s easement (\u00a7\u00a7 1240.010, 1245.340, subd. (a)), and paragraph 11 identifies the statutory authority for L &amp; M\u2019s condemnation of that easement (\u00a7 1245.340, subd. (a)). Paragraphs 1, 9 and 10, with accompanying exhibits, describe quite precisely the location and extent of the easement to be taken. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1001, subd. (c)(1); \u00a7 1245.340, subd. (b).) Paragraphs 13 and 14 explain the great necessity for L &amp; M\u2019s taking of the easement (\u00a7 1245.325, subd. (b)(1)), while paragraph 15 justifies the location selected for the taking (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1001, subd. (c)(2); \u00a7 1245.325, subd. (b)(2)). Finally, paragraph 16 presents the Council\u2019s assessment of the relative hardships the parties would bear if the taking was either disapproved or permitted. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1001, subd. (c)(3); \u00a7 1245.325, subd. (b)(3).) The pertinent evidence supporting these findings also appears in the Council\u2019s resolution. (See ft 2, 4-8, 13-16.) That evidence was presented to the Council by its staff and the parties at the hearings on August 14 and 28. Taken together with the other evidence presented to the Council at those hearings (see part I, <em>ante), </em>we conclude the Council\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Rate of Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">In their final argument Ferreira and Milgen contend the lower court violated their rights to \u201cjust compensation\u201d under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by applying the legal rather than market rate of interest to their $8,400 condemnation award. Authority exists for awarding interest at either rate. (Legal rate: <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1923) 263 U.S. 78, 86-87 [68 L.Ed. 171, 182, 44 S.Ct. 92]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baugh </em>(5th Cir. 1945) 149 F.2d 190, 193; see also 3 Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d rev. ed. 1981) \u00a7 8.63[3] at pp. 8-360 to 8-362; market rate; <em>United States </em>v. <em>429.59 Acres of Land </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 612 F.2d 459, 464, 465; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blankinship </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 543 F.2d 1272, 1276-1277.) Ferreira and Milgen argue, in essence, they have not received an adequate return on their condemnation award. They do not challenge the adequacy of the award itself. In the particular circumstances of this case, we need not resolve the constitutional issue Ferreira and Milgen raise. In addition to 7 percent legal interest, Ferreira and Milgen have received value from remaining in possession until after L &amp; M deposited the balance due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>them under the judgment of condemnation.
