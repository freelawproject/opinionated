Code, \u00a7 4852.01, et seq.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Inasmuch as it appears that appeal is an inadequate remedy, this court has issued an alternative writ of mandate. <em>(Hogya </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 122, 128 [142 Cal.Rptr. 325].) We agree with petitioner that the superior court erred in denying his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>Petitioner pled guilty to rape and assault charges (\u00a7\u00a7 261, subd. (2) and 220) on December 16, 1975. On February 6, 1976, criminal proceedings were suspended and petitioner was committed to Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sex offender (MDSO). He was released from Atascadero on December 9, 1977, and treated as an outpatient.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Criminal proceedings were resumed on October 26, 1978 (former Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6325.1, subd. (a)). On November 27, 1978, petitioner was placed on three years\u2019 probation. His motion to set aside the plea and dismiss charges was granted January 13, 1982. (\u00a7 1203.4.) On July 2, 1982, petitioner moved for a certification of rehabilitation. (\u00a7 4852.01, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A petition for a certificate of rehabilitation is the first step that an ex-felon must take in seeking a pardon from the Governor. The ex-felon must establish that during a prescribed period he has met certain conditions which demonstrate his rehabilitation. (\u00a7 4852.08.) Should the court determine that the ex-felon has established his rehabilitation, it shall issue a certificate of rehabilitation and recommend that the Governor grant a full pardon to petitioner. (\u00a7 4852.13.) A full pardon restores all rights, privileges and franchises to the ex-felon. (\u00a7 4853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of rehabilitation was argued on December 16, 1982. The court found that petitioner\u2019s release on probation (Nov. 27, 1978)\u2014not his release as a MDSO outpatient (Dec. 9, 1977)\u2014 was the controlling date for the purposes of commencing the running of the five-year period set forth in section 4852.03.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court, in denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>petition, ruled that petitioner was not eligible for a certificate of rehabilitation until five years had run from the date that he was placed on probation (Nov. 27, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">At the outset we are confronted with real party\u2019s argument that the petition for a certificate of rehabilitation, filed on July 2, 1982, was submitted prematurely. Real party contends that the petition could not <em>be filed, </em>under petitioner\u2019s theory, until five years after his date of release as a MDSO outpatient (Dec. 9, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">There is no claim that real party was misled or prejudiced by the early filing of the petition. Moreover, real party failed to raise the problem by a motion to dismiss at a time when the defect could have been cured. The premature filing of the petition harmed no one; at its worst it offended a sense of legal propriety. The argument advanced by real party only serves to undercut the policy of liberal construction of section 4852.03 in order \u201cto promote the objective of alleviating the collateral consequences of a felony conviction.\u201d <em>(Daudert </em>v. <em>People </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 580, 587 [156 Cal.Rptr. 640].) We therefore treat the petition for a certificate of rehabilitation as being timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Petitioner asserts that a \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation would construe the phrase, \u201cdischarge of the petitioner from custody due to . . . his release on parole,\u201d to include MDSO outpatients. He alludes to certain similarities between a parolee and MDSO outpatient. For example, both are required to have an appropriate program of supervision by state officials. (Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 3052 and 3053 with \u00a7\u00a7 1603, 1604, and 1605.) Moreover, parolees and MDSO outpatients remain under legal custody subject to reimprisonment. (Cf. \u00a7 3056 with \u00a7\u00a7 1609-1610.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">On the other hand, there are significant differences in the status of MDSO outpatients and parolees. The statutory scheme governing parolees does not apply to MDSO outpatients. (\u00a7 3000 et seq.) The confinement of MDSO\u2019s is for the purpose of <em>treatment, </em>not punishment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saffell </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 223, 229 [157 Cal.Rptr. 897, 599 P.2d 92].) The Legislature has made a clear distinction between those adjudged incompetent under section 1026 and those classified MDSO. In the former classification, the Penal Code refers to the party as being under \u201cparole treatment.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1611, 1613.) At no time is the MDSO outpatient referred to in this manner. Accordingly, we find that petitioner\u2019s status as a MDSO outpatient is not, for the purposes of section 4852.03, equivalent to being released on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Thus, we are confronted with the question of whether section 4852.03 operates to deny petitioner his right of equal protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>law.  When reviewing legislative classifications under the equal protection clauses of the United States and California Constitutions, the classification is generally presumed to be constitutional. <em>(D'Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 16-17 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].) \u201cHowever, once it is determined that the classification scheme affects a fundamental interest or right the burden shifts; thereafter <em>the state </em>must first establish that it has a <em>compelling </em>interest which justifies the law and then demonstrate that the distinctions drawn by the law are <em>necessary </em>to further that purpose.\u201d (Italics in original.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236, 251 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375].)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Petitioner asserts that his right to vote, a fundamental right, is at stake in this proceeding and urges that this court apply the strict scrutiny test. Article II, section 4 of the California Constitution bars the right to vote to those who are \u201cmentally incompetent or imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony.\u201d (See also, Elec. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 701, 707; <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Riggs </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 138 [145 Cal.Rptr. 573].) Since petitioner is not mentally incompetent, not imprisoned and not on parole, his right to vote is not impaired. Accordingly, our inquiry must be directed to the question of whether or not the statutory classification bears a \u201crational relationship\u201d to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. <em>(Westbrook </em>v. <em>Mihaly </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 765, 784 [87 Cal.Rptr. 839, 471 P.2d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Real party asserts that a \u201ccompelling\u201d state interest supports the discriminatory classification scheme. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saffell, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 233-235.) In <em>Saffell, </em>our Supreme Court held that equal protection does not require that MDSO\u2019s receive \u201cgood time\u201d credit for good conduct during their institutionalization in a state hospital, even though prison inmates are eligible for such credits while in prison. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Waitley) </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 39 [180 Cal.Rptr. 790].)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Justice Richardson\u2019s opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Saffell, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 223 at pages 234-235, enumerates five reasons<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that underlie the disparate treat-</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ment of <em>institutionalized </em>MDSO\u2019s. However, none of the reasons mentioned by Justice Richardson are applicable to the situation presented here. Indeed, the discriminatory treatment of MDSO outpatients only serves to hamper the societal goal of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">An ex-felon is subject to a wide array of \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of his criminal conviction.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For example, an ex-felon cannot engage in certain businesses (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 480); must register with local law enforcement authorities if his oifense related to certain sex charges (\u00a7 290; but see <em>In re Reed </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 914 [191 Cal.Rptr. 658, 663 P.2d 216]); loses the right to possess arms (\u00a7 12021); and, if he testifies in court, may be impeached on the basis of his prior felony conviction (Evid. Code, \u00a7 788). A number of these disabilities may be removed once the ex-felon has obtained a certificate of rehabilitation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The continued imposition of punitive disabilities\u2014long after the ex-felon has served his time and demonstrated for a period of years that he is able to live crime-free in society\u2014 frustrates the goal of rehabilitation and thereby increases the likelihood of recidivism.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the societal goal of rehabilitation is to represent something more than a hollow promise, it is imperative that the ex-felon be freed of these disabilities at the earliest feasible moment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Although \u201cthe purpose of imprisonment for crime is punishment\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(1)), rehabilitation remains an important consideration in the treatment of criminals. <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 674, 687 [3 Cal.Rptr. 127]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Sovereign), <em>supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at pp. 148-149.) Professor Herbert Morris in his provocative article <em>Persons and Punishment </em>in The Monist (Oct. 1968), argues that punishment derives from a person\u2019s inalienable right to be treated as a human being. It gives one who has violated society\u2019s rules in the past the opportunity to pay a debt back to society and restore the equilibrium which has been upset. This is a way of achieving rehabilitation. Therapy, which focuses on the present with an eye towards cure, may serve to deny a person his individuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Despite this intriguing philosophical dilemma, petitioner has paid his debt to society via the penal and therapy mode. We should not add an additional debt by prolonging the time for which he is eligible for a certificate of rehabilitation. The goal of rehabilitation whether achieved by way of punishment or therapy becomes all the more significant upon the realization that \u201cmost offenders will eventually return to society.\u201d <em>(Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 817, 823 [41 L.Ed.2d 495, 502, 94 S.Ct. 2800]; see also 2 Criminal Law Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1969) \u00a7 19.8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Section 4852.03 relates to the rehabilitation goal of the corrections process. <em>(Daudert </em>v. <em>People, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 588, fn. 5.) In proceedings brought under section 4852.03, the critical inquiry is whether the ex-felon has demonstrated an ability to conform postinstitutional behavior to the norms of society. The factors which a court considers in determining whether there has been rehabilitation are virtually identical in cases involving MDSO outpatients and as they are in cases involving ex-felons on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Here, the record demonstrates that, for a period beginning with his release from Atascadero on December 9, 1977, petitioner has avoided committing any criminal acts. We are unable to conceive of any logical reason why, for the purposes of timely filing a petition for rehabilitation, this individual ought to be treated any differently than would have been the case had he been given the bureaucratic label of a \u201cparolee\u201d rather than an \u201cMDSO outpatient. \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue ordering that respondent superior court vacate its order denying petitioner\u2019s petition for a certificate of reha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>bilitation on the grounds that it was brought prematurely. Respondent is directed to enter a new order finding that the petition for a certificate of rehabilitation is not premature and conduct further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Stone, P. J., and Abbe, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On October 6, 1983, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Section 4852.01, subdivision (c) reads, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person convicted of a felony the accusatory pleading of which has been dismissed pursuant to Section 1203.4 may file a petition for certificate of rehabilitation and pardon pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; provided the petitioner has not been incarcerated in any prison, jail, detention facility or other penal institution or agency since the dismissal of the accusatory pleading and is not on probation for the commission of any other felony, and petitioner presents satisfactory evidence of three years residence in this state prior to the filing of the petition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Section 4852.03 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u201cThe period of rehabilitation shall begin to run upon the discharge of the petitioner from custody due to his completion of the term to which he was sentenced or upon his release on parole or probation, whichever is sooner. For purposes of this chapter, the period of rehabilitation shall constitute three years\u2019 residence in this state, plus a period of time determined by the following rules:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">\u201c(2) To the three years there shall be added two years in the case of any person convicted of committing any offense which is not listed in subdivision (1) and which does not carry a life sentence.\u201d [Petitioner\u2019s conviction did not involve one of the crimes set forth in subdivision (1).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">\u201c(4) .... Unless and until the period of rehabilitation, as stipulated herein, has passed, the petitioner shall be ineligible to file his petition for a certificate of rehabilitation with the court. Any certificate of rehabilitation which is issued and under which the petitioner has not fulfilled the requirements of this chapter shall be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">\u201cFirst, the very concept of \u2018giving\u2019 or \u2018taking away\u2019 time credits might materially interfere with other principles central to the operation of a therapeutic program. We cannot presume that hospital programs in general, and staff-patient relationships in particular, will benefit from a procedure in which patients are threatened with varying lengths of commitment dependent upon their in-hospital behavior. MDSOs are, by statutory definition, individuals who suffer from a \u2018mental disease, defect, or disorder. \u2019 The rationale of \u2018good time\u2019 credit as a reward for behavioral conformity does not readily fit the company of the mentally disturbed. The \u2018carrot or stick\u2019 approach represented by the extension or withdrawal of credit as reward or punishment seems inconsistent with the goals of a hospital treatment facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">\u201cSecond, if a patient intentionally acts in a disruptive manner in a hospital setting, he may be determined to be unamenable to treatment and transferred to state prison. This consequence, readily perceived, itself acts as a deterrent to intentional criminal conduct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>the hospital setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\u201cThird, at least part of the \u2018good time\u2019 may be earned by participation in prison rehabilitative and educational programs. It is not clear whether state hospitals currently even provide such \u2018work, educational, vocational, [or] therapeutic\u2019 activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\u201cFourth, denial of \u2018good time\u2019 credits (pursuant to Pen. Code, \u00a7 2932) involves a whole panoply of administrative requirements, including a hearing. It is questionable whether hospital administrators have either the ability or the time, given an already burdensome workload, to comply with these additional procedures or whether the type of adversary proceeding which might result, contemplating written notice, investigation, hearing, etc., would assist in furthering the treatment program of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">\u201cFinally, it seems pointless to give an MDSO \u2018good time\u2019 credit against his medical commitment period because [Welfare and Institutions Code] section 6316.2 allows extension of the treatment period if found to be necessary. The concept of \u2018good time\u2019 credit only has meaning within the context of a fixed criminal sentence which may not be so extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">\u201cFor the above reasons, we conclude that the compelling state interest which underlies the eifective treatment of MDSOs justifies a legislative determination not to expand the application of \u2018good time\u2019 procedures to MDSO commitments.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saffell, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 223, 234-235.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-10\"><em>Carafas </em>v. <em>LaVallee </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 234, 237-238 [20 L.Ed.2d 554, 558, 88 S.Ct. 1556]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Sovereign) </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 143 [192 Cal.Rptr. 469].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\">E.g., see Business and Professions Code section 480, subdivision (b); Evidence Code section 788, subdivision (b); Penal Code section 290.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b772-12\">Comment, <em>Restoration of Rights to Felons in California </em>(1971) 2 Pacific L.J. 718; Comment, <em>The Revolving Door: the Effect of Employment Discrimination Against Ex-Prisoners </em>(1975) 26 Hastings L.J. 1403, 1432-1433.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b772-13\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Sovereign), supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at page 154, the court found that the ex post facto increase of the waiting period under section 4852.03 illegally prolonged the period that the ex-felon remained subject to the penalties in the form of continued deprivation of certain civil rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">We must emphasize that our opinion is limited to the question of whether petitioner may be allowed to apply for a certificate of rehabilitation.
