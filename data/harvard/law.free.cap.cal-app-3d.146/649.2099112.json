Fillmore.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff sued defendants to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien and for breach of oral contract arising from his failure to be paid for services as a drywall finisher. Defendants contend that: (1) the trial court erroneously applied Labor Code section 2750.5\u2019s rebuttable presumption that plaintiff was an employee rather than an unlicensed independent contractor barred by statute from recovery; (2) absent the presumption, the evidence was insufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff was in fact an employee; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding of an agreement between plaintiff and defendant Tarman to pay for plaintiff\u2019s services. We agree with defendants\u2019 first two contentions and reverse the judgment. Accordingly, we do not reach the third issue posed by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment (see <em>In re Angelia P. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 908, 924 [171 Cal.Rptr. 637, 623 P.2d 198]), the record reveals the following: plaintiff is a drywall finisher by occupation; he performed taping and texturing work on defendants\u2019 building but he has not been paid. Defendants are partners in a partnership known as Design Concepts, which in 1980 owned real property at 290 Air Park Boulevard in Chico. Defendants constructed a commercial building on the property, with defendant Tarman, a licensed architect and contractor, serving as general contractor. Defendants, through Tarman, subcontracted with Loren Sutton for framing, sheetrock hanging, taping and texturing, wood trim, windows and accessories.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In July 1980 plaintiff was employed by Sam Ivy Drywall, earning $10 an hour. Witness Sabia Montandon, also a drywall worker, was employed on defendants\u2019 construction project and informed plaintiff of the possibility of work there. Plaintiff accompanied Montandon to defendants\u2019 jobsite, where he was introduced to defendant Irvine. Plaintiff and Irvine discussed job specifications and inspected the site. A couple of days later at the jobsite Montandon introduced plaintiff to Sutton. Plaintiff testified that the first thing he told Sutton was that he, plaintiff, was not a licensed contractor and that he would have to become an employee of Sutton\u2019s in order to accept the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Plaintiff told Sutton he would charge 27 cents per square foot for his services; Sutton would have to provide materials and a scaffold. Sutton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>replied that he, Sutton, had budgeted 30 cents per foot to complete the job, including materials and labor. After some discussion Sutton agreed to purchase the needed materials and to pay plaintiff the balance of the budgeted 30 cents per square foot. However, neither plaintiff nor Sutton suggested they reduce this agreement to writing, and no written contract was prepared. Plaintiff was to submit each Friday a statement of the square footage he had completed, and Sutton was to pay plaintiff weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Plaintiff was to commence work July 24, 1980. He testified that when he arrived at the site none of the needed materials was present; Sutton told him they would be available the next day. When once again they were not, Sutton asked plaintiff to purchase what he needed and Sutton would reimburse him. Plaintiff purchased $1,008.80 in materials and was reimbursed by Sutton. Plaintiff deposited the reimbursement in his personal account. Prior to plaintiff\u2019s first payday he filled out a form W-4 which Sutton had given him.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Plaintiff did not receive the weekly payments he was promised, and he told Sutton and job superintendent Robert Novack that he would quit if he was not paid. On the weekend of August 16th and 17th plaintiff actually remained away from the job although he was supposed to work seven days a week. Sutton explained to plaintiff that he was not being paid because the owners had failed to pay him (Sutton).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Plaintiff and Sutton met with Novack and defendants Tarman and Irvine to try to resolve the matter. Tarman initially told plaintiff he would have to discuss his not being paid with Sutton, the subcontractor, rather than with him. Plaintiff testified that \u201cwhen we informed him [Tarman] that Loren [Sutton] was saying the reason we weren\u2019t getting paid is because Mr. Tar-man was not paying him, the whole gist of the conversation changed. He, Mr. Tarman, said if we would go back to work, finish the job, that he would make sure we got paid, whether he had to make out joint checks to be made out to Sutton and myself ... he would see to it we got paid. But not until the end of the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Plaintiff asked some dry wall-finisher friends of his to assist with the job. They did so unpaid, as plaintiff had previously done on jobs of theirs. Plaintiff completed the job on August 28, and recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien on defendants\u2019 realty in the amount of $10,221.20 (which he contends represents his wages for about a month\u2019s work), a figure he arrived at by using the previously agreed formula of 30 cents per square foot minus 2.7 cents cost of materials. Defendant Tarman indicated he was satisfied with plaintiff\u2019s work. Although defendants paid Sutton for all drywall work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>including that performed by plaintiff, plaintiff has never received any payment for his labor from Sutton or from defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Plaintiff filed this action on December 1, 1980, against defendants and Sutton, seeking to foreclose his lien and to enforce defendant Tarman\u2019s promise to pay him if Sutton failed to do so. Recourse to the bankrupt Sutton was, as a practical matter, unavailable. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 1.) Defendants resisted plaintiff\u2019s claim, contending that (1) plaintiff was not Sutton\u2019s employee but was rather an unlicensed independent contractor barred by Business and Professions Code section 7031 from maintaining the action; and (2) plaintiff failed to give preliminary notice of his mechanic\u2019s lien as required by Civil Code section 3097.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The trial court found, inter alia, that (1) Labor Code section 2750.5 created a rebuttable presumption that plaintiff was an employee rather than an independent contractor; (2) defendants failed to rebut the presumption; (3) plaintiff held a valid lien on defendants\u2019 real property; and (4) a valid contract existed between plaintiff and defendant Tarman.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We begin with an overview of three code sections involved in this appeal, Business and Professions Code sections 7031<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 7053,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Labor Code section 2750.5,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which are set out in the margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Section 7031 provides that anyone who engages in the business of, or acts in the capacity of, a contractor without possessing a valid contractors\u2019 license, if one is required by law, is barred from maintaining an action to collect compensation or foreclose a mechanics\u2019 lien. <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N. M. Ball Sons </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 141, 154 [308 P.2d 713], and cases cited therein; see <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Thornsberry </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 842 [158 Cal.Rptr. 862].) At the time of trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> section 7053 exempted from the requirements of section 7031 contractors\u2019 employees, whose sole compensation is wages. <em>(Pickens </em>v. <em>American Mortgage Exchange </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 299, 305 [74 Cal.Rptr. 788].) Since it is conceded that plaintiff was unlicensed, and that he was performing work for which a license is required if performed by a contractor (see Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7026), his right to maintain this action is dependent upon his being characterized as an employee rather than an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Section 2750.5 differentiates \u201cworker[s] performing services for which a license is required\u201d by the \u201cContractors\u201d chapter of the Business and Professions Code (ch. 9, div. 3, \u00a7 7000 et seq.) into two categories, \u201cemployees\u201d and \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d The section creates a rebuttable presumption, affecting the burden of proof, that a worker who performs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>services requiring a contractor\u2019s license, or who works for one who is required to possess such a license, is an employee rather than an independent contractor. The section further provides that any person performing any activity which requires a contractors\u2019 license <em>shall hold </em>a valid license <em>as a condition </em>of having independent contractor status. <em>{Ante, </em>fn. 4.) Section 2750.5 explicitly provides in part that: <em>\u201cFor purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, </em>this presumption is a supplement to the existing statutory definitions of employee and independent contractor, ...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">With this statutory overview we turn to defendants\u2019 contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Defendants first contend that the trial court improperly applied section 2750.5 to a determination of whether plaintiff was an employee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In analyzing section 2750.5,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we have in mind that \u201cIn construing the words of a statute ... to discern its purpose, the provisions should be read together; an interpretation which would render terms surplusage should be avoided, and every word should be given some significance, leaving no part useless or devoid of meaning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 47, 54 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935].) The penultimate paragraph of section 2750.5 provides in relevant part that a person performing an activity requiring a contractors\u2019 license \u201cshall hold a valid contractors\u2019 license <em>as a condition </em>o/having independent contractor status.\u201d (Italics added.) This provision does not simply create a presumption; it is mandatory. Under section 2750.5, one performing services requiring a license cannot be an independent contractor unless one holds a valid license. Thus, if one performs work on a construction job for which a license is required, without holding a valid license, one is by definition an employee, not an independent contractor, pursuant to section 2750.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>While this provision of section 2750.5 may serve a salutary purpose of providing broad workers\u2019 compensation coverage to those injured on a job (see <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 621, 626 [170 Cal.Rptr. 32, 620 P.2d 618]), the provision results in untoward consequences when it is applied to determinations under sections 7031 and 7053. As noted above, the effect of sections 7031 and 7053 is to allow one to bring an action to recover compensation if one is an employee but not if one is an unlicensed independent contractor. But, as we have seen, section 2750.5 precludes a worker without a required license from obtaining independent contractor status and effectively designates the worker as an employee as a matter of law. Thus, if section 2750.5 were applied to determinations under sections 7031 and 7053, every unlicensed person performing work on a job would be characterized as an employee and not an independent contractor. This result would repeal by implication section 703l\u2019s ban on recovery by an unlicensed contractor.  That ban \u201crepresents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties, and that such deterrence can best be realized by denying violators the right to maintain any action for compensation in the courts of the state. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N. M. Ball Sons, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at p. 151; accord <em>Rushing </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 597, 605 [130 Cal.Rptr. 110].)  \u201c \u2018The courts assume that in enacting a statute the Legislature was aware of existing, related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of statutes. <em>(Stafford </em>v. <em>Realty Bond Service Corp. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 797, 805 [249 P.2d 241]; <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Conrad </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 85, 93 [8 Cal.Rptr. 56]; 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3d ed.) \u00a7 2012, pp. 461-466.) Thus there is a presumption against repeals by implication; they will occur only where the two acts are so inconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent operation, or where the later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent to supersede the earlier; the courts are bound to maintain the integrity of both statutes if they may stand together. [Citations.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Hays </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 772, 784 [160 Cal.Rptr. 102, 603 P.2d 19], quoting <em>Sacramento Newspaper Guild </em>v. <em>Sacramento County Bd. of Suprs. </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 41, 54 [69 Cal.Rptr. 480].) We must also prefer an interpretation of Labor Code section 2750.5 which is reasonable over one which is not or which would lead to mischief. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nevarez </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 388, 397 [181 Cal.Rptr. 691].)  We hold that Labor Code section 2750.5 is not applicable to determinations of whether one is an employee or unlicensed contractor under Business and Professions Code sections 7031 and 7053.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Plaintiff offers two arguments to rebut our conclusion. First, plaintiff focuses on the first sentence of section 2750.5, which provides: \u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that a worker perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ing services for which a license is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, or who is performing such services for a person who is required to obtain such a license is an employee rather than an independent contractor. \u201d Plaintiff contends that this explicit reference to chapter 9 of division 3 of the Business and Professions Code (of which \u00a7\u00a7 7031 and 7053 are a part) reflects a legislative intent to apply section 2750.5 to determinations under sections 7031 and 7053. However, chapter 9 of division 3 of the Business and Professions Code also contains enumerations of those services for which a license is required (see, e.g., Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7026, 7026.1, 7026.3, 7026.4) and of those services which are exempt from licensing requirements. (See, e.g., Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7040, 7041, 7043, 7046.) We conclude that the reference in the first sentence of section 2750.5 to chapter 9 of division 3 of the Business and Professions Code is for the sole purpose of defining the nature of services performed by the worker (i.e., those for which a license is required under the Bus. &amp; Prof. Code). This conclusion finds syntactical support in the final clause of the first sentence of section 2750.5, where reference is made to \u201csuch services,\u201d i.e., those for which a license is required pursuant to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Plaintiif\u2019s second argument against our conclusion is that Labor Code section 2700 compels the application of section 2750.5 to the instant dispute. We acknowledge that section 2750.5 is a part of division 3 of the Labor Code, entitled \u201cEmployment Relations.\u201d With respect to that division, Labor Code section 2700 provides: \u201cThe provisions of this division shall not limit, change, or in any way qualify the provisions of Divisions 4 and 4.5 of this code, but shall be fully operative and effective in all cases where the provisions of Divisions 4 and 4.5 are not applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In accordance with Labor Code section 2700, various provisions contained in division 3 of the Labor Code have been applied to areas of law other than workers\u2019 compensation. (See 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Agency and Employment, \u00a7 3, pp. 645-646; <em>Charles B. Webster Real Estate </em>v. <em>Rickard </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 612, 615 [98 Cal.Rptr. 559] [Lab. Code, \u00a7 2750 applied in dispute about real estate commission between private parties].)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">However, Labor Code section 2700, which purports to apply section 2750.5 to all areas of law except those specifically excepted, is obviously a statute of general application, whereas sections 7031 and 7053 focus specially on lawsuits for the collection of compensation by those performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>services for which a contractors\u2019 license is required.  \u201c[W]here the same subject matter is covered by inconsistent provisions, one of which is special and the other general, the special one, whether or not enacted first, is an exception to the general statute and controls unless an intent to the contrary clearly appears. <em>(In re Williamson, </em>43 Cal.2d 651, 654 [276 P.2d 593]; see 82 C.J.S. 720-722.)\u201d <em>(Warne </em>v. <em>Harkness </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 579, 588 [35 Cal.Rptr. 601, 387 P.2d 377]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, 521 [156 Cal.Rptr. 450, 596 P.2d 328].) Here, Business and Professions Code sections 7031 and 7053, as special statutes, must prevail over Labor Code section 2700.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Plaintiff contends that even if the trial court erred in applying the presumption of employee status in section 2750.5 there are two alternative bases for applying such a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">First, plaintiff cites <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>George </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 238 at page 242 [105 P.2d 914] for the proposition that \u201cthe fact that one is performing work for another is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of employment and such person is presumed to be a servant in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In <em>Robinson, </em>the plaintiff alleged he was injured by defendant George\u2019s negligent operation of an automobile while George was delivering newspapers for defendant Citizen-News Company. (P. 240.) Citizen-News claimed that George was an independent contractor for whose acts it could not be liable and contended plaintiff presented no evidence showing George to be an employee. Our Supreme Court noted the paucity of evidence establishing either employee or contractor status and applied a presumption recognized by <em>Hillen </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1926) 199 Cal. 577 [250 P. 570], to shift the burden of proof to defendant Citizen-News to show contractor status. (P. 244.) We are aware of no case, however, which has applied the <em>Hillen-Robinson </em>presumption to issues arising under sections 7031 and 7053. We decline to apply the presumption in this context for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">We initially note that <em>Hillen </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>interpreted the then workmen's compensation law. (Stats. 1917, ch. 586, pp. 831-879.) Section 19(d)(1) of that statute provided that an employer should bear the burden of proof to establish the affirmative defense of independent contractor status. (P. 849.) <em>Robinson </em>borrowed <em>Hillen's </em>statutory presumption without analysis. As we have noted above, the presumption of employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>status serves a salutary purpose in the workers\u2019 compensation context. However, neither <em>Hillen </em>nor <em>Robinson </em>contains any reason or policy that persuades us to extend the presumption to determinations of whether one is an employee or an unlicensed contractor under sections 7031 and 7053.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Indeed, to apply a presumption of employee status would be to undermine a policy inherent in section 7031, i.e., that one seeking to recover compensation for contracting work should bear the burden of proving that he complied with the licensing laws. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 2.) As noted above, <em>Robinson </em>establishes a rebuttable presumption of employee status.  Under California law there are two types of rebuttable presumptions: those affecting the burden of producing evidence, designed only to facilitate the determination of the action (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 603, 604) and those affecting the burden of proof which implement an extrinsic public policy (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 605, 606; see <em>In re Marriage of Ashodian </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 43, 46-47 [157 Cal.Rptr. 555]). The <em>Robinson </em>presumption is of the latter variety, since it shifts the burden of proof to implement the public policy of extending compensation for personal injuries. (See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>16 Cal.2d at pp. 243-244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In cases such as this, however, the practical effect of applying the <em>Robinson </em>presumption would be to shift to defendant owners the burden of proving that those who perform work are not employees but are, rather, contractors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If a presumption of employee status were applied, a plaintiff who is in fact an unlicensed contractor would simply plead employee status, establish at trial that he or she performed <em>some </em>work on a job site, and shift the burden to the owner to show that plaintiff was a contractor. Section 7031, however, explicitly requires persons acting in the capacity of a contractor to prove licensed contractor status <em>(ante, </em>fn. 2) in order to effectuate the legislative policy of deterring unlicensed contracting. Thus, application of the <em>Robinson </em>presumption would contravene rather than fulfill an important public policy. (See <em>Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N. M. Ball Sons, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 141, 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Moreover, shifting the burden of proof to defendants would run afoul of Evidence Code section 500, which requires a plaintiff to bear the burden of proof \u201cas to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief . . . that he is asserting.\u201d It is essential to plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>claim that he be either a licensed contractor, per section 7031, or an employee, per section 7053. Plaintiff pleaded that he was an employee. Evidence Code section 500 would, therefore, ordinarily place the burden of proof upon plaintiff to establish that he was an employee. (See <em>Polk </em>v. <em>Polk </em>(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 763, 787 [39 Cal.Rptr. 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We perceive no good reason to shift the burden of proof. In determining whether the normal allocation of the burden of proof should be altered, the comment to Evidence Code section 500 notes that courts consider a number of factors, including the knowledge of the parties concerning the particular fact, the availability of evidence to the respective parties, and the most desirable result in terms of public policy. None of these factors support shifting the burden of proof in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The <em>Hillen-Robinson </em>presumption of employee status has been applied to disputes between someone who performed work (arguably an \u201cemployee\u201d) and someone at whose request the work was performed (arguably an \u201cemployer\u201d). In these situations, evidence of employment status is presumably readily available to the person at whose request the work is performed. An employer, for example, will have ready access to agreements and records reflecting the work history of someone claiming to be an employee. In the instant case, the dispute is not between a worker (alleged employee) and the person at whose request the worker worked (alleged employer). Here the dispute is between a worker, who claims a subcontractor was his employer, and an owner who has no ready access to the terms or conditions of the worker\u2019s work. In cases such as this one, the worker, not the owner, ordinarily has most knowledge of the terms of any employment agreement and of the actual conditions pursuant to which he or she performs the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Finally, applying a presumption of employee status would, as noted above, have a deleterious effect upon the public policy of deterring unlicensed contracting. Unlicensed contractors would be encouraged to bring suit by a rule which renders them presumptive employees. Accordingly, we decline to depart from the ordinary burden of proof established by Evidence Code section 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Plaintiff contends, however, that a presumption of employee status is \u201cconsistent with\u201d Evidence Code section 520, which provides: \u201cThe party claiming that a person is guilty of crime or wrongdoing has the burden of proof on that issue.\u201d Plaintiff argues that if he is not an employee, he is an unlicensed contractor, that contracting without a license is a misdemeanor (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7028), so that defendants should have the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>proving him an unlicensed contractor pursuant to Evidence Code section 520. However, Evidence Code section 300 provides that the Evidence Code is inapplicable when \u201cotherwise provided by statute.\u201d The explicit language of Business and Professions Code section 7031 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 2), requires one to plead and prove licensed contractor status in order to bring or maintain an action. Since the burden of proof in contractor licensing cases is \u201cotherwise provided by statute,\u201d the burden of proof in Evidence Code section 520 is inapplicable. (See <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 970, 976 [140 Cal.Rptr. 669, 568 P.2d 394].)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">We hold that neither case law nor the Evidence Code creates a presumption that one is an employee for purposes of sections 7031 and 7053.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The judgment is reversed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Evans, Acting P.

Proof of independent contractor status includes satisfactory proof of these factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201c(a) That the individual has the right to control and discretion as to the manner of performance of the contract for services in that the result of the work and not the means by which it is accomplished is the primary factor bargained for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201c(b) That the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">\u201c(c) That the individual\u2019s independent contractor status is bona fide and not a subterfuge to avoid employee status. A bona fide independent contractor status is further evidenced by the presence of cumulative factors such as substantial investment other than personal services in the business, holding out to be in business for oneself, bargaining for a contract to complete a specific project for compensation by project rather than by time, control over the time and place the work is performed, supplying the tools or instrumentalities used in the work other than tools and instrumentalities normally and customarily provided by employees, hiring employees, performing work that is not ordinarily in the course of the principal\u2019s work, performing work that requires a particular skill, holding a license pursuant to the Business and Professions Code, the intent by the parties that the work relationship is of an independent contractor status, or that the relationship is not severable or terminable at will by the principal but gives rise to an action for breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201cIn addition to the factors contained in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c), any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code shall hold a valid contractors\u2019 license as a condition of having independent contractor status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201cFor purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, this presumption is a supplement to the existing statutory definitions of employee and independent contractor, and is not intended to lessen the coverage of employees under Division 4 and Division 5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Unless otherwise indicated, Labor Code section 2750.5 is referred to simply as \u201csection 2750.5\u201d hereinafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b541-12\">The statute was subsequently amended.
