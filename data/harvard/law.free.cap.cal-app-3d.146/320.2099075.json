Thereafter and within due time a petition was filed for a rehearing of the cause by this court. We granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The parties filed supplemental briefs. Every point involved in the controversy and every reason which could be conceived or suggested against the soundness of the conclusion to which we had been originally persuaded was examined, analyzed, and advanced with clarity and force.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We have concluded that our original decision was in error and we now affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The principal issue on this appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is whether a nonvoted special assessment levied on an \u201cestimated benefit\u201d basis on real property within a maintenance district of the City of San Jose is: (1) an \u201cad valorem tax\u201d limited by article XIII A, sections 1 and <em>4 of </em>the California Constitution; or (2) \u201cappropriations\u201d or \u201cproceeds of taxes\u201d within the meaning of article XIII B of the California Constitution and subject to its limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">On June 6, 1978, the voters of this state adopted Proposition 13 (now art. XIIIA of the Constitution), which placed limitations on the taxation powers of the state and local governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Following adoption of article XIII A, the City Council of the City of San Jose (collectively City), on May 15, 1979, adopted Ordinance No. 19651 amending chapter 6A of article II of the Municipal Code by adding a new part 14 which described the procedures for creating and funding maintenance districts. (San Jose Mun. Code, \u00a7 2600.194 et seq.) That ordinance was primarily patterned after the provisions contained in chapter 26 of the Improvement Act of 1911, \u201cMaintenance Districts\u201d (Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 5820 et seq.). Under the 1911 state statute, assessments were levied on an ad valorem basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">On July 3, 1979, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No. 19651, the City tentatively approved a resolution to establish Maintenance District No. 5A, a district composed of some 13 contiguous lots in an industrial park. The purpose of the district was to operate and maintain \u201clandscaped median islands including plants, lawns, sprinklers, shrubs, water, power, labor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>supervision and all other necessary works and applicances\u201d on the public streets in the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">As a response to the ad valorem taxation limitations prescribed by article XIII A, the City adopted a different method of levy. For district 5A assessments on a particular parcel were required to be made \u201cin the <em>ratio that the area of each parcel </em>to be assessed for said costs of maintenance and operation <em>bear to the total area of all parcels </em>of property <em>within </em>said maintenance <em>district </em>to be assessed therefore [sic]. \u201d (Italics added.) Thus the assessment was levied proportionate to the \u201cestimated benefit\u201d that each parcel within the district would receive from the maintenance of the divider strips.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The estimated maintenance cost for the 1979-1980 fiscal year was $35,000. Under this \u201cpro rata\u201d formula each parcel was assessed a charge equivalent to $420.73477 per acre. There were no oral or written protests from the affected property owners to the creation of the maintenance district or to the levy of the special assessment. On July 17, 1979, the City formally adopted the resolution creating Maintenance District No. 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In November 1979, the voters passed article XIII B of the California Constitution by initiative as Proposition 4. Article XIII B placed a limit on the growth of appropriations on the state and local level and prescribed procedures for returning to the taxpayers appropriations received in excess of the established limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">On March 6, 1980, the City filed a petition for validation of Maintenance District No. 5A. Appellant Kent South, the City finance director, filed an answer challenging the creation of the Maintenance District No. 5A and the levy of assessment, contending that: (1) the general state statute relating to maintenance districts preempted the field and directed the City to levy assessments on an ad valorem basis; (2) the special assessment is an ad valorem tax subject to the limitations of section 1, and therefore, a \u201cspecial tax\u201d which must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the affected property owners as required by section 4, article XIII A; and (3) the special assessment levy is \u201can appropriation\u201d subject to the limitation of article XIII B.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">On October 21, 1980, the trial court specifically rejected each of the appellant\u2019s contentions and entered judgment in favor of the City. Appellant raises the same arguments on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">I. <em>Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">In support of his first argument, appellant asserts that the Improvement Act of 1911, specifically Streets and Highways Code sections 5821 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>5830, requires the City to levy special assessments on an ad valorem basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree. As mentioned above, under the state statute special assessments were levied on an ad valorem basis. Nevertheless, the City was empowered under its \u201chome rule\u201d power to employ any method of levy it determined would equitably distribute the burden of payment among the affected property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The City operated under a charter which provides for \u201chome rule\u201d pursuant to article XI, sections 3-7 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 56, 60 [81 Cal.Rptr. 465, 460 P.2d 137].) Under the principle of \u201chome rule\u201d the City has the power to control and finance all \u201cmunicipal affairs,\u201d without interference from gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>eral state laws and subject only to limitations contained in the state Constitution and the Charter itself. (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 224-225 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 208]; <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 132, 135 [98 Cal.Rptr. 281, 490 P.2d 793].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Where, as here, there is a conflict between the state and the local legislation, the courts must decide whether the matter regulated is a state or a municipal affair. (See <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 62; <em>Alioto's Fish Co. </em>v. <em>Human Rights Com. of San Francisco </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 594, 603 [174 Cal.Rptr. 763], cert, den., 455 U.S. 944 [71 L.Ed.2d 657, 102 S.Ct. 144]; cf. <em>Professional Fire Fighters, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 276, 294 [32 Cal.Rptr. 830, 384 P.2d 158].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">It cannot be seriously disputed that the operation and maintenance of the landscaped median islands and their appurtenant areas is strictly of local interest. (See <em>Raisch </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 773, 778-779 [167 P.2d 198]; <em>City of Redwood City </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 563, 577-578 [42 Cal.Rptr. 72] [disapproved on other grounds in <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 63, fn. 6].) The instant improvements do not affect the regulation of traffic or communication. (See <em>Rumford </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 545, 550, fn. 3 [183 Cal.Rptr. 73, 645 P.2d 124]; <em>Pac. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of S. F. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 766, 771-776 [336 P.2d 514].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Appellant concedes that the <em>construction </em>of this improvement is a municipal affair, but asserts that the <em>ongoing maintenance </em>is not. Appellant fails to cite any cases upholding this distinction and we fail to see any logic to it. If the erection and operation of the improvement is deemed to be a municipal affair, a fortiori, its maintenance must also be a municipal affair. Further, both the state statutes and the city ordinance expressly permit the City to levy assessments for the <em>operation and maintenance </em>of the local improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Accordingly, we find that the City was free to levy a \u201cpro rata\u201d special assessment for maintenance regardless of inconsistent provisions of the general state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>II. <em>California Constitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"AoY4\">\n<em>Article XIIIA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Appellant next argues that the voters intended to include special assessments on property within the limitation of ad valorem property taxes of article XIII A, sections 1 and 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant relies on the ballot summary and the arguments and analyses in the ballot pamphlet to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The City maintains that the special assessments levied on the basis of \u201cestimated benefits\u201d are materially different from ad valorem taxes and are not subject to limitation under sections 1 and 4 of article XIII A, Citing <em>Solvang Mun. Improvement Dist. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 545 [169 Cal.Rptr. 391], and <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 974 [156 Cal.Rptr. 777], In <em>Solvang, </em>the city levied a special assessment to service and redeem assessment bonds used to create three public parking lots. In <em>Malmstrom, </em>the county levied assessments in order to service and redeem assessment bonds for local improvements under the Improvement Act of 1911 (Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.) and the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913 (Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 10000 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Both courts concluded that the special assessments were not ad valorem taxes within the meaning of article XIII A, sections 1 and 4. <em>(Solvang, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at pp. 550-557; <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at pp. 981-982.) Relying principally on <em>Malmstrom, </em>the <em>Solvang </em>court reasoned that the \u201coverriding concern of article XIII A was directed against general governmental spending and general real property taxes levied to finance such spending.\u201d <em>(Solvang, supra, </em>at p. 556; <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>at p. 985.) Ad valorem taxes, the court concluded, are general taxes levied on all taxable property to pay for general expenditures. <em>(Solvang, supra, </em>at p. 552; <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>at p. 981.) In contrast, the court determined that special assessments are charges against property to pay for local improvements which specially benefit the affected property. <em>(Solvang, supra, </em>at pp. 552-553; <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>at p. 981.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>In upholding the validity of California Constitution article XIII A in general, our Supreme Court recognized that the language of the article was \u201cimprecise and ambiguous\u201d in several respects. <em>(Amador Valley, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 245; <em>Los Angeles County Transportation Com. </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 197, 201 [182 Cal.Rptr. 324, 643 P.2d 941].)  One area of confusion is the meaning of the term \u201cspecial assessment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">,A. We turn first to article XIII A, section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The incongruity is readily apparent when the two subdivisions of section 1 are read together: \u201c(a) The maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property <em>shall not exceed one percent (1%) </em>of the full cash value of such property. <em>The one percent (1 %) tax </em>to be collected by the counties and apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties, [f] (b) The <em>limitation </em>provided for in subdivision (a) <em>shall not apply to </em>ad valorem taxes or <em>special assessments </em>to pay the interest and redemption charges on any indebtedness <em>approved by the voters prior to the time this section becomes </em>effective.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The confusion arises because of the use of the term \u201cspecial assessments\u201d in subdivision (b) but not in subdivision (a).  As discussed above, the <em>Solvang </em>and <em>Malmstrom </em>courts resolved this incongruity in favor of the governmental entity, concluding that a special assessment was wholly different from an ad valorem tax,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore not within the one percent (1 percent) limitation. Thus the reference to \u201cspecial assessments\u201d in subdivision (b) was mere surplusage. <em>(Solvang, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at pp. 552-554; <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at pp. 980-982.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">A question substantially identical to the City\u2019s maintenance levy, in the context of a maintenance levy for a flood control district in favor of the special assesssment was resolved in <em>American River Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>Sayre </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 347 [186 Cal.Rptr. 202].<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similar to the \u201cestimated benefit\u201d basis of the City\u2019s instant maintenance levy, the flood control district was divided into \u201czones of benefit\u201d with each zone bearing a percentage of the maintenance costs proportional to the benefits each zone received. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 352.) The legislation under which the flood control district operated allowed levies for improvements on maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The Third District relied on <em>Solvang Mun. Improvement Dist. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 545, at pp. 552-554 as follows: \u201c. . . a special assessment, sometimes described as a local assessment, is a charge imposed on particular real property for a local public improvement of direct benefit to that property, as for example a street improvement, lighting improvement, irrigation improvement, sewer connection, drainage improvement, or flood control improvement. <em>The rationale of special assessment is that the assessed property has received a special benefit over and above that received by the general public. The general public should not be required to pay for special benefits for the few, and the few specially benefited should not be subsidized by the general public. (Burnett </em>v. <em>Mayor etc. of Sacramento </em>(1859) 12 Cal. 76, 83-84.) The theory underlying special assessment is that <em>the local improvement, </em>such as the paving or lighting of a street, <em>directly benefits and increases the value of adjacent real property. .. . Although a special assessment is imposed through the same mechanism used to finance the cost of local government, </em>in reality <em>it is a compulsory charge to recoup the cost of a public improvement made for the special benefit of a particular property. </em>. . . [f], . . In sum, a special assessment is a charge levied against real property particularly and directly benefited by a local improvement in order to pay the cost of that improvement. ...\u201d (Pp. 552-554; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The City\u2019s maintenance district levy provides for just such an assessment to be levied only against the lots in the district. The assessment is levied proportionate to the \u201cestimate benefit\u201d received by each parcel. We conclude that article XIII A, section 1 of the Constitution does not impinge on the City\u2019s authority to levy a special maintenance levy for district 5A. <em>(American River Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Sayre, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d 342, 347; <em>Solvang Mun. Improvement Dist. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Precisely because of the limited nature of the City\u2019s special maintenance district 5A, we cannot agree with appellant that \u201cit could result in the wholesale avoidance of the purpose of article XIII A.\u201d Since special assessments like the instant one, traditionally require hearings and give prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>erty owners the opportunity to protest (San Jose Mun. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2600.196.5-.196.13 and 2600.197.3-,197.8), if the property owners do not want the proposed assessment, they will vote against it. Even though section 2600.197.8 of the city ordinance provides that a majority protest may be overruled by a four-fifths vote of the City Council, \u201c. . . it is unlikely that local governments will continue with assessment proceedings once a majority of property owners in the proposed district have voiced their disapproval.\u201d <em>(County of Placer </em>v. <em>Corin </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 443, fn. 9 at p. 454 [170 Cal.Rptr. 232].)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Our view is supported by the Legislature\u2019s recent enactments (set forth, so far as pertinent, below)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that demonstrated that article XIII A does not limit the imposition of special benefit assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">B. We turn next to article XIII A section 4.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In <em>Los Angeles County Transportation Com. </em>v. <em>Richmond, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 197, our Supreme Court noted at page 205, that section 4 was \u201cfundamentally undemocratic\u201d and therefore construed it very strictly. In upholding the creation of a special transportation district sales tax by simple majority vote, the court held that the will of the majority of local voters would prevail over the two-third provisions of section 4 enacted by the voters of the state. (At p. 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The special assessment for maintenance purposes is not a \u201cspecial tax\u201d within the meaning of section 4. \u201cSpecial tax\u201d as used in that section does not mean special assessment, but taxes levied for a specific purpose. <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 47, fn. 3 at pp. 53, 57 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935].)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Further, section 4 by its terms is restricted to taxes that can be \u201cimposed\u201d by the electoral process. Due process requirements <em>(Brookes </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1911) 160 Cal. 423, 431 [117 P. 433]; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>City of Red Bluff </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 584, 594 [47 Cal.Rptr. 553, 407 P.2d 857]), notice and the opportunity to be heard, which apply to special assessment, are not necessary for the imposition of a tax. <em>(Saunders </em>v. <em>Carr </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 10, 17-18 [74 Cal.Rptr. 147]; <em>American Co. </em>v. <em>City of Lakeport </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 548, 560 [32 P.2d 622].) In <em>Brookes, supra, </em>at p. 431, our Supreme Court held unconstitutional a statute that provided for the levy of an assessment by a vote of the qualified electors, as \u201cthe <em>constitutional requirement of due process of law is not fulfilled, unless there is provided a notice and an opportunity to be heard </em>to the property-owner, <em>upon the question whether or not his property is in fact benefited </em>by the improvement, <em>and whether or not it shall be, in effect, excluded from the district, although within its territorial limits. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) Thus the elective processes do not apply to benefit assessments. <em>(Chase </em>v. <em>Kalber </em>(1915) 28 Cal.App. 561, at pp. 572-574 [153 P. 397]; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1953) 119 Cal.App.2d 816, at p. 824 [260 P.2d 261]; <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>City of Claremont </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 826, at p. 836 [323 P.2d 71].) To construe section 4 to include special assessments would render it unconstitutional. We conclude that section 4 does not apply to the instant special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">C. Application of California Constitution Article XIII B.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Finally, appellant argues that the City\u2019s special assessment constitutes \u201cproceeds of taxes\u201d as defined by article XIII B and subject to its limitations.1 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Article XIII B was adopted less than 18 months after the addition of article XIII A to the state Constitution, and was billed as \u201cthe next logical step to Proposition 13,\u201d (art. XIII A). Article XIII A was generally aimed at controlling ad valorem property taxes and the imposition of new \u201cspecial taxes.\u201d <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d 208, 231-232 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]; <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d 974, 980 [156 Cal.Rptr. 777], see art. XIII A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4.) The thrust of article XIII B, however, was toward placing certain limitations on the growth of appropriations at both the state and local governmental level; in particular, article XIIIB places limits on the authorization to expend the \u201cproceeds of taxes.\u201d (\u00a7 8, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Article XIII B provides that beginning with the 1980-1981 fiscal year, \u201can appropriations limit\u201d will be established for each \u201clocal government.\u201d (\u00a7 8, subd. (h).) No \u201cappropriations subject to limitation\u201d may be made in excess of this appropriations limit, and revenues received in excess of authorized appropriations must be returned to the taxpayers within the following two fiscal years. (\u00a72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The appropriations limit for the 1980-1981 fiscal year is equal to the total \u201cappropriations subject to limitations\u201d for that entity in the 1978-1979 fiscal year, with certain adjustments for changes in the cost of living, population and financial responsibility for providing services. (\u00a7\u00a7 3, 8, subd. (h); see Opns. Cal.Legis. Counsel, No. 15349 (Aug. 24, 1979) Gann Initiative, p. 4.) In succeeding years, the appropriations limit will be equal to the prior year\u2019s appropriations limit, subject to the specified adjustments. Appropriations limits may be changed by the voters, but not to exceed a period longer than four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u201cBilled as a flexible way to provide discipline in government spending, article <em>XIIIB does not limit the ability to expend government funds collected </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>from all sources. </em>Rather, the appropriations limit is based on \u2018appropriations subject to limitation,\u2019 which consists primarily of the authorization to expend during a fiscal year the \u2018proceeds of taxes.\u2019 (\u00a7 8, subd. (a).) <em>As to local governments, limits are placed only on the authorization to expend the proceeds of taxes levied by that entity, </em>in addition to proceeds of state subventions (\u00a7 8, subd. (c)); <em>no limitation is placed on the expenditure of those revenues that do not constitute \u2018proceeds of taxes. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Placer </em>v. <em>Corin, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d 443, 447; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Here, as in <em>Corin, supra, </em>the question is whether the special maintenance levy for the City\u2019s district 5A is within the meaning of \u201cproceeds of taxes.\u201d We agree with the City that the proceeds of the special assessment are not \u201cproceeds of taxes\u201d and will not be included within its budgeted \u201cappropriations subject to limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In <em>Corin, supra, </em>the court explained at page 448: \u201cSection 8, subdivision (c) defines \u2018 \u201cproceeds of taxes\u2019\u201d as follows: \u2018 \u201cProceeds of taxes,\u201d <em>shall include, but not be restricted to, </em>all tax revenues and the proceeds to an entity of government, from (i) regulatory licenses, user charges, and user fees to the extent that such proceeds exceed the costs reasonably borne by such entity in providing the regulation, product, or service, and (ii) the investment of tax revenues. . . . [f] In summary, for local entities, \u2018proceeds of taxes\u2019 <em>includes, but is not restricted to: </em>(1) all tax revenues; (2) excessive regulatory license fees and excessive user charges and fees; (3) the investment of tax revenues; and (4) subventions from the state.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In specifically rejecting the county\u2019s argument that special assessments (inter alia) while not included within the expressly enumerated categories of subdivision (c), were so similar in origin that they must be considered \u201cproceeds of taxes,\u201d the <em>Corin </em>court relied on the <em>Malmstrom-Solvang </em>distinctions between \u201cspecial assessments\u201d and taxes, described above at pages 9-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Conceding (at p. 449) that the broader purpose of XIIIB required a liberal construction, the court\u2019s conclusion is equally apt here: \u201cOur analysis of article XIII B, section 8, subdivision (c), <em>compels </em>the conclusion that the <em>framers of the initiative did not intend to include the proceeds derived from special assessments to be included within the \u2018not restricted to \u2019 language of \u2018proceeds of taxes.' </em>While respondent correctly asserts that assessments are a function of the general power of taxation <em>(City of Baldwin Park </em>v. <em>Stoskus </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 536, 568 [105 Cal.Rptr. 325, 503 P.2d 1333]; see <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Town of Los Altos Hills </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 676, 683 [129 Cal.Rptr. 97, 547 P.2d 1377]; <em>Los Angeles Co.

Co. </em>v. <em>Regents Etc. </em>(1908) 153 Cal. 776, 778 [96 P. 801]; see <em>Inglewood </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 697, 702 [280 P. 360].)\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Corin, supra, </em>at p. 449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Appellant concedes the holding of <em>Corin </em>but urges that like <em>Solvang </em>and <em>Malmstrom, Corin </em>was restricted to special assessments for local capital improvements as distinct from maintenance and relies on language from <em>Corin </em>at page 451, that \u201cto the extent that an assessment results in revenue above the cost of the improvement or is of general public benefit, it is no longer a special assessment but a tax.\u201d Nothing in the record supports this latter assertion. As to the attempted distinction between \u201ccapital improvements\u201d and \u201cmaintenance,\u201d <em>American River Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Sayre, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d 347, expressly dealt with an ongoing maintenance type of assessment.
