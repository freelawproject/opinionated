Walker appeals the judgment entered on jury verdicts convicting him on single counts of rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (2)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sodomy (\u00a7 286, subd. (c)), oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)) and false imprisonment (\u00a7\u00a7 236, 237). Walker was acquitted on two other counts of oral copulation and rape. The court imposed a twenty-four-year sentence, consisting of three consecutive eight-year upper terms for the rape, sodomy and oral copulation and a two-year concurrent sentence for false imprisonment. We affirm the judgment of conviction and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Myrna G. worked at National Pen Company where Walker was the director of security. Shortly after midnight, Ms. G. left her work station at Walker\u2019s request and went to his office. There, after engaging in consensual oral copulation Walker raped Ms. G. After dressing, she was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>unlock the door to leave the office. Walker then ordered her to take off her clothes and sodomized her. Still in fear Ms. G. also submitted to Walker\u2019s demand that she orally copulate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Walker drove Ms. G. back to the building where she worked. She asked the guard to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Walker testified Ms. G. had offered to meet him after work to straighten matters out in reference to a complaint by a coworker. He said she left her work station and at his office freely and voluntarily engaged in \u201cregular,\u201d oral and anal sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Unlike many cases where the jury accepts an all-or-nothing version of the events, the jury here rejected Ms. G.\u2019s testimony in two material ways. The jury found the first act of oral copulation was consensual and the second act of vaginal intercourse did not occur.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the verdicts were received, at the request of both court and counsel, the foreman was asked about the perceived inconsistency of the verdicts. The foreman said: \u201cThere were a couple members of the jury who knew something about the logic of the Philippine mind, and they felt Filipinos value their jobs very highly. And if she thought through an act of oral copulation she could get back to her job, and get home, and back to her family, she would be willing to [orally copulate Walker]. So therefore we voted not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Walker does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment, but labels the guilty verdicts as arising from the jurors\u2019 misconduct in which it considered out-of-court evidence and created facts and conclusions from the \u201cthinnest of air.\u201d (\u00a7 1181, subds. 2 and 3.) Walker\u2019s contention, however, overlooks the process through which a jury verdict may be impeached. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1150; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 685 [183 Cal.Rptr. 663, 646 P.2d 824].) A verdict may not be discredited by extrapolating solely from the unsworn hearsay statements of a single juror. There is no factual basis to support Walker\u2019s argument the jury failed to properly follow the court\u2019s instructions or the jury considered out-of-court evidence. Moreover, even if the communicated thoughts from the couple of jurors here are characterized as misconduct, Walker suffered no prejudice. The alleged misconduct inured to his benefit by impugning the credibility of the victim, resulting in an acquittal on one count of oral copulation. The trial court correctly denied Walker\u2019s new trial mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>tion. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sutter </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 806, 821 [184 Cal.Rptr. 829].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Walker appreciates section 954<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits inconsistent verdicts where the record discloses sufficient evidence to support the guilty verdicts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 565, 569-571 [182 Cal.Rptr. 563].) Nonetheless, he argues section 954 does not apply because (1) the force or fear element of the oral copulation of which he was acquitted is identical to that of the three sex crimes of which he was convicted, and (2) proof of the oral copulation of which he was acquitted is necessary to sustain his sex crime convictions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 124, 130 [145 Cal.Rptr. 429].) Walker\u2019s argument overlooks the fact his charged offenses consisted of separate and distinct acts. Acquittal of one does not require reversal of the convictions for the others. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ranney </em>(1932) 123 Cal.App. 403, 406-407 [11 P.2d 405].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Walker presents several challenges to his sentence. He argues the court made dual use of the fact he allowed Ms. G. to dress after the rape and then ordered her to undress for the sodomy. The transcript discloses the court improperly used this fact indicating premeditation to impose both an upper term for the sodomy conviction (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 421(a)(8))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a consecutive sentence for the rape conviction (rule 425(b)). Accordingly, we remand for resentencing. (Rule 441(c); <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 742, 747 [192 Cal.Rptr. 101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">For guidance of the court at resentencing we discuss the scope of the court\u2019s sentencing discretion under sections 667.6, subdivision (c) and 1170.1, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>In sentencing Walker the court said it was statutorily prohibited from following the probation officer\u2019s recommendation to impose consecutive sentences of one-third the midterm for Walker\u2019s convictions of sodomy and oral copulation. Apparently both the court and defense counsel believed section 667.6, subdivision (c) required full consecutive sentences on each such sex offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Although the court did not say why it believed it could not follow the probation report, the broad brush of <em>Ottombrino (People </em>v. <em>Ottombrino </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 574 [179 Cal.Rptr. 676]) decided a week earlier probably governed its reasoning. Here, relying solely on <em>Ottombrino, </em>the People argue <em>\u201cOttombrino . . . </em>held, Penal Code section 667.6 terms \u2018are independent and separate to terms computed pursuant to sections 1170 and 1170.1.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 586.) This Court further held the principal and subordinate term scheme provided in Penal Code section 1170.1 has no application to consecutive terms for forcible sex offenses under Penal Code section 667.6 and \u2018if there are any other terms of imprisonment, they shall be served separately from the term computed under these subdivisions of section 667.6.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ottombrino, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at pp. 586-587.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">As precedent, however, <em>Ottombrino </em>must be limited to its holding that section 654 does not operate to stay a section 12022.3 enhancement <em>where the court chooses to. sentence under section 667.6 and impose a full upper term for a violent sex offense. </em>We emphasize the latter part of the foregoing sentence because <em>Ottombrino </em>involved both violent sex offenses <em>and </em>nonsex offenses and the trial court wished to impose full force terms for the crimes in each category. <em>Ottombrino </em>explained once a court \u201cexcluded [a section 667.6, subdivision (c) offense from consideration under section 1170.1, subdivision (a)], it cannot be used for principal and subordinate term determination [under section 1170.1].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 586.) In other words, the starting point in <em>Ottombrino </em>was the court\u2019s decision to impose full force consecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>live terms for the violent sex offenses in addition to a full force consecutive term for the nonsex offense of attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In the case before us, the starting point must again be the court\u2019s view of what is appropriate for the offender in light of the crimes committed. To the extent allowed by statute, a court should have the power to impose a sentence to fit the crime and the perpetrator based on the particular facts and circumstances of the case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 470, 489 [179 Cal.Rptr. 443, 637 P.2d 1029].) Section 667.6, subdivision (c) gives the sentencing court just that opportunity, permitting it to choose between sentencing under either that subdivision or section 1170.1, subdivision (a). The unambiguous \u201cin lieu of\u201d preface to section 667.6, subdivision (c) directs the sentencing court to the separate sentencing tracks it can select depending upon the severity of the sentence the court wishes to impose.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By comparison, the Legislature in enacting section 667.6, subdivision (d) decided certain other violent sex offenders should be treated more severely and mandated the imposition of full consecutive terms for sex offenses under the subdivision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our conclusion has been accepted without discussion in what can be called \u201creasons\u201d rather than \u201csentencing discretion\u201d cases. In discussing whether a statement of reasons must be given (\u00a7 1170, subd. (c); rule 443) for sentencing under section 667.6, subdivision (c) both <em>People </em>v. <em>Karsai </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 224 [182 Cal.Rptr. 406] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 343 [185 Cal.Rptr. 498] assume the existence of trial court discretion to sentence the section 667.6, subdivision (c) sex offender under section 1170.1, subdivision (a). There is no statutory, precedential<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or policy reason to dilute the authorized power of the sentencing court here. If upon remand the court wishes to follow the probation officer\u2019s recommendation it may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The court also violated section 654 in imposing a concurrent two-year term for the false imprisonment conviction. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ratcliffe </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 808, 815, 819 [177 Cal.Rptr. 627].) If the court again imposes a prison sentence on the sex offenses it must stay the sentence on the false imprisonment conviction, the stay to become permanent upon the completion of the other unstayed terms. <em>(In re Adams </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 629, 636-637 [122 Cal.Rptr. 73, 536 P.2d 473].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Judgment of conviction affirmed; remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Brown (Gerald), P.
