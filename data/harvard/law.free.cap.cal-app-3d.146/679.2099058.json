J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhC\">Attorney John Fay appeals an order imposing $250 sanctions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">Plaintiff Georgia Karwasky sued defendants Delbert Zachay and his employee Maurice Covington for her injuries in a fall at a trailer park owned by Zachay and managed by Covington. Karwasky alleged in her complaint Covington\u2019s wrongful acts were in the course of his employment and directed by Zachay.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Attorney Judith Haller represented the defendants. Claiming Haller\u2019s representing Covington was adverse to Zachay, Karwasky asked the superior court to disqualify Haller as Covington\u2019s attorney. Karwasky also asked the court to order Zachay\u2019s insurer not to pay for Covington\u2019s defense. Asserting Karwasky\u2019s motion was frivolous and not in good faith, defendants noticed a motion for $900 sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. After hearing the court denied Karwasky\u2019s motion and ordered Karwasky\u2019s Attorney Fay to pay Haller $250 sanctions for making a frivolous motion in bad faith without basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 subdivision (a), the court may order a party\u2019s attorney to pay reasonable expenses resulting from frivolous actions, including making motions without good faith. Fay contends the court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions here without evidence he acted in bad faith in seeking to disqualify Haller. He asserts mistaken legal judgment does not constitute bad faith.  However, a motion is frivolous and in bad faith where, as here, any reasonable attorney would agree such motion is totally devoid of merit. (See <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 649-650 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179].)  In seeking to disqualify Haller, Fay alleged Haller had a conflict of interest in representing both defendants because Covington was Zachay\u2019s employee and acted on Zachay\u2019s orders. However, Fay made no showing whatsoever Haller had any such conflict. Fay presented no evidence and points to nothing in the record suggesting any such conflict existed. Further, Fay cited no authority the defendants\u2019 employment relationship without more created any conflict under the facts alleged here. Indeed, Fay admitted to the superior court the absence of any statutory or case law supporting the motion to disqualify Haller. Moreover, given Karwasky\u2019s allegations Covington\u2019s wrongful acts were in the course of his employment, Covington\u2019s liability, if any, may be imputed to his employer Zachay and covered by Zachay\u2019s insurer; indeed, Zachay may have the duty to indemnify Covington. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 2802.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In finding no conflict between Covington and Zachay precluding their representation by Haller, the court told Fay: \u201cI think that the concept of good faith has to include the concept that motions are brought, based upon at least some statutory law, or based upon some case law, or at least is based upon some kind of a concept that has a logic or coherency to it, but yours has none of these.\u201d The court could properly find any reasonable attorney would agree a motion to disqualify Haller under the circumstances here was totally devoid of merit. The court acted within its discretion in awarding Haller sanctions against Fay.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 subdivision (b), an order imposing sanctions must be in writing and \u201crecite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.\u201d Fay contends the court\u2019s written order here does not specify such conduct or circumstances. However, in its written order the court cited section 128.5 subdivision (b) and said the motion to disqualify Haller as Covington\u2019s attorney and prohibit Zachay\u2019s insurer from defending Covington was frivolous, not made in good faith and without supporting basis in law. The court also said Karwasky had no standing to bring such motion. The court\u2019s written order listed in proper detail reasons justifying imposing sanctions against Fay.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Cologne, J., and Staniforth, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 23, 1983, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 9, 1983.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
