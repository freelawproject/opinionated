The primary issue presented by this appeal is whether the Ralph M. Brown Act (Brown Act), specifically section 54957, requires public sessions when salaries of nonelected city officers or employees are discussed and determined. We conclude the Brown Act prohibits exclusion of the public during City Council sessions at which such salaries are discussed and/or determined, except when a specific nonelected officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s job performance is evaluated the City Council should meet in executive session for that purpose only and, upon determining the individual warrants a salary adjustm\u00e9nt, hold a properly noticed, public meeting to determine that adjustment. As so interpreted, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">When the City Council met in executive session for the announced purpose of discussing and determining the salaries of City Manager Ray Blair, Planning Director Jack Van Cleave, City Auditor William Sage and City Clerk Charles Abdelnour, for the 1980-1981 fiscal year, members of the public, including a San Diego Union reporter, were excluded. During the executive session, the job performance of each employee was discussed and, after such evaluation, the City Council increased the salary of each. At a later, regular meeting the City Council announced and adopted the respective salary levels for the cited employees which had been agreed upon in closed session.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The Union obtained an order enjoining the City Council from discussing and determining salaries of nonelected city employees in closed session.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Throughout this controversy, section 54953 has provided: \u201cAll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d At the time of the judgment, section 54957 provided in pertinent part: \u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the legislative body of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>local agency from holding closed sessions with the Attorney General, district attorney, sheriff, or chief of police, or their respective deputies, on matters posing a threat to the security of public buildings or a threat to the public\u2019s right of access to public services or public facilities, <em>or from holding closed sessions during a regular or special meeting to consider the appointment, employment, or dismissal of a public employee or to hear complaints or charges brought against such employee by another person or employee unless such employee requests a public hearing. </em>The legislative body also may exclude from any such public or closed meeting, during examination of a witness, any or all other witnesses in the matter being investigated by the legislative body.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">\u201cFor the purposes of this section, the term \u2018employee\u2019 shall not include any person elected to office, or appointed to an office by the legislative body of a local agency; provided, however, that nonelective positions of city manager, county administrator, city attorney, county counsel, or a department head or other similar administrative officer of a local agency shall be considered employee positions; and provided further that nonelective positions of general manager, chief engineer, legal counsel, district secretary, auditor, assessor, treasurer, or tax collector of any governmental district supplying services within limited boundaries shall be deemed employee positions.\u201d (Italics added.) After judgment in 1982, section 54957 was amended by inserting \u201cevaluation of performance\u201d after \u201cthe appointment, employment\u201d language in the first paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\n<em>Applicable Rules Governing Our Appellate Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The granting, denying, dissolving, or refusal to dissolve a permanent injunction rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>(Union Interchange, Inc. </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 601, 606 [342 P.2d 249]; <em>Gawzner Corp. </em>v. <em>Minier </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 777, 781 [120 Cal.Rptr. 344, 80 A.L.R.3d 726].) However, because continuing relief by injunction operates in the future, \u201c [i]t is the established rule that \u2018on appeals involving injunction decrees, the law in effect when the appellate court renders its opinion must be applied.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McKinny </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 79, 85, fn. 1 [181 Cal.Rptr. 549, 642 P.2d 460], quoting <em>Tulare Dist. </em>v. <em>Lindsay-Strathmore Dist. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 489, 527-528 [45 P.2d 972]; <em>M Restaurants, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Local Joint Exec. Bd. Culinary, etc. Union </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 666, 673-674 [177 Cal.Rptr. 690].)  Moreover, when reviewing the interpretation and proper application of a statute where, as here, the underlying facts are not in dispute, the reviewing court must exercise its independent judgment in making that determination. <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 518, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>522 [187 Cal.Rptr. 273]; <em>West Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins.

Further, it asserts the Legislature by the 1982 amendment manifested its intent that evaluation of employee performance fall within the ambit of the \u201cpersonnel exception,\u201d which likewise includes the terms and conditions of employment of which salary level is an integral part. Moreover, it urges the Legislature enacted section 54957 to protect affected employees from undue public embarrassment during the discussion of personnel matters, including their respective salary levels. Contrarily, the Union argues exceptions to the Brown Act must be narrowly construed with all doubts resolved in favor of open and public meetings; cites the ease with which the City Council can evaluate in executive session the job performances of senior city employees and determine whether the specific official warrants a salary increase and then to meet in public to determine salary adjustment; and claims public policy and the underlying legislative intent of the Brown Act mandate that salaries of city executives be publicly discussed and set.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Our interpretation of the \u201cpersonnel exception\u201d of section 54957 is governed by the following fundamental rules of statutory construction: Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>primary importance, \u201cthe court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672]; <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Board </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) The provision under scrutiny must be given a reasonable and common sense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers, practical rather than technical in nature, which, upon application, will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity. <em>(United Business Com. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 156, 170 [154 Cal.Rptr. 263]; <em>City of Costa Mesa </em>v. <em>McKenzie </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 763, 770 [106 Cal.Rptr. 569].) \u201c \u2018The court should take into account matters such as context, the object in view, the evils to be remedied, the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject, public policy, and contemporaneous construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cossack </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 733 [114 Cal.Rptr. 460, 523 P.2d 260], quoting <em>Alford </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 688 [104 Cal.Rptr. 110]; <em>United Business Com. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>at p. 170.)  As to the latter, opinions of the Attorney General are not binding on the courts, although they have been accorded \u201cgreat weight\u201d in matters of this nature, where controlling authority construing the provision is absent. <em>(Joiner </em>v. <em>City of Sebastopol </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 799, 804-805 [178 Cal.Rptr. 299]; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 875, 883 [144 Cal.Rptr. 568]; <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 384, 388-389 [134 Cal.Rptr. 507].)  Finally, express exceptions to the general statutory rule are to be strictly and narrowly construed and will not be extended beyond the import of their terms. (58 Cal.Jur.3d, Statutes, \u00a7 116, p. 505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The express legislative intent underlying the enactment of the open-meeting requirements of the Brown Act (\u00a7 54953) is set forth in section 54950: \u201cIn enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people\u2019s business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\u201cThe people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.\u201d The Brown Act provides for a \u201cpersonnel exception\u201d in section 54957 al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>lowing closed sessions when the governmental entity is \u201cmeeting to consider the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance or dismissal of a public employee or to hear complaints or charges brought against such employee by another person or employee unless such employee requests a public hearing.\u201d The parties agree the underlying purposes of the \u201cpersonnel exception\u201d are to protect the employee from public embarrassment and to permit free and candid discussions of personnel matters by a local governmental body. (63 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 153, 155 (1980); 61 Ops.Cal. Atty.Gen. 283, 291 (1978); 59 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 532, 534 (1976).)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"> Mindful we must construe the \u201cpersonnel exception\u201d narrowly and the \u201csunshine law\u201d liberally in favor of openness (see, e.g., <em>Wexford Cty. Pros. Atty. </em>v. <em>Pranger </em>(1978) 83 Mich.App. 197 [268 N.W.2d 344, 346-347]), we reject the City Council\u2019s arguments the term \u201cemployment\u201d be broadly interpreted so as to encompass the terms and conditions of continued employment of which salary level determination is an integral part or that the amendment providing for \u201cevaluation of performance\u201d be similarly interpreted. Our determination is consistent with the purpose and mandate of the Brown Act and the specific language of section 54957. Salaries and other terms of compensation constitute municipal budgetary matters of substantial public interest warranting open discussion and eventual electoral public ratification. Public visibility breeds public awareness which in turn fosters public activism politically and subtly encouraging the governmental entity to permit public participation in the discussion process. It is difficult to imagine a more critical time for public scrutiny of its governmental decision-making process than when the latter is determining how it shall spend public funds. With ever-increasing demands on public funds which have dwindled so drastically since the passage of Proposition 13, secrecy cannot be condoned in budgetary determinations, including the establishment of salaries. Granted, evaluating a specific employee\u2019s performance is a matter within the ambit of the \u201cpersonnel exception\u201d in light of the 1982 amendment to section 54957; however, upon the determination a particular public employee is deserving of a salary increase, various other factors must be considered such as available funds, other city funding priorities, relative compensation of similar positions within the city and in other jurisdictions, before determining the salary increase. Each of these considerations is of acute public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Further, there is no basis for the apparent underlying assumption of the City Council\u2019s argument that it cannot evaluate the performance of the cited public employees without also establishing their salaries in executive session. Consistent with both the \u201cpersonnel exception\u201d as to the evaluation of performance of a particular employee and the general mandate of the Brown Act, we envision the two-step process of an executive session eval<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>uating the performance of the public employee and a properly noticed, open session for setting that particular employee\u2019s salary as a facile matter, not negatively affecting the review process. Common sense compels the conclusion that oblique references to discussions of salaries for specific individuals within executive sessions evaluating the performance of that public employee would not violate the Brown Act so long as the specific discussions as to the amount of salary increase are reserved for a properly noticed, public meeting. (See 61 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 283, 288 (1978).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">However, if for any reason the foregoing two-step process proves unworkable, the process could be avoided by adopting a multilevel salary structure designed to compensate the designated officers and employees according to their responsibilities, years of service and job performance, by the City Council after a properly noticed, public session and, if mandated by the charter, ratified by the electorate. (Compare current San Diego City Charter \u00a7\u00a7 27, 40, 70 and 71.) Salary increases could proceed automatically upon City Council determining a specific public employee\u2019s job performance and other credentials warrant a salary adjustment within an executive session.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Had the Legislature intended the \u201cpersonnel exception\u201d to permit closed hearings for the determination of the cited public employees\u2019 salaries, it could have easily included such authorization when it enacted section 54957.6 in 1968 (15 years after the enactment of the Brown Act), which permits the governmental body to meet in executive session with its representative in collective bargaining negotiations to design negotiating strategy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or when it amended section 54957 in 1982.  \u201cIt is assumed that the Legislature has in mind existing laws when it passes a statute. [Citations.] \u2018The failure of the Legislature to change the law in a particular respect when the subject is generally before it and changes in other respects are made is indicative of an intent to leave the law as it stands in the aspects not amended.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Estate of McDill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 831, 837-838 [122 Cal.Rptr. 754, 537 P.2d 874]; <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 56, 65 [81 Cal.Rptr. 465, 460 P.2d 137].) Consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>omission of any reference to salary or other terms of compensation in section 54957 and the express reference to a specific kind of salary discussion within section 54957.6 evidence a legislative intent not to include such salary discussions within the ambit of the \u201cpersonnel exception,\u201d requiring such a hearing dedicated to salary determination to be open and public unless such discussions fall within the narrow provisions of section 54957.6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The Brown Act Addresses a Matter of Statewide Concern and Thus Is not Unconstitutional as Applied to the City Council</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Finally, the Brown Act, as applied to City Council, does not unconstitutionally interfere with its plenary authority over municipal affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\u201cIt has long been settled that, insofar as a charter city [like San Diego] legislates with regard to municipal affairs, its charter prevails over general state law. [Citations.] However, as to matters of statewide concern, charter cities remain subject to state law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sonoma County Organization of Public Employees </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 296, 315-316 [152 Cal.Rptr. 903, 591 P.2d l].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   The determination of what constitutes a strict municipal affair is often a difficult question, ultimately for the courts to decide. (Id., at p. 316.) Where the underlying legislative purpose in enacting a general law reveals an attempt to preempt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>field to the exclusion of local regulation, the fact the Legislature has chosen to deal with the problem on a statewide basis is entitled to great weight; however, it is not determinative of whether the statute in fact relates to a matter of statewide concern. <em>(Ibid; Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 56, 63; <em>District Election etc. Committee </em>v. <em>O'Connor </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 261, 273 [144 Cal.Rptr. 442].) Doubt whether a matter \u201crelates only to a municipal affair or to a broader concern must be resolved in favor of the legislative authority of the state. \u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Department of Health </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 473, 480 [133 Cal.Rptr. 771].)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Granted, a charter city has complete control over its municipal affairs and has direct constitutional power to determine the compensation of its officers and employees. (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5, subds. (a), (b).) However, the Brown Act does not impermissibly infringe in any manner upon this authority. Rather, the procedural nature of the Brown Act\u2019s guarantee all meetings of a governmental body be open to the public unless expressly exempted by statute, designed to eliminate much of the secrecy surrounding the deliberations and decisions on which public policy is predicated (see generally, <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Committee of Taunton </em>(1979) 7 Mass.App. 226 [386 N.E.2d 1295, 1297]), addresses a genuine and pure matter of statewide concern. As section 54950 declares, \u201c[t]he people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.\u201d The fundamental nature of this openness requirement does not impede the city\u2019s exercise of its plenary authority over the establishment of compensation for its executive appointees. The Brown Act does not conflict with any substantive power constitutionally conferred upon charter cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Disposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Brown (Gerald), P.
