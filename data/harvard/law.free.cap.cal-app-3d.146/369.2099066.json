Code, \u00a7 451, subd. (b)) and arson of property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 451, subd. (d)). Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied, and he was sentenced on count I to the low term of three years in state prison. A two-year sentence on count II was stayed (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654). In his brief on appeal, appellant asserted the following grounds of error: (1) His jury trial waiver was procured by fraud on the part of the district attorney; (2) evidence of a prior uncharged offense was improperly admitted; (3) his warrantless arrest was illegal and therefore his subsequent statements to the police should have been suppressed; and (4) the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">At oral argument and in a subsequent letter brief, appellant raised the issue of primary concern to us here: whether the arson of an unoccupied unit in an otherwise occupied apartment building is \u201carson of an inhabited structure\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 451, subd. (b). We hold that it is, and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Appellant was convicted of starting a fire in an apartment in which his estranged wife, Patricia Green, had been living. The fire occurred at approximately 4 a.m. on February 19, 1981. Ron Barry, who lived with Donna Lem in the apartment adjacent to Mrs. Green\u2019s, testified that on that date, at approximately 12:30 a.m., he saw a male Negro fitting appellant\u2019s description walk along a dirt path at the side of the apartment building and stop in the carport area. When Barry walked outside to investigate, the man disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Karen Jolicoeur, who lives across the street from the apartment building, was walking her dog at approximately 2:30 a.m. on February 19 when she \u25a0saw appellant walking in the carport area. He was wearing dark clothes and had a small can in his hands. Appellant was looking up at the apartments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and was ducking behind the cars. He appeared to be drunk, as he was staggering and mumbling to himself. Jolicoeur watched appellant for approximately 20 minutes, until he disappeared down the hallway that leads to the apartment courtyard. Although she had seen him there on other occasions and had called the police, she did not call the police this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Around 4 a.m., Ron Barry heard a small explosion and smelled smoke. He went down to the carport area and saw flames and smoke falling from the carport overhang. The flames were coming from Pat Green\u2019s apartment. Barry shouted a warning then tried to get his and Donna Lem\u2019s cars out of the carport. Ms. Lem\u2019s car, which was parked in Patricia Green\u2019s parking space, caught fire as Barry was trying to remove it, and was eventually destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">After the fire, Karen Jolicoeur, suspecting that appellant was responsible, told the apartment manager and the police that she had seen appellant at the apartment that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigator James Wolfe testified that in his opinion the fire in Mrs. Green\u2019s apartment was deliberately set. The fire started in the dining room area and burned through the floor (which was the roof of the carport). The burn pattern was characteristic of a fire started with a flammable liquid.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">After a two-week investigation during which he interviewed several witnesses, Officer Wolfe decided to arrest appellant, and went to appellant\u2019s home in Lakeview Terrace for that purpose. When appellant answered the door, Wolfe asked him to step outside so that they could talk. After a brief conversation, he placed appellant under arrest. Appellant told the police that he was a security guard for Wells Fargo and was working on the night of February 18-19; Wells Fargo records showed that appellant was off that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Also testifying at appellant\u2019s trial were Donna Lem and David Church. Ms. Lem testified that she and Mrs. Green worked together from July 1980 until February 1981. Mrs. Green worked nights, usually arriving home around 11:45 p.m. On February 15, 1981, four days before the fire, Patricia Green moved to England.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">David Church, another tenant of the Vano wen apartment complex, met appellant during the summer of 1980, when he was introduced to appellant by Mrs. Green. Church testified that appellant told him he was a member of the \u201carson squad\u201d in the Air Force, although appellant denied this and testified that the Air Force did not even have an \u201carson squad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Some time during the summer of 1980, Church went down to the carport area to empty his trash and saw appellant with his head inside the storage cabinet beneath Mrs. Green\u2019s apartment. Appellant ran when he saw Church. Church started to return to his apartment when he smelled smoke, and saw that the storage cabinet was on fire. He got a fire extinguisher and opened the cabinet door, whereupon he saw a plastic bottle which was burning and rapidly melting down. When he attempted to extinguish the fire with the extinguisher, the flames \u201cshot out all over the place.\u201d Church, a mechanic who had experience with gasoline fires, testified that this was characteristic of a gasoline-type fire. Church was also on the scene for the February 19, 1981 fire, which he helped extinguish. He testified that he smelled a gasoline-type odor in Patricia Green\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Appellant testified in his own behalf. He denied setting either the 1980 or February 1981 fires, stating that he had spent 20 years in the Air Force as a fireman and had been \u201cputting out fires all his life.\u201d After retiring from the Air Force, he worked for the Palmdale Fire Department in crash rescue. At the time of the February 19th fire, he was working as security officer for Wells Fargo Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Although he and Patricia Green separated in 1980, they continued to see each other and were on friendly terms, although he never went into Mrs. Green\u2019s apartment due to problems with her son. Appellant claimed that he knew Mrs. Green was leaving-the country, and in fact he was supposed to meet her in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">When questioned during cross-examination, appellant denied having threatened Mrs. Green. In rebuttal, David Church testified that he had overheard several arguments between the Greens. On one occasion, when everyone was sitting around the apartment pool and appellant, in Church\u2019s opinion, had had \u201ca few too many,\u201d appellant told his wife, \u201cIf you don\u2019t shut up, bitch, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">1. Appellant claims that the prosecutor \u201cdefrauded\u201d him into waiving a jury trial because his decision was based upon the state of the evidence at that time, which evidence did not include the testimony of David Church. He implies that the prosecutor concealed the fact that Church would testify in order to induce the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">This serious charge is totally without support in the record. It is apparent that the prosecution located Mr. Church on the second day of trial, and immediately notified the defense of Church\u2019s availability and anticipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>testimony. Defense counsel indicated that he had been caught somewhat off guard by the sudden appearance of Mr. Church, but no mention was made of any \u201cfraud\u201d or other impropriety on the part of the prosecutor. Instead, appellant waited until after he was convicted, then raised the issue of fraud in a motion for new trial. Having thus impugned the prosecutor\u2019s integrity, appellant proceeded, in the motion for new trial, to refute his own claims by way of a supporting declaration by defense counsel, who stated: \u201cAs the Court knows, <em>neither Mr. M\u00edreles or </em>[sz'c] <em>myself were aware of the existence of Mr. Church prior to the trial, </em>and it was only during trial that his identity became known. Had I known about any evidence concerning prior fires as testified to by Mr. Church, there would not have been a jury waiver.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Even if, as appellant claims, he based his jury waiver on the state of the evidence at that time, he has not set forth any facts to support his claim that the waiver resulted from his being \u201cmisled\u201d by the prosecutor. \u201cDefendant should not be allowed to waive a jury trial, take his chances before a trial court, and then when he finds himself dissatisfied with the result, be allowed to predicate error upon ... [a] vague possibility of misunderstanding.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Langdon </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 425, 433 [341 P.2d 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">2. Appellant next contends that the court erred in admitting evidence of the storage unit fire which occurred during the summer of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">As a general rule, evidence of prior uncharged offenses is inadmissible when offered solely to prove the defendant\u2019s disposition or propensity to commit the crime charged. However, \u201c \u2018[w]hen ... a primary issue of fact is whether the defendant\u2014rather than some other person\u2014committed the charged offense, evidence of uncharged offenses is ordinarily admissible if it discloses a distinctive modus operandi common both to the charged and uncharged offenses .... A modus operandi gives rise to a reasonable inference that the charged and uncharged offenses were committed by the same person when the marks common to those offenses set them apart from other offenses of the same general variety.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>DeRango </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 583, 588 [171 Cal.Rptr. 429], citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Matson </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 35, 40 [117 Cal.Rptr. 664, 528 P.2d 752].)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In determining whether evidence relating to a prior uncharged offense should be admitted to show a \u201ccommon design or plan\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b)) the court must look at \u201c \u2018whether there is some clear connection between [the prior] offense and the one charged so that it may be logically inferred that if defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty of the other. Or as the matter is sometimes stated, the other offenses . . . are sufficiently similar and possess a sufficiently high degree of common fea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tures with the act charged where they warrant an inference that if the defendant committed the other acts he committed the act charged. . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 457, 465 [143 Cal.Rptr. 215, 573 P.2d 433].)  Here, the trial court correctly concluded that there were \u201cstrong unifying factors\u201d between the two incidents. The most obvious of these is that Mrs. Green\u2019s apartment was clearly the target of both fires. Both fires were deliberately set, using a flammable liquid which appeared to be gasoline. In each instance, appellant was in the area at or near the time the fires broke out. These factors establish a clear connection between the 1980 fire and the one in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">3. Appellant next claims that his arrest without a warrant violated <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramey </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 263 [127 Cal.Rptr. 629, 545 P.2d 1333], and thus his subsequent statements to police (presumably those to the effect that he was working on the night of the fire) should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In <em>Ramey, </em>the Supreme Court held that a warrantless arrest inside the arrestee\u2019s home is per se unreasonable. The only two exceptions to this rule (which concededly were not present here) are (1) where there are exigent circumstances, or (2) where the arresting officers have consent to enter the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ramey </em>is misplaced, since the arrest took place outside his home. \u201cThe privacy interests protected by <em>Ramey </em>were satisfied when appellant voluntarily stepped outside. Once he stepped outside, it was lawful for the officer to arrest him on probable cause. . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tillery </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 975, 979-980 [160 Cal.Rptr. 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">4. Appellant\u2019s claim that his conviction is unsupported by the evidence is also without merit.  Under the well-established principles of appellate review, we \u201c \u2018must view the evidence in a light most favorable to respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">\u201c[T]he very nature of the crime of arson ordinarily dictates that the evidence will be circumstantial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441, 449 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1].) Some of the factors upon which courts have relied in affirming arson convictions are motive, evidenced by a threat; prior presence in the building; possession of inflammatory materials; presence in the vicinity at the time of the fire; lack of evidence of natural or accidental cause but evidence of intentional (incendiary) cause; and more than one fire with temporal and spatial proximity. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 449-450.) All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of these factors were established here by both direct and circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">5. Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Cardona </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 481 [191 Cal.Rptr. 109], appellant argues that because Mrs. Green had vacated her apartment several days before the fire, the apartment was not \u201cinhabited\u201d at the time of the fire and therefore he should not have been convicted of \u201carson of an inhabited structure. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In <em>Cardona, </em>the defendant was convicted of first degree burglary, that is, \u201cburglary of an inhabited dwelling house.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 460.) As it turned out, the occupants of the home had moved out the day before, and caught the defendant redhanded when they returned to retrieve some of their belongings. The court held that because the victims had moved and no longer intended to use the house as their dwelling, the house was not \u201cinhabited,\u201d in other words, not \u201ccurrently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.) The court then reduced the defendant\u2019s conviction to second degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\"><em>Cardona, </em>however, is inapplicable here. Appellant was convicted of arson under Penal Code section 451. That section provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of arson when he willfully and maliciously sets fire to or burns or causes to be burned or who aids, counsels or procures the burning of, any structure, forest land or property.\u201d Section 451, enacted in 1979, replaced former sections 447a through 450a. Under former section 447a a defendant convicted of arson of (among other things) a \u201cdwelling house\u201d could look forward to a term of \u201cnot less than two or more than 20 years\u201d in state prison. Consistent with the purpose of the determinate sentencing law, which is that punishment be \u201cfixed by statute in proportion to the seriousness of the offense\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170), section 451 fixes the terms of imprisonment for various degrees of arson according to the injury or potential injury to human life involved: \u201carson that causes great bodily injury\u201d (\u00a7451, subd. (a)), five, seven or nine years in state prison; \u201carson that causes an inhabited structure ... to burn\u201d (\u00a7 451, subd. (b)), three, five or seven years; \u201carson of a structure or forest land\u201d (\u00a7 451, subd. (c)), two, four or six years; and \u201carson of property\u201d (\u00a7 451, subd. (d)), 16 months, two or three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Section 451 also substituted the words \u201cinhabited structure\u201d for the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d used in former section 447a. Section 450, subdivision (d) defines \u201cinhabited\u201d as \u201ccurrently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not\u201d; this is the same definition used in the burglary statute, Penal Code section 459. \u201cStructure,\u201d defined in section 450, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(a), includes \u201cany building.\u201d This deliberate and careful choice of language indicates a \u201cmanifest legislative intent to provide more stringent punishment for the narrow category of crimes against property which involves the deliberate attempted or actual burning of buildings likely to be inhabited, because of the obvious danger to human life attendant thereon.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Earnest </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 734, 748 [126 Cal.Rptr. 107].)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Viewed in this context, the words \u201cinhabited structure\u201d in section 451, subdivision (b) must be read together; any other interpretation produces an absurd result. Appellant was convicted of \u201carson of an inhabited structure\u201d because he started a fire in a large apartment building, thus endangering the lives of all of the building\u2019s occupants. Yet he argues in effect that the timely departure of his estranged wife makes his act less blameworthy. This is contrary to public policy and contrary to what the Legislature intended when it enacted section 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Also without merit is appellant\u2019s contention that his conviction on count II (arson of property with respect to Donna Lem\u2019s car) should be reduced to a violation of Penal Code section 452<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the burning was \u201creckless\u201d and not \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d as required by section 451. \u201cWillful\u201d means \u201cintentional,\u201d and \u201c \u2018malice\u2019 denotes nothing more than a deliberate and intentional firing of a building, or other defined structure, as contrasted with an accidental or unintentional ignition thereof; in short, a fire of incendiary origin.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Andrews </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 69, 75 [44 Cal.Rptr. 94].) Here, the fire was set \u201cwillfully and maliciously,\u201d and the fact that some of the resulting damage may have been unintentional is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Feinerman, P. J., and Stephens, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Penal Code section 452 provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of unlawfully causing a fire when he recklessly sets fire to or burns or causes to be burned, any structure, forest land or property . . . . [f] (d) Unlawfully causing a fire of property ... is a misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
