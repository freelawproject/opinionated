For the reasons that follow, we answer this query in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">In its first proposition of law OCSEA asserts that the appellate court erred in determining that the arbitrator exceeded his authority based upon the interpretation of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">In reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award, courts are bound by R.C. 2711.10, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-16\">\u201cIn any of the following cases, the court of common pleas shall make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-17\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-18\">\u201c(D) The arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-19\">Furthermore, in <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union No. 200 </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 516, 71 O.O. 2d 509, 330 N.E. 2d 703, paragraph one of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1975), 423 U.S. 986, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-20\">\u201cA mere ambiguity in the opinion accompanying an arbitration award, which permits the inference that the arbitrator may have exceeded his authority, is not a reason for vacating the award when such award draws its essence from a collective bargaining agreement. <em>(United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp. </em>[1960], 363 U.S. 593, followed.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVj\">In <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court cautioned that \u201c* * * an arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thus, we will accord considerable latitude to an arbitrator, but we recognize his powers are not unlimited in the resolution of labor disputes. \u201cThe arbitrator is confined to the interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement, and although he may construe ambiguous contract language, he is without authority to disregard or modify plain and unambiguous provisions.\u201d <em>Detroit Coil Co. </em>v. <em>Internatl. Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, Lodge No. 82 </em>(C.A.6, 1979), 594 F. 2d 575, 579; see, also, <em>General Drivers, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, Local Union No. 89 </em>v. <em>Hays &amp; Nicoulin, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1979), 594 F. 2d 1093; <em>United Paperworkers\u2019 Internatl. Union </em>v. <em>MISCO, Inc. </em>(1987), 484 U.S. 29, 38. Accordingly, it is our duty to determine whether the arbitrator\u2019s award was reached in a rational manner from the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Detroit Coil, supra; Timken Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union No. 1123, United Steelworkers of America </em>(C.A.6, 1973), 482 F. 2d 1012, 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit, was confronted with a situation similar to the one at bar in <em>S.D. Warren Co. </em>v. <em>United Paperworkers\u2019 Internatl. Union</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(C.A.1, 1988), 845 F. 2d 3, certiorari denied (1988), 488 U.S. 992 <em>(\u201cWarren 1\u201d), </em>and its companion case <em>S.D.

This <em>sole </em>\u2018right includes but is not limited to .. . the right to . . . discharge employees for proper cause . . . .\u201d <em>Warren 1, supra, at </em>6. Furthermore, among the causes listed for discharge appended to the parties\u2019 contract were \u201c* * * [possession, use or sale on Mill property of . . . marijuana . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>The parties agreed that the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority was \u201c \u2018concerned solely with the interpretation and/or application of the collective bargaining agreement,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018the arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision which in any way modifies any provision of the agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Warren 1, </em>as a consequence of a police undercover operation, twelve employees were discharged for possessing, using or selling marijuana. The union filed a grievance regarding three of the employees. The arbitrator found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the employees had violated the drug rules, but rejected the employer\u2019s position that the plain meaning of the contract provided for immediate discharge for the violations. <em>Id. </em>at 6. See, also, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>S.D. Warren </em>v. <em>United Paperworkers\u2019 Internatl. </em>(D.Me. 1986), 632 F. Supp. 463, 465-466. In <em>Warren 1 </em>and <em>Warren 2 </em>the First Circuit concluded that the arbitrator had exceeded her contractual authority in overturning the employees\u2019 discharges. The <em>Warren 1 </em>court held that the penalty for drug violations had been predetermined. <em>Id. </em>at 8. The court went on to state that \u201c[njothing is left to the arbitrator\u2019s judgment except determining whether the rules are violated. An uncomplicated reading of the contract reveals that management has the <em>sole </em>right to discharge employees for cause, the definition of which includes possession of marijuana on Mill property. It is not a question of a strained interpretation by the arbitrator with which we might agree or disagree, but rather a reading of the plain language of the contract which removes from the arbitrator the authority to determine a remedy once she concludes that a certain ride has been breached.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Local 27, United Paperworkers\u2019 Internatl. Union </em>(C.A.1, 1988), 864 F. 2d 940, the First Circuit again was faced with the question of an arbitrator\u2019s authority to interpret disciplinary provisions of a collective bargaining .agreement, somewhat analogous to those in the case at bar. In <em>Georgia-Pacific </em>an employee who had been injured was allowed job absences when his injury made him unable to work. <em>Id. </em>at 941. On several occasions the injured employee notified the company that he would be absent due to his injury, and he received workers\u2019 compensation from the company for the hours he would have worked in such instances. <em>Id. </em>On one occasion, Georgia-Pacific found out that its injured employee had played eighteen holes of golf in a pro-amateur tournament one hundred fifty miles from home on a day when he called in sick. Consequently, the employer discharged the employee for dishonesty. <em>Id. </em>at 942. The pertinent portion of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cB. Causes for Discharge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">\u201c1. Any employee may be discharged for just cause. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing some of the causes for immediate discharge are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">&lt;&lt;* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">\u201c(5) dishonesty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Some of the causes for discharge after proper warning has been given are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-14\">\u201c(1) reading a book, newspapers, etc., while on duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-15\">\u201c(2) failure to report for duty without good reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-17\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-18\">\u201c3. * * * Any employee found under the grievance procedure to have been discharged without just cause shall be reinstated and shall receive pay for time lost.\u201d <em>Georgia-Pacific, supra, </em>at 9-12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">In interpreting this portion of the collective bargaining agreement the arbitrator concluded that the language was unambiguous on its face in allowing the company to discharge the employee immediately for dishonesty, but that the company in this instance lacked just cause to discharge. <em>Id. at </em>943. The <em>Georgia-Pacific </em>court vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award, finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-20\">\u201c* * * The language of the agreement is unequivocal in that it establishes two <em>independent </em>justifications for dismissal: 1) just cause and 2) a list of offenses, including dishonesty, for which immediate discharge is appropriate. * * * The language in this agreement is unambiguous that once dishonesty is established, no further showing is required. In essence, dishonesty, as a ground for immediate discharge, is <em>per se </em>just cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-21\">\u201c* * * Accepting the union\u2019s argument, this list at best would be a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>brief, non-exhaustive list of factors that could, but need not, be considered in a just cause analysis. It would be surprising then that mitigating factors on behalf of the Union also were not included.* * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944-945.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Further, the court noted that \u201c[t]he arbitrator, using reasoning reminiscent of an Alice in Wonderland fantasy,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] held that although he lacked \u2018normal authority\u2019 to mitigate the discharge penalty because of the circumstances of the offense, nevertheless concluded that he possessed \u2018normal authority\u2019 to mitigate on the basis of * * * [the employee\u2019s] overall employment record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. The court concluded that the arbitrator\u2019s actions were an abuse of power. <em>Id. </em>Thus, upon reaching the conclusion that the employee committed an act of dishonesty, which subjected him to discipline, \u201cthe arbitrator was barred from further inquiry because such additional probing constituted \u2018ignoring] the plain language of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>MISCO, Inc., supra, </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In the collective bargaining agreement at issue, the parties agreed in Section 25.03 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201c* * * Only disputes involving the interpretation, application or alleged violation of a provision of the Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. <em>The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of this Agreement, nor shall he/she impose on either party a limitation or obligation not specifically required by the expressed language of this Agreement. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Furthermore, the agreement set forth the appropriate standards of discipline in Section 24.01, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">\u201cDisciplinary action shall not be imposed upon an employee except for just cause. The Employer has the burden of proof to establish just cause for any disciplinary action. In cases involving termination, if the arbitrator finds that there has been an abuse of a patient or another in the care of the State of Ohio, <em>the arbitrator does not have authority to modify the termination of an employee committing such abuse.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">Here, the arbitrator specifically found that Dunning committed abuse, but chose to reinstate her because of the employer\u2019s violation of the just-cause requirement in Section 24.01, which impliedly required notice and fair treatment like that afforded to similarly situated grievants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">Apparently, the arbitrator grafted a just-cause requirement onto the clause governing termination for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>abuse,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thereby violating the clear and unambiguous terms expressed in the agreement. We recognize that an arbitrator departs from the essence of a collective bargaining agreement when: \u201c(1) an award conflicts with express terms of the collective bargaining agreement, * * * [or] (3) an award is without rational support or cannot be rationally derived from the terms of the agreement. * * *\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cement Divisions, Natl. Gypsum Co. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>(C.A.6, 1986), 793 F. 2d 759, 766; <em>Dobbs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Local No. 614, Internatl. Bhd. of Teamsters </em>(C.A.6, 1987), 813 F. 2d 85, 86. Clearly, in the present case the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the clause governing termination for abuse failed to draw its essence from the agreement. Specifically, the arbitrator\u2019s award conflicted with the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement, imposed additional requirements for termination not expressly provided in the agreement, and could not be rationally derived from the terms of the agreement. The arbitrator created, in effect, a contract of his own, rather than applying the contract agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The conclusion that the arbitrator exceeded his authority is further strengthened by the legislative support for mentally retarded persons contained in R.C. Chapter 5123. The grievant in this case was responsible for caring for a mentally retarded person. The patient was totally dependent on the grievant for care and direction. Thus, it is understandable that the parties in their agreement prohibited the arbitrator from modifying any termination for abuse. Returning Dunning to work would risk harm to those in the care and custody of the state. This was not a situation where the employee was fired for being late to work. In this instance the employee physically and verbally <em>abused </em>the patient in direct violation of the employer\u2019s rules and the rights declared in R.C. 5123.62, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">\u201cThe rights of mentally retarded persons and of developmentally disabled persons include, but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">\u201c(A) The right to be treated at all times with courtesy and respect and with full recognition of their dignity and individuality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">\u201c(N) The right to be treated equally as citizens under the law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">\u201c(O) The right to be free from <em>emotional, psychological, </em>and <em>physical abuse[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">Thus, the parties were prevented from making an agreement which would violate the rights contained in R.C. 5123.62. R.C. 5123.64.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Therefore, we hold that OCSEA\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In its second proposition of law OCSEA maintains that the arbitrator was within the stipulated issues presented by the parties. The parties had stipulated that the issue for the second phase of their bifurcated hearing was whether there was just cause for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">As previously discussed, the arbitrator conducted a bifurcated proceeding. First, on October 31, 1987, the arbitrator issued his decision on the burden of proof and the definition of \u201cabuse\u201d as that term is used in Section 24.01 of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. Conceivably, the arbitrator could have determined that Dunning\u2019s acts amounted to something less than abuse, in which case an appropriate just-cause analysis would have been necessary under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">However, the arbitrator not only defined \u201cabuse\u201d in his first hearing, he further stated that the employer must have just cause for a termination associated with abuse. Consequently, the issue had already been framed by the arbitrator prior to the second half of the bifurcated proceeding. Obviously, the arbitrator was under the impression that the parties were in disagreement as to the requirement, if any, of just cause for termination for abuse. That being the case, nothing remained for the parties to stipulate to at the second hearing. The arbitrator exceeded his authority by misinterpreting and exceeding the conditions of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">If the stipulation by the parties were accepted as providing a just-cause component to Dunning\u2019s termination, then the arbitrator would be permitted to exceed the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement. This result would run contrary to the requirement that an arbitrator\u2019s award may only be legitimate when it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Detroit Coil, supra, </em>at 579; <em>Enterprise Wheel, supra, </em>at 597; <em>Goodyear, supra, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Alternatively, no just-cause analysis is required here because abuse is <em>per se </em>just cause. Therefore, the arbitrator was without authority to modify the penalty imposed under the clause governing termination for abuse. Consequently, we find OCSEA\u2019s second proposition wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">OCSEA proposes in its third proposition of law that Dunning\u2019s due process rights were violated by the employer in not adequately notifying Dunning of the specific charges against her. We summarily overrule this proposition of law since the arbitrator\u2019s discussion of the notice given to Dunning was dependent upon a just-cause analysis, which has already been found to be inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-13\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, H.

Moreover, he indicated the employer neglected to inform the grievant of the possible form of discipline, and that the employer failed to adequately distinguish prior disciplinary decisions which did not involve employee removal from the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> Terms in a collective bargaining agreement shall be given their ordinary-meaning in the absence of \u201cevidence indicating that the parties to * * * [the] contract intended to expand or otherwise deviate from that meaning.\u201d <em>Detroit Coil </em>v. <em>Internatl.

The facts of this case may be succinctly set forth as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Juliette Dunning was employed by the state of Ohio, Department of Men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tal Retardation and Developmental Disabilities (\u201cemployer\u201d), as a hospital aide at the Northwest Ohio Developmental Center (\u201ccenter\u201d). Effective October 29, 1986, Dunning was removed from her position as a hospital aide for allegedly \u201cabusing\u201d a resident at the center.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement\" between the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, Local 11, AFSCME, AFL-CIO (\u201cOCSEA\u201d), appellant, and appellee, the state of Ohio, Dunning, a member of OCSEA, filed a grievance challenging her removal. In accordance with the contract, the matter proceeded to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">OCSEA and the employer (\u201cthe parties\u201d) agreed to a bifurcated arbitration hearing. The object of the first phase of the arbitration hearing was to have the arbitrator establish a definition for the term \u201cabuse\u201d as that term is used in Section 24.01 of the collective bargaining agreement. The parties agreed that the arbitrator\u2019s contract interpretation of the term \u201cabuse\u201d would have statewide application and that the arbitrator was empowered to develop a reasonable definition for the term. The object of the second phase of the arbitration hearing was to determine if Dunning\u2019s removal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Section 24.01 of the collective bargaining agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\u201cDisciplinary action shall not be imposed upon an employee except for just cause. The Employer has the burden of proof to establish just cause for any disciplinary action. In cases involving termination, if the arbitrator finds that there has been an abuse of a patient or another in the care or custody of the State of Ohio, the arbitrator does not have authority to modify the termination of an employee committing such abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">With regard to the first phase of the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator issued a written opinion defining the term \u201cabuse.\u201d In this opinion, the arbitrator stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">\u201cThis contract interpretation analysis would be incomplete if the Arbitrator failed to discuss the inherent linkage between the definition of the term \u2018abuse\u2019, and the language contained in Section 24.01 * * * dealing with the scope of an arbitrator\u2019s authority. * * * The standard specified in * * * [Section 24.01] contains an explicit just cause requirement for <em>any </em>* * * disciplinary action. The sentence that follows does not modify but supplements the previous sentence. Thus, a determination that an abuse has been committed does not automatically guarantee that termination is the appropriate penalty. In other words, the Employer must establish that it had just cause to undertake the termination before it can allege that an arbitrator does not have the authority to modify a penalty. The purpose of this provision is to prevent an arbitrator from holding that an employee was terminated for proper cause on the basis of certain misconduct, but that termination for such misconduct should be reduced.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>(Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">More than two and one-half months after the arbitrator issued his opinion regarding the definition of the term \u201cabuse,\u201d the second phase of the arbitration hearing ensued. The issue(s) submitted to the arbitrator at this hearing were stipulated to by OCSEA and OCB as follows: \u201cWhether the removal of Juliette Dunning was for just cause? If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">In an \u201copinion and award\u201d dated March 11, 1988, the arbitrator found that Dunning did engage in the conduct for which she was charged, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cabuse.\u201d However, the arbitrator held that Dunning was not removed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>her position for just cause because, according to the arbitrator, Dunning\u2019s employer violated certain terms of the contract in removing Dunning from her position. The arbitrator also found that the degree of discipline imposed upon Dunning was greater than that imposed upon a former employee who had engaged in similar conduct. Accordingly, the arbitrator ruled that Dunning be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2711, the Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining filed, in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, a motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s March 11,1988 award. The court of common pleas granted OCB\u2019s motion to vacate, finding that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The matter is now before this court for final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Today\u2019s majority concludes that the arbitrator, in awarding reinstatement for Dunning, exceeded his authority under the \u201cexpress terms\u201d of the collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, the majority concludes that the last sentence of Section 24.01 of the contract (which limits an arbitrator\u2019s authority to modify certain terminations) prohibited the arbitrator from modifying Dunning\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">I disagree. In the first phase of the arbitration hearing, the parties empowered the arbitrator to give meaning to the term \u201cabuse\u201d as that term is used in Section 24.01 of the contract. The arbitrator, in completing his task, indicated that the contract required just cause for any termination, including terminations for \u201cabuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">With the benefit of knowing how Section 24.01 would be interpreted by the arbitrator, the parties, in the second phase of the arbitration hearing, <em>agreed </em>to submit to the arbitrator the issue(s) of whether Dunning was terminated for just cause and, if not, what the appropriate remedy should be. In doing so, it is my opinion that the parties (1) clearly expected the arbitrator to address the issue of just cause <em>(i.e </em>whether Dunning\u2019s termination was \u201cjust\u201d and in accordance with the contract), even if \u201cabuse\u201d was found, and (2) provided the arbitrator with the authority to modify Dunning\u2019s termination if Dunning was found to have been terminated without just cause. If the employer merely had wanted the arbitrator to determine whether Dunning was guilty of \u201cabuse,\u201d and had not wanted the arbitrator to determine whether Dunning was terminated for just cause, the employer would have framed the issue submitted to the arbitrator in a different manner. This is particularly true where, as here, the employer knew how Section 24.01 would be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Accordingly, in my judgment, the parties provided the arbitrator with the authority to modify Dunning\u2019s termination <em>even if </em>it can be said that the express terms of the contract limit the arbitrator\u2019s authority to modify any termination for \u201cabuse.\u201d In deciding whether an arbitrator exceeds his authority, it is important to determine whether the arbitrator\u2019s award goes beyond the stipulated issue presented to him by the parties to the arbitration. See, <em>e.g., United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp. </em>(1960), 363 U.S. 593. In the case at bar, the arbitrator decided the very issue submitted to him in a manner which the parties to the arbitration must have contemplated. Thus, I believe that the arbitrator\u2019s award was clearly within the confines of the authority expressly conferred upon him and that, therefore, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Furthermore, in any event, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the arbitrator\u2019s award fails to \u201cdraw its essence\u201d from the terms of the contract. Section 24.01 clearly states that \u201c[disciplinary action shall not be imposed upon an employee except for just cause. The Employer has the burden of proof to establish just cause for any disciplinary action. * * *\u201d Therefore, Section 24.01 requires just cause for <em>every </em>disciplinary action including, of course, terminations. However, Section 24.01 also provides that in cases involving terminations for abuse, the arbitrator has no authority to modify the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The arbitrator, in interpreting Section 24.01, determined that terminations for abuse were not excepted from the just cause requirement, and if just cause existed for such a termination, there could be no reinstatement. Conversely, if there was no just cause for a termination for abuse, there could be no termination. Accordingly, upon finding that Dunning was not terminated fairly and in accordance with the contract, the arbitrator determined that Dunning was terminated without just cause and, hence, awarded reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The majority reads Section 24.01 differently. The majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 24.01 is that once the arbitrator finds \u201cabuse,\u201d an award of reinstatement is prohibited. This interpretation, however, fails to give effect to all the words and phrases used in Section 24.01. Specifically, this interpretation fails to give effect to the requirement in Section 24.01 regarding just cause for all disciplinary actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">I do not agree with the decision of the arbitrator to reinstate Dunning. I believe that any proven abuse of a patient by an employee should result in termination of employment. However, while I would have ruled differently had I been the arbitrator, that does not give me the right to substitute my judgment for that of the arbitrator. The more we weaken this alternative method of dispute resolution, the less it will be used. Arbitration has served us well, and absent a clear and absolute violation by an arbitrator of the arbitrator\u2019s mandate and/or authority, the decision in arbitration should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In my judgment, both the arbitrator\u2019s and the majority\u2019s interpretations of Section 24.01 are reasonable. As such, the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation prevails. See, <em>e.g., Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St. 3d 129, 551 N.E. 2d 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and order that the arbitrator\u2019s award be reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-10\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
