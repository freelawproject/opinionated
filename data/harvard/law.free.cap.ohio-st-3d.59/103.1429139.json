Such a case was <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sherman </em>(C.A. 9, 1978), 581 F. 2d 1358, in which a trial court \u201cforbade the jurors from discussing the case further with anyone * * * and * * * ordered everyone, including the news media, to stay away from the jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1360. Noting that news gathering is protected by the First Amendment, see <em>Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 665, 681, the <em>Sherman </em>court analyzed the order as a prior restraint on speech with \u201ca heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.\u201d <em>Sherman, supra, </em>at 1361, citing <em>Bantam Books </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 58, 70. To overcome this presumption, the order\u2019s proponents had to show \u201cthat the activity restrained poses a clear and present danger or a serious and imminent threat to a protected competing interest * * *\u201d; that the restraint was narrowly drawn; and that no reasonable, less restrictive alternatives were available. <em>Sherman, supra, </em>at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Respondent trial court in <em>Sherman </em>suggested two justifications for the order. First, it argued that the order was needed \u201cto enable the jurors to serve on future jury panels * * The <em>Sherman </em>court rejected this argument, reasoning that if post-verdict discussion of a past case threatened a juror\u2019s impartiality in future cases, \u201cthat could be discovered on future voir dire and the juror excused.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Second, respondent argued that the order would \u201cprotect the jurors from harassment.\u201d But the appellate court pointed out that \u201cjurors individually, perhaps, may not regard media interviews as harassing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Sherman </em>court noted that trial courts may remedy actual harassment, but concluded that \u201cthis order is too broad.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">A similar ban on post-verdict juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>interviews was overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>In re Express-News Corp. </em>(C.A. 5, 1982), 695 F. 2d 807. In <em>Express-News, </em>a local rule of court forbade interviewing any juror about the jury\u2019s deliberations or verdict in any action without leave of court. <em>Id. </em>at 808. Relying partly on <em>Sherman, </em>the appellate court held the rule unconstitutional as applied. The rule was not \u201cnarrowly tailored to prevent a substantial threat to the administration of justice.\u201d Instead, like the judge\u2019s order here, it was \u201cunlimited in time and in scope, applying equally to jurors willing and anxious to speak and jurors desiring privacy, forbidding * * * courteous as well as uncivil communications, and foreclosing questions about a juror\u2019s general reactions as well as specific questions about other jurors\u2019 votes that might, at least under some circumstances, be inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. Accord <em>Journal Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Mechem </em>(C.A. 10, 1986), 801 F. 2d 1233. See, also, <em>In re Memphis Pub. Co. </em>(C.A. 6, 1989), 887 F. 2d 646, 649; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doherty </em>(D. Mass. 1987), 675 F. Supp. 719, 724 (trial court \u201cdid not and could not order\u201d discharged jurors to refrain from discussing deliberations); <em>State, ex rel. Beacon Journal, </em>v. <em>McMonagle </em>(Ohio App. 1982), 8 Med. L. Rptr. 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Respondents in the instant case advance two justifications for the trial court\u2019s order. First, they argue that the order simply enforces the jury\u2019s already expressed desire not to talk to the press about the case. There is authority suggesting that such an order would be proper. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrelson </em>(C.A. 5, 1983), 713 F. 2d 1114, the court of appeals upheld a trial court\u2019s order forbidding anyone to make \u201crepeated requests\u201d that a juror discuss a case after the juror\u2019s refusal to do so. The corut considered it reasonable to limit would-be questioners to one request; once that request was refused, any further queries would amount to \u201cnagging.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We do not doubt the trial court\u2019s power, even after trial, to protect juror privacy from overly persistent interrogation. Nonetheless, respondents\u2019 argument fails for two reasons. First, the jurors have not expressed a desire to eschew discussion of the case. The only evidence that the jury did not want to talk was the foreman\u2019s statement; individual jurors were not asked. See <em>Sherman, supra, </em>at 1362 (district court\u2019s order erroneous because it deprived media of opportunity to ask jurors whether they wished to be interviewed). Indeed, it is not clear that the foreman even claimed to speak for every juror. He simply said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d \u201cWe\u201d could have meant \u201ca majority\u201d or \u201ca consensus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Second, even if the foreman did speak for everyone on the jury, Judge Ruehlman\u2019s order does not allow for the possibility that some jurors may change their minds and choose to talk about the case. The order thus goes further than the asserted goal requires. Cf. <em>Harrelson, supra, </em>at 1118 (noting that juror who changes his mind remains free to initiate an interview).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Reasonable, less restrictive measures were available to protect juror privacy. Certainly a court may instruct the jurors that they have no obligation to discuss the case with anyone. <em>Sherman, supra, </em>at 1361-1362; <em>Express-News, supra, </em>at 811; <em>Journal Pub., supra, </em>at 1236-1237; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>(N.D. Ind. 1982), 546 F. Supp. 1133, 1144-1145. Or, like the trial court in <em>Harrelson, </em>a court may forbid reporters to pester jurors for interviews once the jurors have refused to talk. Such measures protect jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>from harassment without violating First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">As a second justification for the order, respondents remind us that \u201cthe jury system and its deliberations * * * depend upon * * * confidentiality.\u201d \u201cFreedom of debate might be stifled and independence of thought checked if jurors were made to feel that their arguments and ballots were to be freely published to the world.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1933), 289 U.S. 1, 13 (Cardozo, J.). Accord Sharp, Postverdict Interrogation of Jurors by the Press: Is the First Amendment Absolute? (1984), 27 Res Gestae 380, 381; Note, Public Disclosures of Jury Deliberations (1983), 96 Harv. L. Rev. 886, 889-891.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Because confidentiality is important to the jury\u2019s independence, courts have upheld orders forbidding jurors to discuss the specific votes of other jurors. <em>Harrelson, supra, </em>at 1118, citing <em>Clark, supra. </em>See, also, <em>Express-News, supra, </em>at 810; <em>Journal Pub., supra, </em>at 1237 (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Again, however, Judge Ruehlman\u2019s order is too broad. Instead of narrowly focusing, like the order upheld in <em>Harrelson, </em>on protecting the confidentiality of other jurors\u2019 specific votes or opinions, Judge Ruehlman\u2019s order would prohibit a juror from waiving the confidentiality of even his own votes and opinions. Such a \u201ccategorical denial of all access,\u201d not tailored to the objectives cited to justify it, violates the First Amendment. <em>Express-News, supra, </em>at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Respondents cite our recent decision in <em>Tasin </em>v. <em>SIFCO Industries, Inc. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St. 3d 102, 553 N.E. 2d 257, as supporting the constitutionality of Judge Ruehlman\u2019s order. Noting the importance of \u201c \u2018full and frank discussion in the jury room\u2019 * * we held in <em>Tasin </em>that \u201ca local rule * * * which prohibits post-trial communication between parties or their counsel and jurors, without leave of court, for the purpose of investigating the validity of the verdict, is not an unconstitutional prior restraint on freedom of speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 553 N.E. 2d at 263, quoting <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 107, 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">We reject any analogy with <em>Tasin. </em>The local rule we upheld there restricted only parties and their counsel; the trial court\u2019s order here applies to \u201ceveryone.\u201d This distinction has twofold significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">First, \u201c[b]y voluntarily assuming the special status of trial participants and officers of the court, parties and their attorneys subject themselves to greater restraints on their communications than might constitutionally be applied to the general public.\u201d <em>Haeberle </em>v. <em>Texas Internatl. Airlines </em>(C.A. 5, 1984), 739 F. 2d 1019, 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Second, the rule we upheld in <em>Tasin </em>was justified by \u201ca \u2018weighty government interest in insulating the jury\u2019s deliberative process\u2019 from post-verdict inquiry by the parties.\u201d <em>Tasin, supra, </em>at 108, 553 N.E. 2d at 263, quoting <em>Tanner, supra, </em>at 120. We noted that \u201c \u2018[prohibiting post-verdict interviews protects the jury from an effort to find grounds for post-verdict charges of misconduct, reduces the \u201cchances and temptations\u201d for tampering with the jury, increases the certainty of civil trials, and spares the district courts time-consuming and futile proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Haeberle, supra, </em>at 1021. These concerns simply do not justify an order aimed at nonparties, who have \u201cless incentive to upset a verdict than does a losing party or attorney.\u201d <em>Journal Pub., supra, </em>at 1236. See, also, <em>Express-News, supra, </em>at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">We thus reject both proffered justifications for Judge Ruehlman\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>One commentator has suggested a third possible justification for imposing broad post-verdict gag orders on jurors. \u201c* * * [EJxposure of jury-deliberations brings to light not only differences. of opinion among jurors, but also decisional premises with which various members of the public are bound to disagree. The revelation of these inevitable yet disquieting divergences may unnecessarily undermine public acceptance of jury verdicts.\u201d Note, Public Disclosures of Jury Deliberations, <em>supra, </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">On this reasoning, then, a trial court may forbid discharged jurors to discuss the cases on which they sat, because such discussion might \u201cunjustifiably impair public respect for the [jury] system,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 892; it might, in other words, influence public opinion in a way the court dislikes. Such reasoning is inconsistent on its face with the principles underlying the First Amendment, and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In sum, respondents contend that the trial court\u2019s order serves important state interests, but we believe those interests would be as well or better served by a less restrictive, more narrowly focused order. We hold, therefore, that the order issued here violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Having concluded that the order was unconstitutional, we now consider the remedy. Since the Post was not a party to the action in the common pleas court, it lacks standing to appeal the order. Thus, the Post lacks an adequate remedy at law, and some form of extraordinary relief is appropriate. See <em>In re T.R. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St. 3d 6, 11, 556 N.E. 2d 439, 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Relator asks for a -writ of mandamus, but relator\u2019s object is to keep Judge Ruehlman from enforcing his order; thus, \u201cthe requested relief would restrict, rather than compel, respondents * * <em>State, ex rel. Hensley, </em>v. <em>Nowak </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St. 3d 98, 556 N.E. 2d 171, 172. That is not the office of a writ of mandamus. \u201cA writ of mandamus compels action or commands the performance of a duty * * <em>State, ex rel. Smith, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 303, 22 O.O. 349, 39 N.E. 2d 838, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">However, writs of prohibition have issued to prevent courts from enforcing gag orders that unconstitutionally impair the press\u2019 right to gather news. See, <em>e.g., In re T.R., supra; State, ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co., </em>v. <em>Lake Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St. 3d 104, 107, 556 N.E. 2d 1120, 1124. Thus, we will treat relator\u2019s complaint in mandamus as one in prohibition. See <em>State, ex rel. Burech, v. Belmont Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 154, 156, 19 OBR 437, 438, 484 N.E. 2d 153, 155. Finding the trial court\u2019s order unconstitutional, we allow the writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright, H.
