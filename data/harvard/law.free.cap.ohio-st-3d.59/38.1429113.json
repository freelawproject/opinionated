In its decision below, the BTA held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply in this case, and that appellant\u2019s use of the subject property was not exempt as property used by a charitable institution, under R.C. 5709.121 and 5709.12, or by a public institution of learning, under R.C. 5709.07. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">In deciding the issue of collateral estoppel, the BTA relied upon <em>Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 133, 135, 16 O.O. 3d 150, 151, 403 N.E. 2d 996, 999, and <em>Beatrice Foods Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 29, 35, 24 O.O. 3d 68, 71, 434 N.E. 2d 727, 731. The basic elements that must exist before the doctrine can be applied, as identified in these decisions are: (1) an administrative proceeding of a judicial nature, (2) an identity of the parties, and (3) an identity of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\"><em>In Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, supra, </em>at 135, 16 O.O. 3d at 151, 403 N.E. 2d at 999, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-14\">\u201cThis court must decide whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel can be applied to decisions rendered by administrative bodies.\u201d We held that it \u201cmay be used to bar litigation of issues in a second administrative proceeding,\u201d <em>id., </em>but only \u201cwhere an administrative proceeding is of a judicial nature and where the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate the issues involved in the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">In the instant appeal there is no indication of an administrative proceeding of a judicial nature as to the 1942 and 1960 determinations, or an opportunity of the parties to litigate the issues involved. The Tax Commissioner was not a party to any of the prior determinations. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s collateral estoppel argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">Appellant has consistently argued that it is a qualified charitable institution or, alternatively, a public institution of learning, and thus entitled to exemption for the subject real estate. The Tax Commissioner contends that appellant is a professional association and its principal purpose is to advance the interests of its membership. She argues that any charitable or educational activity and any use of the property for the public good are merely incidental to the overall and primary purpose of appellant\u2019s use of the real\u2019 estate</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">R.C. 5709.12 (now 5709.12[B]&gt; exempts real property if \u201cused exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>5709.07 (now 5709.07[A][4]) provides exemption for real estate \u201cconnected with public institutions of learning, <em>not </em>used with a view to profit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">R.C. 5709.121(B), as applicable here, sets forth the standards for exemption from taxation based on the exclusive use of property for charitable purposes: The property must be \u201c[otherwise made available under the direction or control of such institution * * * for use in furtherance of or incidental to its charitable, educational, or public purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In <em>Cincinnati Nature Center Assn. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 122, 125, 2 O.O. 3d 275, 277, 357 N.E. 2d 381, 383, we decided: \u201cTo fall within the terms of R.C. 5709.121, property must (1) be under the direction or control of a charitable institution or state or political subdivision, (2) be otherwise made available \u2018for use in furtherance of or incidental to\u2019 the institution\u2019s \u2018charitable * * * or public purposes,\u2019 and (3) not be made available with a view to profit.\u201d While it is doubtful that appellant\u2019s use of the property is principally for a charitable purpose as opposed to a self-serving use, appellant\u2019s claim of exemption must fail, nevertheless, upon analysis of the third factor, namely, that it not use the property to make a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Statutes providing exemption from taxation must be strictly construed. <em>National Tube Corp. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 407, 47 O.O. 313, 105 N.E. 2d 648, paragraph two of the syllabus. More specifically, as we set forth in <em>Seven Hills Schools </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 186, 28 OBR 275, 503 N.E. 2d 163, 164: \u201c* * * Exemption is the exception to the rule and statutes granting exemption are strictly construed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The term \u201cprofit,\u201d therefore, must be given its full definition. Profit is \u201cthe excess of the price received over the cost of purchasing and handling or of producing and marketing goods\u201d or \u201cnet income (as in a business) usu. for a given period of time.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1811; <em>Seven Hills, supra, </em>at 187-188, 28 OBR at 276-277, 503 N.E. 2d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Appellant\u2019s chief operating officer testified before the BTA that the preponderance of education revenue received by A.S.M. was from courses given at the subject property. He agreed that A.S.M. had made a \u201cnet profit from the sale of publications\u201d; and that A.S.M. \u201coperate[d] every year with a view to having * * * operating revenues exceed * * * operating expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">This testimony establishes that appellant\u2019s use of the subject property resulted in a \u201cprofit,\u201d thus disqualifying appellant from real property tax exemption under R.C. 5709.12 and 5709.121.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Nor can appellant establish its right to exemption as a public institution of learning. R.C. 5709.07 provided: \u201cPublic schoolhouses and houses used exclusively for public worship * * * and the ground attached to such buildings necessary for the proper occupancy, use, and enjoyment thereof, and not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit, public colleges and academies and all buildings connected therewith, and all lands connected with public institutions of learning, not used with the view to profit, shall be exempt from taxation. * * *\u201d (Currently found in R.C. 5709.07[A][1] through [A][4].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">Here again the profit factor set forth in R.C. 5709.121 defeats appellant\u2019s claim for exemption. Moreover, the definition of \u201cpublic institution of learning,\u201d as observed by the BTA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>parallels that of \u201cpublic colleges and universities\u201d and contemplates a place of training and instruction with a teacher-student character. <em>American Chemical Society </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 258, 260, 16 O.O. 3d 288, 290, 405 N.E. 2d 272, 274. Appellant conceded it was not an accredited institution, but its courses are intended to be a supplementary, self-improvement experience. The courses are only of a two-day to five-day duration. They involve only a small part of appellant\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Since appellant does not use its property as a charitable institution or as a public institution of learning within the meaning of the taxing statutes, and since it is not entitled to rely upon the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the decision of the BTA not to grant real property tax exemption to appellant was neither unreasonable nor unlawful, and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, H.
