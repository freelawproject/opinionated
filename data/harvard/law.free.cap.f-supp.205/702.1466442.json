Diversity is present. Cross-motions were filed: defendant moves to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiff' seeks summary judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-21\">Plaintiff is in the retail business of selling home furnishings and clothing; defendant in the money loan business. It is the parent of a number of operating subsidiaries. Plaintiff alleges among its holdings were all shares of four operating corporations engaged in the loan finance business and, on August 30, 1956, defendant offered to purchase the stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>of plaintiff\u2019s operating companies foils,500,000. The offer was accepted and settlement was made on September 20, 1956. Four separate closing agreements were signed by the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention here is defendant is guilty of breach of the agreement by allocating $1,218,742.80 of the purchase price for the stock it sold to defendant to the cost of covenants of plaintiff appearing in two of the four agreements not to compete in the loan business. Defendant and apparently its subsidiaries amortized this cost over a five-year period and claimed such deductions in their income tax returns, i. e., defendant and its subsidiaries in contesting Federal income tax liability in 1956 and subsequent years have contended to the taxing authorities the sum of $1,218,742.80 was paid as consideration for the covenants not to compete. Plaintiff alleges this interpretation of its agreement with defendant has caused the Government to reopen plaintiff\u2019s own income tax liability for 1956 and to assert a deficiency against it in the amount of $329,060.55, the difference between the tax already paid by plaintiff at capital gains rates and the possible tax at ordinary income tax rates upon the sale price for the stock it sold defendant. Plaintiff states if the Court enjoins defendant from maintaining its position, under the original contract between the parties, the Internal Revenue Service will withdraw the asserted deficiency in tax against plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b750-5\">E.

Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">As originally adopted in 1934 the exemption with respect to Federal taxes was not contained in the statute, thus leading to serious speculation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the then new declaratory judgment act could be used as a quick way for persons to gain a determination of tax status. The additional words were specially fashioned to avoid any such \u201cradical departure from the long-continued policy of Congress * * * with respect to the determination, assessment, and collection of Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>eral taxes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That the exemption does prevent a taxpayer from obtaining declaratory relief from the Commissioner has been frequently proclaimed through the years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">But, in the ease at bar, however, one plaintiff-taxpayer seeks declaratory relief from an alleged breach of contract<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by the other contracting party, which breach plaintiff claims will result in serious consequences of a tax nature to it. Defendant simply says this matter is \u201cwith respect to federal taxes\u201d and obviously falls within the specific exemption found in the present Declaratory Judgment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">I cannot agree. For, if plaintiff\u2019s allegations in fllO of its complaint are true, defendant has breached the contract. If, for example, the contract had stated explicitly what plaintiff claims it stated \u201cby necessary and inevitable implication\u201d, i. e., that defendant pledged not to allocate or cause its subsidiaries to allocate any part of the purchase price to the covenants not to compete, found in two of the four separate agreements signed by the parties, then plaintiff would have a valid action for breach of contract against defendant. Too, it would have a valid action under the Declaratory Judgment Act to prevent the alleged subsequent breach from occurring.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Thus I hesitate to deny plaintiff an opportunity to be heard simply on the basis of the exemption in the statute. This Court should examine the facts and determine whether plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the contract is correct. This Court may not determine tax liability; but it may determine facts which may have a direct, even immediate, bearing on what the tax liability will be.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The fact that plaintiff has \u201ctax motives\u201d for bringing this suit to determine rights of parties under their contract cannot squeeze this action into the statutory exemption by virtue of depriving this Court of jurisdiction. Such motives are relevant in determining the quantum of taxes due; they are not relevant in determining whether a party has made a claim to which he is entitled to declaratory relief. Veil-piercing techniques have a place in the law, particularly in the law of corporate action and taxation, but such mechanisms should not lead Courts to dismiss timely actions on the basis of a search for such motive-hunting. If the declaratory judgment act affords plaintiff a remedy, the mere bringing of the suit is an act of independent legal significance; and a plaintiff\u2019s motive, under such circumstances, has no relevance on whether the Court should exercise its judgment in taking cognizance of the law suit and whether the Court should decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\">2. Defendant\u2019s argument that a judgment of this Court would be binding neither on the Commissioner of Internal Revenue nor the Treasury Department nor the Tax Court is true, but also irrelevant. It should be understood the most plaintiff can receive by way of declaratory judgment from this Court is a determination that defendant has breached its contract with plaintiff. Final decisions as to taxes are decisions for the Tax Court. Functioning under its expertise, it will determine how much, if anything, defendant may claim was paid as consideration for the covenants not to compete mentioned in the agreements. It may engage [as this Court will not] in the balancing process of determining how much, if any, of the $1,218,742.80 allegedly paid for covenants not to compete may be so treated for tax purposes. The point of the matter here is that all plaintiff asks is for this Court to bind defendant against its breach, not the United States. I think this Court has power so to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">3. Defendant\u2019s third point is essentially for dismissal on the merits because the exhibits show it made no representation such as plaintiff claims here. As this claim is similar to that of plaintiff for summary judgment, it shall be considered, infra, together with that particular motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">4. Defendant\u2019s argument that the same issues as are being tried here are already before the Tax Court may have merit. It is true that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">\u201cUpon reaching the conclusion that the ends of justice would be best served by such a course * * [of declining jurisdiction] a court of the United States in its discretion may refuse declaratory relief because another court has jurisdiction in an executory or non-declaratory action of proceedings involving <em>an issue identical with that involved in the suit for declaratory relief. </em>Such a conclusion must be based upon sound reasons why under all the circumstances a non-declaratory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>executory action is to be preferred over a suit for a declaration. See Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, p. 181 et seq.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Here it would seem the issues may be identical with those before the Tax Court. The same contract may there be interpreted; the same parties may there be heard; the same factors may there be weighed in making a determination as to the tax consequences of the sales agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">If the Tax Court does, in fact, take into account issues identical with those that would be taken into account here, and every issue that would be so taken into account, this case might then be ripe for dismissal on the basis of the Tax Court determination. But if the Tax Court does not, the case at bar might then be heard by trial; and, while an injunction would no longer aid plaintiff, damages could and might issue from this Court in the form of a monetary decree were it to find what plaintiff claims here. Meanwhile, it would serve no useful purpose to hear this case at the present time; but it well might be an injustice to dismiss it. Therefore, the present case shall be stayed until the Tax Court\u2019s decision is made; this will enable this Court to consider its further decision as to what may then appear to be meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">II. <em>Summary Judgment. </em>While the above decision to stay these proceedings allows this Court the option of staying determination on plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the motion has been made, briefed, and argued; and it best be disposed of at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">The object of a motion for summary judgment \u201cis to separate what is formal or pretended in denial or averment from what is genuine and substantial, so that only the latter may subject a suitor to the burden of a trial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has again recently restated the general policy with respect to the granting of such motions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-19\">\u201cSummary judgment should be entered only when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and admissions filed in the case \u2018show that [except as to the amount of damages] there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 Rule 56(c), Fed.Rules Civ. Proc., [28 U.S.C.A.] This rule authorizes summary judgment \u2018only where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, where it is quite clear what the truth is, * * * [and where] no genuine issue remains for trial * * * [for] the purpose of the rule is not to cut litigants off from their right of trial by jury if they really have issues to try.\u2019 Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., 321 U.S. 620, 627 [64 S.Ct. 724, 88 L.Ed. 967].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-21\">In the second circuit, debate, always instructive and often profound, has been long-standing between those proponents of the views of Judge Clark, who favor a broader grant of summary judgment, and those of the late Judges Learned Hand and Frank, who favored a more limited grant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this circuit, the decision has long since been reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>that courts will look particularly closely to insure that parties are not too quickly deprived of a \u201cfull dress\u201d trial. Hart &amp; Co. v. Recordograph Corporation, 3 Cir., 169 F.2d 580.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the present case, genuine factual dispute exists on numerous issues which would require sustained and detailed consideration to determine. Two examples should suffice:</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">(a) Plaintiff claims the contract of sale was entered into on September 7, 1956, as a result of its acceptance of an offer made August 30, 1956, by defendant in a letter which defendant stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\u201cFrom your standpoint, the transaction will simply entail your sale of all of the stock of your subsidiaries for the purchase price set out in the first paragraph of this letter. We are advised by counsel that this sale will constitute a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes, and you will be required to report the gain or profit on each of the sales. By definition of Section 1221 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, corporate stock constitutes the capital asset so that the gain or profit on the sales will be taxable at capital gain rates, which at present is a maximum of 25% of the gain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\u201cWhile we realize your company is not concerned with our procedures after completion of the purchase of this stock, we felt you might be interested in knowing that after the purchase, our subsidiaries will liquidate and dissolve the corporations which they have acquired under the provisions of Section 334(b) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code. This procedure is necessary since our purpose in this purchase is to acquire the loan contract of your subsidiaries rather than their stock. Following this liquidation and in line with our corporate policy of having each office a separate corporation, we will form additional subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, each of which will acquire the assets of one office.\u201d<footnotemark>1<em>4</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">Defendant argues that these two paragraphs fall in the same category as every other \u201cvagrant thought\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> expressed by the parties during the course of negotiation and that only the final agreement dated September 20, 1956 should be considered in determining what the parties meant by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">(b) Plaintiff claims that neither \u201cat the time of execution of these closing agreements, nor at any time prior thereto, had there been any negotiation whatsoever between the parties concerning any covenant not to compete, and no agreement was at any time made which modified the agreement of the parties of September 7, 1956. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Defendant replies that f[7 \u00b0f the proposed contract specifically provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-15\">\u201cAs a material part of the consideration for this contract, Seller specifically agrees that it will not, for a period of three (3) years from and after that date of this agreement, either directly or indirectly, individually or in association with others, engage in the business of making loans. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">Defendant further argues that this matter was under negotiation and consideration prior to August 30, 1956,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that the extent of the negotiations is indicated by the fact that the final agreement of September 20, 1956, extended the time limit of the covenants, as stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>draft, from three to five years, and only applied them to two of the four subsidiary corporations purchased by defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The disposition of these two issues alone manifestly would cut much of the heart out of this case. But such issues can be evaluated neither by lawyer\u2019s briefs nor by participants\u2019 affidavits. They can be critically analyzed for evaluation only by consideration of testimony of witnesses under oath, subject to cross examination and bound by rules of evidence as to what these parties did intend, what these negotiations did encompass, and what these agreements do require. A trial, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has written, \u201cis not a game of blind man\u2019s buff.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Neither is the opportunity to grant summary judgment a call for judges to decide cases blindly. Granted too expeditiously, summary judgment becomes summary justice. The summary judgment mechanism negates the inquisitorial and fact-finding function of the trial judge, especially absent the jury as is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal is \u2022 denied; and plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is also denied. Further action in this case shall be stayed until proceedings involving the parties in the Tax Court are completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">An order may be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 301, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed. 1407:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-13\">\u201c* * * [W]e think it plain also that the enactment of the Act of August 30, 1935, 49 Stat. 1027, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 400(1), which excluded from the operation of the Declaratory Judgments Act all cases involving \u25a0 federal taxes, cannot be taken to deprive the courts of their discretionary authority to withhold declaratory relief in other appropriate cases. This amendment was passed merely for the purpose of \u2018making it clear\u2019 that the Declaratory Judgments Act would not permit \u2018a radical departure from the long-continued policy of Congress\u2019 to require prompt payment of federal taxes.
