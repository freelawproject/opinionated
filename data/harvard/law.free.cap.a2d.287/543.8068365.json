In so doing, we deny the instant application because, as a matter of law, this case is inappropriate for interlocutory review under \u00a7 11-721(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-21\">Respondent brought suit against the applicants in the Landlord and Tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Branch of the Superior Court, seeking both the possession of certain leased premises and a money judgment for back rent. Service was not made on either of the named applicants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who had vacated the premises prior to the initial hearing, thus rendering the possessory action moot. Applicants then filed a motion to dismiss, contesting the jurisdiction of the trial court to render a money judgment where no personal service had been made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The denial of that motion is the subject of the instant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Our task in setting forth the guidelines needed to assist both litigants' and trial judges in their determinations as to the proper scope of the interlocutory appeals provision is simplified by the existence of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1970), the analogous U.S.Code provision on which \u00a7 11-721 (d) was modeled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In the first judicial interpretation of that provision, Milbert v. Bison Laboratories, Inc., 260 F.2d 431, 433 (3d Cir. 1958), the court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">It is quite apparent from the legislative history of the Act of September 2, 1958 that Congress intended that section 1292(b) should be sparingly applied. It is to be used only in exceptional cases where an intermediate appeal may avoid protracted and expensive litigation and is not intended to open the floodgates to a vast number of appeals from interlocutory orders in ordinary litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-16\">Keeping that legislative purpose in mind, as well as the long standing judicial awareness of the increased burdens piecemeal appeals place on both courts and litigants, the federal courts have determined that \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-17\">[permission to allow interlocutory appeals should ... be granted sparingly and with discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">Although changing judicial needs have required a certain flexibility in the use of \u00a7 1292(b), what has been characterized as the \u201cexceptional case\u201d doctrine has become the guide to its application. There can be no rigid formulation of the standards implicit in that doctrine. It is evident, however, that the disadvantages inherent in piecemeal review must be substantially outweighed by the possibility of mitigating what might otherwise be protracted and expensive litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That approach has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>been followed by the United States Court of Appeals for this circuit in Groover, Christie &amp; Merritt v. LoBianco, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 51, 336 F.2d 969, 970 (1964) where the court noted that it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">Fully mindful of the well established policy opposed to the allowance of piecemeal appeals, and quite aware that only in the exceptional case have we permitted such an interlocutory appeal .... <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Prior to making the certification required by the statute, the trial court must first determine whether the litigation before it is properly suited to the application of \u00a7 1292(b); and while the terms \u201cprotracted and expensive\u201d are relative, it is clear that the discretion of the trial court in these matters is not unlimited. It was neither the intention of Congress, nor has it been the practice of courts, that the statute would apply in those situations where a trial on the merits would be shorter than the time required by this court to determine whether to allow the appeal \u2014 much less resolve the issue raised.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in no way limits our power to independently determine the suitability of \u00a7 11-721 (d) to the litigation involved. This court \u201cmust do more than give a pro forma \u2018rubber-stamp\u2019 approval of the . . . [trial] court\u2019s certificate.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">We agree with those who feel that it serves no purpose to speak in terms of time worn cliches when dealing with the interlocutory appeals provision. Ex parte Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. [Ex parte Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.], 322 F.2d 113, 115 (5th Cir. 1963); Hadjipateras v. Pacifica, S.A., 290 F.2d 697, 702 (5th Cir. 1961). However this court is also cognizant of the need to clearly indicate, at this stage, its adoption of the position taken by the federal courts that if such appeals are to serve the purpose for which they were intended, they must be used only when the alternative would mean greater delay and expense than would be caused by the interlocutory review itself. It is evident that only in the \u201cexceptional\u201d case will that be the result. Neither \u00a7 1292(b) nor \u00a7 11-721(d) was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">[I]ntended merely to provide [interlocutory] review of difficult rulings in hard cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">Application denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-12\">. D.C.Code 1967, \u00a7 11-721 (d) (Supp. IV, 1971) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">(d) When a judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in making in a civil case (other than a ease in which a child, as defined in section 16-2301, is alleged to be delinquent, neglected, or in need of supervision) a ruling or order not otherwise appeal-able under this section, shall be of the opinion that the ruling or order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for a difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the ruling or order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation or case, he shall so state in writing in the ruling or order. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from that ruling or order, if application is made to it within ten days after the issuance or entry of the ruling or order. An application for an appeal under this subsection shall not stay proceedings in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia unless the judge of that court who made such ruling or order or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">.
