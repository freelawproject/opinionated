They explain that the moderate amount charged for defendant\u2019s board and lodging was because defendant, who it appears was engaged in the fish and fur business, was often away. That the price was fixed on an average, and that if defendant had been continuously boarding they would not have consented to any amount under forty or forty-five dollars per month. Plaintiff\u2019s wife kept a memorandum of the payments in cash made by defendant, and she is positive as to the amounts for which defendant is given credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">Defendant, on the other hand, does not remember, except in a general way, and to many questions he pleads lack of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">The question involved is purely \"one of fact, and we see no reversible error in the conclusions reached by the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
