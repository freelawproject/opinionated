The complaint in the instant case clearly did not state a cause of action entitling the plaintiff to the injunction <em>pendente lite </em>granted by the court at Special Term, and the record will be searched in vain for any extrinsic facts entitling the plaintiff to such relief. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Bunnell, </em>113 N. Y. 216; <em>Bachman </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>184 N. Y. 458; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Stirone, </em>232 App. Div. 262; <em>Matter of Dietz, </em>138 App. Div. 283; <em>Matter of Greene, </em>153 App. Div. 8; <em>McHenry </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>90 N. Y. 58; <em>Brass </em>v. <em>Rathbone, </em>153 N. Y. 435; <em>Koenig </em>v. <em>Eagle Waist Co., </em>176 App. Div. 726; <em>Glascoe </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>44 Misc. Rep. 166; <em>Kienle </em>v. <em>Gretsch Realty Co., </em>133 App. Div. 391; <em>Wick </em>v. <em>Crane Co., </em>141 Misc. Rep. 31.) An injunction <em>pendente lite </em>ought not to have been granted since the right thereto was doubtful; the relief granted was not required to preserve the <em>status quo </em>or to prevent irreparable injury pending trial; the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, and the issuance of the injunction was the equivalent of the granting of final relief. <em>(Bruce </em>v. <em>President, etc., of D. &amp; H.

The case is here upon certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>We think the complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action for an injunction. No facts are pleaded tending to show an irreparable injury, actual or threatened; or that plaintiff is without an adequate remedy at law. On the contrary, the allegations disclose merely a dispute about a possessory right in specific chattels, which could be readily and adequately settled by an action in replevin or for a conversion. (Cf. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Sunderman, </em>263 N. Y. 623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">A court of equity, even where property interests are incidentally affected, will not ordinarily interfere with criminal processes, unless there would be irreparable injury and the sole question involved is one of law. <em>(Delaney </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>183 N. Y. 323.) Neither condition is present here. If the order appealed from were to stand, there would be nothing left to try. <em>(Yome </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>242 N. Y. 395, 401.) Instead of preserving the <em>status quo, </em>the order definitively destroys it.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the motion should be denied, with ten dollars costs of motion. Question No. 1 should be answered in the negative; question No. 2 in the affirmative; other questions unanswered as unnecessary to a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Pound, Ch. J., Crane, Lehman, O\u2019Brien, Hubbs and Loughran, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
