Class </em>for plaintiff, appellant and respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acn\">This being an action in equity for the specific performance of a contract providing for more than the mere payment of money, the trial court properly awarded judgment for the installments due after the date of the complaint, and properly directed payments in the future. <em>(McGean </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>150 App. Div. 208; <em>Kilbourne </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>137 N.

Specific performance is not the appropriate remedy for the collection of money. As these amounts come due, if they are not paid, the plaintiff has her action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We need not at this time determine the duty of the plaintiff to support her son under the terms of the agreement as it is not now in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The judgment should be modified in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Pound, Ch.
