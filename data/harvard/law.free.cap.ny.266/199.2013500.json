We think that this result is contrary to the terms and intent of the waiver which was executed by petitioner as an inducement to bis appointment to the rank of deputy chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The orders should be reversed, with costs in all courts, and the motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Crane, Ch.
