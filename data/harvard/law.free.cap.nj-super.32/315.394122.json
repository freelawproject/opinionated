J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"APn\">This was an action for negligence which was dismissed at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, on the ground that he had not made out a cause of action as against any of the three defendants. lie appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">The defendant, Eosemawr Homes, Inc., was engaged in developing certain of its property. It hired or rented from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the defendant, United Construction Co., Inc., a steam shovel to dig, among other things, a trench from a house to the street so as to enable Patsy Yellone, a plumbing contractor, to connect the house plumbing with the sewer line in the street. Plaintiff was Yellone\u2019s helper. The defendant, Erancis L. Bayley, United\u2019s employee, the \u201csteam shovel man on the project,\u201d dug the trench, in some measure at any event pursuant to Yellone\u2019s instructions, making it four feet wide and, for some of its distance, 12 feet deep. \"While plaintiff was at work in the trench, one side caved in, injuring him seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We think the dismissal should stand as against Rosemawr. The plaintiff, citing <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 413 and 416, seeks to hold Rosemawr upon the theory that the ditch was inherently dangerous to the plaintiff unless special precautions were taken in digging it, and that therefore Rosemawr, as the employer of the independent contractor, United, is liable for United\u2019s alleged failure to take such precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">This theory has not met with approval everywhere. <em>Silveus v. </em>Grossman, 307 <em>Pa. </em>272, 161 <em>A. </em>362 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932). Our cases use the term \u201cnuisance.\u201d <em>Terranella v. Union Bldg, and Construction Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>443, 446 (1950); <em>Sarno v. Gulf Refining Co., </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>340, 342 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924), affirmed 102 <em>N. J. L. </em>223 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1925); <em>Cuff v. Newark and New York R. R. Co., </em>35 <em>N. J. L. </em>17 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1870), affirmed 35 <em>N. J. L. </em>574 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">But we need not in this case look further into the matter; for, as stated in the <em>Restatement </em>at the places cited, the rule applies only to a situation \u201cnecessarily\u201d giving rise to an \u201cunreasonable\u201d or a \u201cpeculiar\u201d risk of bodily harm. See <em>Prosser, Torts </em>488 (1941); <em>Mechem, Outlines of Agency (11th ed. </em>1952), \u00a7 488; 57 <em>C. J. S., Master and Servant, </em>\u00a7 590, <em>p. </em>361; <em>Besner v. Central Trust Co., </em>230 <em>N. Y. </em>357, 130 <em>N. E. </em>577, 23 <em>A. L. R. </em>1084; <em>Smith v. Henger, </em>148 <em>Tex. </em>456, 226 <em>S. </em>W. <em>2d </em>425, 20 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>868; <em>Note, Responsibility for the Torts of an Independent Contractor, </em>39 <em>Yale L. J. </em>861 (1930). As to the phrase \u201cinherent danger,\u201d <em>cf. Lydecker v. Freeholders of Passaic, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>622, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>627 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1918); <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Asplundh Tree Expert Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>319, 329 <em>et seq. </em>(1953). It cannot be supposed from the proofs (even taking into account testimony that might have been given by Morris Mandl, as hereinafter stated) that the mere making of an excavation with a steam shovel would <em>necessarily </em>give rise to an unreasonable or peculiar risk to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"> Generally the person who engages an independent contractor is not to be charged with the negligence of the latter\u2019s employee. <em>Meny v. Carlson, </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>82 (1950). The case against Rosemawr is within the general rule and was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">As to the liability of the defendants, Bayley and United, the situation is different. First, United claims it was, as a matter of law, relieved of responsibility for Bayley\u2019s acts when it \u201crented or hired\u201d him and the shovel to Rosemawr. With this, we do not agree. United paid Bayley his wages. Besides it could reasonably be inferred that United expected him to look after its interests in operating the shovel and, failing that, could prohibit him from operating it. The question as to whether the relationship between United and Bayley was that of master and servant was for the jury. <em>Larocca v. American Chain and Cable Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>1, 6 (1953); <em>Younkers v. Ocean County, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>607 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943); <em>cf. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Coggins and Griffith </em>(Liverpool), <em>Ltd. </em>[1947] <em>A. C. </em>1 <em>(H. </em>L.).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Next, United, as an independent contractor, claims these injuries occurred after its work had been completed and accepted by the owner or employer, and therefore it and its employee are absolved from liability. <em>Miller v. Davis &amp; Averill, Inc., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>671 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948); but <em>cf. Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7 385; <em>Prosser, Torts, </em>694-697 (1941). See further <em>Hale v. Depaoli, </em>33 <em>Cal. 2d </em>228, 201 <em>P. 2d </em>1, 13 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>191, 239; and in support thereof, <em>Prosser, supra, </em>695. The theory of this rule is \u201c That, by occupying and resuming exclusive possession of the work, the owner deprives the contractor of all opportunity to rectify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>his wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. Davis and Averill, Inc., </em>137 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>675, <em>supra. </em>The only proof of Rosemawr\u2019s acceptance of the work and resumption of exclusive possession over the property is a statement by Yellone, its independent contractor, that after the work was finished he (not Rosemawr) told Bayley it was satisfactory. That proof does not sustain the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Finally we come to the question whether or not the trial court erred in refusing to allow plaintiff to take the testimony of Morris Mandl, an expert witness. There was no proof of negligence without his testimony. Indeed, there was no offer of proof as to what his testimony would be. However, in the pretrial order plaintiff charges United and Bayley with negligence by reason of their failure to use \u201cstandard methods\u201d in excavating the trench, in that the sides thereof were straight, not Y-shaped. The term \u201cstandard methods\u201d \u2014 at any event, reading it with the reference to experts in the answer to the interrogatory hereinafter mentioned \u2014 seems to us a sufficient indication that expert testimony was to be adduced on the point. <em>Cf. Beck v. Monmouth Lumber Co., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>268, 277 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Assuming, then, that there had been proof that Bayley deviated from standard methods so as to give rise to an unreasonable risk of causing harm, <em>Kelly v. Loft, Inc., </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>185 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940), we think plaintiff would have made out a case for the jury as against United and Bayley. United, through Bayley, undertook to operate a steam shovel here for hire, and it is for a jury to determine whether any such deviation constituted negligence. <em>Prosser, supra, </em>239; 2 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3rd ed. </em>1940), 489. It does not become a question of law for the court merely because of the testimony that Bayley was working under Yellone\u2019s directions with no discretion as to the \u201ckind of hole\u201d dug.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Mandl\u2019s testimony therefore was vital to plaintiff\u2019s case as against these two defendants. The court refused to allow it to be taken, <em>R. R. </em>4:23-12, because his name did not appear \u25a0 in answer to the following interrogatory of those defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cState the name of every person known to plaintiff to have knowledge of any of the facts on which the allegations of the plaintiff are based - *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">After stating several names, plaintiff\u2019s answer added at the end:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cand several experts who have not as yet been retained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Thereafter and before the trial plaintiff retained another attorney, and the latter argued strongly at the trial and argues now that under the law he was not required by that interrogatory to furnish the names of experts. See <em>Schnitzer &amp; Wildstein, N. J. Rules Serv. </em>A.IV \u2014 457. He claims that experts do not have \u201cknowledge of relevant facts.\u201d <em>R. R. </em>4:16-2. However, the question as to what constitutes a \u201cstandard method\u201d is surely a matter of fact, not inference. Wigmore has made this clear (7 <em>Wigmore, supra,, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1917, 1919):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cLord Mansfield in effect answered the objection that the expert had no personal knowledge, no facts, by pointing out that the subject was in truth one of fact, but of a class of facts about which expert persons alone could have knowledge * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">We need not decide here whether an interrogatory should he permitted which requires, not the names of those having knowledge of the relevant facts, hut the names of those among them who are to be called as witnesses. <em>Cf. Atlantic Northern Airlines, Inc. v. </em>Schwimmer, 12 <em>N. J. </em>293, 308 (1953) ; but see 4 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (2nd ed. </em>1950), \u00a7 26.19. In May 1954 the distinguished Advisory Committee on Federal Kules of Civil Procedure \u2014 in order to resolve a conflict in the federal eases \u2014 proposed an amendment to <em>Federal Rule </em>33 to permit an interrogatory requiring</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">\u201ca listing of the names of witnesses whom the party interrogated expects to call at the trial.\u201d See Committee\u2019s note to proposed amendments to <em>Federal Ft/ules </em>33 and 16 (4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Plaintiff argues that it is not proper to take an expert\u2019s deposition (upon which matter we do not pass), and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>fore his name should not he given an interrogating party. But this does not follow. Knowing the name of the expert, an adversary can investigate his qualifications and secure experts of equal standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We think the trial court\u2019s ruling, that the interrogatories here properly required plaintiff to disclose the names of experts such as Mandl, was sound and in keeping with the very salutary purposes of our discovery practice. However, the ruling being highly novel, we question whether the plaintiff should have had visited upon him the penalties provided in <em>R. R. </em>4:23-12. <em>Cf. Hogan v. Hodge, </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>55, 60 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949). <em>R. R. </em>4:23-12 must be fully enforced, but still there should have been some redress for the plaintiff here.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Plaintiff moved for a mistrial (perhaps it would have been more appropriate, <em>Sevlesruo Holding Corp. v. </em>American <em>etc., Co., </em>11 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>334 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1933), to have designated it a dismissal without prejudice) because of the court\u2019s refusal to allow him to put in the expert testimony; but this motion was not made until after defendants had moved for a dismissal and the court had said there was no proof of negligence. Still, the mere fact that the trial court had so spoken, is not in this case dispositive of the matter. <em>Cf. Magich v. John Hancock Mulual Life Ins. Co., </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. </em>33 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The granting of some redress here, through a relaxation of <em>R. R. </em>4:23-12 or, if justice warranted it, through a new trial or otherwise, was, we conclude, clearly called for by the circumstances, and requires us now to award a new trial. <em>Cf. Carlo v. Okonite-Callender Cable Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>253, 263 (1949). In the exercise of the discretion inherent in the power to relax the rules or to allow a mistrial or a voluntary dismissal \u2014 especially where plaintiff\u2019s entire cause thereby stands or falls \u2014 the trial court is called upon to meet the high responsibility, with which every court is charged, of rendering justice in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Affirmed as to Rosemawr. Reversed and new trial ordered as to United and Bayley.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
