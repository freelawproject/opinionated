In addition, plaintiff in her amended complaint seeks to receive from the Iowa Department of Social Welfare monetary damages equal to the amount of money plaintiff would have been entitled to receive but for the residency-domicile requirement. This action is brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 and plaintiff is a representative of a properly constituted class, F.R.C.P. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">1. Since May 1, 1966 plaintiff Mary L. Sheard has resided in the State of Iowa.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">2. Prior to May 1, 1967 she received Old-Age Assistance from the State of Mississippi which was terminated on said date.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">3. As of July 10, 1967 and at all times material thereafter she met all eligibility requirements for Old-Age Assistance under \u00a7 249.6 Code of Iowa 1966 except subsections (4) <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>(7) and (8) thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-20\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b629-21\">Does \u00a7 249.6(4) Code of Iowa 1966 violate the Constitution of the United States ?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-22\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b629-23\">Section 249.6(4) Code of Iowa 1966 violates the equal protection clause, \u00a7 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitutional right to travel from one state .to another. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (April 21, 1969.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">It is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b629-25\">Ordered, adjudged and decreed</p>\n<p id=\"b629-26\">1. Section 249.6(4) Code of Iowa 1966 denies to plaintiff Mary L. Sheard and others similarly situated the equal protection of .the laws and the right to travel from one state to another as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-27\">2. The defendant Iowa Department of Social Welfare, its officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and all persons in active concert or participation with them are permanently restrained from enforcing and executing \u00a7 249.6(4) of the Code of Iowa 1966 and from refusing to grant Old-Age Assistance to the plaintiff Mary L. Sheard and others similarly situated because of said provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>3. Jurisdiction of this cause is retained on condition that the Iowa Department of Social Welfare promptly process plaintiff Mary L. Sheard\u2019s pending application for Old-Age Assistance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-14\">. \u00a7 249.6 <em>To whom granted. </em>Old-age assistance may be granted and paid only to a person who :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-16\">SfC v S\u00a1S</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-17\">4.
