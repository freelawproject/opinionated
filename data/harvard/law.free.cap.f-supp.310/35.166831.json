Since the complaint alleges the unconstitutionality of a statute of state-wide application, this threejudge panel has been convened. 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281-2284.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-20\">Jurisdiction is based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Civil Rights Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. Presently before the Court are defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-21\">The individual plaintiffs are citizens and taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and their claims are brought in that capacity. Plaintiff Lemon, in addition to being a citizen and taxpayer, is a Negro parent of a child attending public school in Pennsylvania. The organizational plaintiffs are associations of persons resident in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which \u201cshare as a common objective the separation of Church and State and the opposition to the use of public funds for the support in whole or in part of sectarian schools, or other private schools whose policies and practices, by purpose or effect, exclude or otherwise discriminate against persons by reason of race or religion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, (NAACP) with which the plaintiff, Pennsylvania <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>State Conference of the NAACP, is affiliated, \u201cis an organization whose purpose is to seek the elimination of racial discrimination through resort to judicial proceedings and otherwise\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5Each of the organizational plaintiffs asserts its standing to sue as a party-plaintiff in the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The defendant Kurtzman is the Pennsylvania Superintendent of Public Instruction who is responsible for approving the allocation of funds under the Pennsylvania Education Act. Defendant Sloan is the State Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who will allocate the approved funds. The seven defendant schools are sectarian elementary and secondary educational institutions situated within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who have contracted with the Commonwealth for the purchase of secular educational services under the Education Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\n<em>The Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Education Act.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The Education Act was signed into law by the Governor of Pennsylvania on June 19, 1968. The Act empowers the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to contract for the purchase of \u201csecular educational services\u201d from nonpublic schools located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which fulfill the compulsory school attendance requirements under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">In its legislative findings and declaration of policy<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Pennsylvania Legislature has determined that a crisis exists in elementary and secondary education in Pennsylvania due to rapid increases in costs and school population and consequent demands for more teachers and facilities. It was also found that twenty per cent of all elementary and secondary school children in Pennsylvania fulfill the requirements of the Commonwealth\u2019s compulsory school attendance laws in nonpublic schools. It has been further recognized that elementary and secondary education constitutes a public welfare purpose and that nonpublic education, by providing instruction in secular subjects, contributes significantly to the achievement of this public purpose. The Legislature, therefore, concluded that it is a governmental duty to support the achievement of this public welfare purpose by supporting the purely secular objectives of nonpublic education.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">Briefly, the operational scheme of the statute permits the Superintendent of Public Instruction to enter into contracts<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with nonpublic schools, whether sectarian or nonsectarian, for the purchase of \u201csecular educational services\u201d. These \u201csecular educational services\u201d are defined <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to mean \u201cproviding of instruction in a secular subject\u201d, while secular subject is defined as \u201cany course which is presented in the curricula of the public schools of the Commonwealth and shall not include any subject matter expressing religious teaching, or the morals or forms of worship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of any sect\u201d. All purchases of secular educational services under the Education Act are to be at the \u201cactual cost\u201d of three items of such service: teacher salaries, textbooks and instructional materials. The Education Act further limits all purchases of secular educational services to courses in mathematics, modern foreign languages, physical science, and physical education<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>. As a condition for payment under the Act, the Superintendent of Public Instruction must approve all textbooks and instructional materials employed in the instruction rendered. In addition, a satisfactory level of student performance in standardized tests must have been attained and within five years of the date of the Act all secular educational services for which reimbursement is sought must be rendered by teachers holding State certification equal to the standard for teachers in public schools.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Payment under the Act in discharge of the contractual obligation may be made only after service has been rendered. Section 5607(a) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">Any nonpublic school seeking such reimbursement shall maintain such accounting procedures, including maintenance of separate funds and accounts pertaining to the cost of secular educational service, as to establish that it actually expended in support of such service an amount of money equal to the amount of money sought in reimbursement. Such accounts shall be subject to audit by the Auditor General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN\">Funds for the operation and administration of the Education Act are to be drawn only from the nonpublic elementary and secondary education fund. The monies comprising this fund are to be taken exclusively from the proceeds of State horse racing and harness racing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Defendants, in their brief, have informed the Court that 1181 nonpublic elementary and secondary schools in Pennsylvania, having a total pupil population of 535,215 children, and located in 55 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 67 counties, are now under contract with the Commonwealth pursuant to the Education Act. One year\u2019s performance under contract has now been rendered and, on September 2, 1969, the Commonwealth paid its first quarterly installment obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\n<em>Standing of the Individual and Organizational Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">The defendants have moved pursuant to Rule 12(b) to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the grounds that both the organizational and individual plaintiffs lack standing to maintain the instant suit under the religious clauses of the First Amendment and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\n<em>A. Organizational Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The organizational plaintiffs assert their standing solely on the ground that they are organizations established for the purposes of either maintaining the separation of Church and State or preventing racial discrimination. Nothing further is alleged with respect to the issues of the instant case than the fact that these organizations share a common interest in the outcome of this suit as it may or may not comport with their particular organizational goals. The fundamental aspect of standing, as recently articulated by the Supreme Court, is that \u201cit focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court * * Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 99, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1967). The Flast decision further noted that \u201cthe emphasis in standing problems is on whether the party invoking federal court jurisdiction has \u2018a <em>personal stake </em>in the outcome of the controversy\u2019 * * * and whether the dispute touches upon <em>\u2018the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.\u2019 </em>* \u2022\u00bb * <em>\u201d </em>Flast v. Cohen, <em>supra, </em>at 101, 88 S.Ct. at 1953. (Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">On the basis of the allegations set forth in the complaint as they pertain to the organizational plaintiffs, we can perceive no <em>personal stake </em>or <em>adverse legal interests </em>of these plaintiffs which demonstrate their standing as <em>parties </em>to the instant suit. Regardless of the good motives of these organizations, the mere fact that the instant case may result in a decision which may be in accord with or adverse to the respective general purposes of these organizations we believe is insufficient to establish standing to sue as an affected party in interest<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>. Consequently the organizational plaintiffs have failed to establish standing as to both the religious and equal protection issues involved in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">\n<em>B. Individual Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">The individual plaintiffs, Alton Lemon, Priscilla Reardon and Betty J. Worrell, assert standing under the religious clauses of the First Amendment and the equal protection clause based upon varied allegations of status as to each issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Initially, it is alleged that all individual plaintiffs are taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Plaintiff Lemon alleges he has paid an admission fee to a Pennsylvania race track. Such fees provide the sole financing of the Education Act. The other individual plaintiffs have not alleged payment of such admission fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\"> As to plaintiff Lemon\u2019s standing as a taxpayer under the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment, again we note that the focus is on the party asserting his claim. In this respect, however, \u201c[i]t is both appropriate and necessary to look to the substantive issues * * * to determine whether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated.\u201d Flast v. Cohen, supra, at 102, 88 S.Ct., at 1953. Although the <em>Flast </em>decision concerned itself with the status of a federal taxpayer to challenge a federal spending program under the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment, we consider that its requirements as to standing apply as well to state taxpayers. <em>Flast </em>dictates two requirements for taxpayers standing, namely that: \u201cFirst, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked\u201d 392 U.S. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1954 and \u201cSecondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged\u201d. 392 U.S. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1954. In <em>Flast, </em>both elements were satisfied since it was alleged that the taxing and spending powers of the federal government were being used in excess of the specific constitutional limitations imposed upon their exercise by the First Amendment. See 392 U.S. at 103, 88 S.Ct. 1942. Since the First Amendment applies to State governmental powers, Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940), the exercise of State taxing and spending is equally limited. These are precisely the allegations made by plaintiff Lemon in the instant case. We, therefore, hold that he has by these allegations demonstrated standing to challenge the Education Act under the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The other individual plaintiffs assert generally that they are taxpayers in Pennsylvania. However, they have not alleged the payment of any tax which would bring them within the class of affected taxpayers. Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952); Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 108, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292 (1943). Rather, these plaintiffs allege that they have not paid an admission fee to a Pennsylvania race track because to do so would require them to pay tax for the support of religion in violation of their rights of conscience. The personal right to freedom of conscience is protected by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment and the State may not condition other rights or privileges upon the sacrifice of this freedom. See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961). Although the privilege to attend a race track here asserted and its connection to free exercise is less apparent than in either of the above cited cases, we will recognize it for the purpose of establishing the standing of these plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The remaining question is whether any of the individual plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Education Act on equal protection grounds. It is alleged generally in the complaint that the private schools which have contracted or will contract with the Commonwealth under the Education Act intentionally discriminate in the selection of students and/or teachers or are de facto segregated by race or religion. It is further alleged that the funds allocated by the Commonwealth to these schools under the Act will be used to perpetuate and support these practices and as such there is State action involved. We will assume for the purpose of deciding this aspect of the standing issue that these alleged facts could be proved at a hearing on the merits. Nevertheless, these plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Education Act under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Education Act on its face does not use religion or race as a standard or guideline to determine who may enter into a contract with the Commonwealth. As such the Act itself does not purport to make any classifications to deny equal treatment to members of any particular race or religion. As we previously noted, the requirement of standing focuses on the party affected and his personal stake in the outcome of the litigation at issue. Plaintiff Lemon asserts his status as a Negro and parent of a child in a public school in Pennsylvania. However, there is no allegation in the complaint which asserts that Lemon or his child is personally affected by any alleged intentional discrimination or de facto segregation in these schools. There is no allegation that Lemon\u2019s child attempted to enroll at any of these schools and was denied admission because of race or religion. None of the other plaintiffs\u2019 allegations point to any interest, parental or otherwise, which has been or may be affected by the alleged discriminatory practices. The absence of an allegation that the personal rights of these parties are affected has the net effect of seeking to raise hypothetical grievances of oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ers who <em>may be </em>personally injured by such discrimination. Standing requires at least that the plaintiff himself be personally affected. <em>Flast, </em>supra, 392 U.S. at 110, 88 S.Ct. 1942. See also United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947). Race is indeed a relevant consideration to equal protection issues. However, our research does not disclose any case in which a person was permitted to challenge discriminatory practices, policies or laws where he himself was not the object of such practice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consequently, as none of the individual plaintiffs have alleged a personal stake in the instant case, they have failed to establish standing under the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\n<em>Establishment and Free Exercise</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> We consider now the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In this posture of the case we accept as true all well-pleaded allegations of fact in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The plaintiffs allege as a fact that the purpose and primary effect of the Education Act is to aid religion. For the purpose of considering the motion to dismiss it is argued that the allegation of the purpose and primary effect of the Education Act in the complaint must be deemed admitted. While it is true that well-pleaded facts in the complaint are deemed admitted for the purpose of testing its sufficiency, such an admission does not include legal conclusions drawn from these facts. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Schauffler, 303 U.S. 54, 57, 58 S.Ct. 466, 82 L.Ed. 646 (1937); Pauling v. McElroy, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 372, 278 F.2d 252, 253-254 (1960). We believe that the allegation asserts not a fact but a conclusion of law and as such is not admitted for purposes of testing the sufficiency of the complaint. The question of law then presented is whether the purpose or primary effect of the Pennsylvania Education Act on its face or in the necessary effect of its administration is to advance or inhibit religion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof * * This limitation originally placing a restriction only on federal governmental involvement in religion has since been judicially incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and now represents a bar on State as well as Federal action. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). The meaning and scope of the First Amendment have been elaborated several times by the decisons of the United States Supreme Court in areas involving education. Most apposite to the instant case are the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947) and Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968). In <em>Everson, </em>the Supreme Court held that a New Jersey statute which authorized State reimbursement to parents for bus fares of children attending both public and parochial schools did not violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The Court noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>establishment clause prohibits the states from setting up a church or supporting the religious activities of sectarian institutions. 330 U.S. at 16, 67 S.Ct. 504. However, the Court further observed that a State may not hamper citizens from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation by excluding religions from its benefits. <em>Id. </em>The First Amendment \u201crequires the state to be a neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and non-believers * * 330 U.S. at 18, 67 S.Ct. at 513. As bus-sing was generally in the same category as other government services provided to parochial schools such as ordinary police and fire protection, sewage disposal, public highways and sidewalks, this measure of aid, as it benefited school children, could be constitutionally extended without breaching the standard of government neutrality toward religion embodied in the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Most recently, in Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968) the Court sustained, over First Amendment objections, legislation in New York which required the State to lend textbooks free of charge to all children in private sectarian and nonseetarian schools. The Court recognized that <em>\u201cEverson </em>and later cases have shown that the line between state neutrality to religion and state support of religion is not easy to locate. \u2018The constitutional standard is the separation of Church and State. The problem, like many problems in constitutional law, is one of degree\u2019. Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314 [72 S.Ct. 679, 684, 96 L.Ed. 954] (1952). See McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 [81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393] (1961)\u201d. Id. The Court re-examined its prior decisions and articulated a pragmatic standard, first espoused in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963), by which to test legislation designed to achieve a public objective through religiously affiliated educational institutions. To distinguish between forbidden involvement of the State with religion and those contacts which the Establishment Clause permits the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">The test may be stated as follows: what are the purpose and primary effect of the enactment? If either is the advancement or inhibition of religion then the enactment exceeds the scope of legislative power as circumscribed by the Constitution. That is to say that to withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause there must be a secular legislative purpose and a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion. 374 U.S. at 222, 83 S.Ct. at 1571.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Although the results of the <em>Everson </em>and <em>Allen </em>decisions were to provide some measure of indirect aid to parochial schools in that transportation to receive religious instruction was facilitated and that the parochial schools\u2019 funds were no longer required to purchase certain books, such results did not constitute a breach of State neutrality towards religion. In applying the purpose and primary effect test to the New York statute in <em>Allen, </em>the Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he express purpose of \u00a7 701 was stated by the New York Legislature to be furtherance of the educational opportunities available to the young. * * The law merely makes available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend school books free of charge.\u201d 392 U.S. at 243, 88 S.Ct. at 1926. Although a distinction between bussing and books was recognized, since the latter may be used as a vehicle of religious teaching, the Court noted that the language of the New York statute neither authorized nor permitted loans or distributions of religious literature. Properly, the Court was not-willing to assume that New York\u2019s administrators would violate the terms of the statute; accordingly, it was held that the principal of neutrality was satisfied and the primary effect of the statute was not to advance religion. See 392 U.S. at 244, 245, 88 S.Ct. 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">It is here argued that Pennsylvania\u2019s Education Act has as its pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>pose and primary effect the advancement of religion. We believe that the purpose of the Education Act can be found clearly on its face. The Legislature has declared that the purpose of the Education Act is \u201cto promote the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u201d and \u201cto promote the secular education of children of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania attending nonpublic schools\u201d. Support for this declaration of purpose is found in specific legislative findings which point to the percentage of school-age children educated in Pennsylvania\u2019s private institutions, the rising cost of education, increased school population and demands for more qualified teachers and adequate facilities. Furthermore, the Legislature also recognized the potential financial burden on the public treasury and long-range impairment of education which may result if private institutions no longer bear their present educational burdens. The plaintiffs argue that because the vast majority of schools which will contract for the purchase of secular educational services under the Education Act are sectarian schools, the purpose or operative effect of the instant statute must be to support religion. We cannot accept the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. \u201cThe fact that a state law, passed to satisfy a public need, coincides with the personal desires of the individuals most directly affected is certainly an inadequate reason * <em>* </em>* to say that a legislature has erroneously appraised the public need.\u201d Everson v. Board of Education, 380 U.S. at 6, 67 S.Ct. at 507. The purpose of the statute on its face indicates that \u201c[the State\u2019s] interest is education, broadly; its method, comprehensive. Individual interests are aided only as the common interest is safeguarded\u201d. 392 U.S. at 247, 88 S.Ct. at 1928. The plaintiffs urge that we reexamine the legislative history of the statute and contend that such an examination will disclose that the true intent of the Pennsylvania legislators was to aid religion. We do not, however, feel that it is necessary or appropriate in the instant case to re-examine the legislative history of the Education Act in search of the \u201ctrue intent\u201d of Pennsylvania\u2019s legislators. The legislative findings of the State are not to be lightly set aside. In this connection, Mr. Justice Frankfurter has observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">[T]he private and unformulated influences which may work upon legislation are not open to judicial probing. \u201cThe decisions of this court from the beginning lend no support whatever to the assumption that the judiciary may restrain the exercise of lawful power on the assumption that a wrongful purpose or motive has caused the power to be exerted.\u201d McCray v. United States, 195 U.S. 27, 56 [24 S.Ct. 769, 776, 49 L.Ed. 78]. \u201cInquiry into the hidden motives which may move [a legislature] to exercise a power constitutionally conferred upon it is beyond the competency of courts.\u201d (Citations omitted) McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. at 469, 81 S.Ct. at 1158.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The education of our nation\u2019s children quite properly has been recognized by the Supreme Court as a proper subject of legislation enacted in furtherance of a public interest. Cochran v. Louisiana State Board of Education, 281 U.S. 370, 50 S.Ct. 335, 74 L.Ed. 913 (1930). It is neither necessary nor constitutionally permissible to require that educational pursuits be followed only in public institutions of learning; rather, educational goals may effectively be satisfied through private education. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925). As a sensible corollary to the <em>Pierce </em>decision and considering the State\u2019s interest in satisfying its compulsory education laws through private educational institutions, the <em>Allen </em>Court observed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">[I]f the State must satisfy its interest in secular education through the instrument of private schools, it has a proper interest in the manner in which those schools perform their secular educational function. 392 U.S. at 247, 88 S.Ct. at 1928.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>We recognize that \u201cprivate education * * * is playing a significant and valuable role in raising national levels of knowledge, competence, and experience,\u201d 392 U.S. at 247, 88 S.Ct. at 1928, and that the public\u2019s reliance on private education suggests that adequate <em>secular </em>education is being provided in these schools. We further recognize, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Allen, </em>that the \u201cState\u2019s interest in education would be served sufficiently by reliance <em>on the secular teachings that acconvpan[y] religious training\u201d </em>in nonpublic schools. 392 U.S. at 245, 88 S.Ct. at 1927. Furthermore, we consider that \u201creligious schools pursue two goals, religious instruction and secular education\u201d, 392 U.S. at 245, 88 S.Ct. at 1927, and we believe that the State may aid the secular function rather than the sectarian function of private educational institutions in the public interest of education within proper confines and without participating in a forbidden involvement in religion proscribed by the First Amendment. The Education Act on its face authorizes the Commonwealth to contract only for services connected with the <em>strictly secular </em>function of educating Pennsylvania\u2019s school children in the secular subjects of mathematics<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>, physical sciences<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>, modern foreign language<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>, and physical education<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>. That the Commonwealth must not be involved in the religious functions of sectarian educational institutions is clearly established by the nature and kind of strictly secular subjects selected in the statute itself and the controls and restrictions placed upon the statute\u2019s operation by the regulations promulgated thereunder. Thus limited and restricted we cannot hold that the statute advances religion either in purpose or primary effect. Moreover, the statute applies to <em>all </em>nonpublic schools both sectarian and nonsectarian. As it may apply to sectarian institutions, we concur with the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Allen, </em>supra, that <em>\u2018\u2018we cannot agree </em>* * * <em>either that all teaching in a sectarian school is </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>ligious or that the processes of secular and religious training are so intertwined </em>that secular textbooks furnished to students by the public are in fact instrumental in the teaching of religion.\u201d (Emphasis added) 392 U.S. at 248, 88 S.Ct. at 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Administered within its narrow confines neither the primary nor the necessary operative effect of the statute advances religion. It is quite unlike the situation .where State tax-supported public school buildings, facilities and teachers are used as a forum and means for the dissemination of religious doctrines at times and on occasions when pupils are subject to the State\u2019s compulsory attendance laws. People of State of Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 68 S.Ct. 461, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948); Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962). On the contrary, the statute is limited not only to secular subjects but to a limited number of <em>specific </em>secular subjects peculiarly unconnected with and unrelated to the teaching of religious doctrines. The statute is further limited and confined to the purchase of services at cost. Unlike <em>Schempp </em>and <em>Engel </em>the statute here maintains a position of complete <em>religious </em>neutrality. In Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 72 S.Ct. 679, 96 L.Ed. 954, the Court approved the State\u2019s encouragement of \u201creligious instruction\u201d and its cooperation \u201cwith religious authorities\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark>. Here the Education Act does not go so far as to encourage the teaching of religious matter. We recognize that the separation of Church and State embodied in the non-establishment principle is not a self-defining concept. The increasing national concern for education in our society, coupled with the public awareness that private schools are performing a significant public service in educating great numbers of school-age children, necessarily makes the State interested in private education. Of necessity therefore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">As the State\u2019s interest in the individual becomes more comprehensive, its concerns and the concerns of religion perforce overlap. State codes and the dictates of faith touch the same activities. Both aim at human good, and in their respective views of what is good for man they may concur or they may conflict. No constitutional command which leaves religion free can avoid this quality of interplay. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 461-462, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1153, 1154, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1966). (Separate opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">That such a common interest in education exists is desirable if not essential to the continued existence of a free society so long as the State\u2019s function is, as here, carefully defined, limited and confined to secular as opposed to sectarian matters. We do not view the First Amendment as requiring an absolute separation between necessarily overlapping interests in the secular education of school-age children. To require such a standard would assume that the State and religion exist in mutually exclusive and sharply defined spheres having no common natural interest in the education of our youth. Such a view would not comport with the extension of even police or fire protection or other governmental services in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Nor do we find persuasive the argument that the child must be the direct beneficiary of government funds which support secular education. Such an approach would place form over substance in that a constitutional result would depend upon minute distinctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and technicalities. The child and society generally certainly benefit from the improvement of the secular education the child receives regardless of whether there is a direct payment or loan to him or to his parents or to his school or teachers. In our view the constitutional result should not and cannot wholly depend upon the identity of the payee. The use to which the funds are put must be the primary concern.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The mandate of the First Amendment is neutrality with respect to religious teachings, beliefs and practices. The Education Act does not employ religion as its standard. The prerequisites to receiving government funds for the purchase of secular educational services, we believe, are designed to maintain the neutrality required by the First Amendment. While it may be argued that the consequential result of the instant statute m\u00e1y be to indirectly benefit nonpublic sectarian schools, the purpose and primary effect of the Education Act is secular in nature and such an incidental benefit is not sufficient to infringe upon the non-establishment principle of the First Amendment. As was noted by Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in Board of Education v. Allen, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">[W]here the contested governmental activity is calculated to achieve nonreligious purposes otherwise within the competence of the State, and where the activity does not involve the State \u2018so significantly and directly in the realm of the sectarian as to give rise to * * *, divisive influences and inhibitions of freedom\u2019 * * * it is not forbidden by the religious clauses of the First Amendment. 392 U.S. at 249, 88 S.Ct. at 1929.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Admittedly, the line is not an easy one to draw. However, we believe the Education Act is consistent with neutrality towards religion and comes within the permissible limits and spirit of the non-establishment principle. Consequently, we will dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under the establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Plaintiffs also allege in their complaint that the Education Act on its face and in its necessary operative effect denies them the free exercise of religion. With respect to each of the plaintiffs, it is alleged that \u201c [i]t is against the religious conscience of each of the plaintiffs to be forced by operation of the taxing power into contributing to the propagation of religion or for the support of sectarian schools\u201d. It is also alleged that the Act \u201cconstitutes compulsory taxation for the support of religion or religious educational institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">With respect to the latter allegation, as we have decided that the Education Act in purpose and primary effect does not advance or support religion, such taxation, assuming arguendo that it is compulsory, is not for the support of religion. Consequently, this allegation must fall. With respect to the former allegation, it is the purpose of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment \u201cto secure religious liberty in the individual by prohibiting any invasions thereof by civil authority\u201d. School District of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S, 203, 223, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1572, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963). There is no allegation in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as to what their particular religious beliefs are nor how the Education Act, by authorizing the purchase of secular educational services, coerces them in the practice of their religion. In dismissing the free-exercise allegation in Board of Education v. Allen, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">Appellants also contend that \u00a7 701 offends the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. However, \u2018it \u25a0 is necessary in a free exercise case for one to show the coercive effect of the enactment as it operates against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>him in the practice of his religion,\u2019 Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 233 [83 S.Ct. 1560, 1572, 10 L.Ed.2d 844] * * * and appellants have not contended that the New York law in any way coerces them as individuals in the practice of their religion. 392 U.S. at 248, 88 S.Ct. at 1929.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Since these essential allegations are also lacking in this case plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment and, therefore, their complaint will be dismissed. In view of our disposition of defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, we need not consider the remaining motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">And now, this 28th day of November, 1969, it is ordered that:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">1.

Reimbursement to a school is authorized only for the cost of teachers\u2019 salaries, textbooks and instructional materials after and to the extent that such costs have actually been incurred by the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-20\">The complaint alleges that the great majority of the schools eligible for subsidies under the Act are affiliated with or under the control or direction of churches or are in other respects sectarian schools or schools which teach religion and that the primary purpose as well as the principal effect of the Act is thus to aid religious institutions. For purposes of the present motion the majority opinion properly accepts as factually correct the complaint's allegations as to the religious and sectarian character of most of the schools intended to receive and actually receiving state grants-in-aid under the Act. However, that opinion characterizes as an allegation of law, and therefore refuses to accept as correct, the allegation that the primary purpose and principal effect of the Act is thus to aid institutions of religion. Instead, the majority seems to view the question of the purpose and effect of the statute as foreclosed by declarations in the statute itself that the legislative purpose is \u201cto promote the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth\u201d and \u201cto promote the secular education of children of the Commonwealth of Penn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>sylvania attending nonpublic schools\u201d. With this I cannot agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But even if inquiry as to purpose and effect should be confined to examination of the language and scheme of the statute, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the primary purpose and effect of the enactment is to help the nonpublic schools by supplying them with needed financial aid, while whatever promotion of the public welfare is anticipated as a result of such public assistance is at best an incidental consequence claimed in justification of the state\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">It merits mention at this point that both the statutory text and the majority opinion make much of the concept that the state \u201ccontracts to purchase secular educational services\u201d. Actually, this phrase is not descriptive of the statutory scheme. A nonpublic school that desires financial aid under the Act need do no more than submit, on a form prescribed by the state, an application designating the portions of its curriculum for which it wants assistance. The State Superintendent of Education then agrees that the state will do what the statute requires, namely, pay the school such sums as Act No. 109 entitles it to receive. This is the so-called \u201ccontract\u201d. The school need not undertake to enlarge its curriculum or to increase its enrollment. Indeed, it can decrease its enrollment and diminish its curriculum and still qualify for state subsidy. It merely goes through a prescribed procedure in asking for aid and later proving that it has made expenditures that are reimbursable under the Act, without ever obligating itself to do anything for or in the interest of the state. The state buys no services and the school sells none. The artificial characterization of this procedure as \u201ccontracting for secular educational services\u201d does not help solve our constitutional problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Certainly the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not preelude the state from providing any assistance, no matter how indirect, to religious institutions. As the majority opinion correctly indicates, religion\u2019s interest and the state\u2019s interest in the public good necessarily overlap. In contemporary experience churches and other religious institutions characteristically, and to their great credit, conceive their mission and undertake their ministry through various social means additional to the fundament of worship. The providing of shelter and care for the needy and aged, education for youth, and other social services for the community are all deemed an important part of organized church work. Yet, in the modern welfare state, similar activities have long since won recognition as important governmental functions and responsibilities, from the performance and discharge of which religious institutions with like undertakings may derive incidental benefits. Thus, where the state has supplied all school children with transportation arid books, sectarian educational enterprises are indirectly aided by being relieved of a financial burden which they might otherwise feel obligated to bear. In Everson v. Board of Education, 1947, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711, and Board of Education v. Allen, 1968, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060, the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution does not preclude a state from thus providing public services directly to its people merely because such services incidently aid religious institutions. However, these cases do not suggest that the Constitution permits direct public financing of a religious enterprise merely because such aid also benefits the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">It is unrealistic to view the present statute as merely subsidizing secular instruction and thus only incidentally benefiting religious institutions by releasing their funds for religious purposes. The primary purpose for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>sectarian schools formulate and offer a comprehensive curriculum apart from the public school system is religious. Through a total educational program offered in a separate religious environment, sectarian schools serve to inculcate and reinforce in children doctrine and moral precepts derived from the tenets of the church. It is not necessary to inquire whether, for the fulfillment of this primary religious purpose every course is taught with religious overtones. The crucial consideration is that the total teaching program is offered in a separate religious environment and for the better achievement of appropriate religious objectives. When the state reimburses a sectarian school for any part of the curricular costs of such a teaching program it directly finances and supports a religious enterprise. Constitutionally, such subsidizing of a religious enterprise is not essentially different from a payment of public funds into the treasury of a church. Such a prohibited involvement of the state in a religious undertaking is not validated merely because the religious enterprise itself incidentally relieves the state of the cost of educating many children.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Even more important than the foregoing analytical distinction are the constitutionally significant consequential distinctions betwen the present statute and those considered in the <em>Everson </em>and <em>AUen </em>cases. The statute in this case, much more than those in <em>Everson </em>and <em>Allen, </em>invites religious groups and organizations to act politically and involves the state intrusively in the affairs of religious institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">It has already been pointed out that sectarian schools are only part of the complex of activities, many of them as \u201csecular\u201d as the teaching of languages and physical science, which modern churches and religious institutions finance and conduct. Charities, hospitals, community centers and homes for the aged and infirm are familiar examples. The theory that would validate Act No. 109 also unavoidably validates state subsidies for all such enterprises of religious organizations, as well as subsidies for all of the \u201csecular\u201d parts of sectarian education not included in the present statute. If the constitutional bar to state grants in all such cases should be removed, it is reasonable to anticipate continuing political controversy in every state and local community whether and to what extent public funds are to be granted to subsidize a large number and a broad range of activities of religious organizations. Leaders and devout members of various organized religious groups will see it as their duty to their church or sect to seek such aid and to insist that state and local government contribute liberally to their sectarian enterprises. Legislators, government executives and candidates for elective office in whose judgment other claims upon the public purse merit higher priority can anticipate political opposition as enemies of the faith. In this way religion and politics will become <em>in pari materia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">So far we have escaped much of the divisiveness and antagonism of political differences and controversies about religious matters because public financing of activities of religious organizations has been understood to be prohibited by our Constitution. Professor Paul Freund has perceptively pointed out that President Kennedy was able to avoid taking a political position upon issues of religious character by relying upon authoritative decisions on the constitutional separation of state and religion as controlling. Freund, Public Aid to Parochial Schools, 1969, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1680, 1692. But if the present statute is held to be constitutional, I see no escape from the evils that attend a widespread and pervasive intermingling of politics and religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The other side of the coin is the inevitability of state intrusion into the affairs of organized religion in the administration of the present statute. As already stated, it is the justifying imperative of most, if not all, church-sponsored and controlled education that formal education shall serve to inculcate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>and reinforce in youthful minds sectarian doctrine and moral precepts derived from the tenets of the church.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In schools with such a mission it is appropriate, practically unavoidable, that admission policies and practices reflect a preference for enrollment of children of the sponsoring faith, though not necessarily excluding all others. Yet, once the state joins in financing such education, the mandated equalitarian position of the state must result in state imposition of strictly non-discriminatory admission standards consistent with public duty,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whatever sacrifice of appropriate religious objectives may result. I cannot square such state intrusion into religious affairs with the concept of separation of church and state which the First Amendment implements.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The same is true in the matter of curriculum. If the state is to finance \u201csecular\u201d teaching in parochial and other church-related schools, the state must have the power and responsibility of monitoring curriculum and instruction to assure that teaching in these state-supported areas is not so oriented as to inculcate sectarian or religious tenets or doctrines. Indeed, Act No. 109 expressly provides for state approval of text books and teaching materials in all subsidized schools. The substantiality of this involvement is indicated by Mr. Justice Douglas in the course of his dissent in Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 258-262, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060, where he elaborates numbers of instructive examples of sectarian orientation in teaching materials appropriately used in the teaching of \u201csecular\u201d subjects in church-related schools. The extent to which religious orientation of secular subjects will become an appropriate subject of state inquiry is also suggested by interrogatories which the plaintiffs in this suit have addressed to the defendant schools. For example, the church-related schools have been asked to disclose the extent to which sectarian precepts are involved in the teaching of secular subjects; whether teachers of such subjects are clerics, and what religious materials and symbols are used or displayed in the schools in connection with activities other, than religious ceremonies. It is difficult to imagine a type of intrusion by the state more offensive to a religious community than such pervasive monitoring and investigation of instruction and academic organization in order to purge the secular areas of the curriculum of religious orientation. Yet, it is to just such intrusion that the Pennsylvania statute opens the door, if by necessary implication it does not go farther and mandate the entry of state overseers as the only means by which the state can adequately check upon the initial and continuing eligibility of particular \u201csecular\u201d instruction for state financing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Mr. Justice Goldberg, in School District of Abington Township v. Schempp, 1963, 374 U.S. 203, 307, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1616, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 and Mr. Jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tice Harlan, in Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 249, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060, have both expressed what I believe to be a sound rationalization that the First Amendment is violated by state action which will \u201cinvolve the state so significantly and directly in the realm of the sectarian as to give rise to those very divisive influences and inhibitions of freedom which both religion clauses of the First Amendment preclude.\u201d I am unable to avoid the conclusion that the state undertaking authorized by Act No. 109 would thus intolerably involve the state in the realm of the sectarian.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">It must also be considered that some of the schools eligible for aid under Act No. 109 appear to be nonsectarian private schools which do not include religious training in their educational programs. Obviously, the First Amendment does not debar state aid to such schools. However, the plaintiffs allege and seek to prove statistically that only a very small minority of the eligible schools are of this character and that this fact and the legislative history of the statute combine to show that the primary purpose and effect of the legislation is to aid sectarian schools. I think the plaintiffs should be permitted to show, if they can, that the inclusion of nonseetarian private schools as institutions eligible for state aid is so minor and incidental an aspect of the statutory scheme that it cannot validate the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">It remains to consider the claim that subsidizing the defendant nonpublic schools as authorized by the statute would deny the plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws. I agree with the majority that the organizational plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the legislative scheme under either the First Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause. I also agree that no individual plaintiff alleges that any discrimination practiced by any of the defendant schools affects him or his children in a way that would give him standing to litigate the equal protection issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Finally, while I agree with the majority that plaintiff Lemon does and the other individual plaintiffs do not have standing to litigate the alleged violation of the Establishment Clause on the basis of the requirements enunciated by the Supreme Court in Flast v. Cohen, 1967, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947, .my reasoning is somewhat different and leads to the conclusion that, except for Lemon, the individual plaintiffs lack standing under the Free Exercise Clause even more clearly than under the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In Flast v. Cohen, federal income taxpayers alleged that the expenditure of federal funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to finance instruction in sectarian schools and to purchase educational materials for use in such schools violated the religion clauses of the First Amendment. The taxpayers\u2019 bill for a declaratory judgment and an injunction was dismissed by a three-judge district court for lack of standing. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the plaintiffs had satisfied the requirements of a logical connection between their status as taxpayers and both \u201cthe type of legislative enactment attacked\u201d and \u201cthe precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged\u201d. 392 U.S. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1954. The Supreme Court relied principally on its finding that the Establishment Clause was designed to limit the taxing and spending powers of Congress and sp\u00e9cifically declined to decide whether the taxpayers\u2019 free exercise claim alone would confer standing. 392 U.S. at 104 n. 25, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">In this case, the ultimate source of funds for the challenged payments under Act No. 109, and the only source, is the admission tax on harness races, 15 P.S. \u00a7 2606 (1967), and on thoroughbi\u2019ed races, 15 P.S. \u00a7 2656 (Supp. 1969). Plaintiff Lemon alleges that he has paid an admission fee to a harness race, including the tax. All three individual plaintiffs allege that \u201c[i]t is against [their] religious conscience to be forced by operation of the taxing power into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>contributing to the propagation of religion or for the support of sectarian schools\u201d. The majority opinion apparently construes the latter allegation to mean that, except for Lemon, the individual plaintiffs have refrained from attending the races because to do so would require them to support parochial education. However, the complaint contains no factual allegation that these plaintiffs desire to go to the races and have been deterred by reason of the known application of the racing revenues to the purposes of Act No. 109, and none of the individual plaintiffs has alleged any particular religious belief or any effect of Act No. 109 on the practice of a particular religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The individual plaintiffs other than Lemon can only be considered \u201ctaxpayers\u201d within the scope of the standing requirements of Flast v. Cohen, if their \u201ctax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections * * 392 U.S. at 106, 88 S.Ct. at 1955. The plaintiffs who have not attended horse races have not alleged that their \u201ctax money is being extracted\u201d by Act No. 109 unless by virtue of a theoretical increase in general tax requirements that might result from the failure to allocate racing revenues to general expenses. However, Flast v. Cohen pointed out that where a challenged tax operates \u201cupon a particular class of taxpayers * * * the proper party emphasis in the federal standing doctrine would require that standing be limited to the taxpayers within the affected class.\u201d 392 U.S. at 104 n. 25, 88 S.Ct. at 1955. Although the Supreme Court was referring to taxpayer standing under the Free Exercise Clause in the quoted dictum, the required nexus between taxpayer status and \u201cthe type of legislative enactment attacked\u201d, 392 U.S. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1954, also depends on actual or threatened liability for a tax in a challenge under the Establishment Clause. In order to have \u201cthe requisite personal stake in the outcome\u201d, 392 U.S. at 101, 88 S.Ct. at 1953, the plaintiffs should have an established monetary interest in the relief sought, rather than an interest that will be realized only if judicial action enjoining expenditures supported by a particular tax program to which plaintiffs are not subject shall result in a decrease in general tax burdens. Therefore, the individual plaintiffs other than Lemon do not have taxpayer standing to challenge Act No. 109 under either of the religious clauses because they do not contribute revenues disbursed under the Act, and are not \u201ctaxpayers within the affected class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">On the other hand, such a taxpayer as plaintiff Lemon, who is subject to the tax program that supports the particular statutory scheme sought to be enjoined, \u201cmay or may not have the requisite personal stake in the outcome * * 392 U.S. at 101, 88 S.Ct. at 1953. Focusing upon the nexus between Lemon\u2019s status as a taxpayer and \u201cthe precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged\u201d, 392 U.S. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1954, Lemon does complain that he has been required to contribute in support of an establishment. Although Lemon was not compelled to attend a harness race, he has been constrained by the state government to pay a tax on his attendance, a tax that is specifically earmarked by statute for purposes that allegedly support an establishment of religion. In view of the primary function of the Establishment Clause in restraining taxation and disbursement in support of religion, the tax Lemon has paid possesses a sufficient connection to the challenged expenditures under Act No. 109 and to the alleged constitutional infirmity of the Act to lend the requisite specificity and adverseness to his claim. Accordingly, I conclude that plaintiff Lemon has standing to attack the validity of the legislation under the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">As to all plaintiffs I would dismiss so much of the claim as alleges a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because of lack of standing to sue. However, in my view, the allegations of the complaint disclose a legislative scheme violative of the Establishment Clause of the First</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Amendment, as to which plaintiff Lemon Lemon\u2019s First Amendment claim, the alone shows standing to complain. As to motion to dismiss should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00a7 5601.
