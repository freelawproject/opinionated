PRESKA, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">Before the Court is a joint motion to dismiss a class-action complaint alleging federal and state antitrust violations by major record labels in the distribution of music over the Internet. Defendants include Bertelsmann, Inc.; Sony BMG Music Entertainment; Sony Corporation of America; Capitol Records, Inc. d/b/a EMI Music North America; EMI Group North America, Inc.; Capitol-EMI Music, Inc.; Virgin Records America, Inc.; Time Warner Inc.; UMG Recordings, Inc.; and Warner Music Group Corp.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Several individual plaintiffs seek to represent a putative nationwide class of digital music purchasers. The operative complaint before the Court is the Third Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cTCAC\u201d), filed June 2, 2010. The Court\u2019s previous judgment dismissing the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint was vacated, and the case returned on remand from the Court of Appeals. <em>Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm\u2019t, </em>592 F.3d 314, 327 (2d Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 901, 178 L.Ed.2d 803 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-24\">1. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-25\">Because the allegations in the TCAC are, with certain exceptions, the same as those previously considered in published opinions both here and in the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court assumes familiarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>with the factual allegations in the TCAC. <em>Stair, </em>592 F.3d at 317-22; <em>In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., </em>592 F.Supp.2d 435, 437-39 (S.D.N.Y.2008). To situate this discussion, a summary of the alleged facts follows. The Court assumes that all nonconclusory facts alleged are true for present purposes. <em>Starr, </em>592 F.3d at 317 &amp; n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Defendants produce, license, and distribute music sold online (\u201cInternet Music\u201d) and on compact discs (\u201cCDs\u201d). They control eighty percent of the market for digital music in the United States. Defendants Bertlesmann, Inc., Warner Music Group Corp., and EMI launched an online service called MusicNet, a joint venture entity owned and controlled by various Defendants. (TCAC \u00b6 67.) Defendants UMG and Sony Corporation of America launched a similar online music service called Duet, later renamed pressplay. (TCAC \u00b6 67.) It too was a joint venture. All Defendants signed distribution agreements with MusicNet and pressplay. (TCAC \u00b6 67.) These joint ventures, along with the Recording Industry Association of America, provided a forum for Defendants to exchange pricing information, terms of sale, and use restrictions. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 34, 67-68, 87-88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants conspired to fix the price, terms of sale, and restrictions on the use of Internet Music through these joint ventures. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 72, 98.) Defendants used these joint ventures as a forum to discuss their desire to engage in the alleged conduct, to share licensing terms and pricing information, and to police the alleged agreements, among other things. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, 98.) Through the use of Most Favored Nation (\u201cMFN\u201d) clauses in Defendants\u2019 licensing agreements, a licensor would receive at least equivalent licensing terms as another licensor. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 92, 99.) The alleged effect of the MFN agreements was to set a wholesale price floor for Internet Music of seventy cents per song. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.) Plaintiffs allege that despite the fact that the price of distributing Internet Music fell to essentially zero, the wholesale price of Internet Music increased uniformly. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.) This was due in material part to Defendants\u2019 enforcement of the MFN clauses, which Defendants attempted to hide. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 93, 99-100.) In addition, Defendants included digital rights management (\u201cDRM\u201d), which restricted transfer of songs to portable players, among other things. (TCAC \u00b6 76.) Plaintiffs allege that but for the conspiracy, a defendant may have removed DRM to gain market share. (TCAC \u00b6 76.) Allegedly, both the wholesale price and DRM included with Defendants\u2019 music was fixed among Defendants because of Defendants\u2019 collusion, even when they sold to unaffiliated retailers. (TCAC \u00b6 69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The core allegation is that Defendants\u2019 behavior sustained high prices for Internet Music, which made it less attractive to consumers and hampered the growth of Internet Music services generally. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.) Plaintiffs point to eMusic, an independent competitor in the online music business, as an example of competitive pricing. It is the second-largest online retailer and charges \u2014 at retail \u2014 less than half of Defendants\u2019 wholesale price, and Defendants refuse to do business with it. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants\u2019 motive to conspire was to support their ability to charge supracompetitive prices for CDs; they could do so because Internet Music was priced, through the alleged conspiracy, so as to be an unattractive or economically uncompetitive substitute. (TCAC \u00b6 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The procedural history of this case is also well-described in the earlier opinions in this case. <em>E.g., Starr, </em>592 F.3d at 320-21. The Court of Appeals remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, and Defendants have again moved to dismiss the action, relying mainly on arguments made but not addressed in their original motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In evaluating this motion, the Court first will discuss the Sherman Act claims, beginning with a brief discussion of the <em>Twombly </em>analysis by the Court of Appeals. Then the Court will turn to the arguments made regarding the Sherman Act claims but not addressed in the original motion to dismiss and renewed in the motion to dismiss <em>sub judice. </em>Next, the Court will analyze Defendants\u2019 arguments relating to the state claims, aside from the <em>Twombly</em>related argument, made in the original motion to dismiss but not addressed previously. The Court will also discuss new arguments raised in relation to newly added claims under the Illinois and New York antitrust laws. Following the state-law discussion, the Court will analyze Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss claims against the Parent Companies. Finally, the Court will discuss the associated motion to strike portions of the TCAC. Before delving into these matters, the Court sets out the applicable legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">A. <em>Legal Standard for Motions to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In assessing a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept all non-conclusory factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Goldstein v. Pataki, </em>516 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). To survive such a motion, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A complaint that offers \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The complaint must allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a defendant\u2019s liability, it \u2018stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201cwhere the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,\u201d dismissal is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 1950. \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">In analyzing a motion to dismiss a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, the Court is mindful that a plaintiff needs to allege only \u201cenough factual matter ... to suggest that an agreement was made,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, but he need not, unlike in the summary judgment context, \u201crule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955. \u201cAsking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement, at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of an illegal agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955. \u201cThus, an allegation of parallel conduct coupled with only a bare assertion of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>spiraey is not sufficient to state a Section 1 claim.\u201d <em>Starr, </em>592 F.3d at 322. \u201cInstead, allegations of parallel conduct \u2018must be placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement, not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">B. <em>Pleading of Sherman Act Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In its opinion vacating the judgment entered in this case, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint \u201calleges specific facts sufficient to plausibly suggest that the parallel conduct alleged was the result of an agreement among the defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323. The TCAC being the same in material part, Defendants do not argue their motion to dismiss on <em>Twombly </em>grounds. In light of the Court of Appeals clarification of the importance of context in claims under section 1 of the Sherman Act and its conclusion that the allegations above suffice, Plaintiffs\u2019 section 1 claims may proceed because the TCAC meets <em>Twombly\u2019s </em>pleading standards. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">C. <em>Other Sherman Act Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In their original motion to dismiss, Defendants made two arguments with respect to the federal claims that were not addressed. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims through February 1, 2005, were settled and released because of a state class action settlement in <em>Ottinger v. EMI Music Distrib., </em>Civ. Action No. 24885-11 (Tenn.Cir.Ct.). (Declaration of Helena Almeida in Support of Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss dated July 30, 2007 (\u201cAlmeida Dec!.\u201d), Ex. E.) Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims involving CDs cannot survive because the TCAC does not state a claim of anticompetitive conduct involving CDs, which deprives Plaintiffs of antitrust standing for CD purchases. The Court considers these arguments in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">1. <em>Settlement and Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Defendants argue that the <em>Ottinger </em>case involved an alleged conspiracy that Defendants conspired to elevate the price of CDs despite cost reductions. Because the <em>Ottinger </em>settlement released all claims that the settlement class \u201calleged or could have alleged\u201d (Defendants\u2019 October 2007 Reply Brief (\u201cDef. 2007 Reply Br.\u201d) at 11) based on the allegations in that case, the argument is that the instant claims, which Defendants argue could have been alleged, were released.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Defendants correctly note that \u201c[a] court may release not only those claims alleged in the complaint and before the court, but also claims which could have been alleged ... in connection with any matter or fact set forth or referred to in the complaint.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa, </em>396 F.3d 96, 107 n. 13 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., </em>643 F.2d 195, 221 (5th Cir.1981)) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, they fail to appreciate that a release applies only \u201cas long as the released conduct arises out of the \u2018identical factual predicate\u2019 as the settled conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107. In other words, a settlement may be framed to prevent future suits \u201cdepending on the very same set of facts,\u201d <em>Nat'l Super Spuds, Inc. v. N.Y. Mercantile Exch., </em>660 F.2d 9, 18 n. 7 (2d Cir.1981), but future claims are barred only \u201cwhere there is a realistic identity of issues\u201d between the former and future cases and \u201cwhere the relationship between the suits is at the time of the class action foreseeably obvious to notified class members.\u201d <em>TBK Partners, Ltd. v. W. Union Corp., </em>675 F.2d 456, 461 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Here, the claims do not arise out of the \u201cidentical factual predicate\u201d as the <em>Ottinger </em>claims. <em>Ottinger </em>involved allegations that record-company defendants used various schemes to maintain higher CD profit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>margins than they could achieve for vinyl records and cassette tapes, despite cost reductions in the price of CD production. (Almeida Decl. Ex. G \u00b6 1.) The alleged schemes had to do with the ways CDs were priced at wholesale and marketed to retailers, and the schemes involved allegations of direct price agreements and price signaling for CDs. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 2.) The allegations simply have nothing to do with Internet Music, the interplay between the online music market and the CD market, or the related allegations here. This complaint involves allegations that the market for online music downloads was priced at set, artificially high levels. It involves a different factual predicate from the <em>Ottinger </em>complaint. That this complaint, like the complaint in <em>Ottinger, </em>also alleges anticompetitive effects in the CD market or a motive to maintain higher CD prices is insufficient; a release bars future suits that depend on \u201cthe very same set of facts.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Super Spuds, </em>660 F.2d at 18 n. 7; <em>see Wal-Mart Stores, </em>396 F.3d at 107. The source of the alleged antitrust conspiracy here is wholly different from the source of the alleged antitrust conspiracy in <em>Ottinger. </em>Thus, the <em>Ottinger </em>release does not bar these claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">2. <em>Standing to Assert CD-Purchaser Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Defendants next argue that the TCAC does not allege antitrust injury to purchasers of CDs but, rather, only to Internet Music purchasers. This is an argument about antitrust standing. Defendants say that the TCAC is insufficient to confer standing on a CD purchaser class because it does not allege that any CD purchaser would have bought Internet Music instead of CDs absent the alleged conspiracy. They also argue that the complaint does not specify how restricting Internet Music affected the price of CDs. In sum, Defendants\u2019 argument is that the CD-purchaser plaintiffs may not recover for an antitrust injury in a separate market.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In addition to Article III standing, \u201can antitrust plaintiff must also establish antitrust standing.\u201d <em>In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., </em>585 F.3d 677, 688 (2d Cir.2009). Antitrust standing is analyzed using two metrics. First, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u201cantitrust injury, which is \u2018injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977)). Second, a plaintiff must show that he is a proper plaintiff in light of the factors discussed in <em>Associated General Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 540-45, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983). These include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">(1) the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; (2) the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement; (3) the speculativeness of the alleged injury; and (4) the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them among direct and indirect victims so as to avoid duplicative recoveries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\"><em>In re DDAVP, </em>585 F.3d at 688. In addition, the existence of an improper motive is a relevant consideration, but it \u201cis not a panacea that will enable any complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 537, 103 S.Ct. 897; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>Balaklaw v. Lovell, </em>14 F.3d 793, 797 n. 9 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Ultimately, antitrust standing is about the question of \u201cwhich persons have sustained injuries <em>too remote </em>[from an antitrust violation] to give them standing to sue.\u201d <em>Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready, </em>457 U.S. 465, 476, 102 S.Ct. 2540, 73 L.Ed.2d 149 (1982) (alteration and emphasis in original). \u201cJust as in common-law tort and contract litigation, concepts such as \u2018foreseeability and proximate cause, directness of injury, certainty of damages, and privity of contract\u2019 circumscribe a party\u2019s right to recovery, so in antitrust actions \u2018the plaintiffs harm, the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants, and the relationship between them,\u2019 can limit the right to sue.\u201d <em>Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., </em>428 F.3d 408, 437 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 532-33, 535-36, 103 S.Ct. 897); <em>Reading Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Oaktree Capital Mgmt. LLC, </em>317 F.Supp.2d 301, 316 n. 8 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (\u201cIn considering the question of antitrust standing, the Supreme Court has likened the analysis to that of proximate cause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As to the first part of the analysis, there is little doubt that the CD-purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury is an antitrust injury. The CD-purchaser plaintiffs allege that they bought Defendants\u2019 CDs but were \u201cforced to pay supra-competitive prices as a result of the defendants\u2019 anti-competitive conduct. Such an injury plainly is \u2018of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re DDAVP, </em>585 F.3d at 688 (quoting <em>Brunswick, </em>429 U.S. at 489, 97 S.Ct. 690).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The second part of the analysis is less straightforward, however. Defendants argue that there are several infirmities in the CD-purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust standing: (1) the allegedly unlawful <em>conduct </em>has only to do with Internet Music; (2) no plaintiff alleges he would have bought Internet Music instead of CDs but for the allegedly unlawful conduct; and (3) there is no alleged connection between the allegedly unlawful conduct and its effect on the CD market. Plaintiffs counter that \u201cinjuries to different groups of consumers of related products can be inflicted by a single antitrust conspiracy.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 September 2007 Opposition Memorandum (\u201cPI. 2007 Opp.\u201d) at 21.) Neither side cites a case directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The Court begins by laying out the allegations relevant to the CD market in the TCAC. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">\u2022 \u201cInternet Music and CDs are viewed as substitutes by both record labels and consumers as evidenced by the inverse relationship between sales of CDs and Internet Music.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6 41.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u2022 \u201cDefendants\u2019 collusion in setting high prices for Internet Music ... made Internet Music less attractive to consumers, allowing Defendants to sell CDs at supracompetitive prices.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6 82.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">\u2022 \u201cActing alone, no defendant could sustain the supracompetitive prices prevailing in the CD market. This inability to charge high CD prices, as market factors made consumer demand for CDs more elastic over time at the prices charged by Defendants during the conspiracy, gave Defendants motive to conspire.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6 83.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">\u2022 \u201cIn consequence, Defendants\u2019 conspiracy to restrain the availability and distribution of Internet Music, and to fix and maintain the price of Internet Music, has protected the sale of CDs and enables Defendants to maintain CD prices at supracompetitive levels.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6 126.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">Otherwise, the TCAC has substantially similar allegations in a few other para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>graphs, but no allegations that add materially to these.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The allegations in the TCAC do not suffice to establish the antitrust standing of CD purchasers. Although Plaintiffs argue that the \u201csupracompetitive price that CD purchasers pay for CDs \u2018flows from\u2019 Defendants\u2019 anticompetitive conduct\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 22), this argument is nothing more than <em>ipse dixit. </em>The allegations either (1) are insufficient to allege antitrust standing because they do not demonstrate an adequate connection between the alleged misconduct and an effect on the CD market or (2) do not allege cognizable antitrust standing because the alleged injury is too attenuated from the source of the alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">As to the first point, all of the allegations of misconduct in the TCAC involve fixing prices of Internet Music. Without saying more than that CDs and Internet Music are \u201csubstitutes,\u201d the TCAC goes on to assert that Defendants\u2019 conduct in the Internet Music market \u201callow[ed] Defendants to sell CDs at supracompetitive prices.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6\u00b641, 82.) The TCAC contains no nonconelusory allegations about how the pricing of Internet Music affected CD pricing, how the CD market operated generally, what considerations affected CD pricing, or any kind of tie\u2014 contractual, historical, or correlative, for example \u2014 between CD pricing and Internet Music pricing. Absent a \u201cphysical and economic nexus between the alleged violation and the harm to the plaintiff,\u201d antitrust standing is difficult to come by. <em>See Blue Shield, </em>457 U.S. at 478, 102 S.Ct. 2540; <em>see also Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 545-46, 103 S.Ct. 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Allegations of this type of linkage are important. The cases Plaintiffs rely upon have a much closer link between the allegedly unlawful conduct and the antitrust standing of the plaintiff. For example, in <em>Loeb Industries, Inc. v. Sumitomo Corp., </em>defendants allegedly fixed prices on the copper futures market, but claims by purchasers of physical copper proceeded because \u201cthe price of physical copper ... is directly linked to the ... price for copper futures.\u201d 306 F.3d 469, 476 (7th Cir.2002). In part, that was due to the fact that \u201cdealers in all forms of physical copper quote prices based on rigid formulas related to [copper futures].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, there is no alleged \u201cdirect link\u201d between Internet Music pricing and CD pricing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Likewise, <em>In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation </em>involved a situation where vertically integrated producers restricted production of linerboard, which was a component of the end product, corrugated packaging. 305 F.3d 145, 159 (3d Cir.2002). Plaintiffs, buyers of corrugated materials, had antitrust standing because restricting liner-board output <em>necessarily </em>increased the price of the corrugated packaging, as it was a required component. <em>See id. </em>at 148-49, 159-60. In this case, there is no necessary link alleged between the price of Internet Music, the market where the alleged misconduct occurred, and the price of CDs, which could be affected by totally distinct market forces or costs of production. Moreover, the TCAC does not explain any alleged link. Similarly, in <em>Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, </em>patients of psychologists who were allegedly damaged by conspiracy between psychiatrists and health insurers had standing because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the patients\u2019 injury was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the psychologists\u2019 injury. 457 U.S. at 479, 482-84, 102 S.Ct. 2540. This case created a limited exception to the rule that an antitrust claim must be asserted by a market participant; it applies when injuries are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a market participant\u2019s. <em>Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of Ca., </em>190 F.3d 1051, 1057 n. 5 (9th Cir.1999). <em>Blue Shield </em>is inapposite because here, both CD purchasers and Internet Music purchasers allegedly were harmed by higher prices of CDs and Internet Music, respectively, and CD purchasers\u2019 alleged injury is thus distinct from and not intertwined with Internet Music purchasers\u2019 injury. Finally, Plaintiffs allude to <em>Crimpers Promotions Inc. v. Home Box Office, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 290 (2d Cir.1983), as supporting authority. That case involved an alleged conspiracy to boycott a trade show that allowed television producers to sell programming directly to cable television systems, rather than having producers go through middlemen who packaged programming together and sold it to the cable systems. <em>Id. </em>at 294. <em>Crimpers </em>involved <em>conduct </em>directly affecting the group defendants allegedly conspired to harm. 724 F.2d at 294. Here, the <em>conduct </em>was directed at an entirely separate group of plaintiffs, and any effect on CD purchasers was at best indirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Although in <em>Crimpers </em>and in this case, the complaints alleged a motive of the conspiracy to harm the plaintiffs, intent alone is insufficient. <em>Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 537, 103 S.Ct. 897; <em>see Blue Shield, </em>457 U.S. at 479, 102 S.Ct. 2540 (stating that antitrust liability \u201cis not a question of the specific intent of the conspirators\u201d). Yet Plaintiffs appear to rely on only the \u201cmotive, purpose and intended effect of the conspiracy\u201d (Pl. 2007 Opp. at 21) to support their CD-related claims. The thrust of the TCAC is that Defendants were motivated to engage in this conspiracy in order to continue selling CDs at higher prices, but the TCAC goes no further. <em>(E.g., </em>TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 41, 126.) At best, it could be read to say that Defendants\u2019 motivation supported some unstated, preexisting, and parallel conspiracy to keep CD prices high. (TCAC \u00b6 126 (stating that object of conspiracy was to <em>\u201cmaintain </em>CD prices at supraeompetitive levels\u201d (emphasis added)).) But such an allegation does not exist in the TCAC, and there is nothing in the TCAC to show how any conduct was directed at the CD market or how other conduct affected the CD market beyond conclusory allegations that Defendants could continue selling CDs at higher prices. The CD-purchaser plaintiffs do not have antitrust standing. <em>Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 540, 545, 103 S.Ct. 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Were the above not enough, the TCAC also alleges an injury that is too attenuated from the source of the alleged misconduct. The TCAC alleges that Defendants\u2019 price-fixing in the Internet Music market caused prices of Internet Music to be supraeompetitive. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 98-99, 103,105,126.) This allegation is sufficient. As a side-effect, and with no conduct directed at the CD market, the TCAC asserts that the Internet Music price-fixing scheme allowed Defendants to continue selling CDs at supraeompetitive prices. (TCAC \u00b6 126.) This allegation is not sufficient. Not only is there no nonconclusory connection alleged between the Internet Music and CD markets, but the CD market could have been affected by supply and demand, cost of production, or other economic factors wholly unrelated to Internet Music. <em>(See, e.g., </em>TCAC \u00b6 71 (discussing factors involved in CD pricing that are absent in Internet Music distribution).) Absent allegations of some conduct directed at the CD market or a direct linkage between the two markets, an allegation of wrongdoing in the Internet Music market bears little connection to the CD market. <em>Cf. Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 542-43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>103 S.Ct. 897 (listing independent factors that could have been at play). This alleged injury is simply too attenuated from the source of the alleged malfeasance. <em>See id.; see also Am. Ad Mgmt., </em>190 F.3d at 1057 (\u201cAntitrust injury requires the plaintiff to have suffered its injury in the market where competition is being restrained.\u201d); <em>Automated Salvage Transp., Inc. v. Wheelabrator Envtl. Sys., Inc., </em>155 F.3d 59, 79 (2d Cir.1998) (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Indeed, looking to the antitrust standing factors, the CD-purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 standing fails in several regards. <em>See In re DDAVP, </em>585 F.3d at 688. First, the cause of any injury to CD purchasers is from an indirect source; the direct cause of any injury is from machinations in the Internet Music market. <em>Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 540, 103 S.Ct. 897. Second, there is a class of persons \u2014 those who purchased Internet Music directly \u2014 whose self-interest would motivate them to vindicate the public interest. <em>Id. </em>at 542, 103 S.Ct. 897. Third, allowing CD purchasers to bring an antitrust suit involves more speculative injuries than those alleged to Internet Music purchasers, especially in light of the dearth of allegations about the linkage between the CD market and the Internet Music market, as explained above. <em>Id. </em>at 542-43, 103 S.Ct. 897. Because the CD market is separate, as the Court explains <em>infra, </em>\u201cthe alleged effects on the [CD market] may have produced by independent factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 103 S.Ct. 897. And fourth, there is strong potential for duplicative recoveries here because the CD purchasers\u2019 claims are hard to disentangle from the Internet Music purchasers\u2019 claims, and the injury they seek to remedy arises from the same alleged misconduct. id at 544-45, 103 S.Ct. 897. Given these additional factors, the CD-purchaser plaintiffs are not the proper plaintiffs to bring this action. The most they allege is malfeasance in the Internet Music market with no hard link to the CD market.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Plaintiffs appear to argue that no distinction between the CD market and the Internet Music market is warranted. (PI. 2007 Opp. at 21-22.) Although Plaintiffs have structured their complaint to define the relevant market as the market for music generally, their allegations involve only conduct related to the Internet Music market and not the CD market. Moreover, Plaintiffs themselves divide the market by referring to two separate classes of purchasers: Internet Music purchasers and CD purchasers. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.) The TCAC itself explains how Internet Music differs from CDs. For example, Internet Music is \u201cwell below CD-quality\u201d and \u201cfurther hampered by DRM.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6 74.) In addition, CD pricing includes costs for many features that distinguish the product: it includes costs for producing the discs, cases, packaging, antishoplifting mechanisms, shipping, distribution, and so forth. (TCAC \u00b6 71.) Most tellingly, the TCAC alleges that while Internet Music \u201chas the potential to transform the market\u201d by increasing selection (TCAC \u00b6 70), Defendants\u2019 conduct hampered its development and \u201cforestalled the time by which Internet Music would emerge as a reasonable consumer substitute for CDs.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6 79.) Thus, the TCAC acknowledges that Internet Music is not the same as or a substitute for CDs. Even Plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum implicitly understands that CDs and Internet Music are different; it calls them \u201crelated products.\u201d (PL 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Opp. at 21.) Finally, it takes no special training to understand that a CD is a physical product, while Internet Music is not. These attributes could be meaningful to one set of consumers over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">To summarize: the TCAC does not allege a sufficient linkage between the CD market and the Internet Music market to make its allegations regarding the CD market cognizable for antitrust purposes. In addition, the TCAC alleges an injury that is too attenuated from the source of the alleged malfeasance to confer antitrust standing on the CD-purchaser plaintiffs. The TCAC merely pairs an allegation of a motive with an allegation of consequential harm to assert antitrust standing. The Supreme Court held specifically that this approach, combined with the other factors present here, is insufficient to confer antitrust standing. <em>Associated Gen., </em>459 U.S. at 545, 103 S.Ct. 897 (\u201cWe conclude, therefore, that [plaintiffj\u2019s allegations of consequential harm resulting from a violation of the antitrust laws, although buttressed by an allegation of intent to harm [plaintiff], are insufficient as a matter of law.\u201d). This being the third amended complaint involving factual allegations that do not involve the CD-purchaser plaintiffs, these claims are DISMISSED with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">D. <em>State-Law Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Defendants reassert three state-law-based arguments that were made but not addressed previously: they argue that (1) Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims on behalf of residents of states not included in this action; (2) Plaintiffs claims fail under state-law pleading requirements; and (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims are barred under the <em>Illinois Brick </em>doctrine. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 newly added claims under Illinois and New York antitrust statutes are barred. The Court addresses these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">In considering substantive state-law claims, the Court \u201cfollow[s] a decision of the highest state court \u2018unless there are very persuasive grounds for believing that the state\u2019s highest court no longer would adhere to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re New Motor Vehicles Can. Exp. Antitrust Litig. (In re NMV), </em>350 F.Supp.2d 160, 169 (D.Me.2004) (quoting 19 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 4507).' \u201cIn the absence of a ruling by the state\u2019s highest court, [the Court] consider^] and may follow intermediate court rulings unless [it is] convinced that the state\u2019s highest court would decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the standing argument, which the Court addresses first, is a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">1. <em>Standing on Behalf of Other State Residents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">The named Plaintiffs are residents of California, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Oregon; they assert state-law claims under those states\u2019 laws. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 5-19, 44.) The TCAC also asserts state-law claims under the laws of fourteen other states and the District of Columbia, where no named plaintiffs reside.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (TCAC \u00b6 44.) Because the TCAC does not identify class representatives from those fourteen other states and the District of Columbia, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have no Article III standing to assert these claims. Plaintiffs disagree, saying that, in this case, class certification issues are \u201clogically antecedent\u201d to standing issues. <em>See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 831, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Although an Article III court must ordinarily assure itself that it has jurisdiction before proceeding, there is an exception to that rule when class certification issues are \u201clogically antecedent to Article III concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201clogically antecedent\u201d exception is not exactly defined. <em>See Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., </em>756 F.Supp.2d 445, 451 (S.D.N.Y.2010). The cases indicate that where \u201cclass certification is the <em>source </em>of the potential standing problems,\u201d class certification should precede the .standing inquiry. <em>In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Litig., </em>No. 06 MD 1739, 2006 WL 3039993, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2006) (emphasis added); <em>accord Blessing, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 451; <em>see In re Buspirone Patent Litig., </em>185 F.Supp.2d 363, 377 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (deferring standing inquiry until after class certification decision because \u201cthese alleged problems of standing will not arise unless class certification is granted\u201d). This is particularly true where, as here, Article III concerns \u201cpertain to statutory standing.\u201d <em>Salsitz v. Peltz, </em>210 F.R.D. 95, 97 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (quoting <em>Ortiz, </em>527 U.S. at 831, 119 S.Ct. 2295). Cases holding otherwise have been situations where the standing of the <em>named plaintiffs </em>is in question or where the standing of each plaintiff involves nuances in the conduct affecting each plaintiff. <em>E.g., Gunther v. Capital One, N.A., </em>703 F.Supp.2d 264, 274 (E.D.N.Y.2010) (named plaintiff had no standing); <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>692 F.Supp.2d 524, 533-34 (E.D.Pa.2010) (similar, declining to defer standing inquiry where defendant \u201cattackfed] the standing only of the <em>named </em>plaintiffs\u201d); <em>Marshall v. Milberg, LLP, </em>No. 07 Civ. 6950, 2009 WL 5177975, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2009) (nuanced conduct determines standing of each plaintiff); <em>see Clark v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>213 F.R.D. 198, 204 (D.N.J.2003) (\u201cStated differently, the <em>Ortiz </em>exception ... does not apply if the standing issue would exist regardless of whether the named plaintiff filed his claim alone or as part of a class.\u201d). Generally, this occurs in securities cases where \u201cplaintiffs brought claims related to securities they did not purchase on the theory that proposed class members had purchased them and would establish standing once joined.\u201d <em>Blessing, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 451 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The Court concludes that this case is one where class certification issues are the source of any standing problems, making it appropriate to defer consideration of standing until the class certification stage. Defendants do not dispute that the named Plaintiffs have standing to bring class actions in the states where they reside and purchased Internet Music. <em>See, e.g., In re Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 533-34. Thus, there is no risk that the named Plaintiffs are attempting to \u201cto piggy-back on the injuries of the unnamed class members.\u201d <em>In re Grand Theft Auto, </em>2006 WL 3039993, at *3 (quoting <em>Payton v. Cnty. of Kane, </em>308 F.3d 673, 680 (7th Cir.2002)). Plaintiffs claim that they, along with a class of many more individuals, were all injured in similar ways by the same conduct of the Defendants: price-fixing of Internet Music. This conduct is alleged to be the same no matter where any plaintiff resides. This is not a case where nuances in the facts of each alleged injury suggest that standing must be determined first. \u201cThe relevant question, therefore, is not whether the Named Plaintiffs have standing to sue Defendants \u2014 they most certainly do\u2014 but whether their injuries are sufficiently similar to those of the purported Class to justify the prosecution of a [larger] class action.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Blessing, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 452; <em>Sheet Metal Workers Nat\u2019l Health Fund v. Amgen Inc., </em>No. 07 Civ. 5295, 2008 WL 3833577, at *9 (D.N.J. Aug. 13, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Therefore, class certification issues are the source of any standing problems iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tified by Defendants at this stage of the litigation. Here, moreover, statutory standing is generally at issue with respect to the state claims. <em>Salsitz, </em>210 F.R.D. at 97. Class certification is logically antecedent to standing in this case, and the Court will consider standing after class certification has been resolved. <em>See Blessing, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 452; <em>In re Buspirone, </em>185 F.Supp.2d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">2. <em>State-Law Statutory Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Defendants make two basic arguments as to the pleading of state-law claims. First, they claim that the TCAC contains insufficient allegations of intrastate conduct in states requiring such allegations and that in states without such a requirement, a lack of an intrastate connection fails under the dormant Commerce Clause. Second, they say that Plaintiffs do not properly allege state-law consumer protection claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">a. <em>Intrastate Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Defendants argue that the TCAC insufficiently alleges state claims under the antitrust laws of the District of Columbia, Michigan, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, as well as the consumer protection laws of North Carolina. Defendants focus on a single common denominator: they say that because each of those states\u2019 statutes require an allegation of conduct or substantial effects within the state, the absence of such an allegation is fatal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In large part, Plaintiffs accept the proposition that these states require allegations of intrastate conduct or substantial effects within the states, but they say that the TCAC sufficiently pleads intrastate activity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, as the Court must, the TCAC\u2019s allegations are sufficient to satisfy state statutes requiring either allegations of intrastate conduct or substantial effects within the state. The TCAC alleges that Defendants \u201cproduced, licensed, distributed and/or sold\u201d Internet Music in all of the listed states. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 39, 44, 57-59, 127, 136.) The TCAC alleges that Defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201cin a continuous and uninterrupted flow of intrastate and inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>state commerce throughout the United States.\u201d (TCAC \u00b689.) Pleadings involving similar allegations of intrastate conduct along with conduct throughout the United States in nationwide class actions have survived motions to dismiss in the face of this very argument. <em>E.g., In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., </em>602 F.Supp.2d 538, 581 (M.D.Pa.2009) (similar pleading sufficient to allege intrastate conduct in Wisconsin); <em>In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig., </em>496 F.Supp.2d 404, 411-14 (D.Del.2007) (District of Columbia); <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 171-75 (South Dakota, Tennessee &amp; West Virginia). The Court cautions that \u201c[t]he allegations of the [TCAC] certainly could have been more fulsome on this subject.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 171. Nevertheless, the Court must construe the pleadings in a light favorable to Plaintiffs and thus considers allegations of nationwide sales and distribution on essentially the same terms in both intrastate and interstate commerce to be sufficient. <em>See id. </em>Defendants cite <em>California v. Infineon Technologies AG, </em>which they argue holds that similar language is insufficient to plead interstate activity. 531 F.Supp.2d 1124, 1156 (N.D.Cal.2007). That case, unlike this one and others similar to it, does not contain specific allegations of \u201cintrastate\u201d conduct along with allegations of conduct \u201cthroughout the United States\u201d and therefore is not persuasive. <em>See In re Chocolate, </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 581 n. 53 (coming to the same conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Defendants also argue that the antitrust laws of Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Vermont have not been determined to require an intrastate connection and that allegations that lack such a connection would violate the prohibition on state regulation that unduly burdens interstate commerce. <em>See, e.g., Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>545 U.S. 429, 433, 125 S.Ct. 2419, 162 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005). The Court need not tarry here because, as discussed above, reading the TCAC in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, it contains sufficient allegations of intrastate conduct or effects to pass Constitutional muster without having to construe the limitations on those state laws, if any. Moreover, without getting to the details of the jurisprudence, it suffices to say that states may not regulate wholly interstate activity, but they are not limited to regulating wholly intrastate activity. <em>See id.; Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, </em>425 F.3d 158, 169-72 (2d Cir.2005). The Court rejects Defendants\u2019 argument as to pleading under the laws of these six states. The motion as to the state-law antitrust claims is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">b. <em>Consumer Protection Laws</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Defendants argue that the TCAC insufficiently pleads violations of the consumer protection laws of California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, and North Carolina because the TCAC does not plead the requisite deceptive or fraudulent conduct under those statutes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a general matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>whether the TCAC contains allegations of deception or fraud affects the analysis of allegations under each state\u2019s consumer protection laws. Thus, the Court first addresses this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The TCAC does not contain allegations of fraudulent or deceptive conduct. First of all, the TCAC does not purport to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and plead any allegation of fraud with particularity (and, in fairness, Defendants do not make this argument). The Court cannot find in the TCAC any cognizable allegations of fraud. Secondly, there is no deception alleged about the nature of the product Plaintiffs purchased or the terms and conditions under which it was sold. This is not a case like <em>In re Intel, </em>where the product was secretly altered to under-perform when joined with complementary technology offered by a competitor and where the defendant threatened and retaliated against customers who dealt with its competitor. 496 F.Supp.2d at 418. Instead, Plaintiffs rely only on allegations that Defendants concealed a price fixing conspiracy in attempting to parry Defendants\u2019 argument. (Pl. 2007 Opp. at 34 n. 39.) However, if \u201cfailure to disclose participation in a purported antitrust conspiracy were sufficient to state a consumer-protection claim, then <em>any </em>Section 1 antitrust case would automatically become a consumer-protection case. That is not the law.\u201d <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 177 n. 22; <em>accord Leider v. Ralfe, </em>387 F.Supp.2d 283, 295-96 (S.D.N.Y.2005). Finally, although Plaintiffs assert that two other nationwide antitrust cases determined that allegations of price fixing or monopolization alone are enough to allege deceptive or unconscionable conduct, that is not true. In both of those cases, the courts undertook a detailed, fact-intensive analysis of the allegations to determine whether the complaints alleged such conduct. <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 176-77, 196; <em>see In re Intel, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 418. Without such allegations here, the Court can do no more and disagrees with Plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">These preliminary matters determined, the Court proceeds to discuss state consumer protection law claims about which Defendants make arguments. It has been observed that different state consumer protection statutes contain \u201cnot only nuances, but differing standards of proof, procedure, substance, and remedies.\u201d <em>Tylka v. Gerber Prods. Co., </em>178 F.R.D. 493, 499 (N.D.Ill.1998). The Court thus discusses Defendants\u2019 arguments with respect to each state because there is no unifying theme.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\n<em>i.California</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Plaintiffs agree with Defendants that they do not bring a claim under California Unfair Competition Law for damages because such a claim is not allowed. <em>Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>29 Cal.4th 1134, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937, 943 (2003). Instead, Plaintiffs seek restitution, which is a permissible claim. <em>Id. </em>This statute \u201cprohibits unfair competition, including unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent business acts. The [California law] covers a wide range of conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendants make no other argument about why this claim should be dismissed. Their motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\n<em>ii.Kansas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The parties agree that Plaintiffs do not assert a claim under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 50-623 et <em>seq., </em>but, rather, under the \u201cRestraint of Trade\u201d statute, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 50-101 <em>et seq. </em>Defendants\u2019 motion is therefore DENIED as moot on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">\n<em>iii.New Mexico</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Defendants argue that the TCAC insufficiently alleges \u201cunconscionable trade practices.\u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57-12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>2(E)(2). \u201cFederal courts have generally permitted claims under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act in price fixing cases if the plaintiff alleges a gross disparity between the price paid for the product and the value received.\u201d <em>In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 08 Civ. 4883, 2009 WL 3754041, at *9 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 5, 2009). Here, as in Aftermarket Filters, the TCAC\u2019s allegation that Plaintiffs paid supracompetitive prices for the music they purchased \u201cis sufficient to allege gross disparity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendants\u2019 motion is DENIED as to the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">iv. <em>New York</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 New York General Business Law \u00a7 349(a) claim is deficient because the TCAC does not allege any deceptive conduct. The New York statute requires \u201ca showing that defendant is engaging in an act or practice that is deceptive or misleading in a material way and that plaintiff has been injured by reason thereof.\u201d <em>Goshen v. Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>98 N.Y.2d 314, 746 N.Y.S.2d 858, 774 N.E.2d 1190, 1195 (2002). \u201cThe deceptive practice, whether a representation or an omission, must be likely to mislead a reasonable consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Nextel Partners, Inc., </em>72 A.D.3d 209, 895 N.Y.S.2d 580, 585 (N.Y.App.Div.2010). Although the New York statute is based upon section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), \u201cNew York has chosen not to include \u2018unfair competition\u2019 or \u2018unfair\u2019 practices in its consumer protection statute, language that bespeaks a significantly broader reach.\u201d <em>Leider, </em>387 F.Supp.2d at 296. Accordingly, \u201canticompetitive conduct that is not premised on consumer deception is not within the ambit of the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 295, because \u201c[t]he statute seeks to secure an honest market place where trust, and not deception, prevails,\u201d <em>Goshen, </em>746 N.Y.S.2d 858, 774 N.E.2d at 1195 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 197 (\u201cAn antitrust violation may violate section 349, but only if it is deceptive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The TCAC does not contain antitrust allegations that \u201cwere imbued with a degree of subterfuge,\u201d <em>Leider, </em>387 F.Supp.2d at 295, as has been the case when courts uphold section 349 claims based on anti-competitive conduct. As the Court found, the TCAC does not allege deception. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on cases like <em>In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litigation (In re TFT I), </em>586 F.Supp.2d 1109, 1127-28 (N.D.Cal.2008), is unpersuasive in this case because those cases deal with an argument about whether defendants made misrepresentations to plaintiffs. Therefore, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the section 349 claim is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">v. <em>North Carolina</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Defendants argue that the North Carolina consumer protection statute prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d commercial conduct, of which they argue the TCAC lacks allegations. <em>Dalton v. Camp, </em>353 N.C. 647, 548 S.E.2d 704, 711 (2001). Plaintiffs argue that the TCAC contains sufficient allegations of at least unfair conduct. Having already determined that there are no allegations of deceptive conduct in the TCAC, the Court goes on to consider whether the TCAC contains allegations of unfair conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The most persuasive authority arising under North Carolina law holds that price fixing is an unfair practice under that state\u2019s law. <em>See Marshall v. Miller, </em>302 N.C. 539, 276 S.E.2d 397, 403 (N.C.1981) (\u201cA practice is unfair when it offends established public policy as well as when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers.\u201d); <em>see also McDaniel v. Greensboro News Co., </em>No. 81 Civ. 132, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>1983 WL 1943, at *3 (M.D.N.C. Dec. 19, 1983) (holding that price-fixing efforts in combination with other dishonest conduct suffices under the North Carolina law). Moreover, like the New York statute, the North Carolina law is based upon section 5 of the FTCA. <em>ITCO Corp. v. Michelin Tire Corp., </em>722 F.2d 42, 48 (4th Cir.1983). However, unlike the New York statute, the North Carolina law contains a provision prohibiting \u201cunfair\u201d practices and thus fully mirrors the FTCA. <em>Id.; Leider, </em>387 F.Supp.2d at 295. Because of that similarity, decisions construing the FTCA are appropriate guidance here. <em>ITCO, </em>722 F.2d at 48. \u201c[I]t is an accepted tenet of basic antitrust law that \u00a7 5 of the [FTCA] sweeps within its prohibitory scope conduct also condemned by \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the parties point to no reason to conclude that North Carolina courts would rule otherwise, the Court finds that the TCAC suffices to state a claim under the North Carolina law for the same reasons it states a federal antitrust claim. Defendants\u2019 motion as to the North Carolina consumer protection law is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">3. <em>State-Law Unjust Enrichment Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Plaintiffs assert claims for restitution based on unjust enrichment under various state laws, stating that \u201cDefendants\u2019 financial benefits resulting from their unlawful and inequitable conduct are traceable to overpayments for Internet Music and CDs stemming from Defendants\u2019 combination and conspiracy to restrain trade in Internet Music.\u201d (TCAC \u00b6 139.) Defendants argue that these claims are nothing more than claims for damages for the alleged antitrust violations, which are barred because they seek duplicative recovery and because state antitrust laws should be the exclusive remedy for such violations. Plaintiffs argue first that they are entitled to plead alternative theories of relief and second that unjust enrichment claims are independent of antitrust claims and proceed on their own merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Although the requirements to plead unjust enrichment vary by state, \u201calmost all states at minimum require plaintiffs to allege that they conferred a benefit or enrichment upon defendant and that it would be inequitable or unjust for defendant to accept and retain the benefit.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>In re Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 541; <em>see also Golden Pac. Bancorp v. FDIC, </em>273 F.3d 509, 519 (2d Cir.2001). \u201cIn contemporary United States common law, restitution based upon unjust enrichment takes at least two forms\u201d; it may be \u201cautonomous\u201d or \u201cparasitic.\u201d <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 207-08. Parasitic claims are \u201c[w]here the unjust enrichment is based upon a predicate wrong, such as a tort, breach of contract or other wrongful conduct such as an antitrust violation.\u201d <em>In re Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 542 n. 13. \u201cConversely, unjust enrichment may provide an independent ground for restitution, and this is known as \u2018autonomous\u2019 restitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Autonomous claims in an area \u201cregulated by an independent body of law\u201d are more problematic than parasitic claims because the \u201cpremise for such a claim must be that, even if the defendants\u2019 conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>blameless under the substantive requirements of federal and state antitrust statutes and state consumer protection statutes, the plaintiffs nevertheless can still obtain restitution.\u201d <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 209. Plaintiffs do not clearly differentiate the type of restitution they seek. <em>See id. </em>at 209 n. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">For purposes of this motion, the Court assumes that the TCAC alleges that Plaintiffs conferred a benefit (payment for music) on Defendants and that, at minimum, Defendants\u2019 conduct violated the federal antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The Court begins with the autonomous claims. On its own, \u201cunjust enrichment ordinarily does not furnish a basis for liability where parties voluntarily have negotiated, entered into and fully performed their bargain ....\u201d <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 210. Here, Plaintiffs \u201cpaid their purchase prices and obtained their\u201d products. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs do not seek rescission of the sales, and they do not \u201cassert that purchasers failed to receive the benefit for which they bargained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They only allege that they overpaid for the product for which they bargained. Although authority exists for the proposition that providing only \u201cfair,\u201d not \u201cany,\u201d consideration for a benefit defeats an autonomous unjust enrichment claim, <em>see In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., </em>338 F.Supp.2d 517, 545-46 (D.N.J.2004), this ease does not involve a situation, as in <em>In re K-Dur, </em>where the plaintiffs alleged that \u201cthey failed to receive the benefit of their bargain.\u201d <em>In re Intel, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 421 (rejecting unjust enrichment claims in an overpayment case). Indeed, Plaintiffs received the music they purchased. Because autonomous restitution only exists in the absence of a violation of law, the Court will not inquire into the terms of the sale where, as here, a relatively comprehensive state and federal statutory and common-law scheme exists to proscribe the conduct of which Plaintiffs complain. <em>See id.; see also U.S. East Telecomms., Inc. v. U.S. West Commc\u2019ns Servs., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1289, 1299 (2d Cir.1994); <em>Ferguson v. Lion Holdings, Inc., </em>312 F.Supp.2d 484, 495 (S.D.N.Y.2004). To do so would undermine that legal regime. <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 209 (citing <em>Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>171 F.3d 912, 936-37 (3d Cir.1999)). Therefore, Plaintiffs \u201ccannot prevail on a claim of restitution based upon [autonomous] unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210; <em>see In re Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 542 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Before proceeding to the \u201cparasitic\u201d claims, it must be noted that there are two types of plaintiffs here: direct purchasers and indirect purchasers. Direct purchasers are those who bought music directly from MusicNet or pressplay. (TCAC \u00b6 44.) Indirect purchasers are those who bought music owned by Defendants from another source that is unrelated to Defendants. (Id.) Moreover, there are two categories of violations at issue: federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">As to parasitic claims premised on a violation of federal law, it is beyond peradventure that indirect purchasers may not employ unjust enrichment to skirt the limitation on recovery imposed by <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 735, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 211. Moreover, there is no clearly established federal common law of restitution for a federal antitrust violation, and Plaintiffs do not suggest that the Court create one. <em>Id. </em>at 211 n. 90. Therefore, absent a basis for restitution in federal law both direct and indirect purchasers may not bring unjust enrichment claims premised solely on a violation of federal law. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for parasitic unjust enrichment is dismissed to the extent it is premised on a violation of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>As to parasitic claims premised on a violation of state law, these claims boil down to an election of remedies, which the Court does \u201cnot have unlimited compass ... to determine\u201d because \u201cthe statute creating liability can override otherwise relevant common law restitution principles by permitting such relief, by prohibiting such relief or by limiting or enlarging the scope of restitutionary relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. Plaintiffs have not sought an unjust enrichment remedy under Florida, Montana, North Carolina, or North Dakota law. The Court has dismissed the New York state claims, so they cannot be the basis for a parasitic claim. Without further direction from the parties about which other states disallow restitutionary relief, the Court will allow all direct purchaser parasitic unjust enrichment claims to proceed in states not named because they merely provide a different form of remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Indirect purchaser Plaintiffs, however, face a further limitation: they may not recover restitution in states that follow the rule of <em>Illinois Brick. See In re Flonase, </em>692 F.Supp.2d at 544-45 (Illinois follows <em>Illinois Brick </em>for individual indirect purchasers); <em>In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig. (In re TFT II), </em>599 F.Supp.2d 1179, 1185-87 (N.D.Cal.2009) (Virginia, Montana, and Puerto Rico); <em>In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig., </em>241 F.Supp.2d 563, 565-66 (D.Md.2003) (Kentucky, Maryland, and Oklahoma); <em>see also </em>740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/7(2) (stating that only the Illinois state attorney general may bring a class action on behalf of indirect purchasers under Illinois law). Many states have not expressly adopted or rejected <em>Illinois Brick, </em>but they have antitrust laws that are harmonized with federal law or \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d look to federal law for guidance. <em>In re Digital Music, </em>592 F.Supp.2d at 448 &amp; nn. 20-21. Therefore, any state that has not expressly passed <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer legislation or interpreted its law in such a way as to override the rule of <em>Illinois Brick </em>is presumed to have decided to follow federal law, including the <em>Illinois Brick </em>limitation on indirect purchaser claims. <em>See, e.g., In re TFT II, </em>599 F.Supp.2d at 1185-87; <em>FTC v. Mylan Labs., Inc., </em>62 F.Supp.2d 25, 43 (D.D.C.1999). In addition to claims (if any) brought under the laws of Florida, Illinois, Montana, New York, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all parasitic claims premised on the state laws of states that follow <em>Illinois Brick </em>are DISMISSED.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>To summarize: Plaintiffs\u2019 autonomous unjust enrichment claims are dismissed, but their parasitic claims under the laws of many, but not all, states pleaded in the TCAC may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">4. <em>Newly Added State Law Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkW\">The TCAC adds state-law claims under Illinois and New York law. Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shady Grove Orthopedic </em>Assocs. <em>v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1431, 176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010) allows them to assert these claims. The Court addresses these newly added claims, beginning with claims under Illinois law.</p>\n<p id=\"APX\">i. <em>Illinois</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under Illinois antitrust law on behalf of all Illinois-resident indirect purchasers fails because the law expressly precludes private parties from asserting class actions on behalf of indirect purchasers. They acknowledge that the Illinois law does not \u201cdeny any person who is an indirect purchaser the right to sue for damages,\u201d but they say that only the state attorney general may assert a class action under this law. 740 111. Comp. Stat. 10/7(2). They therefore argue that Plaintiffs lack standing under the Illinois statute or that <em>Shady Grove </em>does not permit them to assert a claim. The Court begins with <em>Shady Grove </em>because that analysis determines whether Plaintiffs have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\"><em>Shady Grove </em>is a decision about the contours of the <em>Erie </em>doctrine, but it did not result in unanimity on all points. The Court considered whether a New York law prohibiting class actions in any suit seeking penalties or statutory minimum damages precluded a federal court from exercising diversity jurisdiction over a class action. 130 S.Ct. at 1436 (majority op.). The question for the Court was whether a suit for statutory damages could proceed in federal court as a class action notwithstanding the state statute\u2019s limitation. <em>Id. </em>at 1437. The same question exists here because the Illinois law clearly provides for an individual remedy for indirect purchasers, yet it limits those who may maintain a class action for the same alleged violation to only the state attorney general. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/7(2) (\u201cNo provision of this Act shall deny any person who is an indirect purchaser the right to sue for damages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Setting out the legal framework, the Court proceeded to analyze two questions: first, whether the applicable federal rule applies, and second, whether that rule \u201cexceeds statutory authorization or Congress\u2019s rulemaking power.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 1437 (majority op.). A majority of the Court concluded that Rule 23 conflicted with the state statute because Rule 23 \u201ccreates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1437-38. The same analysis applies in this case: a diversity plaintiff in federal court may maintain a class action if he wishes; this rule conflicts with the Illinois statute, which places limits on who may maintain a class action in antitrust suits. Unless Rule 23 exceeds statutory authority or Congress\u2019s rulemaking power, then, it\u2014 and not the state rule \u2014 applies. <em>Id. </em>at 1437.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The Supreme Court differed as to the proper analysis of this second question, even though the Justices agree that a federal rule may not \u201cabridge, enlarge, or modify a substantive right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1442 (plurality op.); <em>id. </em>at 1452 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>judgment). Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion contained a simple approach: \u201cthe validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon whether it regulates procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1444 (plurality op.). Justice Scalia thought that a \u201cclass action ... merely enables a federal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once\u201d but doing so leaves \u201cthe parties\u2019 legal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision unchanged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1443. This view garnered the support of only four Justices. Justice Stevens wrote separately. He explained a more nuanced view of a similar concept: \u201cthere are some state procedural rules that federal courts must apply in diversity cases because they function as a part of the State\u2019s definition of substantive rights and remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1448 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). \u201cA state procedural rule, though undeniably \u2018procedural\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the term, may exist to influence substantive outcomes and may in some instances become so bound up with the state-created right or remedy that it defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1450 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWhen a federal rule appears to abridge, enlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1452. Nevertheless, finding that a federal rule of procedure exceeds Congress\u2019s authority is a \u201chigh\u201d bar. <em>Id. </em>at 1457. In <em>Shady Grove, </em>\u201cJustice Stevens concluded that \u00a7 901(b) was not intertwined with New York\u2019s definition of substantive rights because the rule is in New York\u2019s procedural code, it is applicable to class actions brought under any source of law, and the legislative history was ambiguous.\u201d <em>In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., </em>756 F.Supp.2d 670, 674 (E.D.Pa.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u201c \u2018When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., </em>315 F.3d 179, 189 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This rule is not a <em>carte blanche; </em>it only applies \u201cin instances where one opinion can meaningfully be regarded as \u2018narrower\u2019 than another ... that is to say, only when that narrow opinion is the common denominator representing the position approved by at least five justices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cJustice Stevens\u2019 approach does, however, form the \u2018narrowest grounds\u2019 in <em>Shady Grove </em>....\u201d <em>In re Wellbutrin, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 675. \u201c[T]he five justices in the concurrence and the dissent concluded that the validity of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure turns, in part, on the rights afforded by the state rule that the Federal Rule displaces.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Packaged Ice Antitrust Litig., </em>779 F.Supp.2d 642, 660 (E.D.Mich.2011) (\u201cCourts interpreting the <em>Shady Grove </em>decision ... have concluded that Justice Stevens\u2019 concurrence is the controlling opinion by which interpreting courts are' bound.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The Illinois law, under Justice Stevens\u2019s controlling analysis, is \u201csubstantive\u201d and therefore provides the rule of decision here. It states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">Any person who has been injured in his business or property, or is threatened with such injury, by a violation of [the Illinois antitrust statute] may maintain an action in the Circuit Court for damages, or for an injunction, or both, against any person who has committed such violation........</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">No provision of this Act shall deny any person who is an indirect purchaser the right to sue for damages.... Provided further that no person shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>authorized to maintain a class action in any court of this State for indirect purchasers asserting claims under this Act, with the sole exception of this State\u2019s Attorney General, who may maintain an action parens patriae as provided in this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/7(2). This statute provides a procedure that is \u201cso bound up with the state-created right or remedy that it defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy.\u201d <em>Shady Grove, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1450 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Therefore, applying the federal rule to override this process would be \u201can application of a federal rule that effectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created right or remedy\u201d and is disallowed. <em>Id. </em>at 1451. Unlike the New York law at issue in <em>Shady Grove, </em>its limitation is not contained in a generally applicable procedural rule but, rather, in the same paragraph of the same statute that creates the underlying substantive right. <em>In re Wellbutrin, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 677. It applies only to that statute. <em>Id. </em>\u201cFurthermore, courts have observed that the Illinois statute represents a policy judgment as to the feasibility of managing duplicative recovery, which the legislature has entrusted to the Attorney General but not to individual indirect purchasers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That policy judgment is substantive. Indeed, the statute expressly cautions courts to take care to follow the <em>Illinois Brick </em>rule and avoid duplicate recoveries. \u201cBecause the indirect purchaser restrictions of the [Illinois law] IAA are \u2018intertwined\u2019 with the underlying substantive right, application of Rule 23 would \u2018abridge, enlarge or modify\u2019 Illinois\u2019 substantive rights, and therefore Illinois\u2019 restrictions on indirect purchaser actions must be applied in federal court.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim on behalf- of indirect purchasers under Illinois law is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">ii. <em>New York</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Plaintiffs have added a claim under New York\u2019s Donnelly Act, which is a New York antitrust statute. Defendants contend that, even though <em>Shady Grove </em>allows private class actions for statutory claims in federal court under New York law, Plaintiffs\u2019 claim fails because \u201cfederal antitrust laws preempt the Donnelly Act where the alleged conduct principally affects interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Conergy AG v. MEMC Elec. Materials, Inc., </em>651 F.Supp.2d 51, 61 n. 83 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (collecting cases). Plaintiffs argue that federal antitrust preemption obtains only when there is \u201clittle or no impact on local or intrastate commerce.\u201d <em>Two Queens, Inc. v. Scoza, </em>296 A.D.2d 302, 745 N.Y.S.2d 517, 519 (N.Y.App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Although the authorities quoted by the parties contain broad, categorical language, the state authorities suggest that New York requires an impact on intrastate commerce so as to avoid a dormant Commerce Clause issue. <em>Compare id. </em>(\u201cThe question is whether the burden on interstate commerce outweighs the States\u2019 interests.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>with, e.g., Nat\u2019l Elec.

As Plaintiffs point out, the cases on which Defendants rely involve situations where the defendants had only tangential connections to New York. And as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Court already determined, <em>supra </em>Part II. D.2.a., the TCAC alleges a sufficient intrastate connection to survive this type of argument. The TCAC alleges a \u201csignificant impact on intrastate commerce\u201d in New York, <em>Conergy AG, </em>651 F.Supp.2d at 61, because the end purchasers presumably purchased Internet Music from New York and consumed the product in New York. Moreover, many of the Defendants are headquartered in New York City and/or incorporated in New York, and they clearly conduct significant business in New York. Federal antitrust law does not preempt the Donnelly Act in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the newly added New York claim is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">E. <em>Parent Company Motions to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Three named defendants, Sony Corporation of America (\u201cSCA\u201d), Bertelsmann, Inc.

(\u201cTime Warner\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cParent Companies\u201d), move to dismiss the complaint against them because they are parent companies to the relevant actors named in the complaint. These defendants argue that absent allegations allowing the Court to pierce the corporate veil, their separate corporate form entitles them to dismissal. The Court agrees. The Parent Companies could be liable directly or as alter egos of entities they own or control. The complaint is insufficient under either theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Beginning with the straightforward, the complaint alleges no conduct by the Parent Companies that violates the law. The complaint alleges that each Parent Company is a parent of a subsidiary that owns the rights to musical copyrights, royalties, and licensing agreements and that runs the related music operations. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 26.) The Parent Companies have no direct involvement in or ownership of the relevant music licenses. <em>(See </em>TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 26.) The complaint alleges that the Parent Companies had ownership interests in MusicNet and pressplay, which sold music to customers, and that SCA sold music directly through its website. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 58-60, 67, 72.) None of this is actionable conduct; an antitrust conspiracy complaint must assert enough \u201cfactual matter\u201d to suggest plausibly a preceding agreement. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555-57, 127 S.Ct. 1955; <em>see DM Research, Inc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists, </em>170 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir.1999). Although Plaintiffs argue that they alleged that the Parent Companies were directly involved in the alleged conspiracy (PI. Mem. of Supp. Auth. Dated June 2, 2010, at 1), a reading of the complaint indicates otherwise. The complaint alleges direct involvement of the Parent Companies by way of generic references to \u201cdefendants.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 1-5.) This approach is insufficient. <em>See, e.g., Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., </em>465 U.S. 752, 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984); <em>In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., </em>502 F.3d 47, 50-51 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Heart Disease Res. Found. v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>463 F.2d 98, 101 (2d Cir.1972); <em>Invamed, Inc. v. Barr Labs., Inc., </em>22 F.Supp.2d 210, 221 (S.D.N.Y.1998); <em>see also De Jesus v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>87 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir.1996) (reiterating that related corporations are presumed to be separate).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Direct involvement aside, the thrust of the complaint is to impute the actions of the Parent Companies\u2019 subsidiaries or joint ventures (MusicNet and pressplay) to the Parent Companies. But the complaint does not allege a basis to disregard the separate corporate forms of these entities and impose liability on the Parent Companies. \u201cIt is a general principle of corporate law deeply ingrained in our economic and legal systems that a parent corporation ... is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.\u201d <em>United States v. Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. 51, 61, 118 S.Ct. 1876, 141 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>marks omitted); <em>see, e.g., Greene v. Long Island R.R. Co., </em>280 F.3d 224, 235-36 (2d Cir.2002). \u201cBut there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary relationship as well as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for the corporation\u2019s conduct when, <em>inter alia, </em>the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish certain wrongful purposes .... \u201d <em>Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. at 62, 118 S.Ct. 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">\u201cUnder New York choice-of-law principles, the issue of whether the corporate veil may be pierced is determined under the law of the state of incorporation.\u201d <em>Spagnola v. Chubb Corp., </em>264 F.R.D. 76, 85 n. 10 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (citing <em>Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., </em>68 F.3d 1451, 1456 (2d Cir.1995)). Here, Time Warner and Bertelsmann are Delaware corporations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and SCA is a New York corporation. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) In Delaware, \u201ca court can pierce the corporate veil of an entity where there is fraud or where a subsidiary is in fact a mere instrumentality or alter ego of its owner.\u201d <em>Geyer v. Ingersoll Publ\u2019ns Co., </em>621 A.2d 784, 793 (Del.Ch.1992). Likewise, in New York, \u201cpiercing the corporate veil requires a showing that: (1) the owners exercised complete domination of the corporation in respect to the transaction attacked; and (2) that such domination was used to commit a fraud or wrong against the plaintiff which resulted in plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Morris v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Taxation &amp; Fin., </em>82 N.Y.2d 135, 603 N.Y.S.2d 807, 623 N.E.2d 1157, 1160 (1993). In determining whether to pierce the corporate veil in either state, courts consider allegations of disregarding corporate formalities, siphoning or intermingling of funds, inadequate capitalization, or that the corporation is a mere sham acting for the shareholder, among others. <em>MicroStrategy Inc. v. Acacia Research Corp., </em>Civ. A. No. 5735, 2010 WL 5550455, at *11 (Del.Ch. Dec. 30, 2010); <em>Fantazia Int\u2019l Corp. v. CPL Furs N.Y., Inc., </em>67 A.D.3d 511, 889 N.Y.S.2d 28, 29 (N.Y.App.Div.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In neither state may liability be imposed merely based on a parent\u2019s ownership of a controlling interest in the subsidiary. <em>Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. v. Tx. Am. Energy Corp., </em>Civ. A. No. 8578, 1990 WL 44267, at *5 (Del.Ch. Apr. 12, 1990) (\u201c[T]he separate corporate existences of parent and subsidiary will not be set aside merely on a showing of common management of the two entities, nor on a showing that the parent owned all the stock of the subsidiary.\u201d); <em>Sheridan Broad. Corp. v. Small, </em>19 A.D.3d 331, 798 N.Y.S.2d 45, 46 (N.Y.App.Div.2005). Indeed, a showing that a fraud would be \u201cperpetrated through misuse of the corporate form\u201d generally is required in both states. <em>Medi-Tec of Egypt Corp. v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Surgical, </em>No. Civ. A. 19760, 2004 WL 415251, at *7 (Del. Ch. Mar. 4, 2004); <em>see Morris, </em>603 N.Y.S.2d 807, 623 N.E.2d at 1161. Finally, in both states, the corporation\u2019s separate identity is generally respected, and the proponent of disregarding a corporation\u2019s separate identity bears a heavy burden. <em>TNS Holdings, Inc. v. MKI Sec. Corp., </em>92 N.Y.2d 335, 680 N.Y.S.2d 891, 703 N.E.2d 749, 751 (1998); <em>see MicroStrategy Inc., </em>2010 WL 5550455, at *11.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The TCAC fails to allege circumstances that would allow the Court to pierce the Parent Companies\u2019 corporate veils. The complaint contains no allegations that the Parent Companies misused the corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>form, disregarded corporate formalities, commingled funds, or otherwise misused the separate identities of the entities. <em>See, e.g., De Jesus, </em>87 F.3d at 70; <em>Miller v. Citicorp, </em>No. 95 Civ. 9728, 1997 WL 96569, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 4, 1997) (quoting New York law that subsidiary has to be the \u201cmere dummy\u201d of parent for veil to be pierced); <em>MicroStrategy Inc., </em>2010 WL 5550455, at *11; <em>Fantazia Int\u2019l Corp., </em>889 N.Y.S.2d at 29. There is no allegation that the Parent Companies used the separate corporate form of the subsidiaries to perpetrate a fraud. The most the complaint alleges is that the Parent Companies own their respective subsidiaries and have ownership interests in the joint ventures.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 25-28, 57-58, 72.) But a mere ownership stake in a joint venture is not grounds for a presumption of wrongdoing or fraud <em>on the part of its owners. See, e.g., Broad. Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc., </em>441 U.S. 1, 23, 99 S.Ct. 1551, 60 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979) (\u201cJoint ventures and other cooperative arrangements are also not usually unlawful ... where the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all.\u201d); <em>see also Texaco, Inc. v. Dagher, </em>547 U.S. 1, 5-6, 126 S.Ct. 1276, 164 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006); <em>Addamax Corp. v. Open Software Found., Inc., </em>152 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.1998) (declining to adopt per se section 1 liability for joint venture unless it is a \u201ccomplete sham\u201d). The joint ventures here are separate legal entities and enjoy a presumption of separateness. <em>See Be Jesus, </em>87 F.3d at 70. It is clear that simply owning, even wholly owning, a subsidiary is insufficient to pierce the corporate veil. <em>See Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co., </em>1990 WL 44267, at *5; <em>Sheridan Broad. Corp., </em>798 N.Y.S.2d at 46. And even though Plaintiffs challenge aspects of the joint ventures, <em>see Starr, </em>592 F.3d at 326, there are no allegations about <em>any </em>involvement of the Parent Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">There are no allegations that any Parent Company did anything actionable in the alleged antitrust conspiracy. Whether the joint ventures or subsidiaries did anything actionable is not relevant with respect to the liability of the Parent Companies absent a basis to pierce the corporate veil, and none is alleged. Moreover, there is no allegation that the Parent Companies directed the subsidiaries to engage in an antitrust conspiracy. As stated in a case involving more significant allegations of \u201cdominion and control\u201d over subsidiaries, \u201c[t]he unadorned invocation of dominion and control is simply not enough.\u201d <em>In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litig., </em>265 F.Supp.2d 385, 426 (S.D.N.Y.2003). Here, allegations of less pervasive control over the subsidiary entities, combined with the complete absence of any basis to infer the use of the subsidiary entities as a means to perpetrate a fraud, are likewise not enough. There being no basis in the complaint to impute liability to the Parent Companies, dismissal of the actions against them is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">F. <em>Motion to Strike Portions of the TCAC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Defendants move to strike paragraphs 87, 106-112, and the last sentence of paragraph 38 of the TCAC. Defendant\u2019s motion is GRANTED except as to paragraph 38 because paragraphs 87 and 106-112 contain information that is only inflammatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and is based on investigations or litigation that is unconcluded, concluded with no resolution against Defendants, or concluded but wholly irrelevant to digital music.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">For the reasons stated above, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss [dkt. no. 132] is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The result is as follows: Plaintiffs\u2019 Sherman Act claims may proceed. The CD-purchaser class does not have antitrust standing, and its claims are DISMISSED with prejudice. The Court will conduct a standing inquiry on claims asserted in states in which no named plaintiff resides at the class certification stage. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss claims for violations of state consumer protection statutes is DENIED except as to New York, in which case it is GRANTED. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claims is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Autonomous unjust enrichment claims are DISMISSED. Parasitic unjust enrichment claims are DISMISSED as to Illinois, Florida, Montana, New York, North Carolina, and North Dakota based claims, if any, but may proceed as to other states. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the newly added Illinois and New York state antitrust claims is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part. The New York claim only may proceed. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss claims against the Parent Companies is GRANTED. Defendants\u2019 motion to strike portions of the TCAC is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part; paragraphs 87 and 106-112 are stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The parties shall confer and inform the Court no later than August 1, 2011, how they propose to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-16\">. Because Bertelsmann, Inc., Sony Corporation of America, and Time Warner, Inc., are parent companies of other named defendants, the analysis proceeds somewhat differently for these three defendants. Therefore, the Court will refer to the named entities other than the three parent companies as \"Defendants,'' and the parent company defendants will be called the \"Parent Companies\u201d with their arguments analyzed separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-26\">. There are two salient exceptions. The first is an amendment to paragraph 99, which was proposed but denied as futile in the now-vacated order dismissing the complaint. The TCAC contains the amended language, which was considered by the Court of Appeals in its analysis, <em>Starr, </em>592 F.3d at 323 n. 3, and is considered here. The second exception is that the TCAC contains paragraphs 146-153, which were not included in the Second Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>solidated Amended Complaint. Those paragraphs allege violations of the Illinois and New York state antitrust laws, and they are discussed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">. Even if the <em>Ottinger </em>release were to bar these claims, it would be effective only for claims through September 29, 2003. The release by its terms only applies to members of the <em>Ottinger </em>class, which includes claims arising from CD purchases from June 1, 1991 to September 23, 2003. (Almeida Decl. Ex. E, \u00a7\u00a7 1.5, 1.16, 1.19.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">. Other futures-market cases Plaintiffs rely upon are similarly distinguishable; in all of those cases, allegations of contractual or highly correlated price movements were at issue. <em>E.g., Sanner v. Bd. of Trade of Chi., </em>62 F.3d 918, 929 (7th Cir.1995); <em>Ice Cream Liquidation, Inc. v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., </em>253 F.Supp.2d 262, 274 (D.Conn.2003) (\"Defendants concede that plaintiff has alleged a causal link between the CME butter price and the wholesale price of milk, cream, and butter.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-5\">. It is illustrative that the Court of Appeals hardly mentioned CDs in its opinion vacating this Court\u2019s earlier judgment dismissing the case. Its explanation for why the complaint survives focused instead on the Internet Music-related allegations. Only once did the Court of Appeals mention CDs in that discussion, and that mention referenced the lack of any reduction in the price for Internet Music \"as compared to CDs.\u201d <em>Starr, </em>592 F.3d at 323.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\">. The TCAC amends its allegations to include violations of Illinois state law. (TCAC \u00b6\u00b6 146-149.) Illinois is a state from which no named plaintiff hails, making the total fourteen states, a one-state increase from the thirteen states identified in the parties\u2019 papers. (Pl. 2007 Opp. at 25 n. 23.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\">. In supplemental briefing, Defendants state that the state statutes \"apply exclusively to intrastate \u2014 not interstate \u2014 conduct.\u201d (Def. Response to PL Supp. Auth. Dated June 10, 2010, at 5.) If this argument is that relief under these statutes is exclusive of any applicable federal relief for interstate activity, the Court rejects it. \"[T]he Court does not interpret the statutes to be inapplicable where the anticompetitive conduct may have both interstate effects and, as concerns the particular state in question, intrastate impact.\u201d <em>Sheet Metal Workers, </em>2008 WL 3833577, at *12 (collecting cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\">. Plaintiffs dispute that Michigan, West Virginia, and South Dakota require intrastate allegations. The Michigan statute explicitly requires the unlawful restraint of trade to be in \"a relevant market,\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 445.771, which it defines as an area of competition, \"all or any part of which is within the state,\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 445.772. Thus, the Court assumes that an allegation of intrastate conduct is required in Michigan. West Virginia and South Dakota have statutes that courts have held to be ambiguous as to whether the conspiracy or the conduct must be alleged to have been within the state. S.D. Codified Laws \u00a7 37-1-3.1 (\"[A] conspiracy ... in restraint of trade or commerce any part of which is within this state is unlawful.\u201d); W. Va.Code \u00a7 47-18-3 (similar); <em>see, e.g., In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 172, 175 (holding statutes ambiguous). In light of this potential ambiguity, courts have held that the states intended to cover as broad a range of activities as possible and that the statutes require allegations of some conduct within the state. <em>In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig., </em>496 F.Supp.2d 404, 414 (D.Del.2007); <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 172, 175. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' objections to having to allege intrastate conduct or effects as to South Dakota and West Virginia are meritless, and the Court assumes that those states require an allegation of intrastate conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b448-4\">. \u201cIt would have been helpful if the plaintiffs had added allegations of state-directed activity.\u201d <em>In re NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 169 n. 2. For example, simply adding an allegation of conduct throughout the United States \"and in each listed state\u201d would be superior pleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b448-5\">. Defendants offer no developed argument or legal authority for their claim that the TCAC is insufficient under the District of Columbia, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, or Nebraska consumer protection laws. Absent Defendants\u2019 invocation of some legal basis to dismiss these claims, the Court will not do so. The claims under these states\u2019 laws may proceed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. The Court rejects Defendants\u2019 first argument: that unjust enrichment is disallowed where an adequate remedy at law exists. This argument is premature because Plaintiffs may plead in the alternative. <em>In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., </em>338 F.Supp.2d 517, 544 (D.N.J.2004). Likewise, Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs\u2019 lack of privity with at least some defendants is groundless because, as Plaintiffs argue (without Defendants\u2019 refutation), no state at issue here has a privity requirement to plead unjust enrichment. <em>Id.; see </em>PL 2007 Mem. at 38 &amp; n. 47 (citing cases). Defendants' reliance on cases discussing incidental benefits is misplaced; this case may involve certain indirect benefits, but it does not involve incidental benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\">. Of the other states in which plaintiffs purportedly reside as pleaded in this action, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin have passed <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer laws or their courts have held that state law permits indirect purchaser suits by individuals. The Court relies on the following authority from each state in holding that these states do not follow <em>Illinois Brick: </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 16750(a); D.C.Code \u00a7 28-4509(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 50-161; Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 10, \u00a7 1104(1); Mich. Comp.

Massachusetts is somewhat different in that only direct purchasers may maintain a cause of action under the state antitrust act, but both direct and indirect purchasers may maintain a cause of action under the state consumer protection act. <em>Ciardi v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Ltd., </em>436 Mass. 53, 762 N.E.2d 303, 308-09, 312 (2002). Plaintiffs do not assert a cause of action under the Massachusetts antitrust act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, \u00a7 1 et seq., relying instead only on the consumer protection law, <em>id. </em>ch. 93A, \u00a7 1 et seq. Because the parties have not briefed whether the TCAC is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>cient to state a cause of action under the Massachusetts consumer protection law, the Court will allow a parasitic unjust enrichment claim to proceed for Massachusetts plaintiffs, if any.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b456-5\">. This holding indicates that Plaintiffs have no standing to bring suit under the Illinois law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b458-4\">. Although the place of Time Warner's incorporation is not stated in the complaint, the Court takes judicial notice that Time Warner is a Delaware corporation.

Moreover, the TCAC alleges that Bertlesmann (and SCA) transferred their \"musical copyrights, licensing agreements and royalty rights\u201d to Sony BMG, a separate entity that \"produces, licenses and distributes\u201d the music involved in this lawsuit. <em>(Id.) </em>Whether Bertlesmann or Bertlesmann AG owns an interest in Sony BMG is thus not material for the purpose of this motion; in either case, there is no basis to pierce either entity's corporate veil.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
