The arbitration was the final step in a grievance procedure outlined in the employment contract between the Board and plaintiff Delran Education Association. The Board had denied Roth a salary increment for the 1992-93 year because, in the words of a letter to her signed by school superintendent Carl Johnson on behalf of the Board, \u201con or about February 19, 1992, you behaved in a manner which was not appropriate for a teaching staff member.\u201d The reference is to a single encounter between Roth and Johnson. The Board contends that the arbitrator\u2019s award unlawfully trespassed upon its management prerogative to set standards of appropriate employee behavior. We reject the Board\u2019s argument and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">At the time in question, the Board offered a learning-disabilities program operated by its Child Study Team. Stanley Halpern was the Acting Coordinator of the Team, which included Roth who had been on the Team for nine years and is certified as a learning-disabilities teacher-consultant. The Team staff also included Sandra Fisher, its clerk, and Ellen Kowaf'its secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The Board had engaged an outside contractor to evaluate the program. In order to do so, the contractor had to review the records of a sampling of the pupils enrolled in the program. That presented a problem because under the law, pupil records ordinarily were not available to people who are not part of the school staff. Also, apart from the law, parents may object to their children\u2019s school records being examined by such people.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Parents of some of the children in the program attended a Board meeting in January 1992 and raised those objections. They expressed their concern about the confidentiality of their children\u2019s school records and asked whether they would be given the opportunity to refuse consent before the records are given to the contractor. The evidence is in conflict as to whether Johnson assured the parents that their permission would be sought before disclosure. The arbitrator found that Fisher and Kowal, the Team clerk and secretary, were at the meeting and reasonably understood from Johnson\u2019s assurances that pupil records would not be disclosed to the contractor in the absence of parental consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The alleged misconduct occurred the following month at the Team office. Johnson appeared there with Toni Spiotta, the contractor\u2019s representative, to obtain copies of a random selection of pupil records. Fisher and Kowal told Johnson that they did not want the responsibility of selecting the records for Spiotta\u2019s inspection. In addition to their general concern about confidentiality, they recalled Johnson\u2019s assurance to the parents at the Board meeting that records would not be disclosed without parental consent. Halpern, who was in charge of the office, was elsewhere at a meeting. That left Both as the only certified Team professional who was present. When Johnson ordered her to select the records, she declined to do so, believing that disclosure without parental consent would violate the law. She stated that she would not object to copying the records and blacking out the children\u2019s names if Johnson made the random selections. He insisted that she make the selections. Her refusal is the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d that caused the Board to deny her the salary increment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">A week after Roth\u2019s alleged misconduct, twenty-five to thirty parents whose children\u2019s records were chosen for the study were contacted by Halpern, Coordinator of the Team. He sent them the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">Your child was chosen at random for a study being conducted for the Delran Board of Education by a representative of a consulting firm. (Child Study Team, Inc.) We have been asked to black out identifying information and forward these records to the consultant, Ms. Spiotta, the director of the Psychoeducational center at the Montclair State College.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">Should you have any concerns about your child\u2019s Child Study Team records being used for this project, please contact our office prior to March 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Eight parents responded by objecting to the release of their children\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The Board concedes that the employment contract does not permit it to deny an annual increment \u201cwithout just cause.\u201d The New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-1 to -29, provides that withholding an employee\u2019s increment \u201cfor predominantly disciplinary reasons shall be subject to the grievance procedures established pursuant to law.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-26. Here, those grievance procedures culminate in referring the dispute to arbitration pursuant to the employment contract. An arbitrator\u2019s decision is entitled to a presumption of validity and the party opposing the award has the burden of establishing that the award be vacated. <em>Jersey City Educ. Ass\u2019n Inc. v. Board of Educ. of City of Jersey City, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>177, 187, 527 A.2d 84 (App.Div.1987). Our standard of review requires us \u201cto determine whether the arbitrator followed the inherent guidelines applicable to public sector arbitration and whether the interpretation of the contractual language is reasonably debatable.\u201d <em>State, Dept. of Law and Public Safety, Div. of State Police v. State Troopers Fraternal Ass\u2019n of New Jersey, Inc., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>464, 469, 453 A.2d 176 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">One of the \u201cinherent guidelines\u201d that circumscribe an arbitrator\u2019s authority bars \u201cprerogatives of management\u201d from arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tion. <em>Kearny PBA Local No. 21 v. Town of Kearny, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>208, 215, 405 A.2d 393 (1979). The Board argues that once the arbitrator found that Roth deliberately disobeyed Johnson\u2019s order, the question of whether that conduct constituted just cause for withholding her increment is a matter of management prerogative. It relies on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3, which provides: \u201cNothing herein shall be construed as permitting negotiation of the standards or criteria for employee performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The Board overlooks the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8, which defines \u201cemployer\u201d to include a \u201cschool district.\u201d N.J.S.A 34:19-2a. The Act provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">An employer shall not take any retaliatory action against an employee because the employee does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u2756 i!!******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">c. Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">(1) is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>34:19-3]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">The arbitrator in effect found that Roth refused to obey Johnson\u2019s order in the reasonable belief that to obey the order would be \u201cin violation of a ... regulation promulgated pursuant to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">It is not clear that <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:3-2.5, the regulation relied on by the Board, permitted access to pupil records by an outside contractor. At the time in question, the regulation, entitled \u201cAccess to pupil records,\u201d provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-14\">(a) Only authorized organizations, agencies or persons as defined herein shall have access to pupil records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-15\">(c) Authorized organizations, agencies and persons shall include only: ********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-16\">5. A district board of education, in order to fulfill its legal responsibilities as a board, has access through the chief school administrator or his or her designee to information contained in a pupil\u2019s record. Information shall be discussed in executive session unless otherwise requested by the parent or adult pupil;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The regulation was amended, effective June 7, 1993, more than a year after the incident in question. The amendment renumbered its provisions and added a new paragraph that defines with particularity who may have access to pupil records. <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:3\u2014 6.5 now reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">(a) Only authorized organizations, agencies or persons as defined herein shall have access to pupil records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">(c) Authorized organizations, agencies and persons shall include only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">5. Certified educational personnel who have assigned educational responsibility for the pupil and who are employed by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">i. An approved private school for the handicapped;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">ii. A state facility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">iii. Accredited nonpublic schools in which pupils with educational disabilities have been placed according to N.J.SA 18A46-14; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">iv. Clinics and agencies approved by the Department of Education; [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">6. A district board of education, in order to fulfill its legal responsibility as a board, has access through the chief school administrator or his or her designee to information contained in a pupil\u2019s record. Information shall be discussed in executive session unless otherwise requested by the parent or adult pupil;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">The new <em>N.JAC. </em>6:3-6.5(c)5 demonstrates that more specific definitions of the agencies to whom access to pupil records may be given was necessary because the prior regulation, in effect at the time of Johnson\u2019s order to Roth, was either unclear or not sufficiently comprehensive. The arbitrator could find that either deficiency led Roth to believe reasonably that to obey Johnson\u2019s order would be a violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-15\"> The Board argues that Johnson acted properly in ordering Roth to disclose pupil records to a representative of the independent contractor, because the contractor meets the definition found in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:3-6.5(c)5iv, a regulation that did not exist at the time Johnson\u2019s order was given. Plaintiff has moved before this court to strike that part of the Board\u2019s brief and appendix referring to the new regulation. We deny the motion, but reject the Board\u2019s argument because the regulation was adopted after Roth had refused to obey Johnson\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
