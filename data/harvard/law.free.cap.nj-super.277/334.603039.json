The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>two counts were merged and he was sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment with five years\u2019 parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On the basis of the evidence presented at a pretrial hearing before the Law Division on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, Hon. Burton J. Ironson, J.S.C., found, with ample support in the record, that defendant was stopped by a security guard and subsequently was searched by a Port Authority policeman when he tried unsuccessfully to pass .through a metal detector at Newark International Airport. The search revealed a package hidden under defendant\u2019s shirt. It was wrapped in shiny greenish-tan packaging tape, and it was approximately 8.5 inches long, 4.5 inches wide, and 2 inches thick. Inside the outer wrapping, there were several layers of aluminum foil, which had set off the metal detector, and approximately 400 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Judge Ironson\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law sustaining the legality of the search are set forth in detail in his published opinion. <em>See State v. Ascencio, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 607 A.2d 1381 (Law Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">On appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">Point I The trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress because Officer Rea\u2019s opening of a sealed package was a warrantless search not within any lawful exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">Point II Because Officer Rea suspected the contents of the package to be drugs, he was required to seek a warrant prior to opening the package.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">Point III The trial court erred in imposing the presumptive term of 15 years with a 5-year parole ineligibility period on this young first time offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">We reject defendant\u2019s first two grounds of appeal substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Ironson in his published opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">We reject the defendant\u2019s third ground for appeal for the following reasons. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-5b(l) makes possession of <em>five </em>ounces or more of cocaine, including any adulterants or dilutants, a first degree offense punishable by ten to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment with parole ineligibility for between one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed. Defendant\u2019s presentence report, to which he took no exception at sentencing, reports that the \u201cextrapolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>net weight\u201d of the cocaine which he was carrying was 868.4 grams and the \u201cnet weight\u201d was 402.6 grams. There are 28.35 grams to the ounce. In other words, defendant was carrying 14.2 ounces if the lesser weight is considered and 30.63 ounces if the greater weight is considered. In our view, the quantity of cocaine which defendant possessed was more than sufficient to justify the presumptive term to which he was sentenced, even after giving appropriate consideration to his lack of any prior criminal record. The sentencing judge also properly considered as aggravating factors the need for deterrence and the concern that without a substantial prison term defendant and others would consider his punishment as merely part of the cost of doing business. We find no abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 401, 555 A.2d 559 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 364-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
