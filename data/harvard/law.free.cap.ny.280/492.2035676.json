Appellant urges that if afforded an opportunity he could refute some of the conclusions drawn from a consideration of the agreement between Malley and himself which was not introduced in evidence in the proceeding and which appellant, therefore, did not have an opportunity to meet or to explain. This may also have a bearing upon the extent of the punishment to be inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the matter remitted to the Appellate Division for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Crane, Ch.
