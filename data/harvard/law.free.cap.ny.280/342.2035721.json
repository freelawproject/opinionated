It appears from the pleadings and affidavits submitted on the motion that such property was not as matter of law so attached to and made a part of the building as to constitute fixtures. The intent that it should not be included within the coverage of the real estate mortgage could fairly be inferred by the fact that the contract of sale specifically provided for the execution and delivery of a separate chattel mortgage instrument covering that property as additional security for the payment of part of the purchase price of the realty, which chattel mortgage was, in fact, executed, delivered to and accepted by the plaintiff at the same time as the execution and delivery of the mortgage covering the real estate. <em>(Manufacturers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Peck-Schwartz Realty Corp., </em>277 N. Y. 283.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The order of the Appellate Division and the judgment of the Special Term should be reversed, with costs to the appellant in all courts, and the motion denied, with ten dollars costs. (See 280 N. Y. 814.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Crane, Ch. J., Lehman, O\u2019Brien, Hubbs, Loughran and Rippey, JJ., concur; Finch, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
