The court refused the defendant\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>to give binding instructions and submitted the case to the jury. It, however, failed to agree. Thereupon, defendant moved for judgment n. o. v., which the court refused and'granted a new trial. Following this the railroad took these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\"> Without discussing the facts or indicating any opinion on the defendant\u2019s motion, we regard the cases before us as appeals from the court\u2019s grant of a new trial. In the absence of abuse of discretion, which cannot be contended in these cases, and regarding them as appeals from the grant of a new trial, no appeal lies, and accordingly the appeals are dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
