Did the defendants violate sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and 1934? The sections involved are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Inasmuch as there is no question but that the findings and the conclusions of the District Judge support the decree, the precise question is over the evidentiary support of the said findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Our study of the evidence leaves us with no doubt as to the facts. They are too clear for justifiable disputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">The plaintiff complains of the defendants\u2019 action in the sale of stock in two companies, one the Paducah Cooperage Company, Inc., which will be referred to as the Paducah Co., and the other, the Wahl Co. The stock of the Paducah Co. was registered on the Chicago Curb Exchange and that of the Wahl Company was registered on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Both stock exchanges were registered under the Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">We will discuss merely the Paducah stock transactions, in which defendants dealt heavily.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">By December, \u201934, the Paducah Co. was financially embarrassed and laboring hard to keep afloat. It had that year lost nearly one-quarter of a million dollars. Its asserted net worth had shrunk to $30,000; its capital stock consisted of 250,000 shares. The book value of a share was 13%(\u00a3. Its actual value in the face of the year\u2019s record was probably considerably less than its asserted book value. There were threats of criminal prosecution arising out of the mismanagement of the company\u2019s affairs and a change of officerial management occurred in January, 1935. A profit for the next six months of approximately $6,000 was asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-19\">If the plaintiff\u2019s theory be accepted, and there is evidence to support its charge, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>was at this stage that defendants sought to \u201crig the market\u201d (by rigging is meant raising the market price of the stock by artificial means) and to unload its large holdings upon the public. On Koeppe Company\u2019s own admission, it, at the time, owned 17,000 shares of such stock and shortly afterward acquired 8,000 more. There is evidence to the effect that its total holdings largely exceeded this amount. The last 8,000 shares were acquired about this time at 25%0 per share. In August, 1935, the company made an oral contract with B. E. Buckman Company, a financial house operating in Wisconsin and located at Madison, to sell 45,000 shares of this stock at 650 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Beginning in August, 1935 and continuing for about three months, some 46,750 shares were traded in on the Chicago Curb Exchange. Over two-thirds of them were made by the defendant company through twelve different stock exchange houses or members of the New York Exchange. Most of this buying was in the name of Joseph Magner, nominee of Koeppe, and cleared through Sadler Company, then members of the Chicago Curb Exchange. Koeppe had been expelled from the Exchange for fraudulent conduct in 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">During this three months\u2019 period the. price was raised some 200%. There were many days when Koeppe &amp; Company made the closing trade for the day. The stock reached a high of 530 per share. Defendants stopped buying on or about October 24 and the price abruptly dropped to 300 a share and later reached a level of 30, which was its price at the time of the trial. The price at which defendants closed the day\u2019s transaction was usually a little higher than the preceding day. Defendants employed salesmen to sell the stock, other than through the stock exchange. Over-the-counter sales they were called, or private sales. A reported sale, which the defendants claim was an accident but which the plaintiff disputes, occurred on October 5. There were only fifty shares sold that day. The price was 730 a share. Defendants sold the 50 shares through one brokerage house and purchased the same through another brokerage house. The selling price was three cents higher than the closing price of the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Defendants in manipulating the price, employed one Geldermann to \u201ctout\u201d the stock (Wahl stock) to his friends, paying him $20 for every one hundred shares bought on the exchange market as a result of his recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">It seems Geldermann, who was by himself termed an independent dealer, bought a few shares and then as a holder, he would call up his friends and advise them to purchase this stock. He did not mention Koeppe or the arrangement he had for a commission'. If his friends bought, defendant Koeppe paid him a commission. Geldermann testified to the existence of the arrangement and to the receipt of commissions. He was clear on the facts, but had a somewhat confused understanding .of the difference between betraying and protecting a friend.'</p>\n<p id=\"Aq0i\">Three different witnesses testified that Koeppe told them th\u00e1t his purpose was to \u201cput the market up,\u201d to \u201cget the market up to a dollar or higher,\u201d and that he had cleared up by purchase \u201call the old cheap stock\u201d and that another brokerage concern had been contacted which would help distribute the Paducah stock at not less than a dollar a share. There was also, some direct testimony to the effect that Koeppe said the stock \u201cought to reflect a price of a dollar and a half or two dollars per share\u201d and that he had no \u201cquestion about being able to put it there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Koeppe testified that he did not intend to violate the Securities Act, but was merely filling orders for customers. His profession of innocence conflicted with his selling stock at times for no more or a little less than the closing price on the Chicago Curb the day before. It is hardly believable that he would hire a force of sales agents to drum up business for the sale of this stock when the price realized by him was less than the price he would have to pay on the Exchange for the same stock. (There was at least a commission charge for filling the orders.) The fact that defendant rid himself of 25,000 shares of stock which he held at the time he started the campaign (and which were worth not'more than 130 per share) at prices between 700 and 900, was, undoubtedly, a more persuasive fact with the court than defendant\u2019s protestations of innocence. The stock sales reported on the Chicago Curb gave an appearance of activity and an upward trend which made it possible for defendant company\u2019s salesmen to sell, at private sales, the large block of stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>which it possessed when the so-called campaign was on.</p>\n<p id=\"AQT\">Likewise, it is impossible to reconcile defendants\u2019 transactions with Geldermann with an innocent motive. The unconscionable action of Geldermann in recommending sales under the circumstances disclosed, is equalled only by the defendants\u2019 adoption of such methods in order to create the false appearance of activity in the stock and an eagerness on the part of the public to buy at constantly rising prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Not only does the evidence of disinterested witnesses condemn the action and the motive and intent of the defendants, but the transactions themselves, unsupported by oral testimony of witnesses, leave no doubt as to the defendants\u2019 intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Defendants insist that no injunction should be granted, however, because even though they may have erred in the past and violated the above-quoted sections of the Securities Act, they expressed a desire in the District Court and an intention to refrain henceforth from such practices. They came into court with a contrite heart and with the intention to forget and forgive if the Government would meet them half way.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Undoubtedly, courts will not and do not grant injunctions to prevent that which is unnecessary, but Judge Barnes who saw and heard the witnesses and observed Koeppe on the stand evidently disbelieves his profession of good intentions so willingly made as to future business transactions. Not only does the evidence justify the court\u2019s conclusion but it was the only one that can be reconciled with defendants\u2019 cold-blooded, deliberate effort to sell stock to innocent purchasers through the subterfuge of rigging the market and giving to it an appearance of activity which was false and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Some criticism is made of the Act itself, and to the provisions which condemn these practices. As to its wisdom we are not called upon to pass judgment. It may be that it will lessen market activities on the exchanges and defeat the successful flotation of securities like these by upsetting practices long followed. Our duty is limited to the construction and application of the Act, and our conclusion is that such tradings and \u201csuch acts or practices\u201d are against the clear and specific condemnations of the Securities Exchange Act. Nor will there be justifiable regret if the Act successfully prevents such practices even though market activities are thereby somewhat curtailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">The decree is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-11\"> Section 9 (a) (1) (2) (3), 15 U.S.O.
