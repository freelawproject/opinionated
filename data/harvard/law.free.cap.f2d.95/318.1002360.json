The car had been bought at some undisclosed time before 1934 for $1,825; on June 1st of that year it collided with another car and was so damaged that it was thereafter worth only $190; just before the collision it had been worth $225. The Commissioner allowed $35 as a loss \u2014 the difference between the value before the collision and after; the taxpayers claimed $1,635\u2014 the difference between the cost and the value after the collision. The Board ruled with the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Section 23(e) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(e) (3) \u2014 following the language of earlier acts \u2014 provided that losses \u201cof property not connected with the trade or business, if the loss arises from fires, storms, shipwreck or other casualty,\u201dmay be deducted; nobody disputes that collision is a \u201ccas\u00fcalty.\u201d Subsection (h) of section 23, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23 (h), declared that \u201cthe-basis for determining the amount of. deduction for losses sustained, to be allowed under subsection (e) or (f), shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 113 (b).\u201d Subsection (a) of section 113, 26 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 113.(a), declared that the \u201cunadjusted basis\u201d of property should be its cost; and subsection (b) (1) (B), section 113, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 113(b) (1) (B), that \u201cexhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion\u201d should be deducted from that \u201cunadjusted basis\u201d in cases when they were \u201callowed * * * under this Act.\u201d But section 23(0, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(Q allowed for exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence only in the case of \u201cproperty used in the trade \"or business\u201d; and on this account the respondents could not have claimed any deduction for wear and tear of the car during the years before 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> Verbally the conclusion is nevertheless inescapable that the \u201cadjusted basis\u201d was the same as the \u201cunadjusted,\u201d and was the original cost; and, even though this secures to the owner a deduction which he could not have claimed, had he quite' worn out the car without mishap, it may have been deliberately granted, for the destruction of property, still serviceable, often involves a greater loss to the owner than the money it would fetch on any market. Be that as it may, the letter is too pl\u00e1in; we should have to disregard the words, and should not be interpreting them, if we refused to take them just as they read. Colloquially, it is true, the whole loss was not \u201csustained in 1934, as required by section 23(e) ; but the earlier losses had never been \u201crealized\u201d in terms of money, and our income tax does not ordinarily \u201crecognize\u201d such losses; property used for convenience or pleasure, unlike business property, is no exception. The Treasury must take the bitter with the sweet; and just as increases in value do not increase the taxpayer\u2019s permissible deduction; (Pioneer Cooperage Co. v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 53 F.2d 43); so decreases should not decrease it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
