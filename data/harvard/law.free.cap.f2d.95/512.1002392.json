Upon appeal, his decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Patents, acting through an Assistant Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Appellant thereupon brought the matter to this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">No testimony was offered on behalf of appellant. O\u00f1 behalf of appellee a somewhat elaborate record consisting of testimony and various exhibits was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">As we view the case, the issue is a simple one which requires no elaborate discussion. Admittedly, the goods are of the same descriptive properties and the conclusion turns upon the similarity of the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">It is argued on behalf of appellant that its mark is dissimilar from the mark of appellee in that it consists of two words, the first of which has two sjdlables and the last of which, \u201cMist,\u201d differs in form and meaning from the suffix, \u201ckist,\u201d of appellee\u2019s one-word, two-syllable mark, \u201cSunkist.\u201d It is also said in appellant's brief: \u201cSince appellant\u2019s trade-mark is primarily used on grapefruit juices it may properly be construed to be suggestive of appellant\u2019s product. \u2018Mist\u2019 connotes moisture, and \u2018sunny\u2019 is colloquially interpreted to mean health, happiness, etc. Consequently, there is a decided difference in the meaning of appellant\u2019s and appellee\u2019s marks; in addition there is a difference in the so-called \u2018get up\u2019 of the two marks and in their use on labels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">Appellant also advances the somewhat novel argument that appellee\u2019s mark is so well and widely known that there would be little likelihood of confusion by the use of appellant\u2019s proposed mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-20\">In addition, there are cited a number of decisions by this and other courts where words bearing certain features of resemblance were held not to be confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-21\">All the arguments have been given respectful consideration, but we are unable to escape the conclusion that appellant\u2019s mark so closely simulates that of appellee as to bring it under the ban of the statutory provision, \u201cThat trade-marks which * * * so nearly resemble a registered or known trade-mark owned and inmse by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers shall not be registered.\u201d TradeMark Act 1905, \u00a7 5, as amended, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 85. In sound, unless very, very clearly enunciated, there is a similarity, and even in appearance there are points of resemblance, as, for example, the size of the first letter \u201cS\u201d in both marks. The \u201cSun\u201d portion of the marks is identical and, to our minds, there is in these cases a certain dominance, at least of meaning, or suggestiveness, in this prefix.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">Appellant directs attention to a quotation from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents in Ashland Refining Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>United Collieries, Inc., 20 U.S.Pat.Q. 171, 24 T.M.Rep. 68: \u201cThere is a practical objection to the practice of extending trade mark- protection too freely. It is extremely difficult today to adopt a mark that is new. * * * Over 300,000 trade marks are registered in the United States Patent Office and it has been estimated that only one out of five in actual use is registered. This would mean that over a million and a half trade marks are in use today, approximately three times as many as there are words in the English language. In view of rapidly advancing economic conditions care must be taken not to give to a trade mark an exaggerated scope of protection. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We do not attempt to interpret the meaning of the Commissioner in the foregoing, further than to say that evidently he did not regard it applicable in the instant case, and to add that we feel sure it was not intended by him to imply that closely resembling marks might be registered for application to merchandise of the same descriptive properties where confusion would likely result therefrom. That would be to disregard or nullify the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
