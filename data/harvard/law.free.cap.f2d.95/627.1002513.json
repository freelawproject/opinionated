Appellants\u2019 petition for review thereof was denied by the District Court in a written opinion October 29, 1937, and a formal order dismissing appellants\u2019 petition, and confirming the order of the referee was entered by the court November 16,1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-27\">Thereafter, and on November 26, 1937, appellants filed a petition for rehearing of their petition for review, which the court denied on December 20, 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-28\">On January 15, 1938, the court, at appellants\u2019 request, by formal order extended the time for appeal until February 15, 1938, saying therein \u201cthis is a final extension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-29\">On January 18, 1938, appellants filed with the clerk of the District Court a petition for appeal from the above-described order of December 20, 1937, and filed therewith an \u201cAssignment of Errors,\u201d setting forth fifteen reasons whereby they contended that said order was erroneous. The appeal was allowed by the District Court on January 18, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-30\">Upon the above record appellee moves to dismiss the appeal herein and appellants move for an order \u201cthat the motion of appellee be denied and dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-31\">The order of November 16, 1937 refusing to set aside and actually confirming the referee\u2019s order, stands without appeal therefrom, and the time within which an appeal might be taken therefrom expired December 17, 1937, section 24c of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-32\">We are without power to authorize or permit a change in the record so as to consider an appeal, which in fact was not taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-33\">The order of December 20, 1937, is not an appealable order. See Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 300 U.S. 131, 137, 57 S.Ct. 382, 385, 81 L.Ed. 557, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Appellants\u2019 motion must be denied. Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
