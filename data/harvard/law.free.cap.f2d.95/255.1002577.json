His structure is clearly set forth in the quoted claim, and need not be further described.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Counsel for appellant has clearly stated in his brief the advantages obtained by appellant\u2019s improved structure, and the reasons therefor. We quote: \u201cAppellant\u2019s device requires that all residues of the paste be returned into the tube. While in the tube the paste is secure against the ravages and devastating action of the atmosphere because the atmosphere is excluded by the compressible gasket being forced by the screw action of the cap down upon and into the openings. No air is therefore allowed access to the interior of the tube. In appellant\u2019s Figure 2 the gasket completely occupies the space within the screw cap. This is necessarily so because the gasket is of compressible material. When the screw cap is screwed down to the closed position the gasket is compressed between the top of the screw cap and the wall 16 of the tube neck. Thus the gasket tends to squeeze out at its edges but here it is confined by the outer wall of the screw cap. The gasket thereupon tends to expand inwardly but here it is confined by the pin or projection. Therefore the compressible gasket entirely fills all the space within the screw cap when that screw cap is screwed down to the closed position shown in Figure 2. There is no room here for the lodgment of any of the paste. All the paste must be forced back into the tube. In the tube it is within the sealing protection of the gasket as heretofore stated. The straight-walled pin , or projection snugly fits the openings in the gasket and screw cap right up to a flush position with the top of the cap. There is no room here for the lodgment of any of the paste.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The patent to Matzke relates to a closure for tubes, and discloses, among other things, a <em>cylindrical </em>or <em>\u201cstraight valve extension\u201d </em>on the neck of his tube, which fits into an aperture in the screw cap to close the tube. (Italics ours.) With reference thereto, the patentee stated: \u201c * * * in the closing of the tube closure a suitably shaped projection on the tube or on the neck of the tube enters the mouth opening of the closing cap and displaces and completely forces out the substance remaining behind in the mouth from the last extrusion so that this residual amount may be either at once or later with the amount earlier extruded whereby neither in the mouth opening nor on the closing cap after the closing of the latter is any substance left behind whereby to all disadvantageous consequences caused by the previous remaining behind of substance on the outside of the closure are entirely avoided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The patentee also stated that, instead of being cylindrical in shape, the valve extension might, if desired, be partially conical.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The patent to Behrman relates to collapsible tubes and screw caps therefor. The patentee disclosed a tube having an aperture in the center of the top of the screw cap which is closed by a conical plug within the neck'of the tube when the cap is screwed to a closed position. There are apertures shown in the neck of his tube to permit the flow of the contents of the tube into the screw cap. With reference to this patent, counsel for appellant spates that its operation and performance is much like appellant\u2019s screw cap and tube, except that when the cap is screwed down \u201cthere is no gasket to seal the upper ends of the channels between the legs of the spanner.\u201d (A gasket is disclosed in the patent to Baltzley.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The patent to Baltzley also relates to closures for tubes and the like, and discloses a structure similar to that of appellant, except for the shape of the valve extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">With reference to the Matzke and Baltzley patents, the Board of Appeals said: \u201cIn our opinion the claim on appeal does not patentably distinguish from the Baltzley patent, especially when this patent is considered in connection with the other references referred to. <em>Baltzley shows a tube which fully meets the terms of the claim, except possibly the limitation in line 4 to the effect that the valve extension is \u2019straight. The valve extension of Baltzley is cylindrical (which is what appellant means by straight) for a major portion of its length but the actual sealing takes place between the beveled edges at the end of this extension and a correspondingly beveled seat on the cap. </em>A further difference of no material importance relates to the uniform thickness of the top wall of the cap. Inasmuch as it is old in this art, as shown by the German patent to Matzke, <em>to make the valve extension of the tube neck cylindrical and close-fitting with respect to the aperture in the cap, </em>the limitation referred to is not sufficient to patentably distinguish the claim.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">It is not contended by the Solicitor for the Patent Office that appellant\u2019s structure ' is anticipated by any one of the three references, and the tribunals of the Patent Office did not so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The Board of Appeals held that the patent to Baltzley disclosed a tube on which the appealed claim reads, with the exception that the valve extension in the Baltzley disclosure is cylindrical or straight for but a major portion of its length but not at the point where the sealing of the tube is effected. It was held, however, that it would not amount to invention to substitute the cylindrical or straight valve extension, disclosed in the patent to Matzke, for the valve extension in the patent to Baltzley.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">At the time of the oral arguments in this court, counsel for appellant frankly stated that the real issue before us is whether it would involve invention to substitute the cylindrical valve extension of Matzke for the valve extension of Baltzley in the latter\u2019s structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">We are in agreement with counsel that appellant\u2019s structure is an improvement over the prior art. We are unable to agree, however, that, with the prior art' before him, it would require anything more than mechanical skill to substitute the cylindrical valve extension disclosed in the patent to Matzke for the valve extension of Baltzley in the latter\u2019s structure. We think that substitution would be sufficient to make the Baltzley structure conform to the appealed claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
