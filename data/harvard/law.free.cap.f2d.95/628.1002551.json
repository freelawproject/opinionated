We hold that there is ample evidence, including'testimony of witnesses of respondent, not only tending to show but rather bearing conviction that respondent acquired the land for the purpose of producing lettuce and with the definite intention of removing the trees in accordance with the program which he almost immediately carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
