Plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-28\">. The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff established these facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-29\">The public highway runs north and south. The paved portion was 20 feet in width. On both sides of the paved portion there were graveled shoulders. Snow plows had been over the road and the snow was shoved out to snow banks a distance of 14 feet on the east side and 19 feet on the west side of the highway. Plaintiff was traveling south in a Pontiac automobile. Between eight and eight-thirty P. M., at a point near Centerville, Utah, plaintiff\u2019s automobile collided with an Essex automobile traveling north with the result that the left front wheel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the knee action member were- torn off plaintiff\u2019s automobile and it was left standing facing southeasterly on the highway. The distance from the rear hub to the east edge of the pavement was 69 inches. The distance from the front portion of the frame to the edge of the pavement was 53 inches. The left door of plaintiff\u2019s automobile was jammed so that it could not be opened. Three young men were traveling in the Essex automobile. Immediately after the collision the plaintiff went back and met the young men. After ascertaining that none of the occupants of the Essex automobile had been injured the plaintiff instructed one of the young men to flag vehicles coming from the north. A Mr. Fennell was traveling south on the highway. One of the young men flagged him down. He passed around plaintiff\u2019s automobile and stopped a distance of about 50 feet south of it. It was snowing very hard and the pavement was icy and very slippery. One could see the headlights of an approaching automobile a distance of from 100 to 200 yards. The right headlight and the taillight of plaintiff\u2019s automobile were burning and the motor was running. Plaintiff and the other two young men tried to push his automobile off the pavement, but found it impossible so to do. Plaintiff then directed the two young men to go to the south and flag any automobiles approaching from that direction and stated he would turn off the ignition and stop the motor on his automobile because of the danger of explosion in the event -another automobile ran into it. The two young men went south to flag any approaching automobile and the plaintiff went around on the west side of his automobile, looked to the south and did not see any automobile approaching, opened the door, reached in and turned off the switch, and shut the door. As he turned about he saw the defendant\u2019s automobile approaching. The door of plaintiff\u2019s automobile opened from the front and it was necessary for plaintiff to turn toward the northwest as he reached for the door to close it. When he faced about it was too late to avoid defendant\u2019s automobile which struck him traveling at a speed estimated at between 15 and 25 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The automobile of the defendant being driven by its employee, Murakamy, a Japanese, approached plaintiff\u2019s automobile from the south. Fennell, by honking his horn and shouting a warning, and the two young men by waving their arms up and down, endeavored to warn defendant\u2019s driver and induce him to stop. Defendant\u2019s automobile was approaching at a speed of about 35 miles per hour. The driver thereof did not see plaintiff or his automobile and did not undertake to set his brakes until he was about 30 feet from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The issue of contributory negligence is ordinarily for the jury and it is only when there is no substantial conflict in the evidence which conditions it, and when, from the undisputed facts, reasonable men in the exercise of a fair judgment would be compelled to reach the same conclusion, that the court may properly withdraw it from the jury. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Plaintiff was confronted with an emergency. Mindful of the safety of others he determined to turn off the ignition on his automobile to avoid a possible explosion. He could not enter his automobile from the east side -because the door was.jammed. He sent the young men to flag any vehicle approaching from the south and then went around to the west side of his automobile, looked to the south, saw no approaching automobile, quickly opened the door and turned off the ignition, and as he turned about, after he had turned off the ignition and closed the door, he saw the approaching automobile of the defendant, when it was too late to avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">Bearing in mind that plaintiff was confronted with an emergency; that it was essential to the safety of other travelers that the ignition should be turned off and the motor stopped; that because the left hand door was jammed the automobile could only be entered from the right hand side; that plaintiff sent lookouts to stop any vehicle approaching from the south; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>that he looked to the south just before leaning into his automobile to turn off the ignition and did not see any approaching vehicle; and that he acted expeditiously, we are of the opinion that reasonable men in the exercise of a fair judgment might reach a different conclusion as to whether plaintiff failed to exercise that degree of care for his own safety, which a man of ordinary prudence under the same circumstances would have exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Accordingly the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to grant the plaintiff a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-5\"> Travelers\u2019 Insurance Company v.
