Res-Care, Inc. (\u201cRes-Care\u201d) appeals the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cClaims Court\u201d) interpreting the statute as permitting the United States Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) to select a contractor for the Blue Ridge Job Corps Center (\u201cBlue Ridge\u201d) program through a set-aside for small businesses. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Under WIA, DOL administers a national Job Corps program that provides education, training, and support services to help at-risk youth obtain employment. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2881, 2884. There are 125 Job Corps Centers (\u201cJCCs\u201d) across the nation, including Blue Ridge in Marion, Virginia, which Res-Care has operated since 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">In December 2011, DOL published a Sources Sought Notice for a Request for Information (the \u201cRequest\u201d) seeking information from potential bidders on an upcoming procurement for the operation of Blue Ridge. At the time, Res-Care was operating Blue Ridge under a contract that expired on March 31, 2013. The Request invited \u201c[a]ll interested parties\u201d to submit a response but specifically encouraged firms that qualify as small businesses to respond with a \u201ccapabilities statement\u201d that demonstrated their ability to operate the facility successfully. In response to the Request, one large business and four small businesses submitted capabilities statements. Res-Care, a large business, did not respond to the Request.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">Based on the responses, a DOL contracting officer found the large business and two of the four small businesses capable of operating Blue Ridge. In her review, the contracting officer considered twelve relevant areas of experience and the financial resources of each business. She specifically found that both small businesses were capable under <em>\u201call </em>of the capability areas identified in the [Request].\u201d J.A. 3063. In particular, she found that, based on the responses from the two capable small businesses, DOL would likely receive bids (1) from at least two responsible small businesses and (2) at fair market prices. Because both of these requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d), 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.502-2(b) (the so-called \u201cRule of Two\u201d), had been met, the contracting officer recommended conducting the Blue Ridge contract selection as a small business set-aside. DOL subsequently issued a presolicitation notice indicating that the next Blue Ridge contract, with a value of $25 million, would be solicited as a \u201c100% Set-Aside for Small Business\u201d for the two-year base period beginning April 1, 2013, with three unilateral option years.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">On April 18, 2012, Res-Care filed its bid protest with the Claims Court alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that DOL violated WIA by setting aside the Blue Ridge contract for small businesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 2887 of WIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>describes how entities are selected for managing JCCs. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2887(a)(2)(A). It provides that DOL shall select entities \u201con a competitive basis,\u201d but enumerates certain exceptions set forth in 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 3804(a)-(c) of the Competition in Contracting Act (\u201cCICA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The exceptions in \u00a7 3304(a)-(e) describe instances in which the government may award a contract on a noncompetitive basis. Res-Care argued that setting aside the Blue Ridge contract for small businesses violated the \u201ccompetitive basis\u201d provision in \u00a7 2887.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Before the Claims Court, Res-Care sought to supplement the administrative record with a declaration of its Executive Vice-President of Operations, Richard Myers (the \u201cfirst Myers declaration\u201d), and with a report entitled \u201cAnalysis of Small Business Contracting in Job Corps\u201d (the \u201cRell &amp; Doran Report\u201d). Based on assorted criteria, the report concluded that large businesses outperform small businesses in administering JCCs. The Claims Court denied Res-Care\u2019s request to supplement the administrative record with the Rell &amp; Do-ran Report but admitted the first Myers declaration for the sole purpose of evaluating whether Res-Care was entitled to injunctive relief. <em>Res-Care, Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 12-251 C, slip. op. at 1 (Fed.Cl. July 11, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Claims Court denied Res-Care\u2019s motion and granted the government\u2019s motion, dismissing the case. The court determined that the phrase \u201ccompetitive basis\u201d in WIA did not mean \u201cfull and open competition,\u201d reasoning that the ordinary meaning of the phrase simply requires two or more potential bidders to seek the contract award. <em>Res-Care, Inc. v. United States, </em>107 Fed.Cl. 136, 141-42 (2012). On that basis, the court concluded that WIA did not preclude small business set-asides in which two or more small businesses compete for a JCC contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The court also found that the contracting officer did not violate the Rule of Two in setting aside Blue Ridge for small businesses. <em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Res-Care now appeals to this court, reiterating its contention that WIA does not permit small business set-asides. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">We review the grant of a motion for judgment on the administrative record without deference. <em>Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed.Cir. 2005). The first question before this court is one of pure statutory interpretation: whether WIA\u2019s \u201ccompetitive basis\u201d language permits small business set-asides. Because the underlying issue is a question of statutory interpretation, it is also subject to review without deference. <em>Mudge v. United States, </em>308 F.3d 1220,1224 (Fed. Cir.2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-15\">The relevant language of \u00a7 2887 states: <em>Except as provided in subsections (a) to (c) of section 330b of Title bl, the Secre</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number><em>tary shall select on a competitive basis </em>an entity to operate a Job Corps center and entities to provide activities described in this subchapter to the Jobs Corps center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2887(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">When interpreting a statute, we begin our analysis with the language of the statute itself. <em>Info. Tech. &amp; Applications Corp. v. United States, </em>316 F.3d 1312, 1320 (Fed.Cir.2003). \u201cIf the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, then it controls, and we may not look to the agency regulation for further guidance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778). The meaning of the language is determined in the pertinent overall statutory context. <em>U.S. Nat\u2019l Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents, </em>508 U.S. 439, 455, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">To interpret the term \u201ccompetitive basis,\u201d we presume that the term has its ordinary and established meaning. <em>See Info. Tech., </em>316 F.3d at 1320. As WIA does not define \u201ccompetitive basis,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we may refer to dictionary definitions to determine the ordinary meaning of an undefined statutory term. <em>Id. </em>\u201cCompetitive\u201d is defined as \u201ccharacterized by, arising from, or designated to exhibit rivalry among two or more equally matched individuals or forces especially for a particular goal, position or reward,\u201d and as \u201cinvolving, or determined by competition.\u201d <em>See Res-Care, </em>107 Fed.Cl. at 141 (quoting Webster\u2019s II New Riverside Univ. Diet. 290 (1984)). \u201cCompetition\u201d means a \u201crivalry between two or more businesses striving for the same customers or market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither definition mandates an unencumbered contest open to the entire realm of all possible bidders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Authorized selection criteria may circumscribe the range of permitted rivals. Here, Congress clearly viewed the use of set-asides for small businesses as \u201ccompetitive\u201d as indicated by the CICA. <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303(b) (providing that \u201ccompetitive procedures\u201d shall be used for small business set-asides); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(4) (defining \u201ccompetitive procedures\u201d to include competition limited to further Small Business Act). A selection process confined to multiple small businesses bidding to operate a JCC thus satisfies the statutory \u201ccompetitive basis\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Res-Care argues for an alternate construction of this language. In Res-Care\u2019s view, WIA must be read in conjunction with CICA, which requires \u201cfull and open competition\u201d in the government procurement process, \u201c[ejxcept as provided in sections 3303, 3304(a), and 3305\u201d of Title 41. <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301(a)(1). Those three exceptions contemplate (1) a small business set-aside exception to CICA\u2019s \u201cfull and open competition\u201d requirement (\u00a7 3303(b)), (2) examples where the government may use \u201cnoncompetitive procedures\u201d (\u00a7 3304), and (3) simplified procedures for small purchases (\u00a7 3305). Because WIA\u2019s \u00a7 2887 incorporates only one \u201cexception\u201d from CICA (\u00a7 3304) and no others, such as \u00a7 3303(b)\u2019s authorization of small business set-asides, Res-Care argues that the plain meaning of WIA dictates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>\u00a7 8304 is the only exception allowed by the statute. Under that interpretation, DOL would lack the flexibility and discretion to use small business set-asides in administering WIA and instead must always hold full, open, and unfettered competition among all possible competitors\u2014 except in the very special cases when \u00a7 3304 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">WIA\u2019s plain language, however, requires rejection of Res-Care\u2019s argument. In \u00a7 2887, Congress did not borrow the \u201cfull and open competition\u201d phrase from CICA. Instead, \u00a7 2887 simply states that selection of a JCC contractor shall occur \u201con a competitive basis.\u201d A cardinal doctrine of statutory interpretation is the presumption that Congress\u2019s \u201cuse of different terms within related statutes generally implies that different meanings were intended.\u201d 2A Norman Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06 (7th ed.2007); <em>see, e.g., Daw Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>714 F.2d 1140, 1143 (Fed.Cir.1983) (\u201cThe congressional choice of words has a further and more significant consequence.... Congress\u2019 choice of the different term suggests an intentional difference in meaning.\u201d). Here, we must presume that Congress understood the difference between expressions of a particularized form of competition, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cfull and open,\u201d versus the broader notion represented by \u201ccompetitive basis.\u201d Had Congress intended JCC contractors to be selected solely by \u201cfull and open competition,\u201d it knew how to use those words and could have done so. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Res-Care contends that the Claims Court\u2019s \u2014 and our \u2014 interpretation of WIA permits all of CICA\u2019s exception provisions to apply to WIA and, thus, renders superfluous \u00a7 2887\u2019s reference to \u00a7 3304 from CICA. That argument again conflates WIA\u2019s and CICA\u2019s different structures and language. While it is true that \u00a7 2887 refers to one provision in CICA, there is no reason to read any other provision of CICA into \u00a7 2887 in the way Res-Care advocates. By its terms, \u00a7 2887 is straightforward: selections shall be made on a \u201ccompetitive basis,\u201d except in the special situations where the \u201cnoncompetitive procedures\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3304 of CICA apply. The reference to \u00a7 3304 is not mere surplusage. It demonstrates Congress\u2019s intent to ensure DOL had the flexibility to use a noncompetitive selection process in certain defined situations. Without the \u00a7 3304 reference, DOL\u2019s selections under WIA would always have to be performed through some form of competition. With this understanding, it becomes apparent that \u00a7 2887\u2019s reference to \u00a7 3304 is not at all superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The legislative history offers no support for Res-Care\u2019s position. As an initial matter, we note that if the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, then that is controlling. <em>Indian Harbor Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>704 F.3d 949, 950 (Fed.Cir. 2013). To overcome the plain meaning of a statute, a party must show that the legislative history demonstrates an \u201cextraordinary showing of contrary intentions.\u201d <em>Garcia v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 70, 75,105 S.Ct. 479, 83 L.Ed.2d 472 (1984) (cautioning that resort to legislative history to interpret an unambiguous statute should only occur in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances\u201d). The legislative history of WIA contains no discussion of any specialized meaning of \u201ccompetitive basis,\u201d and Res-Care points to nothing in the history demanding or even implying as much. We find nothing in the legislative history that suggests any intent to bar the widespread, established government practice of small business set-asides for this particular category of government contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">We therefore conclude that the Claims Court properly construed \u00a7 2887(a)(2)(A) to provide DOL the flexibility to use small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>business set-asides for selecting JCC operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Res-Care also argues that the DOL contracting officer violated the Rule of Two when setting aside Blue Ridge, and thus the Claims Court erred in granting judgment to the government. When reviewing a contracting officer\u2019s decision in a preaward bid protest, the Claims Court applies the standards established by the Administrative Procedure Act to decide whether the agency\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; <em>see also Advanced Data Concepts, Inc. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1054, 1057 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\"> On appeal of the Claims Court\u2019s judgment on the administrative record, we reapply the deferential \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard to the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Advanced Data, </em>216 F.3d at 1057. This standard requires us to sustain DOL\u2019s set-aside if it evinces rational reasoning and consideration of relevant factors. <em>See id. </em>at 1057-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Before setting aside a contract for small business participation under the Rule of Two, the Federal Acquisition Regulations require that a contracting officer shall determine that a reasonable expectation exists that \u201cat least two responsible small business concerns\u201d will submit offers and that an \u201caward will be made at fair market prices.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.502-2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">DOL, as a federal procurement entity, has \u201cbroad discretion to determine what particular method of procurement will be in the best interests of the United States in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Tyler Const. Grp. v. United States, </em>570 F.3d 1329, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2009). A contracting officer\u2019s decision to set aside a contract for small businesses invokes \u201chighly deferential rational basis review.\u201d <em>Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States, </em>575 F.3d 1352, 1368-69 (Fed.Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Here, the contracting officer reviewed the submissions from potential contractors against twelve \u201ccapability requirements\u201d identified in the Request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Applying the first factor of the Rule of Two, she determined that two responding small businesses were \u201ccapable under <em>all </em>of the capability criteria identified in the [Request],\u201d and no documentation indicated that either business had \u201cquestionable past performance or capacity issues.\u201d J.A. 3063. The contracting officer also noted that both businesses had submitted past offers at fair market prices for similar work operating other JCCs and had continued to perform those contracts under the fair market prices offered. <em>Id. </em>Based on these findings, she concluded that a reasonable expectation existed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>the Blue Ridge award would be made at fair market prices. We find no abuse of discretion in the contracting officer\u2019s thorough analysis of the submitted materials or her application of the Rule of Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Finally, Res-Care contends that it should have been able to supplement the administrative record with declarations and the Rell <em>&amp; </em>Doran Report. The ability to supplement the administrative record before the Claims Court is a limited one. <em>Axiom Res. Mgmt., Inc. v. United States, </em>564 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2009). In this particular instance, we simply note that none of the opaque and overly generalized extra-record evidence helps Res-Care\u2019s cause. It does not contain any negative performance data about the two small businesses that satisfied the Rule of Two. As the Claims Court stated, whether other small businesses, as a general class, performed at lower levels than larger firms has no bearing on the question of whether the contracting officer used appropriate criteria or properly assessed the capabilities of the identified small businesses against those criteria. <em>See ReS-Care, </em>107 Fed.Cl. at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-10\">. Using the North American Industry Classification System (\"NAICS\u201d), the contracting officer designated the Blue Ridge contract under NAICS code 611519. NAICS codes are used for classifying economic activities or industries according to size and revenue. Under NAICS code 611519, Blue Ridge could be awarded only to businesses with annual receipts under $35.5 million. Res-Care's annu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>al receipts exceed this cap, and therefore, Res-Care could not compete for the Blue Ridge contract under the set-aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A1Q\">. In its motion, Res-Care sought to supplement the administrative record with a second declaration of Richard Myers (the \"second Myers declaration\"), which the Claims Court denied. <em>Res-Care, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>107 Fed.Cl. 136, 138 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ApAZ\">. In the alternative, the court determined that, if WIA was unclear, DOL was entitled to deference in construing WIA as permitting small business set-asides under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Res-Care, </em>107 Fed.Cl. at 142. Because we find \u00a7 2887 unambiguous, we do not reach this alternative ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. CICA also does not define \"competitive basis\u201d but provides a definition for \"competitive basis procedures\u201d in the context of \"an individual purchase of property or services\u201d made under a multiple-award contract. <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302(c)(2). That definition sheds no light on the issue before us, and neither party relies on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b889-12\">. We see no merit in Res-Care\u2019s argument that the list of \u201celigible entities\u201d for operating a JCC in \u00a7 2887(a)(1) suggests that DOL must always hold a full and open competition for selecting an operator to all entities who are eligible. As explained above, the \"selection process\u201d set forth in \u00a7 2887(a)(2) only requires it to be on \"a competitive basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">.
