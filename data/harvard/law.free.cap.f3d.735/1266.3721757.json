Previously, we remanded this case for the limited purpose of determining whether the parties are completely diverse. But Travaglio never responded with evidence of her citizenship. Because we cannot determine whether jurisdiction exists on the record before us, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Travaglio\u2019s complaint on the merits and remand with instructions that this case be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-25\">Travaglio sued several companies alleging they engaged in deception, fraud, and conspiracy in violation of Florida law based on actions they took after she was in a car wreck while on vacation. She asserted subject matter jurisdiction was proper solely based upon diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). But in her complaint, Travaglio failed to allege anything about the citizenship of several of the defendants and only alleged that she was a \u201cresident of the State of Florida.\u201d Upon the defendants\u2019 motions, the district court dismissed Travaglio\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-26\">Travaglio appealed. After examining her complaint, we issued a jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>question asking the parties whether the allegations of citizenship were deficient and, if so, whether amendment of the complaint was necessary. <em>See Mas v. Perry, </em>489 F.2d 1396, 1399 (5th Cir.1974) (\u201cFor diversity purposes, citizenship means domicile; mere residence in the State is not sufficient.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants responded, conceding Travaglio inadequately pleaded jurisdiction but asserting there was record evidence from which we could discern that the requirement of complete diversity was met. Specifically, they pointed us to securities filings and affidavits in the record they claimed established each defendant\u2019s citizenship. And they claimed an assertion in Travaglio\u2019s brief opposing the motions to dismiss adequately demonstrated that she was domiciled in Florida. Travaglio did not respond and did not move to amend her complaint. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653 (\u201cDefective allegations of jurisdiction may be amended ... in the ... appellate courts..\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">After reviewing the defendants\u2019 responses, we concluded the allegations of citizenship were \u201cfatally deficient\u201d and that \u201cnothing in the record ha[d] been called to our attention\u201d that adequately demonstrated the parties were completely diverse. For that reason, we remanded to permit the district court to make jurisdictional findings. On remand, the district court ordered Travaglio to respond to the jurisdictional deficiencies we identified in her complaint. When Travaglio once again did not respond, the court scheduled a teleconference, but neither Travaglio nor her counsel participated. Nonetheless, the district court found that, \u201cwhen the record is considered in its entirety, ... Travaglio is completely diverse from\u201d the defendants. The basis for this conclusion was the same statement from Travaglio\u2019s brief to which the defendants had referred us, which reads in full: \u201cPlaintiffs primary residence was, and still is, Florida, although plaintiff maintained a temporary residence in Ohio.\u201d We now review whether the court\u2019s findings remedy the jurisdictional deficiency in Travaglio\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law we review <em>de novo. RESGA Cobblestone, LLC v. Blake Constr. &amp; Dev., LLC, </em>718 F.3d 1308, 1313-14 (11th Cir.2013). When a plaintiff files suit in federal court, she must allege facts that, if true, show federal subject matter jurisdiction over her case exists. <em>Taylor v. Appleton, </em>30 F.3d 1365, 1367 (11th Cir.1994). Those allegations, when federal jurisdiction is invoked based upon diversity, must include the citizenship of each party, so that the court is satisfied that no plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as any defendant. <em>Triggs v. John Crump Toyota, Inc., </em>154 F.3d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cDiversity jurisdiction requires complete diversity; every plaintiff must be diverse from every defendant.\u201d). Without such allegations, district courts are constitutionally obligated to dismiss the action altogether if the plaintiff does not cure the deficiency. <em>Stanley v. C.I.A., </em>639 F.2d 1146, 1159 (5th Cir. Unit B Mar.1981);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also DiMaio v. Democratic Nat\u2019l Comm., </em>520 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere dismissal can be based on lack of subject. matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, the court should dismiss on <em>only </em>the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>grounds.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). That is, if a complaint\u2019s factual allegations do not assure the court it has subject matter jurisdiction, then the court is without power to do anything in the case. <em>See Goodman ex rel. Goodman v. Sipos, </em>259 F.3d 1327, 1331, n. 6 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c \u2018[A district] court must dismiss a case without ever reaching the merits if it concludes that it has no jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Capitol Leasing Co. v. FDIC, </em>999 F.2d 188, 191 (7th Cir.1993))); <em>see also Belleri v. United States, </em>712 F.3d 543, 547 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cWe may not consider the merits of [a] complaint unless and until we are assured of our subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Yet we need not vacate a decision on the merits if the evidence submitted during the course of the proceedings cures any jurisdictional pleading deficiency by convincing us of the parties\u2019 citizenship. <em>Sun Printing &amp; Publ\u2019g Ass\u2019n v. Edwards, </em>194 U.S. 377, 382, 24 S.Ct. 696, 48 L.Ed. 1027 (1904) (\u201cThe whole record ... may be looked to, for the purpose of curing a defective averment of citizenship, where jurisdiction in a Federal court is asserted to depend upon diversity of citizenship .... \u201d); <em>see also Molinos Valle Del Cibao, C. por A. v. Lama, </em>633 F.3d 1330, 1342 n. 12 (11th Cir.2011) (permitting \u201cadmissions and record evidence to cure [a] pleading defect\u201d as to citizenship). If such evidence is lacking, however, we are obligated by the restrictions Article III places upon us to vacate a judgment without any examination of its correctness. <em>See Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London v. Osting-Schwinn, </em>613 F.3d 1079, 1092-93 (11th Cir.2010). Where, as here, a district court has made jurisdictional factfindings of the parties\u2019 citizenships, we review them for clear error. <em>Ambrosia Coal &amp; Constr. Co. v. Pages Morales, </em>482 F.3d 1309, 1313 (11th Cir.2007). A finding is clearly erroneous if the record lacks substantial evidence to support it. <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">As we indicated in remanding this case for jurisdictional findings, the allegations in Travaglio\u2019s complaint about her citizenship are fatally defective. Residence alone is not enough. <em>Denny v. Pironi, </em>141 U.S. 121, 123, 11 S.Ct. 966, 35 L.Ed. 657 (1891); <em>Taylor, </em>30 F.3d at 1367 (\u201cCitizenship, not residence, is the key fact that must be alleged in the complaint to establish diversity for a natural person;\u201d). \u201cCitizenship is equivalent to \u2018domicile\u2019 for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.\u201d <em>McCormick v. Aderholt, </em>293 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2002). And domicile requires both residence in a state and \u201can intention to remain there indefinitely....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">The only support for the district court\u2019s finding that Travaglio is a Florida citizen was her statement in her brief opposing the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss that her \u201cprimary residence was, and still is, Florida, although\u201d she also had \u201ca temporary residence in Ohio.\u201d But a sentence in an unsworn brief is not evidence. We did not find the statement adequate when we remanded for findings on jurisdiction, and we do not find it adequate now. Even if an assertion of primary residence by itself could suffice, we have never held that an unsworn statement in a brief, alone, can demonstrate a party\u2019s citizenship for purposes of establishing diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">Nor could we so hold. First, to find defective jurisdictional allegations could be cured based exclusively on a plaintiffs self-serving argument about her own citizenship in a brief would be tantamount to permitting her to create jurisdiction simply by saying so. And it is funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>mental that parties may not stipulate to federal jurisdiction. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.2013). Second, to affirm based solely on Travaglio\u2019s unsworn statement would be entirely inconsistent with the standard of review. \u201cStatements by counsel in briefs are not evidence,\u201d <em>Skyline Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>613 F.2d 1328, 1337 (5th Cir.1980), and a finding is clearly erroneous if substantial evidence does not support it, <em>Arthur, </em>452 F.3d at 1243. Critically, and in the same vein, we consistently have required some <em>evidence </em>to assure us jurisdiction exists before we will ignore defective jurisdictional allegations that the plaintiff does not amend. <em>E.g., Williams v. Best Buy Co., </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cWhere the pleadings are inadequate, [federal courts] may review the record to find <em>evidence </em>that diversity jurisdiction exists.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">As the district court noted, in <em>Molinos Valle Del Cibao </em>we did consider a defendant\u2019s admission of his citizenship in his answer to the complaint in concluding there was enough evidence of diversity to overcome a poorly pleaded complaint. 633 F.3d at 1342. But we expressly relied both on the \u201cadmissions <em>and record evidence </em>to cure [the] pleading defect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342 n. 12 (emphasis added). In that case, the defendant\u2019s admission in his answer sharpened the inferences drawn from the several pieces of admissible evidence we catalogued that indicated his citizenship. <em>Id. </em>at 1342. Further, the admission \u201ccarried] evidentiary weight\u201d because it was against the defendant\u2019s interest to concede he was diverse. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, we noted, \u201c[c]ourts generally give little weight to a party\u2019s profession of domicile,\u201d because, as was true of what Travaglio said in her brief, \u201cthese declarations are often self-serving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nothing in that opinion suggests an unsworn admission, especially when it is merely an offhanded argument in a brief, may by itself provide sufficient evidence of a party\u2019s citizenship to cure a jurisdictional pleading deficiency. Unsworn statements were not, alone, enough in that case and cannot be, alone, enough in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">In short, the only statement in the record that arguably could be read to demonstrate Travaglio\u2019s citizenship is an unsworn statement in a brief. Because that statement is not evidence, we cannot rely solely upon it to decide that subject matter jurisdiction exists. As a result, we cannot agree that there is adequate evidence in the \u25a0 record to overcome Travaglio\u2019s deficient jurisdictional pleadings. Therefore, we vacate the dismissal of Travaglio\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim and remand this case with instructions that the district court dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">VACATED in part and REMANDED with instructions; AFFIRMED in part.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (era <em>banc), </em>w.e adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">.

In addition to dismissing Travaglio's claims against the Bank of Newport for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the district court also dismissed those claims for want of personal jurisdiction. Because Travaglio does not mention that ruling in her brief at all, and because this case is due to be dismissed in its entirety for want of jurisdiction, we AFFIRM that dismissal. <em>See Ivy v. Ford Motor Co., </em>646 F.3d 769, 773 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
