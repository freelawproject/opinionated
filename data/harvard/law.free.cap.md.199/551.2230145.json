Zoning regulations applicable to these properties were adopted on April 20, 1948 and again on February 15, 1949. These properties were zoned as \u201cCottage Residential\u201d. Of six zones provided for, the \u201cCottage Residential\u201d is the highest, most restricted zone. In it \u201cthe following uses are permitted: Single or two-family dwellings. \u2014 Schools or churches. \u2014 Public buildings; \u2014 Home occupations and professional offices, providing that such an occupancy does not usurp a structure\u2019s primary use as a dwelling. \u2014 Accessory buildings to any of the above uses.\u201d A regulation provides, \u201cSigns advertising professional offices or home occupations may not exceed two square feet in area.\u201d Defendants do not question the validity of the act or the regulations or claim any right to. a non-conforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The bill alleged that defendants \u201care engaged on [their] lot * * * in the business [a] of transporting for profit * * * fishing parties and (b) of selling for profit live crabs, peelers, soft crabs, minnows, fish and bait, all in * * * violation of said zoning act and the regulations * * * thereunder\u201d; and also \u201cthat practically all of the numerous people who have become patrons of * * * defendants drive upon [defendants\u2019] lot * * * in automobiles ; that the roadway on * * * defendants\u2019 * * * property used by said patrons is not surfaced * * * and all of said automobiles stop, start, back and turn within approximately seven feet of the bedrooms in [plaintiffs\u2019] house * * *; that the driving, stopping, starting, backing and turning of said automobiles produces not only clouds of dust but also fumes and gases which infiltrate the bedrooms and said home of [plaintiffs]' to such an extent that they are denied the peaceful use and comfortable possession thereof\u201d; and also \u201cthat * * * defendants employ in the operation of their said business two motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>launches, four row boats and a number of live boxes; * * * when defendants * * * made repairs to their said equipment, the discarded materials, consisting of boards with protruding nails and other refuse, was dumped overboard by them; <em>* * </em>* the bulk of said discarded material and refuse washed up on the beach of [plaintiffs\u2019] lot * * *, and * * * it became necessary for [plaintiffs] to remove [it]; * * * since some of said refuse material has become submerged and is not discernible through ordinary inspection, the use of [plaintiffs\u2019] bathing beach * * * has become hazardous and dangerous.\u201d The bill prayed an injunction against [a] use by defendants of their premises or any part thereof \u201cfor the sale of crabs, fish, bait and oysters or for any other commercial use, including the transportation of fishing parties, not permitted\u201d by the Anne Arundel County zoning act and the regulations thereunder and [b] \u201ccontinuing and perpetuating the nuisances described and set forth in the bill * * The answer denied \u201cthat defendants engage on said lot in the business of transporting fishing parties for profit, or selling for profit crabs, peelers, minnows, fish or bait\u201d and alleged that \u201cthe people they have taken out on fishing parties have never paid them anything; * * * they do not fish commercially but only for sport, and with hook and line and not with nets, and only on a comparatively few occasions, when they made an excessive catch, did they dispose of the excess, not to the general public, but to neighbors, and not for market price but for a nominal sum\u201d. \u201cThey say that nobody comes to defendants\u2019 premises at any point near plaintiffs\u2019 premises other than defendants\u2019 friends and there is no space in which to park more than two cars, that nobody comes during the week, and only a few people on some week ends. * * * the so called \u2018customers\u2019 who come to defendants' premises do not drive by plaintiffs\u2019 premises at all, and park about two hundred feet from plaintiffs\u2019 home.\u201d Defendants deny throwing refuse overboard, say they have two small children who would be injured by doing so, and say that refuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>which plaintiffs complain comes from plaintiffs\u2019 own wharf and live box. Mr. Snyder\u2019s testimony shows that some of these denials in the answer are not true, <em>e.g., </em>denial that he \u201csold for profit crabs, peelers, minnows, fish or bait\u201d, and assertions that \u201cthe people he had taken out on fishing parties had never paid him anything\u201d and that \u201conly on a comparatively few occasions when he made an excessive catch, did he dispose of the excess, not to the general public but to neighbors, and not for the market price, but for a nominal sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Apart from zoning questions, plaintiffs\u2019 charges of nuisances call for little discussion. Strange to say, at the hearing and in this court the principal nuisance complained of was one not mentioned in the bill, viz., disturbance of sleep by noises from automobiles and other sources in connection with the arrival and departure of fishing parties at three or four o\u2019clock in the morning. Most of the nuisance charges seem exaggerated and improbable on their face. All presented questions of fact. The trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, decided these questions of fact against plaintiffs. In so doing he was not clearly wrong; we think he was right. We shall only add that the instant case, both the charges and the facts, falls far short of <em>Fox v. Ewers, </em>195 Md. 650, 75 A. 2d 357, in which trucks at the plaintiffs\u2019 bedroom window were held a nuisance, <em>Green v. Garrett, </em>192 Md. 52, 63 A. 2d 326, the baseball case, or <em>Five Oaks Corporation v. Gathmann, </em>190 Md. 348, 58 A. 2d 656, a restaurant case, in which latter cases noise and other annoyance caused by attracting a metropolitan or suburban crowd for amusement at hours when neighbors preferred to sleep, were held nuisances.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">On the zoning questions defendants\u2019 contention, which was sustained by the court, is that their commercial maritime activities (if they are commercial), both the fishing parties and the sale of crabs, peelers and bait are \u201chome occupations\u201d permitted by the regulations. These questions are essentially questions of law as to the meaning of \u201chome occupations\u201d. We must construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>this term and apply our construction to what defendants have done and are doing, regardless of the names they apply to their acts. Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, except their two brothers, one of them their counsel, were the defendant Mr. Snyder and friends or associates of his. The witnesses were not always candid \u2014 Judge Clark did not find them candid \u2014 but there are no important conflicts of testimony (except as to nuisance questions) other than some conflicts between what was first denied and later admitted. If defendants\u2019 activities are not clearly stated in the testimony of themselves and their friends and associates, they are readily inferrable therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Mr. Snyder\u2019s own position is two-fold, (1) he admits sales \u2014 and advertising signs which he could not deny\u2014 of \u201chard crabs\u201d, \u201cpeelers\u201d and \u201cbait\u201d, but minimizes the amount of such transactions, (2) he says he does not fish commercially, only for sport, and his fishing parties were confined to \u201cfriends\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Regarding his occupation and his fishing parties, Mr. Snyder testified, \u201cQ. Mr. Snyder, what do you do? A. I forgot to mention I crabbed. I caught some crabs. Q. What do you do with the crabs? A. I ketch crabs whenever I can catch crabs. I don\u2019t always bring them home. I bring them home and put them in the live box. If anybody wants to buy any, I will sell them. Q. You do sell crabs? A. Occasionally when I have them. I don\u2019t always have them. I don\u2019t have any crabs now. Q. You do have signs advertising crabs, don\u2019t you? A. That\u2019s right. Q. You have one in the front of your property and one on the opposite end of the property? A. That\u2019s right. Q. What else do you do in your spare tim\u00e9? A. Well, I go fishing when the fish are biting. I fish with a hook. Q. With whom do you go fishing? A. Well I go fishing lots of times by myself; sometimes I go with my boy; sometimes I take my father; sometimes my father\u2019s friends; sometimes my friends; sometimes relatives\u2019 friends. Q. How often is that? A. Well this year I may have went, so far this season, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>may have went fishing ten or twelve times off-hand. * * * Q. What do you use that boat for, Mr. Synder: A. I use that boat for my own pleasure, fishing with a hook and line. Q. Do you take anybody with you when you go out? A. Yes. Sometimes I go by myself; sometimes I take somebody. Q. How often during the week do you go? A. Well it all depends. Sometimes I don\u2019t go any. I haven\u2019t went fishing for three weeks. Q. You were fishing quite often prior to that thought, wern\u2019t you? A. For two weeks this season, I fished. Q. How about June, did you have Mr. Collins out in June? A. I went fishing the last part of June I think. Q. When you go out, how many people do you take with you? A. Like I told you \u2014 sometimes I go myself, sometimes I take one, may take my boy, my father \u2014 (Court) Do any of them pay you any thing? (Witness) They chip in and pay me for my trouble, expenses and gas and all. (Court) That\u2019s what I want to know about \u2014 this chipping in business. How much do they chip in? (Witness) Well they chip in sometimes two dollars, sometimes five dollars. I have gotten as high as thirty dollars. When they catch a lot of fish, the fellows feel good. (Court) What is your charge? (Witness) I don\u2019t charge anything for my boat. Q. Isn\u2019t it true Mr. Snyder, that you charge ($5.00) Dollars a piece for people you take out. A. No, sir, absolutely not. Q. How do you determine your expenses then when you come in? A. I don\u2019t determine any expenses. A lot of fellows I take out for nothing, absolutely nothing. They don\u2019t pay me a penny. Q. How do they come to get to your place? A. Well, they are all friends of mine. Everyone that goes fishing. Q. What do you mean by friends \u2014 tell us who your friends are? A. Well, I have some friends, people that have known me ever since I was ten \u2014 twelve years old. They come down and go fishing with me.\u201d He then testified, in response to questions by the court, \u201cQ. Well you would starve to death if you did it that way. You have a boat there. You have to make a living. A. I make a living. Q. You don\u2019t make a. living with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>boat. A. No sir. Q. But you have to make a living somehow. A. Yes, sir. Q. Do you want me to understand that any time a friend comes along that you just get in your boat and stay out as long as he feels like staying. A. I stay as long as I want to stay, your Honor. Q. And you don\u2019t make him any charges at all? A. No sir. Q. Well how do you find time to make a living then? A. I make a living. I am a carpenter by trade. Q. Well how can you work at your trade when you are out on the river fishing? A. Well I go crabbing. I catch crabs. Q. Well nobody pays you for working at carpentry when you are out on the river doing that? A. No sir, but I still crab. I make money crabbing. I catch crabs and sell them. I never could make a living by taking what people offered me. If I depended on people just chipping in to pay me I would have starved to death.\u201d Previously he had found it difficult to say just what his occupation was. \u201cQ. Are you employed now Mr. Snyder? A. Well I am always employed off and on. Q. Where? A. In all different places. I do all kinds of work. Q. Where? A. All different places. Q. Would you mind telling us some of the places? A. Well, I may go down the river a certain ways and repair a boat, or anybody who may want a boat repaired, I am a boat mechanic; I am a motor mechanic; I may fix a man\u2019s car; I am a carpenter; I am a boatbuilder; I work in a boatyard. Q. For whom did you work last week? A. Last week I was working for myself, drawing up plans to build three runabout boats. * * * Q. You are working on plans to build three runabouts? A. Drawing plans. Q. What do you propose to do with these runabouts? [Objection] (Court) Overruled. The question is, what he is getting at in an indirect way, is to show that this man hasn\u2019t got any regular job. A. One of them I am going to use and my boy\u2019s gonna use one, just for pleasure and running around the river, like I did before; I may use them myself for a season; then I will sell them if anybody would want to buy one. Q. So you propose to engage on that property in the building of boats? A. No. Well for these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>boats, yes. * * * Q. Did you do any other work in 1951? A. Well I do so many little jobs, I can\u2019t remember where they are, the people\u2019s names. I am sort of a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019. I know a lot of people and I may do a job and forget it tomorrow.\u201d Later he testified that he had taken out \u201cI guess\u201d twelve fishing parties in the 1951 season (before the trial, which began on August 16th) and \u201cmaybe\u201d twenty-five in the 1950 season. He testified, \u201cI never made any profit on it\u201d. Contrary to the averments of his answer, he testified that when he had a large catch of fish he did not sell it to neighbors, but took it to the market, that in 1951 he had sold about sixty cents worth of fish on the premises, about two hundred dollars worth off the premises, in 1950 about fifteen dollars worth on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">There is no evidence that he advertised fishing parties. No one was identified as one of the \u201cpeople that have known him ever since he was ten or twelve years old\u201d. It is a fair inference that anyone known to him as interested in fishing parties \u2014 and willing to \u201cchip in and pay him for his trouble, expenses and gas and all\u201d \u2014 was sufficiently qualified as a \u201cfriend\u201d to go on such parties. Mrs. Snyder testified that \u201cit takes a lot of money to maintain the boat and buy gas and he loves to fish and he is just tickled when somebody offers him money for gas\u201d. One of defendants\u2019 neighbors, who has gone on fishing parties with Mr. Snyder, testified, \u201cQ. But you just live there and you have gone out to help Snyder catch fish so you can sell them in the morning? A. Yes. I wasn\u2019t paid like a regular fishing party; I just chipped in and helped pay expenses. Q. What do you mean by expenses. A. Gas, oil, beer, food. (Court) How much did you chip in? (Witness) One time two dollars; another time three. * * * Q. All those fellows go out and help catch fish in order to sell them at the market? A. Well we catch 300 fish, who\u2019s going to take them? I take home enough to eat and let Mr. Snyder have the rest.\u201d Mr. Snyder is not a \u201cgentleman of leisure\u201d able to live without working. It is evident that when he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>crabbing, or fishing, to the extent that he crabs and fishes, that is his occupation for the time being. Whether he calls it \u201cfishing commercially\u201d or \u201cfishing for sport\u201d, and whether he calls his return \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201cpayment for his <em>trouble le.g., </em>his time and earning capacity], expenses and gas and all\u201d, it is a commercial undertaking and what he gets is compensation for work at his occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Mr. Snyder testified that he has five live boxes, three in the water and two smaller ones; they will hold altogether \u201cmaybe sixty dozen\u201d; he usually has about fifty to sixty dozen crabs. Ninety-five per cent of the people who come to buy crabs come in row boats. Sometimes he sells fish' by the pound, sometimes by what lie thinks they weigh. He has two scales; when people come in to buy fish, he uses either scale; the customers want to know just how much money to give him. At the end of Mr. Snyder\u2019s testimony, Judge Clarke remarked, \u201cIt is not my fault if he has been vague.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Mrs. Snyder testified that most of defendants\u2019 business is on weekends; \u201cwe very seldom have anybody during the week because people mostly come on weekends to get crabs. * * * they come in rowboats; lots of people from the neighborhood come and then we have a few cars come down\u201d. They sell each week \u201cI guess about fifty dozen\u201d; they get seventy-five cents a dozen. Around Fourth of July we sell a lot of [fish], more than usuai. * * * we sell right smart of peelers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\" Assuming that in zoning, as in other fields-'of law, the principle <em>de minimis </em>has a place, we find no place for it in the instant case. During the crabbing and fishing seasons defendants were engaged in commercial business- to a substantial extent. What the net proceeds were, whether-or not they considered the business a success, is not shown and is not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In \u00e1 careful; well-reasoned opinion, based largely on analogy to' <em>Osborne v. Talbot, </em>197 Md. 105, 78 A. 2d 205, Judge- Clark held that defendants\u2019 activities constitute a \u201chome occupation\u201d permitted by the zoning regulations. To a large extent we concur in his reasoning, but-we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>reach a different conclusion, <em>(a) </em>by putting more stress on the difference between <em>Osborne v. Talbot </em>and the instant case, and (6) by construing \u201chome occupation\u201d less broadly. <em>Osborne v. Talbot </em>involved the effect of a restrictive covenant in a 1910 deed upon the use by a chiropractor of his residence. In the professional aspect, a chiropractor is not a physician <em>(Crider v. Cullen, </em>191 Md. 723, 63 A. 2d 618), but in the real estate aspect the positions of a chiropractor and a physician are analogous. From time immemorial, and to a considerable extent today, the profession of a physician, especially of a \u201ccountry doctor\u201d, has been a typical illustration of a \u201chome occupation\u201d. Unless this were true, a community-such as Mago thy Beach could never have a resident practising physician. In this respect we see no near analogy between a physician and a \u201cwaterman\u201d. Furthermore, In suggesting that the scope of \u201cresidence purposes only\u201d may be a matter of degree, we were referring not to the monetary volume of a business done but to the degree of changes in the structure or use of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">On the meaning of \u201chome occupation\u201d Judge Clark said, \u201cA \u2018home occupation\u2019, however, must be something which is customarily incident to the use of the premises as a dwelling. In some communities, the sale of crabs, fish, bait, and the taking out of fishing parties, would not come within this category, but, in a community where there are hundreds of houses fronting on the water, and many men doing exactly what Mr. Snyder is doing, and from their homes, I think what he is doing must be denominated as a \u2018home occupation\u2019. Drive \u00bfround any waterfront in Anne Arundel County, and you will see num\u00e9rous signs up on properties which are primarily residential,- indicating that fish, crabs, bait and so forth are for sale there. And, if the driver will go one step further, and investigate, he will find, in most \u25a0 instances, that a waterman lives in the house in question, a waterman who makes his living c\u00bftching fish, crabs, oysters and so forth, selling most- of his catch bn the wholesale- market, but a- small part thereof at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>his home. Mr. Snyder is in the business on a rather small scale, and, at this time, I cannot see that his activities are so extensive that they can be said to 'usurp' his home\u2019s \u2018primary use as a dwelling\u2019. If he should increase his activities to any considerable extent, we might have a different story. It is all a question of degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We think this construction is too broad. The names Billingsgate and (in its collateral connotations) Marsh Market Place are reminders that the sale of fish has no necessary relation to \u201chome\u201d life in a \u201ccottage residence\u201d community. The activities, lawful or unlawful, of \u201cwatermen\u201d in \u201cOur Mutual Friend\u201d were not \u201chome occupations\u201d incidental to the use of their \u201chomes\u201d, as such, at or near the river. The occupation of a \u201cwaterman\u201d, <em>per se, </em>is no more a \u201chome occupation\u201d than the occupation of a farmer or a garage keeper \u2014 or, formerly, \u201cthe village blacksmith\u201d. If defendants\u2019 occupations were in the past not uncommon in Anne Arundel County, the question remains whether they now are permitted in a \u201ccottage residential\u201d zone. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">If an owner wishes to use her residence as a beauty parlor <em>(Dobres v. Schwartzman, </em>191 Md. 19, 59 A. 2d 684) or a funeral parlor <em>(Ullrich v. State, </em>186 Md. 353, 46 A. 2d 637, 165 A. L. R. 1107) the properties so used are none the less a beauty parlor or a funeral parlor, because also used as a residence, and within express prohibition of such uses in a residential district. In <em>Dobres v. Schwartzman </em>we held it unnecessary to decide whether a beauty parlor is a home occupation permitted by one section of the zoning ordinance in view of express prohibition of beauty parlors by another section. In <em>Piper v. Moore, </em>163 Kans. 565, 183 P. 2d 965, a use in question was held not to be permitted as a \u201chome occupation\u201d and also to be prohibited as a \u201cpublic garage\u201d, as defined for zoning purposes. It has been held that a dancing school, operated on a large scale, after structural changes in the building <em>(State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>Kaegel v. Holekamp, </em>Mo. App., 151 S. W. 2d 685, quoted by Judge Clark) or a restaurant, which apparently had a cook of some local reputation in the vicinity, who was a sister of the owner and lived in the house, <em>(King County v. Lunn, </em>32 Wash. 2d 116, 200 P. 2d 981) or a real estate brokerage office <em>(Village of Riverside v. Kuhne, </em>335 Ill. App. 547, 82 N. E. 2d 500) was not a \u201chome occupation\u201d. In construing \u201chome occupation\u201d we see no difference, in principle, between a general prohibition of commercial uses and a specific prohibition of a beauty parlor, a funeral parlor, or a \u201cpublic garage\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The <em>proviso </em>in the regulation relating to \u201chome occupation\u201d does not broaden but narrows the definition of \u201chome occupation\u201d. It does not include as a \u201chome occupation\u201d any commercial enterprise which can be conducted on a lot 565 feet deep without \u201cusurping\u201d the primary use of the dwelling. If it could be so construed, the residential character of a \u201ccottage residence\u201d district would have little meaning or legal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed with costs, and cause remanded for passage of a decree in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
