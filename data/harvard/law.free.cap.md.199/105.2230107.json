The petition for recount was filed in equity. The answer did not raise any jurisdictional question, but we think it was improperly brought on the equity side of the court. The legislature has provided, as authorized by Article III, Section 47 of the Maryland Constitution, that \u201call cases of contested elections of any of the officers not provided for in the Constitution, or in the preceding section shall be decided by the judges of the several circuit courts, each in his respective circuit, and by the Superior Court of Baltimore City, in the City of Baltimore.\u201d Code (1947 Suppl.), Article 33, Section 108. It has been held that this section does not confer jurisdiction in equity. <em>Hamilton v. Carroll, </em>82 Md. 326, 338, 33 A. 648. Nor would equity have inherent jurisdiction in the absence of fraud, or arbitrary or illegal action. Cf. <em>Hammond v. Love, </em>187 Md. 138, 144, 49 A. 2d 75. However, the case could have been removed from equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>to law, Code, Article 75, Section 124, and heard before the same judge. Under the circumstances we are constrained to pass on the merits of the case without remanding it. Cf. <em>Burns v. </em>Bines, 189 Md. 157, 164, 55 A. 2d 487, 57 A. 2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">A question was also raised as to the right to court review. Sections 108 and 109, Article 33 of the Code (1947 Suppl.) cover all cases of contested elections and provide for appeal to this court. Section 205 defines the word \u201celection\u201d to include elections \u201chad within any county or city for the purpose of enabling voters to choose some public officer or officers under the laws of this State * * *.\u201d Section 12 of Chapter 465, Acts of 1945, incorporating the town of \u201cLandover Hills\u201d, authorizes the appointment of judges of election, and provides that \u201cthe rules and procedure of conducting the election shall be governed by the general election laws of the State of Maryland on any question not .provided for in this charter\u201d. It is also provided that \u201cthe ballot boxes containing the ballots shall be kept by the Town Clerk for thirty days from the date of said election, unless there is. a recount, in which case they shall be kept until said recounting is finally concluded.\u201d We are disposed to hold that the provisions for court review contained in the general law were adopted by reference. The point was assumed, without citation of the local law, in <em>Coulehan v. White, </em>95 Md. 703, 53 A. 786, involving an election for Mayor of Cumberland. Cf. <em>Rawlings v. Armstrong, </em>185 Md. 310, 44 A. 2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Only three ballots are challenged by the appellant. He contends that ballots numbered 1 and 2 were improperly counted for the appellee, on the ground that they contain a mark \u201cother than the cross-mark in a square opposite the name of a candidate\u201d, forbidden by Section 78, Article 33 of the Code (1947 Suppl.). The appellee contends that the ballots were properly counted, but also contends that if they were not, then ballots numbered 30 and 31 were improperly counted for the appellant. We have carefully examined the original ballots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and we think the trial court\u2019s rulings were correct. The court counted a number of ballots where the crossmarks had merely been repeated, but excluded other ballots where it appeared that a check mark had been made and a cross superimposed. The challenged ballots, on close inspection, do not indicate an initial check mark, but rather support the trial court\u2019s finding that the extra line, between the arms of the cross on its left side, was due to dragging, or failure to completely raise, the pencil after making, or repeating, the first mark. We think the marks fall in the category of those passed on in <em>Coulehan v. White, supra, </em>95 Md. at page 712, 53 A. at page 787, class 21, as \u201capparently marked without design and simply as a result of nervousness or inexperience in the use of pencils\u201d. There is also force in the appellee\u2019s contention that if the court had taken the opposite view all of the four ballots would stand on the same footing, and the result would not be altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">We think the court also ruled correctly as to the ballot numbered 38. There a mark like a vertical dash appeared between the upper arms of the cross on the upper margin of the box. This mark was certainly as distinct as the dpt characterized in <em>Coulehan v. White, supra, </em>95 Md. at page 712, 53 A. at page 787, class 20, \u201cas a ready means of identification\u201d. Without attempting to add to the lore of <em>Coulehan v. White, supra, </em>we think the trial court\u2019s rulings correctly applied the principles there laid down by Chief Judge Boyd and adopted by the court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
