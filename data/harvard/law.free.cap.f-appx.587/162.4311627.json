Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d), a Social Security disability claimant, appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s affir-mance of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits under \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In March of 2010, Thomas filed her applications for disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) payments, based on a disability allegedly beginning on March 1, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing on Thomas\u2019s claim, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Thomas was not disabled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For purposes of judicial review, Thomas\u2019s administrative remedies were exhausted when the Appeals Council denied Thomas\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at that point, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 405(g). Thomas appealed the decision to the district court, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision, and that the ALJ applied proper legal standards when evaluating the evidence. Appellant has shown no error, and we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">As an initial matter, in her motion to supplement record excerpts, Thomas seeks to supplement her record excerpts with documentation that is either already in-eluded in the record or immaterial to our analysis. The motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">Consistent with the statutory structures of \u00a7 405(g), \u201c[o]ur standard of review of social security disability claims is exceedingly deferential and limited to two inquiries: whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, and whether the ALJ applied the proper legal standards when evaluating the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that analysis, substantial evidence comprises \u201cmore than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and ... such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In evaluating the presence of substantial evidence, we will not reweigh the evidence nor substitute our judgment, but will instead find evidentiary support insufficient \u201conly where there is a \u2018conspicuous absence of credible choices\u2019 or \u2018no contrary medical evidence.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lastly, where supported by substantial evidence, the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Toward this end, we review the entire record during the relevant evidentiary period, which begins with the onset date of the alleged disability, March 1, 2005, and ends on the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision, July 29, 2011.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">The Social Security Act entitles individuals to certain benefits so long as several conditions are met.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Among these condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tions, an applicant must suffer from a disability, defined as \u201cthe inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or last for a continuous period of 12 months.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The disability determination proceeds through a five-step sequence, analyzing whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">(1) the claimant is presently working; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) the impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in appendix 1 of the social security regulations; (4) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other substantial gainful activity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">A conclusive finding on the presence of disability ends the inquiry at that point in the analysis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The ALJ concluded his analysis at the second step, after finding that Thomas did not have a severe impairment based on a lack of medical evidence supporting her application.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, the ALJ noted that very little treatment substantiated any impairment resulting from Thomas\u2019s complaints of hand, back, chest, and hip pain, along with her diagnoses of unspecified joint disorder and hypertension. Ultimately, the ALJ found that Thomas\u2019s \u201csubjective allegations regarding her impairment-related symptoms and limitations are at least somewhat exaggerated as they are not wholly consistent with the clinical findings on examination.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Thomas was not disabled during the relevant period, and was therefore not entitled to DIB or SSI benefits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">Though the ALJ\u2019s decision substantially described both Thomas\u2019s allegations and the relevant medical evidence,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we must nevertheless \u201cscrutinize the record in its entirety to determine whether substantial evidence does indeed support the [ALJ\u2019s] findings.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Having done so, we hold that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">Thomas variously challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision based on evidentiary weight and credibility, but these challenges do not vitiate the evidentiary sufficiency of the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. While an ALJ must consider evidence of pain, it is within the ALJ\u2019s discretion to resolve discrepancies between subjective complaints of pain and competing medical evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Though Thomas challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision as ignoring a September 2010 assessment of lumbago (or back pain),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the ALJ expressly acknowledged the lumbago assessment, but did not find that the lumbago resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201csevere impairment\u201d due to other evidence from the same assessment, i.e., Thomas\u2019s full range of motion in her back and extremities, her ability to walk and move without difficulty, and her back x-ray which was negative for abnormalities.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Likewise, Thomas notes that the ALJ did not mention a November 2010 assessment of lumbago, described in that instance as a \u201cmedically determinable impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> At the same time, as the ALJ described and the record reveals, \u201ccontrary medical evidence\u201d from the same time period supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that the lumbago did not create severe impairment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As a result, the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and, insofar as Thomas requests that we reweigh evidence, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">As part of her challenge to the ALJ\u2019s severe-impairment finding, Thomas also asserts error in the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider her age, education, past work experience, and residual functioning capacity<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Additionally, Thomas asserts that her lumbago, as a condition allegedly listed in appendix 1 of the social security regulations, warrants a different finding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, the ALJ\u2019s five-step analysis only incorporates such considerations during steps three through five; since we have concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision was sufficiently supported at step two, these issues are not grounds for remand.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Furthermore, we hold that there was no error by the Appeals Council and district court regarding evidence that Thomas submitted after the ALJ\u2019s determination on July 29, 2011. The standards governing consideration of additional evidence by the Appeals Council and district court are similar in requiring that the evidence be both new and material.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this context, material evidence creates \u201ca reasonable possibility that it would have changed the outcome of the [Commissioner\u2019s] decision.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Therefore, materiality impliedly requires evidence to \u201crelate to the time period for which benefits were denied, and that it not concern evidence of a later-acquired disability or of the subsequent deterioration of the previously non-disabling condition.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The additional evidence to which Thomas alludes is either not new, because it was included in the record considered by the ALJ, or not material, falling outside the relevant time period or not supporting an impairment, and therefore does not create a reasonable possibility of changing the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED; motion to supplement is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
