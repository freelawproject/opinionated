Jones, Major Charles R. Horsley, Sergeant Krista M. Vasquez, Correctional Officer Jose A. Armendariz, and Correctional Officer Desmond Barrera. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(3)(2), 1915A. According to Curtis, the defendants had failed to protect him in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Curtis\u2019s allegations as to how the defendants did so, however, have changed repeatedly. In the district court, Curtis asserted that Vasquez orchestrated an antagonistic relationship between him and another inmate which resulted in a fight in which Curtis was injured. He now asserts a more generalized scheme against him by several of the defendants, but particularly Armen-dariz, of which the fight was evidence rather than the result. Curtis\u2019s vague allegations, contradicted by other evidence in the record and shifting as Curtis tries to evade dismissal, are \u201cwholly incredible\u201d and thus frivolous. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). The district court acted within its discretion in dismissing the complaint as frivolous, and its judgment is AFFIRMED. <em>See Rogers v. Boatright, </em>709 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
