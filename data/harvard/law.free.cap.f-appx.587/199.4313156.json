Rocha has appealed the district court\u2019s order denying his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking a reduction in his sentence in light of Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The record reflects that Rocha was sentenced to a particular sentence under the terms of his plea agreement. <em>See Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2695-99 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). Accordingly, he cannot show that the district court abused its discretion in determining that he is ineligible for a reduction in his sentence under Amendment 599. <em>See id.; United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and its alternative motion for an extension of time within which to file a brief is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that tins opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
