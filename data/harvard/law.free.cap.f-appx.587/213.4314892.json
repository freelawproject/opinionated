We reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-25\">Chondra Johnson, a former Director of Recreation Sports, sued Prairie View A &amp; M University (\u201cPVAMU\u201d), alleging sex discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in violation of Title VII, claims under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Texas Workers Compensation Act (\u201cTWCA\u201d). PVAMU moved to dismiss the workers\u2019 compensation and FMLA claims on sovereign immunity grounds, and the other claims either for untimeliness or failure to state a claim. Johnson\u2019s pro se response included a motion to strike PVA-MU\u2019s motion to dismiss because PVAMU did not comply with the Southern District of Texas Local Rule 7. Her response also included a request for appointment of counsel or, alternatively, to withdraw her suit without prejudice. PVAMU noted in reply that Johnson failed to address any of the arguments in its motion to dismiss and that Local Rule 7 does not apply to dispos-itive motions under Rule 12(b)(1). The University advised the district court, however, that it did not oppose her motion for dismissal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The district court issued a brief order denying the motion to dismiss and stating that \u201cthe case, in its entirety, is not subject to dismissal.\u201d The district court did not consider PVAMU\u2019s immunity claims and failed to mention Johnson\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">PVAMU appeals the district court\u2019s order to the extent it rejected the University\u2019s sovereign immunity claims. We have appellate jurisdiction over this otherwise nonfinal decision under the collateral order doctrine. <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 144, 113 S.Ct. 684, 687, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). \u201cThe question of whether state defendants are entitled to sovereign immunity is ... reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Moore v. Louisiana Bd. of Elementary &amp; Secondary Educ., </em>743 F.3d 959, 962 (5th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Hale v. King, 642 </em>F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Based on the Eleventh Amendment, \u201c[ajbsent waiver, neither a State nor agencies acting under its control\u201d are amenable to suit in federal court. <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct, </em>506 U.S. at 144, 113 S.Ct. at 687-88. PVAMU is a state university and therefore partakes of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity. <em>See Nelson v. Univ. of Tex. at Dallas, </em>535 F.3d 318 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Tex. Tech Univ., </em>171 F.3d 279, 289 n. 14 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 572.002(10)(B). There is no indication in the TWCA that any state agency like PVAMU has consented to be sued thereunder, let alone consented to a federal forum. And this is not a case where the state has waived its immunity defense or otherwise forfeited it by its conduct. <em>See Lapides v. Board of Regents, </em>535 U.S. 613, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002) (state forfeits federal-forum immunity when it removes state-law claim to which it had consented to suit in state court). Finally, Johnson\u2019s FMLA claim is also barred by the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, <em>Coleman v. Court of Appeals, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1327, 1332, 182 L.Ed.2d 296 (2012). The University\u2019s sovereign immunity as to the TWCA and FMLA claims is perfectly intact, and the district court erred in refusing to dismiss those claims under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">For these reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order insofar as it denies PVAMU\u2019s motion to dismiss the TWCA and FMLA claims and REMAND with instructions to dismiss those claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ArY\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">. Although Johnson's complaint recites the FMLA as a basis of jurisdiction, it does not plead facts amounting to an FMLA cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\">. In her appellee's brief, Johnson does not renew her motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
