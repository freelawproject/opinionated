The Defendants bring this interlocutory appeal contending that the district court erred by ignoring a claim of immunity in their motion to dismiss and incorrectly granting Garner discovery and denying their immunity-based summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">According to the allegations of the complaint, Stokes (who is autistic) left his residence, wandered down the street, and entered the yard of a private residence. The owner of the residence called police. Officer Dodson responded to the call. According to the complaint, Dodson arrived on the scene and, without provocation or cause, repeatedly instructed his police canine to attack Stokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">As a result of these events, Garner (as parent of Stokes) filed this suit alleging multiple claims: excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment (Count I); unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment (Count II); unlawful arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment (Count III); violation of the Americans with Disability Act (\u201cADA\u201d) (Count IV); negligent hiring (Count V); negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>gence (Count VII);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assault (Count VIII); and battery (IX). Although the complaint is hardly a model of clarity, it appears to assert each claim against every Defendant \u2014 regardless of whether such assertion is rational. The Defendants moved to dismiss all claims except those of excessive force, assault, and battery against Dodson in his individual capacity. The district court granted the motion to dismiss on all the counts it considered with the exception of the ADA claim. However, the district court did not address the motion to dismiss regarding the assault or battery claims against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Defendants also moved for summary judgment on all claims. In response to the summary judgment motion, Garner\u2019s counsel filed an affidavit stating that she would need to present several expert witnesses in order to respond to the motion. The district court granted Garner discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d) and denied the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, but with leave to refile at an appropriate time. The Defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II.Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The Defendants present two issues on appeal. First, Ozark contends that the district court erred by not considering its immunity-based motion to dismiss the state law assault and battery claims. Second, the Defendants contend that the district court abused its discretion by granting Garner\u2019s Rule 56(d) motion for discovery and \u2014 in doing so \u2014 denying the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">III.Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss based on immunity. <em>Rehberg v. Paulk, </em>611 F.3d 828, 837 n. 5 (11th Cir.2010). We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 56(d) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Carmical v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 490, 493 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">IV.Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">A. The district court erred by denying Ozark immunity on the Alabama state law tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">Ozark contends that the district court erred by ignoring its immunity-based motion to dismiss the state law battery and assault claims (counts VIII and IX). In the motion to dismiss, Ozark asserted that it was immune from these claims under Ala.Code \u00a7 11-47-190.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">The Alabama Supreme Court has held that under \u00a7 11-47-190, a municipality is immune from liability for the intentional torts of its agents. <em>Ex parte City of Tuskegee, </em>932 So.2d 895, 911 (Ala.2005). We have previously recognized this immunity under Alabama law. <em>See Brown v. City of Huntsville, </em>608 F.3d 724, 743 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">Accordingly, Ozark is entitled to a ruling on its motion to dismiss based on immunity grounds. We remand and instruct the district court to provide such a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">B. The district court erred by denying the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">The Defendants contend that the district court erred by granting Garner\u2019s Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>56(d) motion and \u2014 in doing so; \u2014 denying their immunity-based summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d) allows a district court to deny a summary judgment motion when \u201ca nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\u201d \u201cA [Rule 56(d) ]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> motion must be supported by an affidavit which sets forth with particularity the facts the moving party expects to discover and how those facts would create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment.\u201d <em>Harbert Int'l, Inc. v. James, </em>157 F.3d 1271, 1280 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cWhether to grant or deny a [Rule 56(d) ]. motion for discovery requires the court to balance the movant\u2019s demonstrated need for discovery against the burden such discovery will place on the opposing party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn qualified immunity cases, the [Rule 56(d) ] balancing is done with a thumb on the side of the scale weighing against discovery.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 646 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3042 n. 6, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (cautioning that district courts should be especially careful in allowing Rule 56(d) discovery before considering a qualified-immunity based summary judgment motion). \u201cThe basic thrust of the qualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including avoidance of disruptive discovery.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 685, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1953, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted). And, the city\u2019s immunity claim in this case warrants a ruling on the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment without further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In this case, Garner has not shown that she meets the requirements of Rule 56(d). Garner has not articulated what particular facts she expects to discover. Neither has she provided any explanation of how those facts would be relevant to the issue of immunity. Garner\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit stating that she would like to present expert witnesses on recognition of individuals with autism, proper handling of police dogs, and the nature of Stokes\u2019s capacity and propensity for physical violence. (R. 19-1 at 1.) Garner does not explain what <em>facts </em>these expert witnesses would provide. Instead, Garner seems to desire the experts for their opinions on the case. Rule 56(d) provides a remedy \u201cwhen <em>facts </em>are unavailable to the nonmovant.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d) (emphasis added). Even assuming Garner\u2019s request for expert opinions was proper under Rule 56(d), she does not explain how these experts\u2019 opinions would be relevant to the issue of immunity. Accordingly, Garner has not particularly identified any relevant facts she needs to oppose the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The district court\u2019s order provides no analysis demonstrating that Garner met the requirements of Rule 56(d). Neither does Garner provide any analysis on appeal. Accordingly, we hold that Garner did not meet the requirements of Rule 56(d) and that the district court abused its discretion in granting Garner discovery. It follows then, that the district court also erred by denying the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on the basis that Garner needed additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">The district court erred by not addressing Ozark\u2019s immunity-based motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we remand and instruct the district court to consider this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>issue. The district court also abused its discretion by granting Garner\u2019s 56(d) motion. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s order on the Rule 56(d) motion, vacate the district court\u2019s denial of the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, and remand and instruct the court to consider the merits of the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">.
