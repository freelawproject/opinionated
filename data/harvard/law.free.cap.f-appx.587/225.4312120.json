He contends that the district court based its sentencing decision solely on his criminal history and that the court should have given more weight to the grade of his supervised release violations, his lack of prior violations, and the policy statement range of 7 to 13 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-22\">Because Armijo did not raise this objection in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). When those elements are shown, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-23\">Armijo has shown no clear or obvious error. At the revocation hearing, the district court listened to defense counsel\u2019s statement and Armijo\u2019s allocution, read a letter Armijo had written, and expressly considered several relevant sentencing fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tors, including Armijo\u2019s history and characteristics, the need for the sentence imposed to deter future criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B) &amp; (C); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The court\u2019s weighing of these factors is entitled to deference. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Armijo\u2019s disagreement with the court\u2019s weighing does not establish that the imposition of his sentence constituted clear or obvious error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Additionally, the district court acted within its statutory authority in ordering a 24-month sentence. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>520 F.3d 425, 427 (5th Cir. 2008); \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We routinely uphold such sentences. <em>See United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 332 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, - the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
