Young, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b565-17\">A. <em>Underlying Conviction and Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">In August 1994, a federal grand jury indicted Young for possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e), the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). He was convicted after a three-day trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Young\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated he had numerous prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>state-felony convictions, 6 of which were violent felonies. According to the PSI, Young pled nolo contendere in all but one of the prior felony cases. Additionally, several of the violent felonies had the same date. The district judge sentenced Young to 262 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">On direct appeal, Young argued the district judge erroneously found he had possessed a firearm in connection with a burglary, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the armed-career-criminal sentencing guideline. Young did not challenge his eligibility for an enhanced ACCA sentence under \u00a7 924(e). We affirmed Young\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Young, </em>115 F.3d 834 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">B. <em>Relevant Post-Conviction Motions, 2000 to 2012</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In February 2000, Young filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. It was dismissed as untimely in July 2001. We denied Young\u2019s applications for leave to file second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions in 2005 and 2006. In 2008, the district judge denied Young\u2019s Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence, because it was an impermissibly successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We dismissed Young\u2019s appeal in that proceeding for failure to prosecute later that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In September 2011, Young moved to correct an error in his judgment of conviction. He asserted his judgment erroneously stated he had been convicted of possessing a firearm <em>and </em>ammunition, whereas the jury had convicted him of possessing a firearm <em>or </em>ammunition. Following an initial denial by the district judge and a remand by this court, the district judge granted Young\u2019s motion. The judge explained that, although the jury had found Young guilty, \u201cthe jury was not asked to specify on the verdict form which item(s) Young possessed and accordingly the verdict was silent in that regard.\u201d Order Amending Conviction Judgment at 2 (Sept. 27, 2012). In October 2012, the district judge issued an amended judgment clarifying that the jury had convicted Young of possession of a firearm <em>or </em>ammunition by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">C. <em>Current 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 Habeas Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">In October 2010, Young filed this pro se \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. After the government responded and Young had submitted numerous additional filings, the district judge directed Young to file an amended petition that included all the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">In his amended \u00a7 2241 petition, Young asserted he was actually innocent of his \u00a7 924(e) ACCA sentence enhancement, because he did not have the required three predicate convictions. Young contended his claim relied on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), which was decided after he had filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion. According to Young, all of his prior felonies were treated as violent felonies in this circuit before <em>Begay, </em>even though he had \u201cpl[ed] innocent\u201d in those cases. ROA at 290. Because Young could not raise his <em>Begay </em>claim in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, he argued \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">Young also sought relief under the \u201c \u2018actual innocence exception\u2019\u201d in <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2011), and the fundamental-miscarriage-of-justice standard in <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). ROA at 338. He similarly argued his actual-innocence showing entitled him to review of his claims, regardless of any procedural bar, under <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013). Young also filed various supplemental authorities and motions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>including a motion for reconsideration under Rule 60(b)(4), and he sought sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The district judge first addressed whether Young could bring claims that normally would be made in a \u00a7 2255 motion, under \u00a7 2241. The judge concluded Young was not entitled to proceed under the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause, because his claims were not based on retroactive, \u201ccircuit law-busting\u201d Supreme Court decisions. ROA at 439. Consequently, the judge dismissed Young\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and denied his request for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">A. <em>Section 2255(e) Savings Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Young seeks the application of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) to permit his \u00a7 2241 petition. Young argues the trial judge also lacked jurisdiction to impose an ACCA sentence, because Young\u2019s predicate convictions were based on his state-court pleas of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, Young\u2019s PSI erroneously counted separately several prior sentences imposed on the same date. He argues that, before the decisions in <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, and <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), precedent barred his ACCA claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We review de novo whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262. When a conviction has become final, a federal prisoner usually may challenge the legality of his detention only through'a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1256. Section 2241 habeas petitions, though generally reserved for challenges to the execution of a sentence or the nature of confinement, may be used if petitioner meets his burden of showing that\u2019 a \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256, 1262, 1288. Whether the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause may \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 petition is a jurisdictional issue that must be decided before addressing the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">To show that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective, a petitioner asserting a sentencing-error claim must establish that (1) binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed the claim during the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (2) after the petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, a United States Supreme Court decision overturned that circuit precedent; (3) the rule announced in that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively on collateral review; and (4) as a result of that new rule, the petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress. <em>See id. </em>at 1274, 1281; <em>see Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244-45 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Under the ACCA, a defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory-minimum, 15-year prison sentence, if he has 3 prior violent-felony or serious-drug-offense convictions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Absent an ACCA enhancement, the maximum sentence for violating \u00a7 922(g) is ten years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Although pro se briefs are to be liberally construed, a pro se litigant who offers no substantive argument on an issue in his initial brief abandons that issue on appeal. <em>See Tim-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>son v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). '</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We first address Young\u2019s claim that his prior state-court \u201cinnocent\u201d pleas made those convictions ineligible as ACCA predicate convictions. Applying the <em>Bryant </em>test, the only allegedly relevant prior precedent identified by Young that could have foreclosed his claims is the Supreme Court\u2019s 1990 decision in <em>Taylor v. United States. </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). The question presented in <em>Taylor </em>concerned the meaning of the word \u201cburglary\u201d in the \u00a7 924(e) definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 577-78, 110 S.Ct. at 2147. The Court defined \u201cburglary,\u201d as used in \u00a7 924(e), as \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary, <em>ie., </em>\u201cany crime ... having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 110 S.Ct. at 2158. The Court further held a sentencing judge applying \u00a7 924(e) generally should look only to the fact of conviction and the elements of the prior statutes of conviction, or to the charging documents and jury instructions, but not the facts of each defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 600-02, 110 S.Ct. at 2159-60. Notably, the Court in <em>Taylor </em>did not address distinctions between guilty, nolo contendere, and <em>Alford </em>pleas. <em>See generally id. </em>Thus, <em>Taylor </em>did not squarely foreclose Young\u2019s claims that his state-court pleas could not be used as ACCA-predicate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Young also has identified no relevant, retroactively applicable, Supreme Court cases that overturned any prior precedent. In <em>Begay, </em>upon which Young relies, the Court addressed whether the New Mexico offense of driving under the influence of alcohol satisfied the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 139-41, 128 S.Ct. at 1583-84. The Court answered that question in the negative, because the phrase \u201cor otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d is limited to crimes \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,\u201d to the examples in the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 148, 128 S.Ct. at 1585, 1588. As with <em>Taylor, </em>the Court in <em>Begay </em>did not address distinctions between guilty, nolo con-tendere, and <em>Alford </em>pleas. <em>See generally id. </em>Therefore, <em>Begay </em>did not overturn any prior precedent relevant to Young\u2019s state-court pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Nor did <em>Bryant </em>signal the abrogation of any relevant precedent. In <em>Bryant, </em>we held the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause permits a federal prisoner to bring a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition upon a showing that his sentence for violating \u00a7 922(g) exceeds the ten-year statutory maximum under \u00a7 924(a), subject to certain conditions previously addressed. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256-57, 1274. Since the time of the petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay, </em>as interpreted by our subsequent decisions, had abrogated some prior precedent, under which the Florida crime of carrying a concealed firearm had been considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1257, 1274-76. As was the case in <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Begay, Bryant </em>did not address distinctions between guilty, nolo contendere, and <em>Alford </em>pleas. <em>See generally id. </em>Accordingly, Bryant\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>pretation of <em>Begay </em>also did not signal the abrogation. of any precedent relevant to Young\u2019s claims regarding his state-court pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">With respect to his claims that the sentences for each of his ACCA-predicates were imposed on the same date, Young likewise has identified no prior, binding precedent foreclosing such a claim or Supreme Court decision abrogating any such precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">B. <em>Actual Innocence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Young contends he was convicted of a non-existent crime under \u00a7 924(e), and he is actually innocent under <em>McQuiggin. </em>133 S.Ct. 1924. In support of his actual-innocence-of-\u00a7 924(e) claim, Young further contends (1) no firearm or ammunition was found in his possession, and (2) his conviction judgment was amended by the recent district court order stating the jury made , no findings as to his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Young\u2019s actual-innocence claim under <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins </em>is misplaced. In <em>McQuiggin, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether actual innocence, if proved, may provide an equitable exception to the statute of limitations applicable to a state prisoner\u2019s initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See McQuiggin, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1928, 1931, 1934-35. Even assuming that <em>McQuiggin </em>applies to federal prisoners, Young\u2019s case involves neither an initial post-conviction challenge nor a statute-of-limitations issue. Moreover, Young\u2019s purported actual-innocence claim is actually a sentencing-error claim under \u00a7 924(e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as opposed to the factual-innocence claim at issue in <em>McQuiggin. See id. </em>at 1935 (\u201cTo invoke the miscarriage of justice exception to [the federal habeas] statute of limitations, ... a petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">C. <em>Due Process Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Young claims the district judge in this case violated his right to due process by holding him to the same standard as an attorney and by failing to engage in fact-finding. He challenges the denial of his motion for reconsideration under Rule 60(b)(4) for similar reasons. He also alleges the government \u201csecretly\u201d submitted to the district judge a \u201chidden response,\u201d in which the government conceded the errors claimed by Young. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Young\u2019s claim of a due-process violation by the district judge is meritless. Young has shown nothing in the record substantiating his claim the judge improperly held him to the same standard as an attorney. The district judge also did not err by failing to engage in factfinding, because she properly determined she lacked jurisdiction over Young\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, based on his failure to satisfy the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. Nor did the judge err, when she denied Young\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion, in which Young merely reasserted his \u00a7 2241 claims as to the nature of his state-court pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Young likewise has shown nothing in the record to substantiate his claim that the government \u201csecretly\u201d submitted a \u201chidden response\u201d to the district judge. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1. By failing to elaborate on appeal any of the myriad other argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ments he raised before the district judge, Young has abandoned them. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\">. Young also contends his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Young\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims are plainly outside the scope of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause, because they do not satisfy any of the requirements for bringing a \u00a7 2241 petition. See <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274, 1281.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-6\">.
