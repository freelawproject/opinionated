InDyne alleged that Abacus had infringed InDyne\u2019s copyright over its Program Information Management System (PIMS) software. That claim arose from the fact that Abacus, while setting up a website for NASA, had copied portions of the PIMS software. The district court granted summary judgment to Abacus on the infringement claim, concluding that InDyne had not presented evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that the elements of InDyne\u2019s software that Abacus had copied were original and thus deserving of copyright protection. We affirmed that decision. <em>InDyne, Inc. v. Abacus Tech. Corp., </em>513 Fed.Appx. 858 (11th Cir.2013) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">Under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505, the district court then ordered InDyne to pay Abacus\u2019 reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. <em>InDyne, Inc. v. Abacus Tech. Corp., </em>No. 6:11-cv-137-Orl-22DAB, 2014 WL 1400658 (M.D.Fla. Feb. 25, 2014). The district court identified three factors justifying its decision to award those fees. First, it ruled that In-Dyne\u2019s decision \u201cto file a copyright infringement claim even though it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>have a copy of the copyrighted material\u201d was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *9. Second, it found that InDyne\u2019s motivation in bringing the suit was \u201cquestionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, it reasoned that an award of attorney\u2019s fees would further the purposes of the Copyright Act because it would deter future litigants from suing for infringement of software copyrights without being able to produce the software code. <em>See id. </em>at *9-10. Taken together, these factors \u201cweighted] in favor of an imposition of fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10. InDyne now appeals that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">A district court may award \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party\u201d in a civil copyright-infringement action. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. The district court awards \u00a7 505 attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas a matter of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 534, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 1033, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994). In deciding whether to make such an award, the court considers \u201cwhether imposition of attorney\u2019s fees will further the goals of the Copyright Act, <em>ie., </em>by encouraging the raising of objectively reasonable claims and defenses, which may serve not only to deter infringement but also to ensure that the boundaries of copyright law are demarcated as clearly as possible.\u201d <em>MiTek Holdings, Inc. v. Arce Eng\u2019g Co., Inc., </em>198 F.3d 840, 842-43 (11th Cir.1999) (alteration and quotation marks omitted). Courts consider factors such as \u201cfrivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and in the legal components of the case) and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence,\u201d if the application of those factors furthers the purposes of the Copyright Act. <em>Fogerty, </em>510 U.S. at 534 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. at 1033 n. 19 (quoting <em>Lieb v. Topstone Indus., Inc., </em>788 F.2d 151, 156 (3d Cir.1986)). We review an award of Copyright Act attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Montgomery v. Noga, </em>168 F.3d 1282, 1303 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">InDyne first contends that Abacus is a bad actor that committed \u201cmassive copyright infringement\u201d against InDyne and \u201cgot away with it.\u201d InDyne thus asserts that the district court abused its discretion because under those circumstances, rewarding Abacus with attorney\u2019s fees would not serve the purposes of the Copyright Act. But that contention is contrary to the district court\u2019s finding, which we previously affirmed, that InDyne could not prove\u2014 and Abacus was therefore not liable for\u2014 copyright infringement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> InDyne\u2019s bare assertion that Abacus behaved badly is an invitation to relitigate the already-decided merits of this case, not a ground for reversing the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Second, InDyne contends that the district court abused its discretion because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>InDyne\u2019s decision to sue despite lacking key evidence was not objectively unreasonable. To survive a motion for summary judgment, a party must produce evidence \u201csuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict\u201d for it. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). But when it sued, InDyne no longer had a copy of the copyrighted version of the PIMS software or even a clear software revision history. Without the software and without a revision history, InDyne had insufficient evidence to show which parts of the copyrighted work were protectable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">InDyne claims that it relied on our decision in <em>Montgomery v. </em>Noga, 168 F.3d 1282, 1303 (11th Cir.1999), for the proposition that it could have proved the content of its copyrighted work using witness testimony. But <em>Montgomery </em>does not stand for that proposition. There, we were able to review the software itself and a detailed revision history to assess whether the updated software exhibited sufficient originality to merit copyright protection. <em>See id. </em>at 1290-91. Here, by contrast, InDyne could not show the court the software or a revision history for its \u201cchameleon-like,\u201d \u201cconstantly morphing\u201d software, without which it could not prove its prima facie case. <em>InDyne, </em>876 F.Supp.2d at 1280. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion when 'it ruled that InDyne\u2019s decision to bring this suit without proof of an element of its prima facie case was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Finally, InDyne. disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that its motives were \u201cquestionable.\u201d But we need not address that finding because the district court noted that even if it had found that this factor weighed in favor of InDyne, the other factors outweighed it. <em>InDyne, </em>2014 WL 1400658, at *9 n. 7; cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 61 (\u201cAt every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">In short, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Abacus its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. In doing so, it appropriately weighed the objective unreasonableness of InDyne\u2019s decision to bring suit, InDyne\u2019s apparent motivation, and the need to deter future litigants who would sue for copyright infringement without producible evidence of their copyrighted work.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">The district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is AFFIRMED. The parties\u2019 unopposed motions to file out of time are GRANTED. Abacus\u2019 motion for damages under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 is DENIED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. The conclusion that Abacus is not liable for copyright infringement is the law of the case. Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, an appellate court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are \"generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d <em>This That &amp; the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb Cnty., </em>439 F.3d 1275, 1284 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation mark omitted). The doctrine further bars relitigation of issues decided by necessary implication, even if they were not addressed explicitly. <em>See id.; Transamerica Leasing, Inc. v. Inst. of London Underwriters, </em>430 F.3d 1326, 1331 (\"While the doctrine encompasses only those issues previously determined, the law is clear that it comprehends things <em>decided by necessary implication </em>as well as those decided explicitly\") (quotation marks and alteration omitted). Our opinion affirms \"on the basis of the thorough and well-reasoned opinion of the district court,\u201d which found Abacus not liable for copyright infringement. <em>InDyne, </em>513 Fed.Appx. at 858; <em>see also InDyne, </em>876 F.Supp.2d at 1293 (granting summary judgment to Abacus).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">. As one element of its prima facie case, In-Dyne had to show that the parts of code Abacus copied were protectable \"original works of authorship.\u201d Not all elements of every copyrighted work are protected. <em>Feist Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., </em>499 U.S. 340, 348, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1289, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (\"[T]he mere fact that a work is copyrighted does not mean that every element of the work may be protected.\"). Computer code, for example, often includes instructions that are unprotectable \" \u2018ideas\u2019 or are dictated by efficiency or external factors, or [are] taken from the public domain\u201d \u2014 instructions that are, in other words, not protectable under copyright law. <em>InDyne, </em>876 F.Supp.2d at 1287; <em>see also </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (\"Copyright protection subsists ... in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-13\">. We conclude that InDyne\u2019s appeal is not frivolous, and we therefore deny Abacus\u2019 Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>38 motion for damages. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38 (\"If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may ... award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
