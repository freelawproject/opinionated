He now appeals from the district court\u2019s denials of his petition for a writ of coram nobis, his motion for recusal, and his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy available in the federal courts pursuant to the All Writs Act as an avenue of collateral attack when a prisoner has completed his sentence and is no longer in custody for purposes of seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>136 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. 1651(a). It is employed only in compelling circumstances to correct fundamental error and avoid a miscarriage of justice. <em>Jimenez v. Trominski, </em>91 F.3d 767, 768 (5th Cir.1996). Wade\u2019s claims that there was insufficient evidence of his guilt, the district court judge was biased against him, and that he was actually innocent of his crimes of conviction are claims that were either already decided in his previous 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions or could have been raised in those motions. Accordingly, because his claims failed to make the necessary showing of a complete miscarriage of justice, the district court did not err by denying his petition for a writ of coram nobis. <em>See United States v. Esogbue, </em>357 F.3d 532, 535 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In his appellate brief, Wade asserts that he should be permitted to raise an actual innocence claim regardless of any procedural impediments pursuant to <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013). He has not shown that the actual innocence exception should apply in his case as he has not presented new evidence that he is actually innocent of the offense of conviction or shown that, in light of this new evidence, no juror acting reasonably would have found him guilty of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Perkins, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">A \u201cjudge abuses his discretion in denying recusal where a reasonable man, cognizant of the relevant circumstances surrounding [the] judge\u2019s failure to recuse, would harbor legitimate doubts about that judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Andrade v. Cho-jnacki, </em>338 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As Wade has failed to make the requisite showing of judicial bias, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for recusal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Wade\u2019s motion for reconsideration was directed at the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of coram nobis. Because the district court\u2019s denial of that petition was not erroneous, Wade has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
