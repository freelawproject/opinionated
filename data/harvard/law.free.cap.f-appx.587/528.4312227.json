Because Max was paying off a mortgage on the property to Embassy National Bank, the policy listed Embassy both as a mortgagee and as the loss payee \u2014 the party that would receive the money if Auto-Owners paid out a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The policy agreement provided that Auto-Owners would \u201c[n]ot pay for any loss or damage caused by ... [vjandalism [or tjheft\u201d if the building was \u201cvacant for more than 60 consecutive days before that loss or damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-20\">In mid-July 2010 thieves broke into the warehouse, stole copper electrical wiring, and damaged machines. Max filed a $1.2 million claim with Auto-Owners. Auto-Owners denied the claim, asserting that the property had been vacant for more than sixty days before the loss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In July 2012 Max filed suit in Georgia state court for breach of contract and a bad-faith re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>fusal to pay its claim, arguing that the warehouse had not been vacant for more than sixty days immediately preceding the burglary. Auto-Owners removed the case to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In January 2013 Embassy foreclosed on the property, along with two other Max warehouses it held mortgages on. Embassy then bought the properties on the courthouse steps for approximately $2.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Max contends that in May 2013 Embassy assigned its rights under the Auto-Owners policy to Max. Max included an unauthenticated copy of what it claims was Embassy\u2019s assignment as an exhibit to its brief opposing summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The district court granted summary judgment to Auto-Owners, finding that Max had no interest in the insurance proceeds. This is Max\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment, and we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Robinson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Because this is a diversity case, state law governs substantive issues of law. <em>See Jackson v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>16 F.3d 1573, 1580 (11th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938)). Under Georgia law, the \u201cright of an insured ... to insurance proceeds, claimed pursuant to an insurance contract containing a loss payee endorsement, is determined at the time of loss and to the extent of the insured\u2019s established actual loss.\u201d <em>CIT Grp./Equip. Fin., Inc. v. Northbrook Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>237 Ga.App. 524, 515 S.E.2d 845, 847 (1999). If \u201cthe amount of debt is in excess of the insurance proceeds, a debtor has no interest in the policy proceeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that circumstance, the debtor has \u201cno claim to the proceeds as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Beasley v. Agricredit Acceptance Corp., </em>224 Ga.App. 372, 480 S.E.2d 257, 260 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">It is undisputed that the amount of the debt Max owed to loss payee Embassy exceeded the amount of its claimed loss. At the time of the burglary, Max owed more than $2 million to Embassy on its mortgaged properties. Max sought only $1.2 million from Auto-Owners. The amount Max owed Embassy was plainly \u201cin excess of the insurance proceeds,\u201d so Embassy was entitled under Georgia law to the whole payment. <em>See CIT Grp., </em>515 S.E.2d at 847. Max therefore has \u201cno claim to the proceeds as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See Beasley, </em>480 S.E.2d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Max argues that Embassy later assigned the \u201csole rights to any proceeds from the insurance claim\u201d to Max. But the district court found that Max had failed to produce the assignment document during discovery or to authenticate the document it later attached to its summary judgment opposition. When Auto-Owners timely objected to the document\u2019s admission, the district court determined that it could not consider the unauthenticated assignment document. Max does not address this authentication ruling in its brief and thus has abandoned any argument that it was error. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014) (holding that plaintiffs\u2019 failure to address independent grounds for judgment in their brief resulted in abandoning \u201cany argument that the additional reasons the district court stated for dismissing each of the claims was error\u201d). Max failed to produce admissible evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact about its contention that Embassy assigned it the insurance proceeds. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Because of that and because Max\u2019s breach and bad-faith refusal-to-pay claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>are predicated on Auto-Owners\u2019 refusal to pay it the insurance proceeds, summary judgment against it was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-13\">. The loss payee is entitled to insurance proceeds to the extent of the debt owed it by the insured. <em>Pearlman v. Sec. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>261 Ga.App. 270, 582 S.E.2d 219, 220 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-21\">. Max\u2019s erstwhile tenant on the property had gone into bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court allowed it to reject its lease. The tenant turned the keys to the warehouse over to Max on May 31, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-16\">. The district court granted summary judgment on a second independent ground \u2014 that Max was judicially estopped from bringing its claim. Because we affirm on the basis of Max\u2019s lack of interest in the insurance proceeds, we do not reach the judicial-estoppel issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
