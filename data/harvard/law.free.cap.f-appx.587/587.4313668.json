We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">In September 2005, Milbauer sought treatment at a VA medical center in Brooklyn, New York (\u201cthe Brooklyn VA\u201d), for injuries he had sustained to his right, shoulder in two work-related accidents at a construction site. Medical staff recommended he receive an MRI to diagnose his injuries. Because of his claustrophobia, Milbauer requested an \u201copen\u201d MRI, a type of MRI that does not require the patient to be enclosed in a tube. The Brooklyn VA, however, did not have an open MRI machine, and Milbauer requested authorization to receive an open MRI at a non-VA facility. Milbauer finally obtained such authorization and received an open MRI at a non-VA facility in July 2006, ten months after Brooklyn VA medical staff had recommended the procedure. The MRI revealed Milbauer had a severely torn rota-tor cuff, and he elected to have surgery. Because the damage was too severe, the surgery was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">On September 27, 2008, Milbauer filed an administrative claim with the VA under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) and 2671-2680. He asserted the Brooklyn VA had failed to provide an open MRI of his right shoulder in a timely manner. Although his doctor had recommended an MRI, the staff did not know how to arrange an MRI at a non-VA facility. Moreover, the staff had placed upon him the burden of completing paperwork. He argued the delay in receiving a timely MRI had caused further damage to his shoulder. He also asserted his rotator cuff could have been repaired if the MRI had been performed within 30 days after his injuries had occurred. The VA denied Milbauer\u2019s administrative claim on August 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">On March 17, 2011, Milbauer filed a complaint in the Middle District of Florida and alleged negligence claims against the United States under the FTCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his complaint, he summarized th'e medical treatment he had received at the Brooklyn VA. He then alleged he was entitled to have an open MRI performed at a non-VA facility at the VA\u2019s expense, and he described the numerous problems he had faced in attempting to obtain authorization for the outside MRI. Milbauer alleged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Brooklyn VA medical staff had failed to return his telephone calls, had directed him to departments that had no knowledge of how to arrange an open MRI, and had failed to follow the procedures set forth in the VA\u2019s New York Harbor Healthcare System Policy No. ll^fl (\u201cPolicy No. 11-41\u201d). According to Milbauer, Policy No. 11-41 established the procedures for medical staff to order or arrange medical tests and procedures performed at non-VA institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Milbauer further alleged the Brooklyn VA medical staff should have offered alternative imaging studies to an MRI to determine the extent of his injury. He claimed the medical staff had deviated from appropriate standards of medical care and (1) had failed \u201cto take reasonable steps to diagnose his rotator cuff injury within a reasonable time frame through an outside MRI,\u201d (2) had failed \u201cto have the appropriate paperwork prepared to authorize the outside MRI for a period of ten months,\u201d and (3) had committed \u201cother negligent acts or omissions in violation of the applicable standards of medical care.\u201d Rl-1 at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The government moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The government argued Mil-bauer\u2019s FTCA suit was barred by a provision in the Veterans Judicial Review Act (\u201cVJRA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a), which specifies that district judges may not review claims involving a decision by the Secretary of the VA under a law that affects the provision of benefits to veterans. The government argued the crux of Milbauer\u2019s claim concerned his frustration with the delay in obtaining a veteran\u2019s benefit, namely, authorization to have the VA pay for an open MRI at a non-VA facility. The government further argued Milbauer had failed to exhaust administratively his claim that medical staff should have offered him alternative diagnostic imaging studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">In response to the latter argument, Mil-bauer argued he administratively had exhausted his claim that the Brooklyn VA should have offered alternative diagnostic procedures. Relying on our precedent in <em>Burchfield v. United States, </em>168 F.3d 1252, 1255 (11th Cir.1999), he argued he was not required to provide the VA with every possible theory of recovery. Rather, he had to provide only enough information to allow the agency to begin its own investigation, and he contended the VA\u2019s investigation should have revealed his alternative-diagnostic-procedures claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The district judge granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. First, the judge concluded, because Milbauer had not exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his alternative-diagnostic-procedures claim, she lacked jurisdiction over that claim. Notably, the judge did not make any factual findings as to whether the VA\u2019s investigation of Milbauer\u2019s claim should have revealed that theory of liability, pursuant to <em>Burchfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">As for Milbauer\u2019s allegations regarding the delay in receiving authorization for an open MRI, the judge concluded, although Milbauer\u2019s allegations were \u201ccouched in the language of tort law,\u201d he essentially had presented a claim relating to veterans\u2019 benefits. R2-64 at 10. The judge found Milbauer\u2019s grievance was with the VA\u2019s benefits procedure, not the medical treatment he received. Because Milbauer had presented a claim for delay of veterans\u2019 benefits, the judge found the VJRA precluded judicial review of that claim. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Milbauer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>diction. <em>Motta ex rel. A.M. v. United States, </em>717 F.3d 840, 843 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">A. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction under the VJRA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On appeal, Milbauer, pro se, argues the district judge erred by finding the delay in his diagnosis was a benefits issue barred by the VJRA. He contends his benefits were not in question; rather, his claim involved the delay of a medical diagnosis due to medical professionals\u2019 deviation from the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The VJRA provides the decision of the Secretary as to any \u201cquestions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the <em>provision of benefits ... </em>shall be final and conclusive and <em>may not be reviewed by any other official or by any court, </em>whether by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a) (emphasis added). The term \u201cbenefit\u201d means \u201cany payment, service, commodity, function, or status, entitlement to which is determined under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs pertaining to veterans and their dependents and survivors.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.3(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The VJRA does not completely eliminate judicial review of benefits decisions. Rather, determinations of the Secretary may be appealed to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d), whose ruling becomes the final decision of the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(a). Decisions of the Board may then be reviewed exclusively by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, an Article I court established by the VJRA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7251, 7252(a), 7266(a). Decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims are in turn appealable only to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(a), (c). The judgment of the Federal Circuit is then subject to review by the Supreme Court by writ of certiora-ri. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Accordingly, pursuant to the VJRA, \u201cjudicial review of a <em>particular application of the law made by the Secretary with respect to a veteran\u2019s entitlement to benefits </em>may be had only by appealing to the Board, then to the Court of Veterans Appeals, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Hall v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>85 F.3d 532, 534 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">We have analyzed the VJRA\u2019s jurisdictional scheme in a published opinion on only one occasion. In <em>Hall, </em>a veteran filed a complaint in district court after receiving notification that his disability benefits had been reduced in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.665, which required disability compensation be diminished during periods of incarceration for certain felony convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 532-33. The veteran alleged the reduction in his disability benefits constituted a tort and violated numerous constitutional provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 533. He specifically requested the district judge to find that 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.665 violated the Constitution. <em>Id. </em>The judge dismissed the complaint sua sponte for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the VJRA. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we held the district judge lacked jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of \u00a7 3.665, because the VJRA precluded judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions involving the interpretation or application of a regulation governing veterans\u2019 benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 534-35. Essentially, we held a plaintiff may not circumvent the VJRA\u2019s jurisdictional limitations by cloaking a benefits claim in constitutional terms. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">We have not considered whether a claim alleging medical malpractice actually concerns a benefits issue precluded by the VJRA. The D.C. Circuit, however, has established a relevant test to determine this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>issue. In <em>Thomas v. Principi, </em>a veteran filed suit in the district court and alleged the VA had committed medical malpractice under the FTCA and had caused him intentional emotional distress by failing to inform him of his \u201cworking diagnosis of schizophrenia.\u201d 394 F.3d 970, 972 (D.C.Cir.2005). The D.C. Circuit held the VJRA did not preclude judicial review of those FTCA claims, because the district judge could adjudicate those claims \u201cwithout determining first whether Thomas was entitled to a certain level of benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974 (citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted). The D.C. Circuit also explained, \u201c[b]ecause none of these claims alleges that the VA failed to pay for treatment (or even to provide for treatment), they raise no \u2018questions of law or fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The D.C. Circuit further acknowledged, however, that some of the plaintiffs claims were barred by the VJRA. <em>Id. </em>at 975. The VJRA barred judicial review of his claims that the VA had \u201cfailed to render the appropriate medical care services\u201d and that the VA\u2019s \u201ccontinuous and persistent deprivation and denial of known needed and necessary medical care treatment ... caused Plaintiff severe emotional distress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original). The court concluded the district judge lacked jurisdiction over those claims, because adjudicating those claims would have required the judge to decide whether the plaintiff was entitled to medical treatment in the face of a prior VA determination that he was not entitled to such benefit. <em>Id.; see also Broudy v. Mather, </em>460 F.3d 106, 115 (D.C.Cir.2006) (explaining the <em>Thomas </em>decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In deciding <em>Thomas, </em>the D.C. Circuit relied on its earlier decision in <em>Price v. United States, </em>228 F.3d 420, 422 (D.C.Cir.2000) (per curiam). <em>Thomas, </em>394 F.3d at 974. In <em>Price, </em>the D.C. Circuit held the VJRA barred the district judge from considering a veteran\u2019s claim for reimbursement of medical expenses, because in order for the judge to resolve whether the VA had failed to reimburse the veteran, it \u201cwould require the district court to determine first whether the VA acted properly in handling [the veteran\u2019s] request for reimbursement.\u201d <em>Price, </em>228 F.3d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In reviewing this issue, we must determine whether Milbauer\u2019s claim regarding the delay in his diagnosis alleged medical malpractice or raised a veterans\u2019 benefits issue. Milbauer alleged the VA failed \u201cto take reasonable steps to diagnose his rota-tor cuff injury within a reasonable time frame through an outside MRI\u201d and failed \u201cto have the appropriate paperwork prepared to authorize the outside MRI for a period of ten months.\u201d Rl-1 at 7-8. This is a benefits issue, because Milbauer sought a particular benefit \u2014 to have the VA pay for an open MRI performed at a non-VA facility \u2014 and he complained the process of obtaining that benefit caused the delay in his diagnosis. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.3(e) (defining the term \u201cbenefit\u201d). Although the VA did not actually deny Milbauer\u2019s request for an outside MRI, we agree with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere is no meaningful legal difference between a <em>delay </em>of benefits and an outright <em>denial </em>of benefits\u201d for purposes of the VJRA. <em>Mehrkens v. Blank, </em>556 F.3d 865, 870 (8th Cir.2009) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the VJRA barred judicial review, and the district judge correctly dismissed that claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Applying <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Price </em>to the facts of this case, we reach the same conclusion. The district judge could not adjudicate Milbauer\u2019s claim \u201cwithout determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>first whether [Milbauer] was entitled to a certain level of benefits,\u201d namely, whether he was entitled to an outside MRI, paid for by the VA. <em>Thomas, </em>394 F.3d at 974 (citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted). Furthermore, in order to adjudicate this claim, the judge would have to determine whether the Brooklyn VA properly handled and processed Milbauer\u2019s request to have the VA pay for an open MRI at a non-VA facility. <em>See Price, </em>228 F.3d at 422. Specifically, the judge would be required to determine whether the Brooklyn VA followed Policy No. 11-41 in processing Milbauer\u2019s request. Thus, Mil-bauer raised a benefits issue, not a medical-malpractice claim. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of this claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the VJRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">B. <em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Milbauer also argues on appeal the district judge erred by dismissing his claim regarding alternative diagnostic imaging, based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Relying on our decision in <em>Burchfield, </em>he contends he provided ample information during the administrative stage to permit the VA\u2019s investigating attorneys to inquire why the VA had not ordered alternative tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">A district judge has jurisdiction over an FTCA claim only if the plaintiff has (1) given the appropriate agency written notice of his claim, sufficient to enable the agency to investigate the claim; and (2) placed a value on his claim. <em>Burchfield, </em>168 F.3d at 1254-55. \u201c[A] claimant must give an administrative agency only enough information to allow the agency to begin its own investigation of the alleged events and explore the possibility of settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We do not require a claimant to provide an agency with a preview of his lawsuit \u201cby reciting every possible theory of recovery or every factual detail that might be relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Rather, the amount of information required is \u201cminimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, an administrative agency is deemed to be on notice not only of the theories of recovery stated in the claim, but of the theories of recovery that its reasonable investigation of the specific allegations in the claim should reveal. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, an agency need not \u201cundertake an independent search for injuries or theories of liability that are not closely related to the matters described in the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Milbauer argued in the district court, and reasserts on appeal, that he presented enough information in his administrative complaint to place the VA on notice of his claim regarding the failure to provide alternative diagnostic tools. The district judge did not conduct any analysis, however, as to whether Milbauer had provided sufficient information under <em>Burchfield </em>to overcome the FTCA\u2019s bar to unexhausted claims. Without additional findings from the district judge, we are unable to engage in meaningful appellate review of this issue. <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (stating district judges\u2019 orders \u201cshould contain sufficient explanations of their rulings so as to provide this Court with an opportunity to engage in meaningful appellate review\u201d). Moreover, although the government argues this claim is nevertheless barred by the VJRA, the district judge did not make any factual findings as to that ultimate determination. Accordingly, we remand for the district judge to analyze, in light of <em>Burchfield, </em>whether Milbauer exhausted his alternative-diagnostic-procedures claim, and if so, whether the VJRA precludes review of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-12\">. Although the relevant events occurred in Brooklyn, New York, Milbauer currently resides in Florida. The district judge denied the government\u2019s motion to transfer venue to the Eastern District of New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
