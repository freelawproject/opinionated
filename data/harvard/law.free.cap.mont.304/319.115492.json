(GCI), appeals from an order dismissing its claim entered by the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, in favor of the Defendants Chewculator, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>(Chewculator) and Carl Seifert (Seifert), individually, pursuant to the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"A55\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b63 GCI raises the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Did the District Court err in finding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a breach of contract dispute between two Montana corporations, and a non-Indian minority shareholder of one of the corporations, for work performed within the boundaries of the Flathead Reservation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b64 This dispute arose from a 1993 construction project on the Pablo Dam located in Lake County, and within the boundaries of the Flathead Indian Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b65 The project bid specifications, published by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (hereinafter CSKT) included a provision requiring that all contractors and subcontractors must adhere to a tribal policy \u201cto expand the opportunities for tribal members and Indian-owned businesses to receive preference in employment, subcontracts, and the procurement of equipment and supplies, in connection with work to be performed under this contract.\u201d The CSKT project rules also stated that the foregoing requirement \u201cshall apply to bidders, the Contractor, and subcontractors at any tier, regardless of their status as a non-Indian Business, an Indian-owned business, or a CSKT business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b66 CSKT awarded Dick Anderson Construction, a Montana corporation, the general contract in July 1993. Dick Anderson Construction then solicited bids for a subcontract to haul and screen gravel. GCI claims that it submitted the low bid, but the subcontract was awarded to Chewculator based on its claimed preference as an Indian-owned business. GCI does not dispute the fact that Chewculator\u2019s majority shareholder is Tina Marie Dupuis Walton, who is a Consolidated Salish and Kootenai tribal member. Carl Seifert, who formed the corporation in 1982 for the purported purpose of manufacturing and distributing novelty items, transferred a majority share interest to Walton in 1993.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u00b67 On October 1, 1993, GCI entered into a subcontract with Chewculator pursuant to Chewculator\u2019s contract with Dick Anderson Construction. GCI agreed to screen the gravel for the Pablo Dam project. GCI allegedly completed performance under the contract, and neither Chewculator nor Seifert paid the final bill of $16,000 submitted by GCI. Chewculator generally alleged that GCI failed to perform in accordance with contract specifications, causing both it and Dick Anderson Construction to incur damages, and therefore withheld final payment on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">\u00b68 On August 17, 1994, GCI filed an amended complaint in this matter, alleging breach of contract against Chewculator and Seifert, individually, and claiming damages in the amount of $16,800. Under Count II, GCI acknowledged that prior to entering the contract with Chewculator, Seifert informed GCI of Chewculator\u2019s preference with CSKT. GCI claimed Seifert had nevertheless agreed to personally guarantee payment under the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b69 On June 19, 1995, the District Court entered an order in favor of Seifert, ostensibly dismissing him, individually, from this matter under the personal guarantee claim based on a parol evidence ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b610 GCI moved in July of 1995 for a leave to amend its complaint again. In the second amended complaint dated July 14, 1995, GCI specifically alleged that due to Chewculator\u2019s and Seifert\u2019s commission of fraud in falsely claiming Chewculator was an Indian-owned business, GCI had been damaged in that it had not been awarded the subcontract with Dick Anderson Construction. Thus, GCI drew Seifert, individually, back into the controversy under this allegation. Under a separate count, GCI for the first time also claimed that Dick Anderson Construction had been negligent in not investigating Chewculator\u2019s status as an Indian-owned business prior to awarding it the subcontract over GCI, and in turn this alleged negligence had caused GCI to incur damage.</p>\n<p id=\"Aabg\">\u00b611 The District Court granted GCI\u2019s motion for leave to file the second amended complaint on October 11, 1996. The amended complaint was filed on October 15, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b612 GCI moved yet again for a leave to amend its complaint on April 8, 1997. Under Count III, GCI specifically and in more detail alleged that Chewculator\u2019s purported status as an Indian-owned business was fraudulent. Under Count IV, GCI also pursued a cause of action against Chewculator and Seifert under the designation of \u201cPIERCING THE CORPORATE VEIL.\u201d Further, the proposed amended complaint named as additional defendants Glacier Sand &amp; Gravel (a business owned by Seifert), Seifert Construction, Randy and Tina Walton (d/b/a Walton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Construction), L.A. Construction, Inc., and \u201cJohn Does 1-5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b613 In the face of the foregoing motion for leave to amend the complaint a third time, the Defendants moved to dismiss, claiming in part that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The Defendants contended that the CSKT tribal court, not the Twentieth Judicial District Court, had proper subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Chewculator contended that Tina Walton, a tribal member, was the majority shareholder in Chewculator, and therefore Chewculator was an Indian-owned corporation over which the District Court lacked jurisdiction. GCI countered that Chewculator was in fact the alter ego of Seifert, who transferred 51 percent of Chewculator\u2019s stock to Walton for the sole purpose of fraudulently gaining preference under CSKT\u2019s project guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b614 The District Court entered its order granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on November 15, 1999. After reciting the general rules for determining subject matter jurisdiction in cases such as this-involving a civil matter arising on tribal lands-the court reached its ultimate determination on two grounds. The court determined that the CSKT tribal court has \u201csole jurisdiction to hear all commercial disputes which arise on the reservation and involve a tribal defendant.\u201d Thus, the court determined that whether or not Chewculator was, in fact, an Indian-owned business, was a matter that must properly be addressed by the tribal court. The court then determined that any allegation of fraud or impropriety concerning CSKT\u2019s policy for giving preference to Indian-owned businesses \u201cnecessarily implicates tribal self-government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b615 The District Court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. GCI appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u00b616 When deciding a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a trial court must determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would vest the court with subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1998 MT 169, \u00b6 7, 289 Mont. 475, \u00b6 7, 962 P.2d 1167, \u00b6 7. A court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the court's interpretation of the law is correct. <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, \u00b6 7, 295 Mont. 357, \u00b6 7, 983 P.2d 968, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\u00b617 Motions to dismiss should be construed in a light most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>to the non-moving party and should not be granted unless it appears beyond a doubt that the non-moving party can prove no set of facts in support of its claim which would entitle it to relief. <em>Stenstrom v. State </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 321, 325, 930 P.2d 650, 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">ISSUE RAISED</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in finding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a breach of contract dispute between two Montana corporations, and a non-Indian minority shareholder of one of the corporations, for work performed within the boundaries of the Flathead Reservation?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b618 GCI raises the foregoing issue in light of its contention that in order to hold Seifert personally liable for Chewculator\u2019s debt, it seeks to pierce Chewculator\u2019s corporate veil due to fraud allegedly committed by Seifert against CSKT.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b619 GCI argues that a corporation, even if Indian-owned, is neither an \u201cIndian\u201d nor a \u201ctribal member\u201d for the purpose of determining subject matter jurisdiction. It has long been the rule in Montana, GCI contends, that a corporation is not a person. GCI contends, therefore, that the finding by the District Court that Chewculator\u2019s Indian-ownership was relevant was the court\u2019s \u201cfirst fundamental flaw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b620 On appeal, GCI insists that this dispute involves nothing more than one Montana corporation bringing a claim for money damages against another Montana corporation, and that the proper resolution of this dispute should inevitably allow GCI to avail itself to the personal assets of Seifert, a non-tribal member. Thus, this is \u201ca dispute between non-Indians\u201d that \u201cdoes not call into question any tribal act.\u201d GCI does not contest, however, that this dispute involves transactions taking place solely within the exterior boundaries of the Flathead Indian Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u00b621 GCI directs this Court\u2019s attention to a fairly thorough and accurate recital of federal law on the subject of tribal sovereignty and state court subject matter jurisdiction. In summary, the U.S. Supreme court, in <em>Montana v. U. S. </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 544, 101 S.Ct. 1245, 67 L.Ed.2d 493, delineated two exceptions to the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of non-members of a tribe. The first exception recognizes that a tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements. The second exception acknowledges a tribe\u2019s inherent power to exercise, civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe. <em>See generally Yellowstone County v. Pease </em>(9th Cir. 1996), 96 F.3d 1169, 1174 (citing and quoting <em>Montana v. U.S. </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 544, 565-66, 101 S.Ct. 1245, 1258, 67 L.Ed.2d 493).</p>\n<p id=\"AEE\">\u00b622 GCI argues that unless one of the <em>Montana </em>exceptions applies, there is no presumption of tribal jurisdiction. We do not disagree with GCI\u2019s rendition of federal authority which defines the interplay between CSKT\u2019s exercise of tribal sovereignty and this state\u2019s court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b623 In turn, GCI should not disagree that under the circumstances described here a Montana state court must follow the three-part test established in <em>State ex rel. Iron Bear v. District Court </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 335, 512 P.2d 1292, which was adopted from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williams v. Lee </em>(1959), 358 U.S. 217, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251. Under <em>Iron Bear, </em>to determine whether a state court may assume subject matter jurisdiction where tribal \u201cadjudicatory\u201d sovereignty over a civil dispute arising on a reservation may be involved, a court looks at whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">(1) the federal treaties and statutes applicable have preempted state jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">(2) the exercise of state jurisdiction would interfere with reservation self-government; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">(3) the Tribal Court is currently exercising jurisdiction or has exercised jurisdiction in such a manner as to preempt state jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\"><em>Iron Bear, </em>162 Mont. at 346, 512 P.2d at 1299. <em>See also In re Marriage of Skillen, </em>1998 MT 43, \u00b6 44, 287 Mont. 399, \u00b6 44, 956 P.2d 1, \u00b6 44 (distinguishing <em>Iron Bear\u2019s </em>adjudicatory sovereignty analysis from two-part \u201cregulatory dispute\u201d test adopted from <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665).</p>\n<p id=\"AX5\">\u00b624 The two-part <em>White Mountain Apache </em>test, as discussed by this Court in <em>Skillen, </em>similarly asks: (1) whether the assertion of subject matter jurisdiction by Montana\u2019s administrative and judicial tribunals is preempted by federal law, and (2) whether the assertion of subject matter jurisdiction by Montana\u2019s administrative and judicial tribunals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>would unlawfully infringe on the tribe\u2019s right to make its own laws and be ruled by these laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Marriage of Skillen, </em>\u00b6 44 (citing <em>First v. State Dept. of Soc. &amp; Rehab. Serv. ex rel. LaRoche </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 465, 471, 808 P.2d 467, 470).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">\u00b625 In following the <em>Iron Bear </em>test, the District Court correctly observed that, pursuant to U.S. Supreme Court case law, if either of the first two prongs under the three-part test are established, the state lacks subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Milbank Mut. Ins. Co. v. Eagleman </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 58, 61, 705 P.2d 1117, 1119. In framing its analysis under the second prong <em>o\u00ed Iron Bear, </em>the District Court turned to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Milbank </em>\u2014 which in turn relied on a Ninth Circuit decision. <em>See Milbank, </em>218 Mont. at 62, 705 P.2d at 1119-20 (citing <em>R.J. Williams Co. v. Fort Belknap Housing Auth. </em>(9th Cir. 1983), 719 F.2d 979, 983-84). <em>In Milbank, </em>we stated that a tribe\u2019s interest in self-government for civil matters arising within a reservation\u2019s boundaries can be implicated in one of two ways: (1) when a state or federal court resolves a dispute that impinges upon the tribe\u2019s right to adjudicate controversies arising within the \u201cprovince of the tribal courts\u201d; and (2) the dispute itself calls into question the validity or propriety of an act fairly attributable to the tribe as a government body. <em>Milbank, </em>218 Mont. at 62, 705 P.2d at 1119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b626 The District Court\u2019s rationale and ultimate determination under <em>Iron Bear </em>and <em>Milbank </em>can be distilled into two questions: was Chewculator an Indian-owned business for the purposes of preference under the subcontract with Dick Anderson Construction? and, did Chewculator or Seifert, individually, commit fraud upon CSKT or otherwise violate CSKT\u2019s preference policy to the detriment of GCI? Determining that the answers to both of these questions were integral to the ultimate resolution of this matter, and that both clearly implicated the jurisdiction of CSKT\u2019s tribal court as well as its policy-making authority, the court concluded it could not assert jurisdiction \u201cwithout violating the policy favoring tribal self-government or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>interfering with the Tribe\u2019s right to self-government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b627 We agree with the rationale expressed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ACB\">\u00b628 First, pursuant to our standard of review, there are several immutable facts that GCI has either conceded or cannot disprove: the dispute resulted from transactions taking place within the exterior boundaries of the Flathead Reservation; Walton is a tribal member; Seifert transferred a 51-percent ownership interest in Chewculator to Walton in July of 1993, prior to entering the subcontract with Dick Anderson Construction; in August of 1993, CSKT\u2019s contract officer approved Chewculator as a tribal member-owned business thus entitling it to preferential treatment; and, in October of 1993, GCI entered a subcontract with Chewculator aware that Chewculator had preferential status with CSKT.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b629 Another material factor in this matter that GCI has attempted to hedge is that its claims for relief require not only a determination of the rights and obligations under its contract with Chewculator, but also a determination of the validity of the preferential status afforded Chewculator by CSKT. GCI asserts, in essence, that if all parties concerned had played by the rules as set forth by CSKT, GCI-not Chewculator-would have received the subcontract with Dick Anderson Construction. Thus, GCI\u2019s fraud claim, as well as its negligence claim against Dick Anderson Construction, have little or nothing to do with its breach of contract dispute over Chewculator\u2019s nonpayment under its subcontract with GCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b630 With these factors in mind, and disregarding all questions concerning the merits of its fraud claim, we observe as did the District Court that GCI cannot avoid the inevitable obstacle it must overcome in order to prevail. Inevitably, GCI must prove that either Chewculator or Seifert or both committed fraud upon CSKT as alleged. As GCI\u2019s own \u201cstatement of issue\u201d sets forth in its brief, the basis of its claim for piercing Chewculator\u2019s corporate veil is the \u201cfraud by the non-Indian minority shareholder <em>against the Tribe.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). To prevail, GCI must demonstrate that Chewculator was not \u201cIndian-owned\u201d under the written requirements established by CSKT.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b631 Contrary to GCI\u2019s argument, therefore, the factual and legal determination of what constitutes \u201cIndian-owned\u201d for the purpose of gaining preferential treatment in contracts with CSKT or in subcontracts with contractors in privity with CSKT, as set forth in CSKT\u2019s own written statement of governing rules and policies, clearly raises the presumption of tribal jurisdiction-either regulatory or adjudicatory-under both <em>Montana </em>exceptions. <em>See Montana, </em>450 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>at 565-66, 101 S.Ct. at 1258; <em>Pease, </em>96 F.3d at 1174 (tribe may regulate consensual relationships between non-Indians and the tribe or its members; and tribe has inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct directly effects the political integrity of the tribe).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">\u00b632 Likewise, the determination of whether a business is \u201cIndian-owned\u201d invokes both criteria set forth in <em>Milbank </em>for determining the second prong <em>ofIron Bear: </em>(1) whether a state court would impinge upon the tribe\u2019s right to adjudicate controversies arising within the \u201cprovince of the tribal courts;\u201d and (2) whether the dispute itself calls into question the validity or propriety of an act fairly attributable to the tribe as a government body. <em>See Milbank, </em>218 Mont. at 62, 705 P.2d at 1119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b633 Although this Court is not being asked to interpret CSKT\u2019s preference policy, such a legal interpretation would be-contrary to GCI\u2019s argument-ineoifabie in order to grant the specific relief requested by GCI under its amended complaints. To assume jurisdiction and decide whether a corporation had committed fraud upon CSKT or a contractor in privity with CSKT-or decide whether a corporation should or should not be deemed \u201cIndian-owned\u201d in spite of a prior determination by CSKT-would clearly require that a District Court in Montana impinge upon CSKT\u2019s right to adjudicate controversies arising within the province of its own courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b634 For the sake of illustration, under our standard of review, even if we assume that all allegations introduced by GCI in this matter are true, it is nevertheless quite possible that Seifert\u2019s and Chewculator\u2019s course of dealing was perfectly acceptable with CSKT in light of its laws and policies governing the administration of contracts on tribal lands. Such a determination-regardless of whether GCI believes it involves fraud, or it is unfair, or it gives rise to bad public policy-is the essence of CSKT\u2019s sovereign right to adjudicate disputes involving commercial activities that occur within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. <em>See generally Marriage of Skillen, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante </em>(1987), 480 U.S. 9, 18, 107 S.Ct. 971, 977, 94 L.Ed.2d 10, 16).</p>\n<p id=\"AG_\">\u00b635 Next, under the second factor identified in <em>Milbank, </em>the fraud dispute instigated by GCI calls into question the validity or propriety of acts fairly attributable to CSKT as a government body-that is, the determination of what is or is not an \u201cIndian-owned\u201d business, and what preferences should be afforded to tribal members engaged in contractual relations with CSKT.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00b636  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court correctly set forth and applied the law of tribal sovereignty and state court subject matter jurisdiction to the case at bar in reaching the determination that GCI\u2019s action must, as a matter of law, be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b637 Asa final argument, GCI claims that at the very least, the District Court erred by making its determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction without a preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b638' We do not disagree with GCI that this Court has stated that where material \u201cjurisdictional facts\u201d are disputed, the appropriate procedure is a preliminary hearing by the District Court pursuant to Rule 12(d), M.R.Civ.P. <em>See Minuteman Aviation, Inc. v. Swearingin </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 207, 212, 772 P.2d 305, 308-09 (addressing motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction). Further, Rule 12(d), M.R.Civ.P, provides that the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) \u201cshall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b639 Our standard of review for subject matter jurisdiction claims-in contrast to the <em>de novo </em>review employed by the Ninth Circuit to which GCI cites-requires that the trial court determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would vest the court with subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Liberty Northwest, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>and compare with Ma v. Reno </em>(9th Cir.1997), 114 F.3d 128, 130. As the above discussion reveals, even if a court presumed all allegations made by GCI were true, a Montana court could not assume subject matter jurisdiction as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AXA\">\u00b640 Also, the procedural record reveals that GCI on September 7,1999, gave notice to the court that it intended to file for a writ of supervisory control, unless the court would <em>\u201ceither </em>issue its Orders <em>or </em>schedule an emergency hearing on all pending motions,\u201d which included the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Emphasis added). GCI filed a nearly identical notice with the District Court on July 26, 1999. Earlier, on June 21, 1999, GCI merely requested that the court \u201crule on the following Motions.\u201d Prior to that, on April 7,1999, GCI gave notice that the motions \u201care at issue and ripe for ruling.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that, given the choice offered by GCI\u2019s \u201capplication,\u201d the court did not err by issuing its order rather than scheduling and conducting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> According to its articles of incorporation, the corporate name <em>\u201cChewculator\u201d </em>derives from its product, a \u201cretail tobacco can calculator,\u201d which Chewculator, Inc., intended to distribute wholesale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\"> We observe that the District Court did not err in not citing to the <em>White Mountain Apache </em>test in determining that Walton\u2019s status as a tribal member and maj ority shareholder of Chewculator involved issues of CSKT\u2019s right to self government in terms of policy making, rather than its adjudicatory function. The second prong of either <em>Iron Bear </em>or <em>White Mountain Apache </em>would essentially yield the same results here. Both focus on whether a Montana state court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction would interfere with a tribe\u2019s sovereign right of self-government in either adjudicatory or regulatory matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
