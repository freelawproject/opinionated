McGimpsey (McGimpsey) for unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying legal proceedings, pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. McGimpsey appeals this sanction. We affirm and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\u00b62 First Interstate Bank (Conservator) is the court-appointed Conservator of the Estate of Shirley L. Bayers (Bayers), who is incapacitated due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. McGimpsey purports to be Ms. Bayers\u2019 private attorney, claiming Bayers hired him after conservatorship proceedings were underway. When McGimpsey began expressing an interest in participating in matters involving Bayers\u2019 estate, Conservator became concerned about the extent of McGimpsey\u2019s involvement in Bayers\u2019 affairs. Conservator\u2019s attorney therefore wrote to him requesting a copy of any legal documents he had that may have been executed by Bayers. McGimpsey responded, saying he could provide only \u201can abstract\u201d of his attorney-client agreement with Bayers, and declining to make any further disclosures, citing the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">\u00b63 On February 16, 2000, following a hearing on Conservator\u2019s annual accounting at which McGimpsey was present, the District Court informed McGimpsey that Conservator was statutorily entitled to the documents it had requested from him. The District Court then instructed Conservator to put its request in writing. The next day, counsel for Conservator sent McGimpsey a letter, once again, requesting documents he possessed having to do with Bayers\u2019 affairs. This letter asked McGimpsey to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">[C]opies of any estate plans you have for Shirley L. Bayers, including, but not limited to: any wills; powers of attorney; trusts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of which she is a settler; and any contract, transfer, or joint ownership arrangement with provisions for payment or transfer of benefits or interest at her death of another. In the event that you have knowledge of any estate plans that are not in your possession, please provide the name and address of the person in possession of those documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The letter went on as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">Furthermore, any person taking actions based upon a Durable Power of Attorney is accountable to the conservator. See Mont. Code Ann. \u00a772-5-501(2). Thus, in the event that you are taking direction from or have an attorney client relationship with any person claiming to be Ms. Bayers\u2019 agent or attorney-in-fact under a Durable Power of Attorney for Shirley L. Bayers, please provide a copy of any engagement or retention letters as well as copies of all bills or account statements for services provided under the Durable Power of Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">If you choose not to provide the requested information within ten days, the conservator will be forced to seek the Court\u2019s intervention. In the event the conservator is required to file a motion with the Court, the conservator will seek sanctions in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b64 McGimpsey ignored Conservator\u2019s request. Accordingly, on April 24, 2000, Conservator filed a motion to compel McGimpsey to provide the requested information, together with a request for attorney fees necessitated by the motion. On April 27,2000, McGimpsey responded with a letter threatening Conservator\u2019s counsel with Rule 11 sanctions if she did not withdraw the motion to compel. Among other things, McGimpsey stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">[T]o put this in language that I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll understand, it is my profound and unwavering belief that your Motion and Brief were not written and filed after reasonable inquiry; are not well grounded in fact; and are not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law.... (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">Before you fall too deeply in love with your current Motion, I would suggest that you secure a copy of (and very, very carefully read) the transcript from the Hearing of February 16, 2000. To analogize: Do you remember the scene from one of the Star Wars\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>movies where young Luke was being told to \u2018feel the force; listen to his feelings?\u2019 Well ..., \u2018read the transcript.\u2019 What you will magically find is that my well-prepared and surgically scripted remarks will put an end to you and Damon\u2019s [Guardian ad litem] continuous and unnecessary billing for \u2018housekeeping matters.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">... [I]f you\u2019re anxious to run with the tall dog litigators in your firm, or for that matter, you need productive billable hours, may I suggest that the following subject areas directed to the financial management of Shirley\u2019s account are ripe for the application of your considerable talent....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">There followed a laundry list of complaints and criticisms of Conservator\u2019s handling of Bayers\u2019 estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b65 On May 8, 2000, McGimpsey filed a motion to strike scandalous, immaterial and irrelevant content in Conservator\u2019s motion and brief. His motion was denied. On June 1, 2000, after the motion to compel was fully briefed, the District Court granted Conservator\u2019s motion to compel and for attorney fees. The District Court indicated in its order that if the amount of attorney fees was contested, a hearing would be held to determine the amount of fees to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b66 On June 7,2000, McGimpsey filed a motion to alter or amend the District Court\u2019s order granting attorney fees. Conservator opposed the motion. The District. Court denied McGimpsey\u2019s motion, and ordered a hearing on the amount of the. sanction to be awarded, \u201cunless the parties can agree to $1,000 in attorney fees being assessed.\u201d Conservator agreed to accept the District Court\u2019s suggestion. McGimpsey did not. A hearing on the amount of fees was therefore scheduled for July 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b67 On July 18,2000, McGimpsey filed a motion to vacate the hearing and moved to establish a discovery schedule regarding attorney fees. The District Court denied the motion at the beginning of the July 27, 2000 hearing. Conservator\u2019s counsel then testified as to her reasonable attorney fees incurred due to McGimpsey\u2019s conduct. On July 31,2000, the District Court issued its order requiring McGimpsey to pay Bayers\u2019 estate $1,500.00 in attorney fees. McGimpsey filed another motion to alter or amend the order determining attorney fees. The District Court denied the motion on August 30,2000. McGimpsey now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b68 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by sanctioning McGimpsey $1,500.00 under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, for unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and vexatiously multiplying the proceedings in District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b69 The District Court awarded fees to Conservator under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">An attorney or party to any court proceeding who, in the determination of the court, multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorney fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">It is within a district court\u2019s discretion to award attorney fees under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. <em>Rocky Mountain Ent. v. Pierce Flooring </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 282, 301, 951 P.2d 1326, 1338. We review a district court\u2019s determination to grant attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Tigart v. Thompson </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 156, 159-60, 796 P.2d 582, 584. This Court generally defers to the discretion of the district court regarding sanctions because it is in the best position to know whether parties are disregarding the rights of others and which sanction is most appropriate. <em>McKenzie v. Scheeler </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 500, 506, 949 P.2d 1168, 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b610 McGimpsey argues that the District Court erred in ordering him to pay fees under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, because in a civil action such as \u2022this one, all discovery and discovery disputes, including sanctions, must be governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, and not by \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. He also argues that it was error for the District Court to sanction him because it made no findings of fact as to his unreasonable and vexatious conduct. Lastly, he asserts that Conservator totally failed to carry its burden of proof as to the amount of time its attorney spent due to his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b611 Conservator counters that the issue before the District Court was not a discovery dispute because there was no litigation and no adversity of parties as envisioned by the rules governing discovery. The only party involved was Ms. Bayers. Conservator also notes that the District Court examined Conservator\u2019s request for fees, heard testimony, and applied the seven factors set forth in <em>Audit Services, Inc. v. Haugen </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 9, 591 P.2d 1105. Finally, Conservator points out that the District Court specifically found McGimpsey\u2019s conduct to be unreasonable and vexatious, as contemplated by \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b612 Section 37-61-421, MCA, was modeled after 28 USCS \u00a7 1927, with only minor changes made to clarify its applicability to <em>pro se </em>litigants as well as attorneys, and to establish that attorney fees may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>awarded as damages. <em>Hearing on </em>HB <em>541 Before the House Judiciary Committee, </em>49th Legis. (1985) (statement of Judge Robert M. Hotter, 19th Judicial District). It was adopted in 1985 to provide redress against persons who abuse the judicial process for their convenience, tactical reasons, personal gain, or the satisfaction of vengeful motives. <em>Hearing on </em>HB <em>541 Before the House Judiciary Committee, </em>49th Legis. (1985) (statement of Judge Michael Keedy, 11th Judicial District).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b613 Contrary to McGimpsey\u2019s assertions, we have upheld the award of attorney fees for discovery violations under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Rager </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 361, 366, 868 P.2d 625, 628 (failure to appear at hearing and refusal to provide discovery responses warranted sanction under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA); <em>also see, Tigart, </em>244 Mont. at 159-60, 796 P.2d at 584-85 (withholding of requested discovery information requiring a second trial warranted sanction under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA). The point in court proceedings at which the vexatious conduct occurs is not the issue. Rather, it is the unreasonable multiplication of court proceedings that is germane.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u00b614  Rules 34 and 37, M.R.Civ.P., anticipate the existence of a dispute between opposing parties. The underlying matter here is not an adversarial proceeding. <em>See, In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 14 (a petition to appoint a guardian is not an adversarial proceeding). Conservatorship proceedings are established to promote the best interests of the protected person. <em>See, </em>\u00a7 72-5-401 <em>et seq., </em>MCA. Conservator was authorized to request the documentation from McGimpsey with or without court authorization or confirmation. Section 72-5-427, MCA. Formal discovery proceedings were not required for Conservator to obtain documents deemed relevant to the protected person\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"Ard\">\u00b615 McGimpsey intentionally led Conservator to believe he possessed documents relevant to Bayers\u2019 estate. When Conservator first requested a copy of any engagement letter, McGimpsey stated he could provide only an \u201cabstract\u201d of the attorney-client agreement because of the other non-conservatorship personal legal matters which he was currently working on for Ms. Bayers. This led to Conservator\u2019s justifiable request to examine representation agreements between McGimpsey and Bayers, which McGimpsey simply refused to answer. On appeal, McGimpsey contends that his \u201cno response\u201d to Conservator\u2019s request was a response, and should have been construed by Conservator as an indication he did not have any of the documents she requested. We find this argument specious. McGimpsey could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>given a straightforward answer. Instead, he chose to force a needless multiplication of proceedings and the pointless involvement of the District Court in this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b616  The District Court found that McGimpsey prolonged this matter unreasonably and vexatiously, thus meeting the requirements set forth in \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. The District Court noted it would have been very simple for McGimpsey to 'write a one-sentence response that he did not have the information requested. This would have ended the inquiry, and would have obviated the necessity for the numerous briefs, hearings and legal proceedings which ensued due to McGimpsey\u2019s recalcitrance. The District Court justifiably found that McGimpsey was \u201cplaying games\u201d and \u201cpushing Ms. Bennett\u2019s [Conservator\u2019s counsel] buttons\u201d by forcing this matter forward. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by assessing attorney fees against McGimpsey pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. The District Court is affirmed on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b617 Unfortunately, McGimpsey\u2019s inclination to prolong this matter unreasonably and vexatiously did not end in the District Court. McGimpsey forced this matter forward on appeal, unnecessarily requiring the respondents to expend additional attorney fees defending the order of the District Court. As already noted, \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, permits the Court to require an attorney who unreasonably multiplies the proceedings to satisfy personally the expenses and attorney fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct. We conclude that McGimpsey should be responsible under this statute for respondent\u2019s expenses and attorney fees incurred on appeal as well as below. Accordingly, we remand to the District Court for the assessment against McGimpsey of the respondent\u2019s costs and attorney fees incurred herein.</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b326-7\">JUSTICE REGNIER</author>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">concurring and dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b618 I respectfully dissent to that part of the Court's opinion which awards attorneys fees on appeal. Although this Court certainly has authority to award said fees pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, as well as Rule 32 of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, I note that the Respondent First Interstate Bank does not request fees on appeal. In the instant case I would not award fees on appeal sua sponte. In all other aspects, I agree with the Court's opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
