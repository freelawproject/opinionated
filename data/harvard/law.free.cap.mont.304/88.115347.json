The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">It is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence be amended to forty (40) years in the Montana State Prison, plus an additional ten (10) years for the use of a dangerous weapon during the commission of the offense, to be served consecutively to the underlying sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The reason for the amendment is that the sentence is clearly inadequate in that it omits the statutory weapons enhancement sentence as provided for in \u00a746-18-221, MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b555-11\">Chairman, Hon.
