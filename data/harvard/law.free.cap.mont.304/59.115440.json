The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">It is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended to a four (4) year commitment to the Department of Corrections, with no recommendation to the Department of Corrections for placement of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">The reason for the amendment is to bring this sentence into compliance with the court's statutory authority at the time of the disposition hearing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b525-17\">Chairman, Hon.
