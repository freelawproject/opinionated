The District Court for the Ninth Judicial District, Toole County, granted summary judgment in favor of Rhone-Poulenc. On appeal, we held that because the McAlpines\u2019 negligence claim was based solely on insufficient warnings in the herbicide\u2019s label, that claim was preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), but the McAlpines\u2019 claims of breach of warranty and strict liability were not preempted by FIFRA to the extent that those claims did not rely on representations made in the herbicide\u2019s label. <em>See McAlpine v. Rhone-Poulenc Ag. Co. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 224, 947 P.2d 474. Following that appeal, the McAlpines proceeded to trial against Rhone-Poulenc on a theory of strict products liability. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Rhone-Poulenc and the McAlpines appealed. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in instructing the jury that it must find that the herbicide was in a \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d rather than instructing that it must find that the herbicide was merely in a \u201cdefective condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in refusing to allow the McAlpines to introduce evidence of the herbicide\u2019s label language after Rhone-Poulenc\u2019s witnesses violated a motion in limine by referencing product labeling during examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">\u00b65 3. Whether FIFRA renders evidence of the herbicide\u2019s label inadmissible where the cold damage effects of the herbicide on crops ar\u00e9 not regulated by FIFRA or the EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b66 The McAlpines are farmers in Sunburst, Montana, near the Canadian border. In May and June 1990, the McAlpines applied a herbicide known as Weedone LV6 to their barley and spring wheat crops. Weedone LV6 falls within a chemical family of herbicides manufactured by Rhone-Poulenc that are known as \u201cphenoxys\u201d or, generically, as 2,4-D. Rhone-Poulenc\u2019s authorized dealer, Ben Taylor, Inc., sold Weedone LV6 to the McAlpines. For several weeks after the McAlpines applied this herbicide to their crops, the night time temperatures fell to near freezing. Soon after, the McAlpines discovered that their crops had been severely damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b67 On July 1, 1992, the McAlpines filed a complaint against Rhone-Poulenc and Ben Taylor, Inc. alleging negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, and strict liability. The McAlpines argued that Rhone-Poulenc and Ben Taylor, Inc. were negligent for failing to advise the McAlpines of the substantial risk of harm if cool or cold temperatures occurred after application of Weedone LV6 to their crops; that they breached express and implied warranties because Weedone LV6 was not suitable and fit for the purposes for which it was sold and intended to be used; and that they were strictly liable for the McAlpines\u2019 damages because Weedone LV6 is a defective product as its propensity to damage or destroy crops in conjunction with cold weather is a danger outside the expectations of the ordinary consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b68 On April 4,1996 and April 17,1996, respectively, Rhone-Poulenc and Ben Taylor, Inc. filed Motions for Summary Judgment arguing that the McAlpines\u2019 claims are based upon allegedly inadequate pesticide labeling and as such are expressly preempted by FIFRA because FIFRA prohibits any state law requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required by the EPA. The McAlpines filed their response on June 10,1996, arguing that FIFRA preemption must be narrowly construed and limited to claims that are exclusively based upon omissions or inclusions in a product\u2019s label.</p>\n<p id=\"A0d\">\u00b69 A hearing on this matter was conducted on July 31,1996.Thefol-lowing day, the District Court filed its Order on Summary Judgment wherein it concluded that because the McAlpines\u2019 claims are all based on the alleged failure of Rhone-Poulenc and Ben Taylor, Inc. to adequately warn users of Weedone LV6 of the risk of using this product during cold temperatures, all of the McAlpines\u2019 causes of action are preempted under FIFRA. Consequently, the court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Rhone-Poulenc\u2019s and Ben Taylor, Inc.\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b610 The McAlpines appealed the District Court\u2019s order to this Court. On October 29, 1997, we issued an opinion wherein we held that FIFRA preempts state tort claims to the extent they arise from an omission or inclusion in the product\u2019s label, but claims alleging a product, manufacturing, or design defect; claims alleging negligent design, testing, or manufacturing; or claims alleging breach of warranty that do not rely on such an omission or inclusion in the product\u2019s label, are not preempted. <em>See McAlpine, </em>285 Mont. at 230, 947 P.2d at 477. Hence, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling that the McAlpines\u2019 claims of negligence are preempted by FIFRA. However, we reversed and remanded to allow the McAlpines to go forward with their claims of breach of warranty and strict liability to the extent that they do not rely on representations made in the product\u2019s label. <em>McAlpine, </em>285 Mont. at 234, 947 P.2d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b611 On August 17,1998, the McAlpines filed Alternative Motions in Limine wherein they moved the District Court for an order barring Rhone-Poulenc from introducing evidence or argument at trial suggesting that the McAlpines failed to comply with the label instructions for Weedone LV6 or, in the alternative, permitting both parties to introduce evidence and argument regarding the McAlpines\u2019 compliance or noncompliance with the product\u2019s label instructions. The District Court ultimately granted the motion by barring all parties from discussing or introducing evidence of the contents of the label.</p>\n<p id=\"A5H\">\u00b6 12 Prior to trial, the McAlpines and Ben Taylor, Inc. reached a settlement agreement and all claims against Ben Taylor, Inc. were dismissed with prejudice. The McAlpines proceeded to trial against the remaining defendant, Rhone-Poulenc, on a theory of strict products liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b613 At trial, the McAlpines claimed that Weedone LV6 was a defective product because its propensity to damage or destroy crops in conjunction with cold weather is a danger outside the expectations of the ordinary consumer. Both the McAlpines\u2019 expert witness and Rhone-Poulenc\u2019s expert witness testified that phenoxy herbicides like Weedone LV6 can cause crop damage when applied in a period of cold temperature. Rhone-Poulenc acknowledged that the crop damage was caused by the phenoxy herbicide, but they argued that such damage was not \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d and that it is only when a product is sufficiently dangerous that liability exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u00b614 The jury returned a verdict in favor of Rhone-Poulenc and the McAlpines appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court erred in instructing the jury that it must find that the herbicide was in a \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d rather than instructing that it must find that the herbicide was merely in a \u201cdefective condition\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b616 A district court has discretion regarding the instructions it gives or refuses to give to a jury and we will not reverse a district court on the basis of its instructions absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 288, \u00b6 44, 297 Mont. 33, \u00b6 44, 991 P.2d 915, \u00b6 44 <em>(citingFillinger v. Northwestern </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 71, 76, 938 P.2d 1347, 1350-51). In reviewing whether a particular jury instruction was properly given or refused, we consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial. <em>Federated Mutual, </em>\u00b6 44. The party assigning error to a district court\u2019s instruction must show prejudice in order to prevail. Prejudice will not be found if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>Federated Mutual, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b617 The jury instructions in question in this case are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">One who sells any product in a <em>defective condition unreasonably dangerous </em>is liable for property damage caused by the product to the ultimate user or consumer\u2019s property if the seller is engaged in the business of selling a product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">This rule applies although the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of its product and the user or consumer did not buy the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">It is no defense for the Seller that the consumer assumed the risk of using the product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Jury Instruction No. 11 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">A product is in a <em>\u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d </em>when the product is in a condition not contemplated by the consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to the product\u2019s characteristics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Jury Instruction No. 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">\u00b618 The McAlpines argue that the District Court erred in instructing the jury that liability only exists where a given product is in a \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>fective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d because the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d language is confusing, duplicative and should have been omitted. The McAlpines point out that these instructions deviate from the Montana Pattern Instructions used in strict products liability cases and that the omission of the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d language in the MPI better reflects our decision in <em>McJunkin v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Systems </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 432, 748 P.2d 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b619 In <em>McJunkin, </em>the buyers of a mobile home brought suit against the manufacturer and the seller of the mobile home alleging various claims by reason of the numerous defects they discovered in the home after they moved in. Following a jury trial, the District Court entered judgment against the manufacturer on a claim of negligence and against the seller on a claim of negligent misrepresentation. On appeal, the buyer argued that the District Court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the theory of strict liability. <em>McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 435-36, 748 P.2d at 912-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b620 We held in <em>McJunkin </em>that a product is defective if it is unreasonably dangerous. <em>McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 445, 748 P.2d at 918 (citation omitted). But, a plaintiff is not required to show that a product is defective and also that it is unreasonably dangerous because establishing that a product is unreasonably dangerous is merely a means of proving that it is defective. Quoting Keeton, <em>Product Liability and the Meaning of Defect, </em>5 St. Mary\u2019s L.J. 30, 32 (1973), we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">It is unfortunate perhaps that Section 402A of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>provides that as a basis for recovery it must be found that the product was both \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d when as a matter of fact the term \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d was meant only as a definition of defect. The phrase was not intended as setting forth two requirements but only one ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af5\"><em>McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 443-44, 748 P.2d at 917. Thus, we concluded that the \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d language creates a vague and imprecise dual test. <em>McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 443-44, 748 P.2d at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b621 The McAlpines point out that <em>McJunkin </em>was decided at a time when Montana utilized the common law test for strict products liability set forth in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A (1965), and that the 1987 Legislature statutorily adopted the Restatement test by enacting \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>(1) As used in this section, \u201cseller\u201d means a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">(2) A person who sells a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to a user or consumer or to the property of a user or consumer is liable for physical harm caused by the product to the ultimate user or consumer or to the user\u2019s or consumer\u2019s property if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">(b) the product is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">(3) The provisions of subsection (2) apply even if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">(a) the seller exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">(b) the user or consumer did not buy the product from or enter into any contractual relation with the seller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">(4) Subsection (2)(b) does not apply to a claim for relief based upon improper product design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\u00b622 Rhone-Poulenc argues that <em>McJunkin </em>was decided upon the pre-statute common law of strict products liability and that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, supersedes the holding of <em>McJunkin. </em>The McAlpines argue, on the other hand, that the statute did not substantively change the test for determining when a product is defective, thus they maintain that the <em>McJunkin </em>holding continues to apply today.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">\u00b623 We agree with the McAlpines that since <em>McJunkin </em>interpreted the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A, and since \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, mirrors \u00a7 402A, <em>McJunkin, </em>in effect, interprets that statute as well. We conclude, as we did in <em>McJunkin, </em>that the \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d language creates a vague and imprecise dual test.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">\u00b624 In <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 916 P.2d 122, we determined that legal concepts, which in that case included \u201cproximate cause,\u201d \u201clegal cause,\u201d and \u201creasonable foreseeability,\u201d should not be submitted to a lay jury because they can only serve to confuse jurors and distract them from deciding cases based on their merits. For that reason, we recommended that such terms are best left to arguments between attorneys for consideration by judges or justices. <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 371-72, 916 P.2d at 139-40. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>We pointed out that the only purpose which is properly served by the instructions to the jury is \u201cto assure a decision consistent with the evidence and the law\u201d and that this can only be accomplished \u201cwhen the instructions are as plain, clear, concise, and as brief as possible.\u201d <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 373, 916 P.2d at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b625 Likewise, the \u201cdefective condition.unreasonably dangerous\u201d language should not have been submitted to the jury in this case because it is not plain, clear and concise. As McAlpines noted in their brief on appeal, the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d language could be construed to mean that, in addition to proving a product is defective, the plaintiff must prove that it is \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d Such an instruction creates a new hurdle to plaintiffs in strict products liability cases which was never intended under this Court\u2019s interpretation of strict products liability law. We have previously held that a plaintiff can establish that a product is defective by proving that it is \u201ccapable of causing injury to the user beyond that which would be expected by the ordinary user.\u201d <em>Wise v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 336, 340, 943 P.2d 1310, 1312 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b626  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in instructing the jury that it must find that Weedone LV6 was in a \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d rather than instructing that it must find that Weedone LV6 was merely in a \u201cdefective condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b627 <em>Whether the District Court erred in refusing to allow the McAlpines to introduce evidence of the herbicide\u2019s label language after Rhone-Poulenc\u2019s witnesses violated a motion in limine by referencing product labeling during examination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">\u00b628 Prior to trial, the McAlpines moved alternatively for a motion in limine that would either prevent Rhone-Poulenc from referencing the herbicide\u2019s label, or allow all parties to discuss the label. The District Court granted the motion by barring all parties from discussing or introducing evidence of the contents of the label based in part on our prior decision in <em>McAlpine </em>as it related to FIFRA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b629 At trial, Rhone-Poulenc\u2019s expert witness referenced the herbicide\u2019s label and implied that a user\u2019s failure to apply the herbicide according to the directions on the label could explain the type of damage seen in this case. Consequently, the McAlpines argued in the trial court and now on appeal that they should have been permitted rebuttal to establish that they complied with the herbicide\u2019s labeling requirements and instructions in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u00b630  In <em>Sleath v. West Mont, </em>2000 MT 381, [304 Mont. 1], 16 P.2d 1042, we reversed our prior decision in <em>McAlpine </em>and held that FIFRA does not preempt state common law damage actions. Consequently, based on our decision in <em>Sleath, </em>neither party is barred from referencing the label language in further proceedings in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b631 <em>Whether FIFRA renders evidence of the herbicide\u2019s label inadmissible where the cold damage effects of the herbicide on crops are not regulated by FIFRA or the EPA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b632 The McAlpines argue that because the EPA does not regulate a herbicide\u2019s propensities to damage the crops which it is designed to protect, federal preemption should not apply. Hence the McAlpines maintain that there was no valid reason to exclude the language of the label from the evidence. Rhone-Poulenc argues on the other hand that the McAlpines did not properly preserve this issue for appeal and that, even if the issue had been properly preserved for appeal, the evidence would bar their claim under FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u00b633 As we noted in our discussion in the previous issue, we held in our recent decision in <em>Sleath </em>that FIFRA does not preempt state common law damage actions and we therefore reversed our prior decision in <em>McAlpine. </em>Consequently, based on our decision in <em>Sleath, </em>evidence of the product label is admissible in further proceedings in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b634 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, LEAPHART, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b63-11\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ATm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">\u00b635 I respectfully dissent from the entirety of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AmR\">\u00b636 The Court\u2019s resolution of issues 2 and 3 is based on the recent decision in <em>Sleath v. West Mont, </em>2000 MT 381 (decided December 28, 2000). My dissent on those issues in this case is based on my dissent in <em>Sleath, </em>which need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">\u00b637 As stated by the Court, issue 1 in the present case is whether the District Court erred in instructing the jury that it must find the herbicide was in a \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous,\u201d rather than merely in a \u201cdefective condition,\u201d to impose liability on Rhone-Poulenc. The Court relies on <em>McJunkin </em>in concluding the trial court erred in instructing the jury by using the precise statutory lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>guage from \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA. I disagree. I would hold neither that case nor Montana Pattern Instruction (MPI) 7.00 \u2014 relied on by the McAlpines \u2014 can trump the statutory language enacted by the Legislature in \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, independently of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>McJunkin. </em>On that basis, I would determine that the instructions given, taken in their entirety, stated the applicable law of the case and, consequently, the District Court did not err in giving Instruction Nos. 11 and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b638 I begin by observing that Instruction No. 11 merely recites the \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d statutory language contained in \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, which has existed and been effective since October 1,1987. Since that instruction contains no definition of the statutory phrase to aid the jury in its determination, the District Court in the present case also gave Instruction No. 12, which states simply that a product is in a \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d when it \u201cis in a condition not contemplated by the consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to the product\u2019s characteristics.\u201d Nothing in that definition is confusing; indeed, it is plain, clear and concise and provides a common sense definition of the statutory phrase. Given that the phrase challenged by the McAlpines is defined in Instruction No. 12,1 disagree with the Court that the phrase at issue is the kind of legal concept \u2014 such as \u201cproximate cause\u201d or \u201clegal cause\u201d \u2014 we held in <em>Busta </em>should not be submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b639 Nor do I agree with the Court\u2019s reliance on McJunkin, a case tried and appealed prior to the effective date of \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, in resolving the issue before us here. The Court is correct that the appellant in that case argued the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the theory of strict liability. <em>See McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 435, 748 P.2d at 912. The issue there, however, had nothing to do with whether given jury instructions were or were riot appropriate, because the question arose in the context of whether the theory had been properly pled and, then, whether there was evidence to support the giving of any jury instructions on the subject at all. <em>See McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 442, 748 P.2d at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b640 Focusing on the latter subissue and clarifying that it was a common law issue requiring us to look to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, we noted that \u00a7 402A bases liability on a product \u201cin a defective condition unreasonably dangerous.\u201d We observed that the commentaries to \u00a7 402A, rather than the actual language in the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tion, set forth a dual test which require a plaintiff to prove the product is defective and also unreasonably dangerous. <em>See McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 442-44, 748 P.2d at 916-17. Relying on Professor Keeton\u2019s criticism, we rejected the position taken in the commentaries and held that a plaintiff need not prove that a product is defective <em>and </em>unreasonably dangerous in all cases. <em>McJunkin, </em>229 Mont. at 443-45, 748 P.2d at 917-18. Thus, <em>McJunkin </em>addressed the plaintiffs burden of proof as set forth in the commentaries to \u00a7 402A which effectively added the word \u201cand\u201d to the language actually contained in \u00a7 402A; it did not reject the \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d language used in the section. In other words, <em>McJunkin </em>addressed a substantially different question than that before us here, which relates only to whether the trial court erred in giving instructions containing the \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d language contained in both \u00a7 402A of the Restatement and \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA. I would hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in using the phrase \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous\u201d in instructing the jury, particularly since it then defined the phrase in common sense and everyday language.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b641 Turning, then, to \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, the Court determines that since we interpreted the Restatement in <em>McJunkin, </em>and \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, mirrors the language of \u00a7 402A, <em>McJunkin </em>\u201cin effect, interprets that statute as well.\u201d Section 27-1-719, MCA, however, was not a legislative codification of the <em>McJunkin </em>decision after issuance of that decision. Rather, the statute was considered and passed by the Montana Legislature prior to the <em>McJunkin </em>opinion and entirely independent therefrom. In addition, as the above discussion reflects, the statute was neither applicable to nor addressed in <em>McJunkin. </em>Furthermore, as also addressed above, <em>McJunkin </em>did not interpret the actual language contained in either \u00a7 402A or \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA; it addressed and rejected a commentary which propounded a dual proof test by adding the word \u201cand\u201d to the \u201cdefective product unreasonably dangerous\u201d language. The instruction at issue in the present case did not add the word \u201cand\u201d to the language contained in \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA. Nor did it imply a dual test in any way. Moreover, the District Court defined the statutory language in another instruction in common, easily understood language which also did not impose or imply a dual test.</p>\n<p id=\"A0H\">\u00b642 As a final matter, it is appropriate to comment on the Court\u2019s reference to the McAlpines\u2019 assertion that the challenged instructions deviate from the MPIs. While the Court\u2019s purpose in including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>this reference is far from clear, I have never heard it suggested that the MPIs themselves are \u201cthe law\u201d and I do not take the Court\u2019s reiteration of the McAlpines\u2019 position in this regard to mean otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"AMb\">\u00b643 The McAlpines are correct, of course, in stating that MPI 7.00 \u2014 the actual instruction for which they contend \u2014 better reflects <em>McJunkin </em>than does Instruction No. 11 as given here. This fact is irrelevant, however, because a closer look at MPI 7.00 and the note accompanying it reflects another problem with the McAlpines\u2019 argument. The Civil Jury Commission note to MPI 7.00 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjB\"><em>NOTE: </em>MPI 7.00 to 7.07 apply to all causes of action arising before 10/1/87. See <em>McJunkin v. Kaufman, </em>44 St.Rep. 2111, 748 P.2d 910 (1987). The Commission expresses no opinion on whether these instructions apply to causes of action arising after 10/1/87 in light of MCA 27-1-719, effective 10/1/87.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">I simply do not believe that either MPI 7.00 or <em>McJunkin </em>have any application to the present case and the jury instruction issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"A81\">\u00b644 On issue 1,1 would hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury. On issues 2 and 3,1 would apply the holding in our 1997 <em>McAlpine </em>decision. In short, I would affirm the District Court and I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
