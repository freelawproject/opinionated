The defendant was advised of his right to be represented by counsel. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he did not wish to proceed at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">It is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the application for review of sentence shall be continued to the first meeting of the Sentence Review Board, at the Montana State Prison, in 2001, thus allowing the defendant an opportunity to consult with his district court appointed counsel, Tony C. Koenig.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Chairman, Hon. Jeffrey H. Langton, Member, Hon. Marge Johnson and Member, Hon.
