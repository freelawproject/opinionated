The order denied Haser\u2019s motion to dismiss due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the alleged violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The judgment sentenced him to 40 years for one count of sexual intercourse without consent, and a concurrent sentence of six months for one count of sexual assault. Haser was found guilty of both counts following a jury trial. Haser argues that the District Court erred by denying his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, and that the evidence before the jury was insufficient to sustain'a conviction for sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b62 We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b63 Haser raises the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Haser\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">2. Was the evidence before the jury sufficient to sustain the conviction of sexual intercourse without consent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\u00b64 At issue on appeal is whether Haser was afforded a speedy trial, and whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction for sexual intercourse without consent involving two victims. Thus, the underlying factual and procedural background detailing the sexual assault conviction is not pertinent to our discussion and will be addressed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">\u00b65 Haser operated a photography studio, Picture Perfect Studios, in Missoula, Montana, at the time the alleged crimes of sexual intercourse without consent took place. Haser also published a free monthly magazine, Missoula Magazine. The two victims, both females, sought Haser\u2019s services as a professional photographer, specifically one who would take professional-modeling photos. Both victims were interested in pursuing modeling careers, and one testified that she hoped that her photo would appear in Haser\u2019s magazine. One victim paid for her photo session, and the other had the option to buy photos at a later date, although Haser did not charge her for the session itself.</p>\n<p id=\"AAs\">\u00b66 Each victim\u2019s account of Haser\u2019s conduct during the photo sessions is similar. Each woman testified that she was alone in the studio with Haser during the scheduled appointment. One victim testified that the session lasted six hours, and the other testified that her session lasted two hours. It is undisputed that the victims understood that they would pose before Haser wearing a variety of attire belonging to them or Haser, including swimsuits, \u00e1nd that the \u201cmodeling\u201d involved striking poses similar to those found in fashion magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">\u00b67 What was not understood or disclosed prior to the photo sessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>was Haser\u2019s insistence that he be allowed to rub lotion or apply makeup to their bodies, including their bare breasts. Haser similarly surprised the victims when he informed them that in order to avoid \"panty lines\" they would not be permitted to wear underwear. Haser apparently persuaded the victims that such conditions were necessary to improve the quality of the photos. Both women removed their underwear upon Haser\u2019s request, and allowed him to personally apply either lotion or makeup to their bare breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b68 Haser also repeatedly insisted that he had to adjust or re-position them in a particular pose, which also involved his touching them. It was during these sudden and frequent \u201cadjustments\u201d that one of his hands would slip under the women\u2019s clothing, rub between their legs, and up against their pubic region. The testimony reveals that his explanation at the time was that such interplay between his hand and the women\u2019s vaginal areas was strictly for the sake of attaining.the optimal pose which would produce high quality photos. Haser does not deny now, on appeal, that his touching the two victims as described at trial constituted \u201cpenetration\u201d pursuant to Montana law governing the offense of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b69 Neither victim abruptly ended the photo sessions due to Haser\u2019s conduct, however. Apparently, the victims voiced little or no objection to Haser\u2019s conduct during their respective sessions-due, apparently, to the suddenness of his actions and the resulting surprise or shock. Rather, at the time of the incidents, the victims believed or were led to believe that such treatment was incidental in the context of a professional model\u2019s photo session, although both testified that they thought at the time, as well as afterward, that Haser\u2019s touchings were odd, disgusting, and made them uncomfortable. The two victims testified that Haser\u2019s conduct elicited embarrassment, surprise, shock, anger, and fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b610 Haser\u2019s conduct with the two foregoing victims was not limited to them alone. Rather, the evidence indicates he routinely took similar liberties with other clientele. As a result of one victim coming forward, which led to an extensive police investigation, Haser was charged on November 12,1997, with eleven counts of misdemeanor sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, or, in the alternative, eleven counts of misdemeanor assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA, and six counts of sexual intercourse without consent, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. On December 3, 1997, Haser entered not guilty pleas to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"AMO\">\u00b611 The State amended its information on December 22, 1997, increasing the number of counts of sexual intercourse without consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>to eight. Haser entered a not guilty plea to the amended information on January 7, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b612 On March 23,1999, the State filed a second amended information, which consolidated the prior multiple counts into two. Under Count I, the State charged Haser with sexual intercourse without consent as a continuing course of conduct involving four victims, and under Count II, the State charged him with misdemeanor sexual assault as a continuing course of conduct involving 14 victims. Haser entered not guilty pleas to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b613 Prior to trial, Haser filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. The District Court denied his motion at the conclusion of a March 25, 1999 hearing, and issued an opinion and order on April 1, 1999. Haser contended that the length of delay-502 days-from the time the original charges were filed on November 12, 1997, until the scheduled trial date of March 29,1999, denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court concluded that the State was responsible for 276 days of the delay, and Haser was responsible for the remaining 226 days. The court concluded that the defendant had failed to demonstrate he had been prejudiced by the State\u2019s delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b614 A jury trial commenced March 29,1999. At the close of the State\u2019s case in chief, which included testimony from the victims, the daughter of one victim, police investigators, and an expert witness, Haser moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the evidence presented was insufficient to take the matter to the jury. The court denied the motion. Haser then called six witnesses, all women, to testify on his behalf. The witnesses testified that they knew Haser and in the past had either worked for or modeled for him-or both. Their testimony was consistent in denying that Haser had ever engaged in inappropriate conduct with them during modeling sessions. None of the witnesses testified that they were present during the victims\u2019 photo sessions. None of the witnesses testified that they knew any of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u00b615 On April 5, 1999, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the first count, sexual intercourse without consent, as applied to two of the four victims \u2014 meaning the jury found Haser not guilty of committing the offense with two of the four victims. The jury also returned a guilty verdict on the second count, sexual assault, \"committed on 11 different victims. Two of these 11 victims were the alleged victims of the sexual intercourse without consent charge that the jury found Haser not guilty of committing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">\u00b616 On June 2, 1999, the District Court sentenced Haser to 40 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>with 20 suspended on the first count, and to six months on the second count. The judgment was entered on August 30,1999. Haser appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss due to the violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, and the judgment that sentenced him to 40 years for the offense of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b617 We recognize that the violation of a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is a question of constitutional law which requires that we review a district court\u2019s decision to determine if it is correct. <em>See State v. </em>Taylor, 1998 MT 121, \u00b6 18, 289 Mont. 63, \u00b6 18, 960 P.2d 773, \u00b6 18 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b618 We review the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction by viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and then determining whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Berger, </em>1998 MT 170, \u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 78, \u00b6 25, 964 P.2d 725, \u00b6 25 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AtY\">\n<em>Issue 1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in denying Haser\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\u00b619 Haser argues that the 276 day-delay attributable to the State pursuant to the District Court\u2019s order was incorrectly calculated, and that the State\u2019s evidence failed to disprove the presumption that he was prejudiced by the 502-day delay in this matter going to trial. Therefore, he contends that the District Court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\u00b620 Since 1972, we have reviewed claims that a speedy trial was denied in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution, based on the general guidelines established by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101. <em>See, e.g., City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, \u00b6 19, 290 Mont. 148, \u00b6 19, 965 P.2d 866, \u00b6 19 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">\u00b621 The <em>Barker </em>test offers four criteria for a court\u2019s consideration: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the assertion of the right to a speedy trial by the defendant; and (4) the prejudice to the defense. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192). As this Court emphasized in <em>Bruce, </em>however, the four factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>established by <em>Barker </em>\u201care necessarily general guidelines to be applied on a case-by-case basis to the unique circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting from <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 533, 92 S.Ct. at 2193, that \u201cthese factors have no talismanic qualities; court\u2019s must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b622  Primarily at issue here is the fourth element, that Haser suffered prejudice due to the delay. We stated in <em>Bruce </em>that prejudice sufficient for a dismissal can be established based on any one or more of the following factors: (1) pretrial incarceration, (2) anxiety and concern to the defendant, and (3) impairment of the defense. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193). Of these concerns, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated the following about their order of importance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. If witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is obvious. There is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past. Loss of memory, however, is not always reflected in the record because what has been forgotten can rarely be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\"><em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b623 The District Court followed the three-part test in <em>Bruce </em>for determining prejudice, and concluded that (1) Haser had been released on his own recognizance prior to trial; (2) Haser had not suffered any more \u201cinordinate pretrial anxiety\u201d than \u201cany other defendant charged with a felony\u201d and as time passed and the publicity died down the \u201ctension and stress on the Defendant lessened;\u201d and (3) Haser\u2019s defense was not \"impaired or prejudiced\" by the delay, rather, the \u201cState\u2019s witnesses have suffered on parts of their recollection to the benefit of the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b624 Haser\u2019s first contention is that the court miscalculated the number of days of delay attributable to the State, and therefore incorrectly analyzed the \u201creason for the delay\u201d prong of the four-part <em>Barker </em>test. We conclude that this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\u00b625 As this Court has stated, once the delay attributable to the State exceeds 275 days, speedy trial analysis is triggered and prejudice is presumed. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. Thus, because 276 days of the 502-day delay were allocated to the State, the burden shifted to the State to demonstrate that Haser had not been prejudiced by the delay. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. If the State satisfied its burden of demonstrating that Haser had not been prejudiced by the delay, the burden would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>shifted to him to show that he had been prejudiced. <em>See State v. Hardaway, </em>1998 MT 224, \u00b6 23, 290 Mont. 516, \u00b6 23, 966 P.2d 125, \u00b6 23. This is one of the primary functions of the \u201creason for delay\u201d prong: to conclusively establish a burden shift for the determination of prejudice. Here, whether the delay attributable to the state was 276 days or 418 days (as Haser argues),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the State nevertheless bore the initial burden of showing that the delay did not cause Haser prejudice. Neither party contests this burden shift, and we conclude that the District Court did not error in assigning the burden to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b626 Further, Haser suggests the alleged 418 days of delay attributable to the State \u201cmay have been intentional rather than mere institutional delay.\u201d We agree that the constitutional question of a speedy trial is primarily designed to protect the accused from oppressive tactics of the prosecution, and that a showing that the delay was an intentional device to harass or gain tactical advantage over the accused rather than ordinary \u201cinstitutional delay\u201d is another primary function of the \u201creason for delay\u201d prong of the <em>Barker </em>test. <em>See State v. Heffernan </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 67, 73, 809 P.2d 566, 569 (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S.Ct. at 2191). Institutional delays, on the other hand, weigh less heavily against the State in the <em>Barker </em>balancing process than intentional delays resulting from oppressive tactics. <em>See Heffernan, </em>248 Mont. at 73, 809 P.2d at 570 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b627  On appeal, Haser does not support his shadow of an innuendo with reference to any evidence or authority. We conclude that there was no showing by Haser, or any other evidence, that the State intentionally delayed his trial to harass him or to gain some tactical advantage over him. We agree with the State that the reason for its delay here was purely institutional in nature. <em>See Heffernan, </em>248 Mont. at 73, 809 P.2d at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b628 Finally, this Court has never established a threshold number of days that conclusively establishes the denial of the right to speedy trial without the necessary finding of prejudice to the defendant. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Doggett v. United States </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 647, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520). Although encouraging the District Court to entertain such a threshold, Haser does not suggest that this Court should do so now here on appeal, in light of his claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b629  We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>determining that, due to the length of the institutional delay attributable to the State, the State carried the initial burden of rebutting the presumption that Haser had been prejudiced by the delay. Therefore, we turn our attention to the issue of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b630 Of the three factors that a court considers under the \u201cprejudice to the defense\u201d prong of the <em>Barker </em>test, Haser and the State agree that the first, \u201cpretrial incarceration,\u201d is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b631 As for the next factor, \u201canxiety and concern to the defendant,\u201d Haser contends that the State essentially offered no evidence to rebut the presumption of prejudice-other than what amounted to the State calling upon its own investigators to opine that they were not aware of any anxiety or concern by Haser. Haser argues that \u201cthe detectives had neither the opportunity, the qualifications, nor the inclination to determine whether the defendant endured anxiety and concern during the 500 days he awaited tri,al.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b632 This Court has previously stated, however, that since it is nearly impossible for the State to prove that anxiety and concern do not exist, the State\u2019s burden to show a lack of anxiety becomes \u201cconsiderably lighter in the absence of more than marginal evidence of anxiety.\u201d <em>State v. Williams-Rusch </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 437, 452, 928 P.2d 169, 178 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b633 Here, the State asserted through testimony and exhibits that to the best of its knowledge Haser had not undergone any treatment or otherwise suffered any extreme distress due to pretrial anxiety or concern, and that he appeared to be maintaining employment and could continue to pursue business ventures related to the field of photography. We conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that, based on this evidence, the State met its burden in rebutting the presumption that Haser experienced prejudicial \u201canxiety and concern,\u201d during the 500-day delay before trial sufficient to warrant a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b634 In turn, we agree with the State that the anxieties expressed by Haser in rebuttal at his motion to dismiss hearing were clearly attributable to the fact that as a proprietor of a business that held its doors open to the general public, he stood charged of sexual crimes involving a substantial number of customers who sought his professional services. That these charges would directly and adversely impact his business as well as his reputation in the community speak far more to the nature of the crimes themselves than the delay in commencing the trial \u2014 whether that delay was 276, 391, or 418 days. We conclude that, at best, Haser presented marginal evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>prejudicial anxiety and concern that can be attributed to the institutional delay in going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b635 The third and final consideration under the element of prejudice, \u201cimpairment of the defense,\u201d which is the most important; focusses primarily on a defendant\u2019s ability to adequately prepare his case. Specifically, we look at whether the delay directly affected the defendant\u2019s ability to call witnesses on his own behalf \u2014 those who can be located and accurately recall events \u2014 and whether the delay directly diminished and impeded the defendant\u2019s own ability to present any other evidence, or develop a particular theory or line of defense. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 71-73; <em>State v. Keating </em>(1977), 285 Mont. 463, 475-76, 949 P.2d 251, 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b636 The State, in this instance, argues it sufficiently rebutted the presumption that the institutional delay in this matter impaired Haser\u2019s ability to prepare his defense. In sum, the State argued to the District Court that it had provided Haser all discoverable materials that could assist his defense and that none of his witnesses would provide exculpatory evidence. The State also argued that it had not impaired Haser\u2019s ability to assert an affirmative defense on account of any delay in this matter. On appeal, the State correctly states that Haser offered no evidence at the speedy trial hearing to restore the presumption of prejudice on this basis, and asserts that no such argument has been made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b637 Haser does not argue that any of his witnesses were unavailable due to the delay. He does not dispute that all of his witnesses supplied character testimony only, or that not one of his witnesses were present during any of the victims\u2019 photo sessions, or that not one of his witnesses knew or had had any contact with any of the victims. Thus, their memory of witnessed events would be marginal at best. As the District Court stated, witnesses for the State \u2014 i.e., the victims of the alleged offenses-were far more susceptible to memory loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b638 Further, Haser has not contested here on appeal the State\u2019s assertion that it timely provided him with discoverable information concerning its witnesses and their statements, materials seized during the search of his business, and any statements he may have made. Likewise, Haser has not suggested that any such delay in this matter affected his ability to establish a defense, such as the affirmative defense of \u201calibi,\u201d which he alluded to in the omnibus hearing in early 1998, and in his February 27,1998 motion to dismiss. In sum, Haser has not presented any argument, let alone evidence, that due to the State\u2019s delay in this matter he was not afforded an ample opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to review the State\u2019s case against him, refresh his own recollection of events, develop his theory of the case, or establish a credible affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b639  Finally, we observe that the focus of Haser\u2019s prejudice argument centers on the \u201canxiety and concern\u201d factor. Restated, Haser\u2019s argument on appeal regarding the factor of \u201cimpairment of defense\u201d is that the State failed to meet its burden and, therefore, he is relieved of his burden to present evidence of prejudice in rebuttal. We disagree, and conclude that Haser\u2019s ability to prepare his defense was not prejudiced by the delay in this matter going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b640 Accordingly, we affirm the order of the District Court denying Haser\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\n<em>Issue 2.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Was <em>the evidence before the jury sufficient to sustain the conviction of sexual intercourse without consent ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b641 Haser does not deny that any of the alleged conduct occurred, which includes various accounts of his hand, thumb, or fingers penetrating each victim\u2019s vaginal region. He does not deny that he deceived the women into submitting to conduct that obviously exceeded the reasonable boundaries of what constitutes a model\u2019s photo session with a professional photographer. In Haser\u2019s brief to this Court he blatantly admits that he used the same \"it\u2019s all for the pictures\" and \"panty line\" ploys on both victims to get them to remove their underwear, that it was \u201ccertainly misleading\u201d for him to put his hand between one of the victim\u2019s legs \u201cup to her vaginal area under the guise of showing her how to pose,\u201d and that both victims fell for his deceptions \u201chook, line and sinker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u00b642 Instead, Haser focusses this Court\u2019s scrutiny of his conviction on the statutory element \u201cwithout consent,\u201d contending that neither victim was \u201ccompelled to submit by force\u201d or was \u201cincapable of consent\u201d as required under the governing statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u00b643 The State counters by arguing that the victims in this instance were subject to what it contends was \u201cconstructive force,\u201d or that force may be implied due to the sudden and surprise nature of the \u201csexual attack,\u201d and, alternatively, both victims were physically incapable of consenting because Haser abused his position of power and trust over the young women, and lulled them into a state of vulnerability not unlike sleep or intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b644  Under \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA, a person commits the offense of sexual intercourse without consent if he or she \u201cknowingly has sexual intercourse without consent with another person.\u201d Under the general definitions provided under \u00a7 45-2-101, MCA, \u201csexual intercourse\u201d includes \u201cpenetration of the vulva ... of one person by a body member of another person . . .\u201d and \u201cany penetration, however slight, is sufficient.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial for a rational trier of fact to find that Haser committed the essential element of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d with the victims beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b645 Under the definitions provided by \u00a7 45-5-501(1), MCA, which are expressly applicable to the offense of sexual intercourse without consent under \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA, the term \u201cwithout consent\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">(a) the victim is compelled to submit by force against the victim or another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">(b) the victim is incapable of consent because the victim is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">(i) mentally defective or incapacitated; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">(ii) physically helpless . . ,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Under \u00a7 45-5-501(2), MCA, the term \u201cforce\u201d as used in subsection (1), sub-part (a), means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">(a) the infliction, attempted infliction,, or threatened infliction of bodily injury or the commission of a forcible felony by the offender; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">(b) the threat of substantial retaliatory action that causes the victim to reasonably believe that the offender has the ability to execute the threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">\u00b646 The instructions presented to the jury by the District Court followed the foregoing statutory definitions. The jury was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>instructed that \u201cResistance by the victim is not required to show lack of consent\u201d and that \u201cForce, fear, or threat is sufficient alone to show lack of consent.\u201d This set of instructions is a verbatim recital of \u00a7 45-5-511(5), MCA, which provides provisions generally applicable to sexual crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b647 Under the general definitions of \u00a7 45-2-101, MCA, a person is \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d if he or she is \u201crendered temporarily incapable of appreciating or controlling the person\u2019s own conduct as a result of the influence of an intoxicating substance.\u201d Obviously, this definition has no application to the factual circumstances <em>sub judice. </em>Under this same statute, a person is \u201cphysically helpless\u201d when he or she is \u201cunconscious or is otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act.\u201d This statutory definition was not presented to the jury in the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">A. The use of \u201cforce\u201d under \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b648 The State concedes that Haser did not threaten either victim. Thus, in order to satisfy the \u201ccompelled to submit by force\u201d element of \u201cwithout consent,\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-501 and 503, MCA, there must be evidence that Haser inflicted or attempted to inflict bodily injury, or committed a forcible felony. Under the general definitions of \u00a7 45-2-101, MCA, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical pain, illness, or an impairment of physical condition and includes mental illness or impairment.\u201d Under the same statute, a \u201cforcible felony\u201d means \u201ca felony that involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.\u201d The instructions presented to the jury did not include these statutory definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u00b649 The testimony of the two victims, viewed in a light most favorable to the. State, indicates that they experienced shock, embarrassment, surprise, anger, and perhaps even a trace of fear during the course of their respective photo sessions with Haser. The State has not argued, pursuant to state law, that any of these responses are a species of pain, illness, or impairment inflicted by Haser in order to compel them to submit to his repeated acts of digital penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u00b650 Instead, the State argues that this Court should follow other jurisdictions that have construed the essential element of \u201cforce\u201d to include \u201cconstructive force.\u201d <em>See State v. Brown </em>(N.C. 1992), 420 S.E.2d 147, 150 (stating that the \u201crequisite force may be established either by actual, physical force or by constructive force in the form of fear, fright, or coercion\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b651 Contrary to the State\u2019s argument, however, Montana\u2019s statutory scheme accounts for \u201cconstructive force\u201d pursuant to the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>version of \u00a7 45-5-501(2), MCA (amended in 1991), which provides that \u201cforce\u201d includes threats of bodily injury or \u201csubstantial retaliatory action.\u201d Thus, under the current law in Montana, actual physical force is no longer necessary to satisfy the essential \u201csubmit by force\u201d element of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent. Again, as conceded by the State, there was no evidence presented at trial that Haser, via his physical or verbal conduct, threatened either victim in any manner. Mere chicanery simply cannot be construed as a form of force under our governing statutes. Likewise, evidence that a victim is frozen in a state of shock or in a state of fear \u2014 but not as a result of a threat or as a result of an attempted or actual infliction of bodily injury or the commission of a forcible felony-is insufficient to establish that a defendant did in fact use \"force\" to compel a victim\u2019s submission to sexual intercourse. Thus, we conclude that Haser did not use \u201cforce\u201d in compelling the victims to submit to sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b652 The State also argues that this Court should equate \u201csurprise\u201d with \u201cforce,\u201d and again turns our attention to case law from other jurisdictions. The State reasons that, due to Haser\u2019s surprise \u201cattacks,\u201d the victims were not afforded the opportunity to consent, and therefore the use of force may be implied by the act of penetration itself. This argument formed the basis of the State\u2019s closing argument to the jury that Haser used force: \u201cIf you\u2019re surprised, then the force required to penetrate or the force required to touch is s\u00fafficient to satisfy the force requirement.\u201d <em>See State v. Atkins </em>(Mo. 1926), 292 S.W. 422, 426 (stating that \"illicit sexual connection\" with a woman may be accomplished \u201cthrough surprise, when she is awake, but utterly unaware of his intention in that regard\u201d and therefore \u201cforce merely incident to penetration should be deemed sufficient force within the meaning of the rape statute\u201d). <em>See accord People v. Borak </em>(Ill.App.Ct. 1973), 301 N.E.2d 1, 5 (citing <em>Atkins </em>and concluding that \u201cforce\u201d in the statutory sense is present when the victim is incapable of consenting to the sexual act involved because she has been given no opportunity to consent and that force is \u201cimplied when the rape or deviate sexual acts proscribed by statute are accomplished under the pretext of medical treatment when the victim is surprised, and unaware of the intention involved\u201d). The prosecution\u2019s comments to the jury, however, were not a correct statement of the law regarding the use of \u201cforce\u201d under our sexual intercourse without consent statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b653 In contrast to Montana\u2019s clear statutory definition of \u201cforce,\u201d the Illinois court decision cited by the State recognized that its statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>requirement \u2014 that the proscribed sexual intercourse must be committed \u201cby force and against the will of the other person\u201d-could be present in certain circumstances \u201cwhere no actual force is used,\u201d and where \u201cno actual violence is either committed or threatened.\u201d <em>See Borak, </em>301 N.E.2d at 4-5. <em>See also Brown, </em>420 S.E.2d at 150 (stating that \u201c Toy force and against the will of the other person\u2019 as used in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-27.5(a)(1) has the same meaning as it did at common law when it was used to describe an element of rape\u201d and that the element is present if the defendant \u201cuses force sufficient to overcome any resistance the victim might make\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b654  In sum, the case law cited by the State, however compelling, simply does not comport with Montana\u2019s clear legislative mandate that \u201cforce\u201d must be related somehow to bodily injury, the attempted infliction of bodily injury, or an actual threat of some kind. We conclude that \u201csurprise\u201d penetration, alone, is insufficient to establish the essential element of \u201cwithout consent\u201d under \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(a), MCA, which requires that the victim was \u201ccompelled to submit by force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b655  Accordingly, we hold that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for sexual intercourse without consent in that a rational trier of fact could not have properly found that the essential element of \u201cwithout consent,\u201d based on either victim being \u201ccompelled to submit by force\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(a), MCA, had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">B. \u201cIncapable of consent\u201d under \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b656 The State next contends that implicit in the definition of \u201cincapable of consent,\u201d under \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(b), MCA, is the notion that the victim must have an opportunity to consent or to communicate a lack of consent, and suggests that Haser, as a professional photographer, managed to exploit his position of trust with the young hopeful models and thereby \u201clull\u201d his victims into a state of mind analogous to intoxication or sleep, which satisfy, respectively, the statutory requirements of being mentally incapacitated or physically helpless. <em>See State v. Graves </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 451, 457, 901 P.2d 549, 553 (victim \"passed out\" due to use of alcohol); <em>State v. Lundblade </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 185, 187, 717 P.2d 575, 577 (victim sound asleep and did not consent to sexual acts with defendant); <em>State v. Gould </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 207, 221, 902 P.2d 532, 541 (sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that victim was mentally incapacitated due to intoxication).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u00b657 The \u201cincapable of consent\u201d alternative under the \u201cwithout consent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>definition of \u00a7 45-5-501, MCA, was not argued by the State in closing argument to the jury, but was included in the jury instructions and recited to the jury by the District Court. As noted, the statutory definition of \u201cphysically helpless,\u201d which is the only viable argument that the victims here were \u201cincapable of consent\u201d under \u00a7 45-5-501, MCA, was not presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b658 Contrary to the State\u2019s argument, we conclude there is indeed a \u201clogical difference\u201d between Haser\u2019s sexual intercourse with the two victims and sexual intercourse with a sleeping or intoxicated victim. Namely, the victims here were awake and sober. Both were therefore conscious and physically capable of communicating an unwillingness to act, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-501(l)(b)(ii) and 45-2-101, MCA, which defines \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b659 Further, contrary to the State\u2019s encouragement, we are not at liberty to read into the already thoroughly defined statutory term \u201cincapable of consent\u201d such implicit notions as \u201copportunity to consent\u201d or \u201cawake and sober but unaware\u201d to fit those circumstances where the victim has been \u201clulled\u201d by another person. <em>See State v. Goodwin </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 1, 22-23, 813 P.2d 953, 966 (quoting 73 Am. Jur.2d Statutes \u00a7 295). Although we must construe the provisions of a penal statute \u201caccording to the import of their terms with a view to effect its object and to promote justice\u201d <em>(see </em>\u00a7 45-1-102(2), MCA), the Legislature has provided specific definitions of the specific conditions that render a person \u201cincapable of consent\u201d under \u00a7 45-5-50 l(l)(b), MCA \u2014 statutory definitions which are noticeably absent from the State\u2019s argument here, and were not addressed by the State at trial in its development of its theory of the case or incorporated in its instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b660  We therefore conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for sexual intercourse without consent. We hold that a rational trier of fact could not have properly found that the essential element \u201cwithout consent\u201d due to the victims being \u201cincapable of consent\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-501(l)(b), MCA, had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b661 In sum, there was simply no evidence offered at Haser\u2019s trial that either victim was compelled to submit to his digital penetration by \u201cforce\u201d or that either victim was \u201cincapable of consent\u201d because she was mentally incapacitated or physically helpless. Accordingly, without such evidence, a rational trier of fact could not have found that the essential element \u201cwithout consent\u201d had been proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore reverse that portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>District Court\u2019s judgment that determined that Haser was guilty of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b662 Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> In its response brief to Haser\u2019s motion to dismiss, the State conceded that it was responsible for 391 days of delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\"> Haser does not challenge his conviction for sexual assault involving a total of 11 women, all of whom he similarly deceived with his self-described \u201cit\u2019s all for the camera\u201d scheme.

The definition of \u201cwithout consent,\u201d provided under \u00a7 45-5-501, MCA, however, is expressly applicable only to the offense of sexual intercourse without consent, \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. The Legislature has not similarly defined the term as used in the sexual assault statute.
