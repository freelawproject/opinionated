The Board does agree that the egregious nature of the crime does require a period of incarceration somewhere, but not necessarily at the prison. If the defendant fails to make good faith efforts to make restitution while in any community placement, she can certainly be revoked and returned to prison.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Acting Chairwoman, Hon.
