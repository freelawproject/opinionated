The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">It is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed, with the modification to the judgment that the eighteen (18) month restriction prior to.becoming eligible for placement in the Treasure State Correctional Training Program or any other community program be lifted, and effectively render that option available to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">The reason for the modification is that the current restriction effectively renders the Defendant ineligible for the program which the sentencing court felt would be beneficial to the Defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Ax9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>DATED this 11th day of September, 2000.</decisiondate>\n<judges id=\"b518-4\">Chairman, Hon.
