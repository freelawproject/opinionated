The state was represented by Geoffrey Mahar.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">It is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended to sixty (60) years in the Montana State Prison, with thirty (30) years suspended. The remainder of the sentence shall remain the same, with the conditions which Judge Langton imposed for parole also, being applicable to any period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">The reason for the amendment is that the sentence is clearly inadequate in that it does not provide for any period of community supervision once Mr. Godfrey is released. While the Board feels that the length of sentence as a period of incarceration is appropriate, and making it consecutive to the other sentences is appropriate, the Board believes that there needs to be an additional period of thirty (30) years during which time the defendant will be supervised.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Acting Chairwoman, Hon.
