The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">After a brief discussion with the defendant and Mr. Geranios, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the hearing shall be continued to the June 2000 meeting, thus allowing the defendant time to submit his application in Missoula County Cause Number DC-94-11074, in order that the sentence in that cause can be reviewed at the same time as the sentence in the underlying matter.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-16\">Chairman, Hon.
