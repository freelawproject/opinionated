He was sentenced to 20 years in Montana State Prison with an additional 2 years for the use of a weapon, with 10 years suspended. Hubbel appeals from this conviction and sentence. We affirm in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">\u00b62 The following issues were presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">\u00b63 1. Whether the appellant sustained his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to request a \u201cfailure to agree\u201d instruction as allowed by \u00a7 46-16-607(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it sentenced the appellant after retrial, suspending less time than after the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-19\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ordered Hubbel to reimburse the costs of his court appointed counsel from his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in failing to inquire into Hubbel\u2019s ability to pay the costs of his court appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b67 Following an evening of dining, dancing and drinking, Wesley Hubbel (Hubbel) and his wife, Carol Dutton Hubbel (Dutton) returned to their home, south of Darby, Montana. Hubbel had been drinking heavily and the two had an argument. Dutton went out to the front porch to call her dog and Hubbel went into a spare bedroom. While searching for money, he found a gun in a closet. He fired the .357 Magnum into the ceiling and then through the front door of the home, striking his wife twice, once in the neck and once in the leg. Hubbel claimed that he did not know that Dutton was on the other side of the door and that the injury was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b68 After calling 9-1-1, Hubbel drove Dutton to a convenience store in Darby to meet an ambulance. Upon reaching the convenience store, Hubbel got out of the car, walked up to the police officer and said, \u201carrest me, I just shot my wife.\u201d Hubbel was arrested, and Dutton was put into the ambulance and received medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b69 In an Information filed on December 11, 1995, Hubbel was charged with aggravated assault. Hubbel was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. A jury trial was held and Hubbel was found guilty of aggravated assault. The court sentenced him to 20 years in the Montana State Prison for the crime of aggravated assault, with an additional 2 years for the use of a weapon for a total of 22 years in the Montana State Prison. Of that sentence, 16 years were to be suspended under certain conditions. Those conditions included that Hubbel not be considered for parole or early release until he had successfully completed several of the prison\u2019s programs, including the Chemical Dependency Program, Anger Management Program, Moral Resonation Program, and the Criminal Thinking Errors Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u00b610 Hubbel brought an appeal to this Court and his initial conviction was reversed. <em>See State v. Hubbel </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 200, 951 P.2d 971. The case was retried in September of 1998, and Hubbel was again convicted of aggravated assault by a jury. Following his second trial, Hubbel\u2019s probation and parole officer prepared an updated presentence investigation report (PSI). This report noted that Hubbel was unable to complete any of the previously ordered programs and recommended that only 10 years of the 22 year sentence be suspended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>rather than 16, as was ordered following the first trial. The prosecutor agreed with this recommendation, arguing that increased prison time was necessary for his rehabilitation. Hubbel\u2019s counsel recommended that the court impose the same sentence it had imposed after the first trial. At the sentencing hearing, Hubbel was again sentenced to 20 years for aggravated assault, with an additional 2 years for the use of a weapon. This time, however, only 10 years was to be suspended under certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b611 Issue 1. Whether Hubbel sustained his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to request a \u201cfailure to agree\u201d instruction as allowed by \u00a7 46-16-607(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b612 Hubbel argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request a \u201cfailure to agree instruction.\u201d Not giving this instruction, he argues, limited the jury\u2019s consideration of the lesser included offenses. The instruction at issue, an \u201cacquittal first\u201d instruction, was proposed by the defendant and given by the court. The instruction provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">In your deliberations you should consider the charge of aggravated assault first, and that all twelve of you find the defendant either guilty or not guilty of that charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">In the event you find the defendant guilty of aggravated assault, you need go no further as you will have reached a verdict in this case ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b613 Hubbel argues that this jury instruction contained a misstatement of the law. He argues that \u00a7 46-16-607(3), MCA, and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, 292 Mont. 23, 971 P.2d 359 (overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204), made a change in the law to require the use of a failure to agree instruction, making the instruction offered by defense counsel an incorrect and misleading statement of the law. He argues that this mistake made his counsel constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay9F\">\u00b614  A criminal defendant is denied effective assistance of counsel if: (1) his counsel\u2019s conduct falls short of the range reasonably demanded in light of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (2) counsel\u2019s failure is prejudicial. <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 61, 63, 947 P.2d 57, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">\u00b615  There is, however, a strong presumption of effectiveness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgG\">Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b616 Hubbel relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, 292 Mont. 23, 971 P.2d 359. In <em>Robbins, </em>we held that the district court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s request to give a corrective instruction that a jury may consider a lesser offense of negligent homicide if it is unable, after reasonable effort, to reach a unanimous verdict on the greater offense. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6 40</p>\n<p id=\"AYb\">\u00b617 <em>Robbins, </em>however, was an unusual case. The defense counsel had initially requested this \u201cfailure to agree\u201d instruction, but was misled by the court and counsel for the prosecution. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b618 Section 46-16-607(3), MCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">When a lesser included offense instruction is given, the court shall instruct the jury that it must reach a verdict on the crime charged before it may proceed to a lesser included offense. Upon request of the defendant at the settling of instructions, the court shall instruct the jury that it may consider the lesser included offense if it is unable after reasonable effort to reach a verdict on the greater offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b619 The second sentence allows for what is known as a \u201cfailure to agree\u201d instruction. In <em>Robbins, </em>we noted the new standard was limited to a request from the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">Thus, under this new standard, as long as a criminal defendant <em>requests </em>a \u201cfailure to agree\u201d instruction at the settling of jury instructions, a district court <em>must </em>instruct the jury that it may consider the lesser offense without reaching a unanimous verdict on the greater offense. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6 34.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">This statute was drafted in order to comport with <em>United States v. Jackson </em>(9th Cir.1984), 726 F.2d 1466, 1469. <em>Jackson </em>held that when a defendant requests an instruction that the jury may consider the lesser included offense if unable, after reasonable effort, to agree on a verdict for the greater offense, \u201cit is error to reject the form timely requested by defendant.\u201d However, contrary to Hubbel\u2019s argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>neither <em>Jackson </em>nor <em>Robbins </em>served to make use of the failure to agree instruction mandatory. While the use of the \u201cfailure to agree\u201d instruction may be beneficial to the defendant, the language of \u00a7 46-16-607(3), MCA, clearly states that this instruction should be given \u201cupon request of the defendant.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>too, makes this form of jury instruction optional. The decision of whether or not to give this instruction is left to the discretion of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b620 In order to meet his burden, Hubbel is required to support his contentions that his counsel erred in not requesting the instruction. There is a strong presumption that defense counsel rendered adequate assistance and made all decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. The record on appeal is silent regarding why Hubbel\u2019s counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged. Defense counsel was never asked to provide an explanation and we must presume that he made his decision exercising reasonable professional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b621 In the face of the strong presumption that counsel acted reasonably, and with no evidence to the contrary, we cannot agree with Hubbel that his counsel was ineffective. It is clear that the jury instructions offered by the defense were adequate. Nothing in the record indicates why, exactly, Hubbel\u2019s counsel did not give the failure to agree instruction. The record is silent on this issue. Hubbel has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that counsel was ineffective without offering any explanation as to why, whether for tactical reasons or not, defense counsel failed to offer the failure to agree instruction but, instead, offered an \u201cacquittal test\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b622 Because we have determined that Hubbel has not sustained his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel was in error in its offered jury instructions, we need not reach the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697. We hold that Hubbel has not sustained his burden of demonstrating that his defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b623 Issue 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it sentenced Hubbel after retrial, suspending less time than it did after his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u00b624 Hubbel argues that the District Court \u201cpunished\u201d him for his successful appeal of his first trial by decreasing the portion of his sentence that was suspended, lengthening his prison time.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u00b625  This Court generally will review a criminal sentence only for legality. Where a sentence is within the statutory parameters established by the legislature, this Court will generally affirm it. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>v. Allen </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 326, 334, 925 P.2d 470, 475. Punishing a person for exercising a constitutional right, however, is a basic due process violation. <em>State v. Baldwin </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 521, 525, 629 P.2d 222, 225. \u201cDue process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 711, 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b626 The <em>Pearce </em>Court set forth the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">[WJhenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal.\u201d <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAs3\">Otherwise, a presumption arises that a greater sentence has been imposed for a vindictive purpose-a presumption that must be rebutted by \u201cobjective information ... justifying the increased sentence.\u201d <em>Texas v. McCullough </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 134, 142. The District Court had an obligation under <em>Pearce </em>to set forth the reasons for the increased sentence. <em>Pearce, </em>935 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b627 The <em>Pearce </em>rule, however, is quite limited. <em>Pearce </em>does not operate as a bar to more severe sentence on reconviction. The Supreme Court clearly stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">We hold, therefore that neither the double jeopardy provision nor the Equal Protection Clause imposes an absolute bar to a more severe sentence upon reconviction. A trial judge is not constitutionally precluded, in other words, from imposing a new sentence, whether greater or less than the original sentence, in the light of events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant\u2019s \u201clife, health, habits, conduct and mental and moral propensities.\u201d Such information may come to the judge\u2019s attention from evidence adduced at the second trial itself, from a new presentence investigation, from the defendant\u2019s prison record, or possibly from other sources. The freedom of a sentencing judge to consider the defendant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the first conviction in imposing a new sentence is no more than consonant with the principle ... that a State may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>adopt the \u201cprevalent modern philosophy of penology that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime.\u201d <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 723, 89 S.Ct. 2072. Citation omitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In addition, in a later case, the Court noted that, the <em>Pearce </em>presumption was not designed to prevent the imposition of an increased sentence on retrial for some valid reason associated with the need for flexibility and discretion in the sentencing process, but was premised on the apparent need to guard against vindictiveness in the resentencing process. <em>Chaffin v. Stynchcombe </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 17, 25, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b628 When the court suspended less time in the second sentence, it noted that the PSI showed that while Hubbel had signed up for many of the courses, he had not begun.any of the courses, presumably due to overcrowding at the prison. The District Court set forth its reasons for suspending less time, commenting that both the original and the updated pre-sentence reports had been considered, and that while Hubbel had performed well in prison, the additional time was needed for his rehabilitation so that he could complete the ordered programs as well as receiving mental health counseling. The court also expressed concern that Hubbel continued to deny responsibility for his actions. The court felt that the increased time to receive mental health counseling and complete the ordered programs was necessary for the. protection of society and for Hubbel\u2019s own rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b629  It appears that the District Court reduced the amount of time to be suspended from his first sentence to his second sentence because Hubbel needed time to complete the various programs which the court had ordered. Suspending less time on the second sentence was not out of vindictiveness, but to insure that Hubbel had sufficient time to complete the various programs which the court had ordered he complete. The District Court\u2019s concern for Hubbel\u2019s rehabilitation was a constitutionally legitimate reason for suspending less time upon reconviction. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b630 Issue 3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it ordered Hubbel to reimburse the costs of his court appointed counsel from his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b631 As a condition of partial suspension of his sentence, the court ordered, among other things, that Hubbel pay the costs of his court-appointed counsel. The total included payment for all three of his attorneys throughout these proceedings, including those who represented him in his initial trial and in his appeal to this Court overturning the verdict in that trial. Hubbel argues that he should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>be required to pay for the costs relating to the first trial and the appeal. Hubbel argues that requiring him to pay the costs of his counsel from his first trial impinges on his right to counsel and that this is punishment for successfully challenging his first conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b632 The trial court has the authority to order Hubbel to reimburse costs of his court appointed counsel. This includes all costs related to his criminal defense. Section 46-8-113, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">1. The court may require a convicted defendant to pay the costs of court-appointed counsel as a part of or a condition under the sentence imposed as provided in Title 46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">2. Costs must be limited to reasonable compensation and costs incurred by the court-appointed counsel in the criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">There is no limitation in the statute preventing a district court from requiring that all costs from the proceeding be paid by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"ABl\">\u00b633  Hubbel\u2019s claim that this is further evidence that the District Court is punishing him for prevailing on appeal is unavailing. There is no evidence in the record to support his claim that the judge was acting out of vindictiveness in ordering him to pay the costs of court appointed counsel. It is clear that the District Court has the authority to order Hubbel to pay the costs of his court appointed counsel. This includes all costs of legal representation, not just those where he is unsuccessful. We affirm the decision of the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AKy0\">\u00b634 Issue 4. Whether the District Court erred in failing to determine the appellant\u2019s inability to pay the costs of his court appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b635 Hubbel argues that the District Court should have held a hearing to determine whether he had the financial resources to pay the costs of his court appointed counsel. The statute requires that the District Court make an inquiry into Hubbel\u2019s financial resources to determine whether he had the ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u00b636 Section 46-8-113(3), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">The court may not sentence a defendant to pay the costs of court-appointed counsel unless the defendant is or will be able to pay them. In determining the amount and method of payment of costs, the court shall take into account the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">\u00b637  Whether Hubbel had the ability to pay the costs of his representation is a significant question that the District Court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>have inquired into, but did not. The statute requires a District Court to make an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s ability to pay before sentencing the defendant to payment of costs. Therefore, we remand this case back to the District Court for further proceedings and a determination of whether or not Hubbel had the ability to pay for the costs of his court appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b638 Affirmed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
