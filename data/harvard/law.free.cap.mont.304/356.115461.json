(USAA), and the denial of her motion for summary judgment. Lee claims that she was entitled to under-insured motorist coverage under a USAA policy which insured two vehicles that she co-owned with the named insured on the policy. USAA maintains that, as a matter of law, Lee is not a named insured under its policy, and is therefore not entitled to under-insured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b62 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b63 Lee raises the following issues for this Court\u2019s review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Lee\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on USAA\u2019s letter affirming coverage because Lee was a registered owner of both vehicles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">2. Did the District Court err in granting USAA\u2019s motion for summary judgment because an issue of fact existed concerning \u201cnotice\u201d to USAA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\u00b64 The origins of this dispute took shape prior to August 9,1998, the date when Lee sustained injuries while riding in a taxi cab near the airport in New Orleans, Louisiana, after the taxi was rear-ended by another driver. The driver of the other vehicle, who was at fault, carried liability insurance with a $10,000 policy limit, which undisputedly served only to scratch the surface of compensating Lee for her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">\u00b65 Prior to that date, her long-term co-habitating boyfriend or companion, David Hoss, purchased insurance from USAA, which covered two vehicles, a 1988 Acura and a 1989 Acura. It is undisputed that Hoss and Lee co-owned the two vehicles, as evidenced by certificates of title in the record. They had jointly owned the 1989 Acura since 1990, and purchased the 1988 Acura in 1997, with a certificate of title listing them as co-owners issued on February 17, 1998. It is also undisputed that although not married, Lee and Hoss have shared a household and parenting responsibilities for 14 years.</p>\n<p id=\"A86\">\u00b66 It is also undisputed that Lee was not expressly made a named insured on the USAA policy, and that the definitions of a \u201ccovered person\u201d in the policy did not include a co-habitating partner, unless that person was driving or was a passenger in a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d In a typical fashion, the policy provided coverage for the named insured and his or her \u201cspouse\u201d and \u201cfamily members,\u201d which it defined as persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption residing in the named insured\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">\u00b67 Hoss\u2019s policy with USAA included underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage. This coverage did not necessarily require that the \u201ccovered person\u201d must be driving or be a passenger in a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d Thus, the UIM coverage potentially extended to the factual circumstances described here, where Lee was occupying a taxi cab which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>involved in an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b68 Following her accident in Louisiana, Lee filed an UIM claim, contending she was entitled to stack coverage under both covered vehicles, which would make $200,000 available to cover the injuries she sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b69 USAA does not now contest that such a policy coverage scenario would be possible if, in fact, Lee was a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the UIM provision found in Hoss\u2019s policy. USAA\u2019s current position is that Lee is not a named insured, and as a matter of law is not a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the relevant policy provisions. Therefore, according to USAA, it has no obligation or duty to treat her as such under any of the legal theories argued by Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b610 USAA\u2019s position, however, was not always so certain. For example, it is undisputed that on October 16,1998, Larry Hutchison, a claims adjuster for USAA in Florida, wrote a letter to Lee\u2019s attorney in Great Falls requesting a copy of the titles for the two Acuras. Hoss and Lee complied. Hutchison then wrote to Lee\u2019s counsel, onNovember 12, stating that because Lee was a co-owner of the vehicles, \u201cshe would be entitled to the Underinsured Motorists coverage of our policy ...\u201d Hutchison informed counsel for Lee, however, that USAA would exclude her from medical payment coverage, because the accident occurred during the course of her employment and therefore Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits were available. The letter also advised Lee of the condition that she must first exhaust coverage from the at-fault party as well as any underinsured motorist coverage available from the taxi cab company before USAA coverage would be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b611 On November 19,1998, counsel for Lee sent a letter to Hutchison, informing USAA that Lee intended to stack UIM coverage limits. It is undisputed that on November 20, 1998, USAA changed its position, and implicitly informed Hoss that Lee, as a co-owner of the vehicles under his policy, was not entitled to UIM coverage; rather, she had only \u201climited coverage.\u201d USAA would later deny Lee\u2019s claim to UIM coverage under Hoss\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b612 Lee filed her complaint on February 8, 1999, claiming that she was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under Hoss\u2019s USAA policy. She further claimed that she had or would soon settle her claim with the negligent driver in Louisiana for the $10,000 policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\">\u00b613 USAA filed an amended Answer on April 2,1999. USAA asserted a blanket denial to Lee\u2019s claim. Lee alleges that USAA\u2019s first Answer, filed on March 28, is material here, because USAA allegedly admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that Lee was entitled to coverage under its policy with Hoss.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b614 Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. Lee filed her motion for summary judgment on April 9, 1999. USAA responded on May 2, and filed its own motion for summary judgment on June 7, 1999. A hearing took place on July 29, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b615 At issue here are two documents presented by USAA at the hearing. The documents, bearing the dates January 15, 1996, and January 15, 1999, are copies of a \u201cpolicy integrity form\u201d apparently sent each year to insureds for the stated purpose of assuring that the insured pays \u201cthe correct amount\u201d for the insurance policy. The form requests that the named insured \u201cmake any changes or corrections as necessary\u201d and may add \u201ca driver or a vehicle.\u201d The form also provides that if an insured makes changes, he or she should return the form; otherwise, the insured is specifically instructed to not return the form if no changes are made. The 1996 form, which was signed and dated by Hoss on October 25, 1995, showed that Hoss was the named insured under the USAA policy, and also the principal driver of a 1989 Acura and a 1983 Ford. Other than the location where the two vehicles would be garaged, no changes were made. The 1999 form affirms that Hoss is the named insured, identifies the two Acuras at issue here, and then shows a handwritten amendment that Lee is an additional driver, and a principal driver of the 1988 Acura.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b616 USAA offered the \u201cpolicy integrity forms\u201d as proof that it had no knowledge that Lee was the owner or operator of either vehicle at the time the accident occurred. This position was adopted at the hearing in response to Lee\u2019s argument that USAA simply made a mistake, or a clerical omission, by not including her, as an owner of the vehicles, on the policies as a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b617 In response to Lee\u2019s objection, the court stated it was accepting the introduction of only the 1996 form for the singular purpose of showing that Hoss had the opportunity each year to review the policy and make any changes. For this purpose, counsel for Lee stated that he did not have an objection-but insisted that the forms in no manner whatsoever should be used to imply that Hoss had withheld information, or otherwise had \u201cdirty hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b618 The District Court denied Lee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted USAA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on September 20, 1999. The court determined that Lee was not an \u201cinsured\u201d for the purposes of UIM coverage pursuant to the express language of Hoss\u2019s policy with USAA. Thus, in terms of governing contract law, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>determined that Lee could not gain the benefit from a bargain to which she was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b619 Next, the court addressed the issue of whether Montana statutes mandating vehicle liability coverage must be construed to place a duty on insurance carriers to cover, as \u201cinsureds,\u201d all registered owners of all vehicles the carrier insures. Lee contended that this duty existed whether or not an owner was a party to the insurance contract, a named insured, or otherwise identified in the policy. The court disagreed, \u00e1nd identified the public policy underlying the mandatory liability statutes at issue as one intended to compensate innocent third parties injured or damaged in an accident, rather than provide all vehicle owners with liability protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b620 Thus, the court concluded that Hoss\u2019s policy with USAA complied with the statutory requirements, notwithstanding the fact that a co-owner of the vehicles was never identified in the policy. The court determined, therefore, that \u201c[tjhere are no statutes or public policy reasons for extending underinsured or uninsured motorist coverages to persons who are not either expressly parties to the insurance contract or passengers in a covered vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b621 The court next addressed the issue of estoppel or judicial admission. Finding no evidence that Lee had relied on the Hutchison letter, the court determined that USAA was not estopped from denying UIM coverage. The court also determined, as a matter of law, that USAA\u2019s first Answer did not serve as a judicial admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b622 Lee filed a Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., motion for a new trial on September 29, 1999. Attached to the motion were the two \u201cpolicy integrity forms\u201d and an affidavit submitted by Hoss in which he claimed for the first time that he had informed USAA by phone some time between November of 1997 and February of 1998 that Lee was a co-owner of both vehicles, and that she should be included as a named insured on his policy. In response, USAA submitted an affidavit by one of its agents that contended that USAA had no record or recollection of that phone conversation, and that the introduction of such evidence, under Rule 59, was improper and could not sustain the motion. Without discussion, the District Court denied the motion on November 5, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b623 Lee appeals summary judgment entered in favor of USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"ATO\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">\u00b624 This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>using the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria applied by the district court. <em>See Spinier v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 348, \u00b6 14. This Court looks to the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits to determine the existence or nonexistence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Erker v. Kester, </em>1999 MT 231, \u00b6 17, 296 Mont. 123, \u00b6 17, 988 P.2d 1221, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"A_G\">\u00b625 Summary judgment is an extreme remedy which should be granted only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., Spinier, \u00b6 16. The party seeking summary judgment, therefore, has the burden of demonstrating a complete absence of any genuine factual issues. <em>See Spinier, </em>\u00b6 15. The party seeking summary judgment also must overcome the burden that all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the offered evidence will be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>See Erker, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b626 Where the moving party is able to demonstrate that no genuine issue as to any material fact remains in dispute, however, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion. <em>See Spinier, </em>\u00b6 15. This burden shift requires that the opposing party present material and substantial evidence, rather than merely conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Erker, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b627 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., motion to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>See Joseph Eve &amp; Co. v. Allen, </em>1998 MT 189, \u00b6 46, 290 Mont. 175, \u00b6 46, 964 P.2d 11, \u00b6 46. \u201cThe test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>1998 MT 306, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 118, \u00b6 13, 970 P.2d 84, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b628 Before addressing the issues raised by Lee, we must dispel those theories that simply are unsupportable as a matter of law. In Lee\u2019s own words, it has been her primary position throughout this litigation that as a matter of law \u201cshe was entitled to UIM coverage because she was an owner of both covered autos\u201d and her \u201cownership of the insured vehicles created underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u00b629 Although not expressly seeking reformation, Lee in essence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>contends that by operation of law or as a matter of public policy we must reform the USAA policy to include her as a named insured because she undisputedly is the co-owner of the two vehicles under the policy. <em>See, e.g., Horace Mann Ins. v. Hampton </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 354, 358, 767 P.2d 343, 345 (discussing reformation of insurance contract and citing 12A Couch on Insurance \u00a7 45:692 (rev.ed.)). We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b630 We agree with Lee, however, that this Court is bound to interpret the terms of an insurance contract according to their usual, common-sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of average intelligence not trained in law or insurance business. <em>See Wendell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 14, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 14, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted). The counter-balance rule to the foregoing is that if the language is clear and explicit this Court may not rewrite an insurance contract, but must enforce it as written. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted). This Court has held, in fact, that expectations which are contrary to a clear exclusion from coverage are not objectively reasonable. <em>See Counterpoint, Inc. v. Essex Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 251, \u00b6 18, 291 Mont. 189, \u00b6 18, 967 P.2d 393, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b631 Assuming that Hoss read the policy it should have been obvious that a non-spouse, non-family member resident of his household was excluded from UIM coverage under certain circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Fillinger v. Northwestern Agency, Inc., of Great Falls, </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 71, 77-79, 938 P.2d 1347, 1351-52 (discussing duty of insured to read policy, and indicating that although duty is not absolute insured must act reasonably under the circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b632 For example, on the declaration page of Hoss\u2019s USAA policy the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d is identified as \u201cDavid J. Hoss.\u201d Under \u201cDEFINITIONS\u201d the policy provides that the terms you and <em>your </em>refer to the \u2018\u201cnamed insured\u2019 shown in the Declarations and spouse if a resident of the same household.\u201d The policy also defines \u201cfamily member\u201d as \u201ca person related to <em>you </em>by blood, marriage, or adoption who is a resident of your household.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b633 It is undisputed that Lee was not identified as a named insured, and was not a spouse or a family member, as defined under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Av-\">\u00b634 The policy defines \u201cYour covered auto\u201d as including \u201cAny vehicle shown in the Declarations.\u201d It is undisputed that the vehicles shown in the declarations at the time of the accident were the two Acuras co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>owned by Hoss and Lee. There are no express terms or provisions, however, requiring or otherwise indicating that <em>ownership </em>of a \u201ccovered auto\u201d was a material prerequisite to attaining the contractual status as a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d or for placing the identification of a particular vehicle on the declarations page. Thus, whether Hoss was in fact the registered owner of <em>his covered auto </em>under the USAA policy is immaterial in construing the express terms and provisions found therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b635 Under the UIM coverage provisions at issue, the term \u201ccovered person\u201d is defined as either You or any family member\u201d and \u201cAny other person occupying your covered auto.\u201d Again, it is undisputed that Lee was not You,\u201d a \u201cfamily member,\u201d or occupying a \u201ccovered auto\u201d at the time she sustained injuries in the New Orleans accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b636  Therefore, as a matter of law, the insurance agreement between Hoss and USAA cannot be construed, due to a patent ambiguity, as conferring the status of \u201cnamed insured\u201d upon Lee. Accordingly, we conclude that there are no ambiguities within the USAA policy as to whether Lee was excluded from UIM coverage at the time she sustained injuries in New Orleans in August of 1998. At that time, it is undisputed that Lee had not been expressly made a named insured on the USAA policy, and that the definitions for the various classes of automatic insureds under the policy did not include a co-habitating partner, unless that person was driving or was a passenger in a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d The USAA policy does not expressly link ownership of a \u201ccovered auto\u201d with the term \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour.\u201d Thus, for the purpose of illustration, even if Lee was the <em>sole owner </em>of the vehicles, and Hoss was the named insured, the results here would be no different.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b637 Other courts addressing a similar interpretation of vehicle insurance policies have reached the same conclusion. For example, a North Carolina court addressed virtually the same issue in <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Williams </em>(N.C.Ct.App. 1996), 472 S.E.2d 220. In that case, the injured spouse of a co-owner of a vehicle claimed he was entitled to UIM coverage under the policy of the other co-owner, his spouse\u2019s father. The court denied that this coverage existed under the express provisions of the policy. The court found that the express UIM coverage under the spouse\u2019s father\u2019s policy applied only to the named insured, or family members residing in the same household, or persons occupying covered autos. The court observed that (1) the co-owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>spouse was a \u201cnamed driver\u201d rather than a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under her father\u2019s policy, (2) neither she nor the injured defendant resided in her father\u2019s household at the time of the accident, and (3) the vehicle driven by the injured defendant was not a covered auto. <em>See generally Nationwide, </em>472 S.E.2d at 221-23. <em>See also Kashmark v. Western Ins. Co. </em>(Minn. 1984), 344 N.W.2d 844, 849 (change in residence of named insured\u2019s son altered son\u2019s status from \u201cfamily member\u201d entitled to uninsured motorist coverage to an \u201comnibus\u201d insured entitled to coverage only while using a described auto).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b638 As to whether the USAA policy should nevertheless be reformed because, as a matter of public policy expressed in governing legislation, <em>all </em>owners of insured vehicles must be named insureds under liability policies covering the owners\u2019 vehicles, we find little support for this assertion as applied to this specific context.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b639 As this Court recently discussed in <em>Infinity Ins. Co. v. Dodson, </em>2000 MT 287, 302 Mont. 209, 14 P.3d 487, our mandatory liability statutes place the burden on vehicle owners to cloak each <em>vehicle </em>they own with prescribed minimum amounts of omnibus liability coverage regardless of the <em>person </em>behind the wheel, so long as the person driving the vehicle has express or implied permission to use the vehicle. <em>See Infinity, </em>\u00b6 48. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 61-6-103(2)(a),.MCA (requiring that an owner\u2019s policy of liability must expressly designate all vehicles covered); \u00a7 61-6-301(l)(a), MCA (requiring that an owner of a motor vehicle registered and operated in Montana shall continuously \u201cprovide\u201d insurance against loss caused by maintenance or use of a motor vehicle); <em>Bill Atkin Volkswagen, Inc. v. McClafferty </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 99, 104, 689 P.2d 1237, 1239-40 (discussing statutory requirement that vehicle owner must insure against liability from permissive use of owner\u2019s vehicle, although auto dealer does not register inventory vehicles).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b640  Again, it is the <em>vehicle, </em>not the <em>person </em>driving the vehicle, that is the focal concern of our mandatory liability laws. <em>See Infinity, </em>\u00b6 48. Our governing mandatory liability laws do not require, therefore, that each named insured under a vehicle liability policy must be the registered owner of the insured vehicle, or that all registered owners of a vehicle must be named insureds. <em>See Horace Mann, </em>235 Mont. at 358-59, 767 P.2d at 345-46 (holding that Mandatory Liability Protection Act requires that liability insurance must continue to cover the <em>vehicle </em>even though the permittee may have exceeded the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the owner\u2019s permission or consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b641 Lee\u2019s public policy argument would make perfect sense if the USAA policy did not deem her an automatic insured for liability when she got behind the wheel of either of the two vehicles she co-owned with Hoss, or otherwise excluded mandatory liability coverage due to a loss resulting from her ownership, maintenance, or use of the vehicles. No one seriously disputes, however, that the legal obligation to continuously \u201cprovide\u201d insurance for the two vehicles was fully discharged by at least one of the owners, in that the USAA policy provided the minimum levels of liability coverage in full compliance with \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, regardless of who was behind the wheel of either vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b642 We conclude, therefore, that whether one or both or neither of the registered owners were \u201cnamed insureds\u201d on Hoss\u2019s USAA policy is immaterial in our analysis of whether the policy comported with the liability coverage mandates of \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-103 and 301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b643 In this same light, whether USAA \u201crealized\u201d that Lee was a co-owner or an \u201coperator\u201d of the vehicles is likewise immaterial to our discussion. Neither fact is material in determining whether Hoss\u2019s policy with USAA complied with our mandatory liability laws. Thus, whether Hoss informed USAA that Lee was or would be an \u201cadditional driver\u201d or was a co-owner of the vehicles, or whether USAA could have or should have or did in fact discover this information, is all immaterial in determining whether the UIM coverage applied to Lee. That USAA was unaware, as it claims, that Lee even existed-let alone posed an insurance risk as a likely operator of either vehicle-speaks far more of its internal customer service policies than to any questions of law under our mandatory vehicle liability insurance statutes. Why an insurance company would issue a vehicle policy to anyone without ascertaining who is the registered owner of the vehicle or vehicles, who resides in the named insured\u2019s residence, and who the prospective drivers would most likely be is of no concern to any legal determination here.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b644 Accordingly, this matter can be pared to (1) whether USAA\u2019s alleged admission that Lee, \u00e1s an owner of the vehicles, was covered under the policy\u2019s UIM provisions is binding; and (2) whether Hoss specifically requested that USAA make Lee a named insured under his policy and then USAA agreed but failed to do so. Thus, we proceed to the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\n<em>Issue 1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in denying Lee\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on USAA\u2019s letter affirming coverage because Lee was a registered owner of both vehicles ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b645 Although the policy itself was not ambiguous, Lee nevertheless contends that because USAA\u2019s claims adjuster in Florida, Larry Hutchison, initially informed Lee that \u201cshe would be entitled to the Underinsured Motorists coverage of our policy\u201d USAA should be bound by this admission of coverage. Lee also claims that USAA\u2019s first Answer, which was' later amended, should be a binding judicial admission as a matter of law, as well. We find little merit in either of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b646 In the November 12, 1998 letter sent by Hutchison to Lee\u2019s counsel, USAA denied medical payment coverage based on a workers compensation exclusion. Hutchison then incorrectly informed counsel for Lee, that Lee \u201cwould be entitled to the underinsured motorists coverage of our policy.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter indicated that Lee would first be required to exhaust the at-fault party\u2019s liability coverage as well as any underinsured coverage available under the taxi cab company\u2019s insurance policy before USAA would \u201cextend any coverage to her from this accident.\u201d In another letter dated November 20, 1998, however, another USAA representative, Donna Skeith-without any direct reference to the Hutchison letter-stated in part: \u201cBecause Stephanie Lee is not a family member by this definition, she has limited coverage ... she is not covered as the operator of, or as a passenger in, any nonowned, borrowed, or rented vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u00b647  Generally, we agree with the authority relied on by USAA that an assurance made by an insurance agent that a particular coverage exists, in the absence of an ambiguity, does not \u201ccreate\u201d or extend coverage beyond those covered risks expressly identified in the policy or those risks that are expressly excluded. <em>See Shows v. Pemberton </em>(Wash.Ct.App. 1994), 868 P.2d 164, 166-67; <em>DeJonge v. Mutual of Enumclaw </em>(Or. 1992), 843 P.2d 914, 916. As provided under \u00a7 33-15-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>302, MCA, an insurance policy must contain the entire contract between the parties, and \u201cneither the insurer or any insurance producer or representative thereof nor any person insured thereunder shall make any agreement as to the insurance which is not plainly expressed in. the policy.\u201d Thus, Lee\u2019s contention that USAA\u2019s \u201cagreement\u201d through the Hutchison letter \u201ccreated\u201d UIM coverage in favor of Lee cannot be sustained as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b648  In sum, assurances or representations made as a result of confusion and misfeasance by an insurance company agent do not render an otherwise unambiguous policy \u201cambiguous\u201d as a matter of law. Rather, as a general rule, such conduct may be offered to demonstrate that an ambiguity exists-particularly from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance. <em>See generally Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Prod. Sales &amp; Mktg., Inc. </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 2000), 93 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 383 (insurance agent may bind insurer in giving ambiguous policy provision an interpretation that coverage exists); <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. </em>Co., 1999 MT 17, \u00b6 14, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 14, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 14 (Court is bound to interpret the terms of an insurance contract according to their usual, common-sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b649  Nevertheless, in some limited instances, an assurance of coverage by an insurance agent that conflicts with an unambiguous policy may afford an insured relief under such theories as waiver or estoppel. <em>See DeJonge, </em>843 P.2d at 916 (agent dissuades insured from reading or understanding policy through its representations that coverage exists); <em>Farley v. United Pac. Ins. Co. </em>(Or. 1974), 525 P.2d 1003, 1007-08 (stating that policy language does not have to be ambiguous as a \u201clegal matter\u201d in order to bind the insurer to the agent\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d interpretation that coverage exists when language is viewed through the understanding of the reasonable consumer of insurance, and agent\u2019s representations are not \u201cpatently absurd\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Akc\">\u00b650 Lee has pursued the theory of equitable estoppel on appeal. This issue was never directly raised by Lee before the District Court; rather, USAA briefly addressed the issue of estoppel and the District Court addressed the issue in its Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b651 As this Court has often stated, an element of estoppel is detrimental reliance. <em>See Truck Ins. Exch. v. Waller </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 328, 333, 828 P.2d 1384, 1387; <em>Selley v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>2000 MT 76, \u00b6 10, 299 Mont. 127, \u00b6 10, 998 P.2d 156, \u00b6 10 (listing six elements of equitable estoppel that include (5) the conduct must be relied upon by the other party and lead that party to act, and (6) the other party must in fact act upon the conduct in such a manner as to change its position for the worse; and stating that elements must be established by clear and convincing evidence) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b652 We need not determine whether or not the circumstances here are appropriate for applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel as discussed in <em>Pemberton </em>and <em>DeJonge. </em>Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Lee has failed to present clear and convincing evidence that she settled the underlying case against the tortfeasor, Troy Stewart, for $10,000 in reliance on the November 12,1998 Hutchison letter that indicated UIM coverage existed, and that such a settlement was to her detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b653 To the contrary, Lee\u2019s complaint, filed February 4, 1999, stated that Stewart\u2019s insurer \u201chas <em>now </em>agreed to pay the policy limits of $10,000 to Stephanie Lee and Stephanie Lee has reserved her right to bring this underinsured motorist claim against Defendant,\u201d and \u201c[i]t is assumed that Defendant has waived or will waive any right of subrogation.\u201d (Emphasis added). The complaint then provides that \u201cPlaintiff is entitled to collect from Defendant, pursuant to this insurance contract, the full extent of her damages over and above the $10,000 she <em>had already received.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). On appeal, Lee has asserted that she \u201csettled her case against the tortfeasor for the $10,000.00 policy limits in specific reliance upon USAA\u2019s representation that UIM coverage existed based upon Lee\u2019s ownership of the covered vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b654 Notwithstanding the inherent contradictions' found in the foregoing conclusory assertions, Lee has presented no evidence that:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">(1) subsequent to Hutchison\u2019s letter Lee satisfied USAA\u2019s conditional assurance of coverage by first exhausting the available coverage under both the at-fault driver and the taxi cab company\u2019s insurance policies;</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">(2) an actual settlement agreement was entered with the at-fault driver\u2019s insurer or the taxi cab\u2019s insurer; or (3) that the timing of any such agreements was reached in correlation with Hutchison\u2019s November 12,1998 letter, before USAA affirmatively denied coverage, and thereby withdrew Hutchison\u2019s assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\u00b655 This set of circumstances is in stark contrast to both federal decisions relied on by Lee. In both <em>Boyle v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(D.Mont. 1999), 25 Mont.F.Rptr. 446, CV 99-8-GF-DWM, and <em>Dion v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(D.Mont. 1997), 22 Mont.F.Rptr. 225, CV-95-122-GF, the plaintiffs were named insureds who, following an accident, were assured they would be covered under their policies, only to have this pledge withdrawn due to a new interpretation of underinsured and uninsured coverage by Nationwide. In both cases, the federal court concluded that the policy was ambiguous as a matter of law as to whether -uninsured coverage included underinsured coverage as well, and therefore construed coverage in favor of the insured. The withdrawal of coverage undisputedly occurred after the plaintiffs had relied on the prior assurance, and, in <em>Dion, </em>the court ruled that the insurer was estopped from denying coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b656 With no material facts regarding detrimental reliance in dispute, we conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that, as a matter of law, USAA could not be estopped from denying UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b657 Finally, Lee contends that USAA\u2019s initial Answer filed March 29, 1999, which was superseded by an amended Answer on April 2,1999, serves as a judicial admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b658 A judicial admission is \u201can express waiver made in court by a party or his attorney conceding the truth of an alleged fact.\u201d <em>DeMars v. Carlstrom </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 334, 337, 948 P.2d 246, 248. A judicial admission is not binding unless it is an unequivocal statement of fact, rather than a conclusion of law or the expression of an opinion. <em>DeMars, </em>285 Mont. at 338, 948 P.2d at 249. Judicial admissions may occur at any point during the litigation process; they may arise during discovery, pleadings, opening statements, direct and cross-examination, as well as closing arguments. <em>See Kohne v. Yost </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 109, 112, 818 P.2d 360, 362 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b659 Our review of both Answers leads to the inevitable conclusion that USAA, essentially, admitted to no material fact of consequence to the matter at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b660 USAA\u2019s first Answer merely stated that \u201cDefendant admits that on July 15,1998 through January 15, 1999, the plaintiff was insured by the Defendant.\u201d Reference to Lee being \u201cinsured\u201d was omitted from the amended Answer, which denied the remaining allegations contained in paragraph three of Lee\u2019s complaint. Paragraph three, however, merely alleged that Lee \u201cwas insured by Defendant.\u201d Thus, Lee never asserted that she was or should be deemed <em>a named </em>insured, or, for that matter, that she was a co-owner of the vehicles. It is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>unequivocal fact that Lee, in certain respects, <em>was insured </em>under Hoss\u2019s policy with USAA, along with the entire world of permissive drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b661  Accordingly, we hold that neither USAA\u2019s agent\u2019s representations to Lee that UIM coverage existed or its first Answer admitting that Lee was insured under Hoss\u2019s policy serve as sufficient grounds for enforcing the UIM coverage in Lee\u2019s favor, or estopping USAA from denying such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>Issue 2.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in granting USAA\u2019s motion for summary judgment because an issue of fact existed concerning \u201cnotice\u201d to USAA?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b662 Lee contends that providing \u201cnotice\u201d of Lee\u2019s ownership of the vehicles to USAA was not required for UIM coverage to exist for Lee. In her Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., motion for a new trial she asserts that \u201c[i]t is Plaintiffs position that it makes no difference whether USAA had notice or did not have notice that Stephanie Lee was an owner when it insured the vehicle <em>owned by her.\u201d </em>Pursuant to our earlier, discussion, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b663 Nevertheless, Lee invites this Court to scrutinize this potential fact issue if we find that \u201cnotice\u201d was a requirement for coverage, and specifically directs our attention to the \u201cpolicy integrity forms\u201d submitted by counsel for USAA to the District Court at the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b664 As Lee correctly points out, although USAA was permitted to introduce the 1996 and 1999 policy integrity forms-although the court apparently accepted only the 1996 form-the existence of the 1997 and 1998 policy integrity forms was never substantiated, nor were their contents revealed to the court. Thus, if \u201cnotice\u201d is an issue, Lee contends that the District Court erred by ruling on inadequate affidavits or documents, and Lee is presumptively prejudiced by not having had an opportunity prior, to the hearing to counter USAA\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d introduction of the 1996 and 1999 forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u00b665 Essentially, Lee\u2019s argument strives to transform what amounts to little more than expository dictum into an ultimate legal conclusion reached by the District Court. True, the court did state in its order that \u201c[ajllowing a party to claim the benefits of insurance coverage where no notice was provided to the insurance carrier of additional risks would be an injustice\u201d and \u201cthere is no evidence before this court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>her existence as an owner or operator of the vehicles was disclosed to Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b666 Nevertheless, we conclude that the denial of Lee\u2019s claim to UIM coverage subject to the District Court\u2019s summary judgment review was well grounded upon Montana law governing mandatory liability insurance for vehicles, the rules of law for construing insurance contracts, and the doctrines of equitable estoppel and judicial admissions. Further, contrary to Lee\u2019s assertions on appeal, her counsel specifically did not object to the introduction of the policy integrity forms on the grounds that led the District Court to offer the foregoing comments concerning notice. Finally, Lee has not contended that the 1999 policy integrity form-which she attached to her Rule 59 motion and brief-was inaccurate, or omitted information that would have any bearing on whether USAA had expressly agreed to place Lee on Hoss\u2019s policy as named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b667 Pursuant to our earlier discussion and our <em>de novo </em>review of the forms in question, we conclude' that whether USAA had \u201cnotice\u201d of Lee\u2019s co-ownership of the two vehicles, and whether she was a named driver or a principle driver under Hoss\u2019s policy, are immaterial facts in determining whether Lee should or should not be entitled to UIM coverage as a matter of law. We therefore disagree with Lee that the District Court deemed that the issue of notice was \u201cpivotal.\u201d To this end, we observe that the District Court\u2019s discussion of \u201cnotice\u201d is immaterial to its ultimate decisions regarding the absence of material facts in dispute, and USAA\u2019s right to judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b668 Nevertheless, in connection with this issue, Lee wishes to raise a factual dispute that was addressed by her Rule 59 motion that is altogether different from her \u201cnotice\u201d argument, in that it directly implicates whether she should have expressly been made a named insured on Hoss\u2019s policy. In her \u201cRule 59 Motion for New Trial and Supporting Brief,\u201d Lee asserted, for the first time, that Hoss had actually contacted USAA soon after he and Lee purchased their 1988 Acura in November of 1997 to notify USAA that Lee was the owner of both Acuras. Sometime between November of 1997 and February of 1998 Hoss allegedly \u201cplaced a telephone call to USAA and advised USAA to include Stephanie Lee as a named insured ...\u201d Allegedly, USAA assured Hoss that it would satisfy his request. This assertion was made pursuant to a signed affidavit submitted by Hoss.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b669 In turn, USAA presented an affidavit claiming that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>possess the 1997 and 1998 policy integrity forms, and that its claims attorney had \u201cmade a diligent search of the records regarding any phone calls that were made between November 17,1997 and February 17,1998 by David J. Hoss regarding any information on the policies of insurance issued to Mr. Hoss by USAA, and, my search has failed to reveal the existence of any such phone call having been made.\u201d USAA did not attach any records supporting the claims attorney\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"AQv\">\u00b670 Again, not one inkling of this critical factual dispute was presented by either party to the District Court for review prior to it entering summary judgment in favor of USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b671 On purely procedural grounds, we first conclude that Lee\u2019s motion for a new trial is without merit. As a matter of law, a summary judgment proceeding, which results in a judgment for one party, is not a \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Rule 59(a), M.R.Civ.P., and \u00a7 25-11-101, MCA. The statute defines a new trial as a \u201creexamination of an issue of fact in the same court <em>after a trial </em>and decision by a jury or court or by referees.\u201d Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., which governs summary judgments, clearly indicates that such a proceeding is a <em>pre-trial </em>adjudication. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rule 56(d), M.R.Civ.P. (indicating that where judgment is rendered not upon the whole case or for all the relief asked a trial may be necessary). This Court has routinely stated that the purpose of summary judgment is to <em>eliminate </em>unnecessary trials, but that summary adjudication should \u201cnever be <em>substituted for a trial </em>if a material factual controversy exists.\u201d <em>See Boyes v. Eddie, </em>1998 MT 311, \u00b6 16, 292 Mont. 152, \u00b6 16, 970 P.2d 91, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted and emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1435 (6th ed. 1990) (defining summary judgment as a procedural device available \u201cfor prompt and expeditious disposition of controversy <em>without trial\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b672  We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in summarily denying Lee\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b673 We observe, however, that Lee\u2019s motion for a new trial is also asserted as a motion for <em>\u201camending </em>... the judgment entered\u201d which invokes Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P., \u201cmotion to alter or amend a judgment.\u201d In closing her Rule 59 brief Lee urged the District Court \u201cto grant a new trial <em>and to amend </em>the judgment granting summary judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added). This Court has stated, that \u201c[w]e shall look to the substance of a motion, not just its title, to identify what motion has been presented.\u201d <em>Carr v. Bett, </em>1998 MT 266, \u00b6 22, 291 Mont. 326, \u00b6 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>970 P.2d 1017, \u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Miller v. Herbert </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 132, 136, 900 P.2d 273, 275). Further, this Court has deemed Rule 59(g) an appropriate procedure under certain circumstances for seeking a complete reversal of summary judgment. <em>See Carr, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b674. In <em>Carr, </em>the aggrieved party in a marriage dissolution case sought to amend a judgment by the court that refused to set aside a foreign judgment from Wyoming in favor of his spouse. In turn, the court granted the spouse\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We concluded that if the relief was granted, and the foreign judgment was set aside, then there \u201cwere no other options available to the District Court to partially alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(g) and the relief requested\u201d and, accordingly, the Rule 59(g) motion was \u201cappropriate in seeking a reversal of the court\u2019s earlier decisions.\u201d <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b675 Recently, this Court set forth criteria for determining what grounds or issues a party may or may not raise pursuant to a Rule 59(g) motion to alter or amend. In <em>Nelson v. Driscoll </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 355, 948 P.2d 256, we identified four potential grounds: (1) to correct manifest errors of law or fact upon which the judgment was based; (2) to raise newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence; (3) to prevent manifest injustice resulting from, among other things, serious misconduct of counsel; or (4) to bring to the court\u2019s attention an intervening change in controlling law. <em>See Nelson, </em>285 Mont. at 360, 948 P.2d at 259 (citing 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2810.1 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b676 We then stated that a motion to alter or amend: (1) is not intended merely to re-litigate old matters nor are such motions intended to allow the parties to present the case under new theories; (2) should not present arguments which the court has already considered and rejected; (3) cannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before judgment issued; and (4) is not intended to routinely give litigants a second bite at the apple, but to afford an opportunity for relief in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Nelson, </em>285 Mont. at 360-61, 948 P.2d at 259 (citations to federal authority omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b677 Here, the District Court summarily ruled on Lee\u2019s motion to amend without discussion, and therefore it is unclear to this Court whether it took into consideration the foregoing criteria in light of the potentially \u201cnewly discovered or previously unavailable evidence\u201d or whether it deemed the substance of Lee\u2019s motion and accompanying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>affidavit as \u201carguments which could, and should, have been made before judgment issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b678 This Court, therefore, has no means of reviewing whether the District Court under the circumstances acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. As we recently stated in <em>Norwood v. Service Distrib., </em>Inc., 2000 MT 4, \u00b6 54, 297 Mont. 473, \u00b6 54, 994 P.2d 25, \u00b6 54, this Court will not enter a judgment if such action might, in the opinion of the court, work an injustice. <em>Norwood, </em>\u00b6 54 (quoting <em>Alley v. Butte &amp; Western Mining Co. </em>(1926), 77 Mont. 477, 497, 251 P. 517, 524). Here, if Lee\u2019s assertion is true, it would call into question numerous factual assertions made by USAA throughout the underlying dispute upon which the District Court relied in entering judgment in USAA\u2019s favor. Our affirmation of the court\u2019s Rule 59 ruling, therefore, could potentially work an injustice unless and until a far more thorough inquiry is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b679 We conclude, therefore, in light of the criteria identified in <em>Nelson, </em>this matter is remanded for the limited purpose of conducting a factual inquiry into the basis of Hoss\u2019s alleged request that Lee be made a named insured, and USAA\u2019s assertion that it possesses no knowledge or records that such a request was ever made or agreed to by one of its agents. After a factual determination, the District Court may then enter its judgment on Lee\u2019s Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., motion to amend the judgment in favor of USAA. -</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b680 Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Lee\u2019s Rule 59 motion to amend and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-7\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> False impressions conveyed by USAA correspondence were not a singular event in this matter. For example, USAA\u2019s November 20, 1998 letter to Hoss, stated that \u201c[\u00bf\u00a1overage does not apply to persons to whom she [Lee] grants permission to operate a vehicle.\u201d Although not at issue, if USAA were to hold to this position, its policy with Hoss could potentially contravene state law and breach the express terms of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b399-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AVF\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">\u00b681 I concur entirely in the Court's opinion on issue 1.1 respectfully dissent from that opinion on issue 2 and would affirm the District Court's denial of Lee's Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P., motion to amend. In my view, the Court's analysis of-and decision on-issue 2 substantially undermines the summary judgment process and also adds unnecessary requirements in ruling on Rule 59 motions, not required by any existing rule, to district courts already overburdened with work. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"AgMK\">\u00b682 Prior to focusing on the legal issue at hand, it is important to keep certain undisputed facts in this case in mind. While Hoss is not a party herein, it is his policy with USAA which is at issue. Hoss and L\u00e9e co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>owned the vehicle under which coverage is sought from USAA, and had shared a household and parenting responsibilities for 14 years. Lee and USAA both filed motions for summary judgment and the District Court granted USAA's motion and denied Lee's motion. Thereafter, via a Rule 59 motion, Lee asserted the existence of a factual issue-described by the Court as a \u201ccritical factual dispute\u201d-for the first time via an affidavit by Hoss; namely, that Hoss had telephoned USAA soon after the purchase of the 1988 Acura to notify it that Lee also was an owner and needed to be included as a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b683 I agree with the Court that Lee's motion properly can be considered one to amend the judgment under Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P., but not one for a new trial. I also agree with the Court that, under the unique circumstances in <em>Carr, </em>Rule 59(g) was an appropriate procedure for seeking reversal of a summary judgment. In my view, however, nothing in <em>Carr </em>supports the use of a post-summary judgment motion to amend-which raises an entirely new factual issue for the first time-such as is presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b684 In <em>Carr, </em>there were two separate cases: in one, the district court denied the husband's motion to set aside a Wyoming judgment in his spouse's favor and, in the other, on the same day, the district court granted the wife's motion for summary judgment. There also were two Rule 59(g) motions to amend by the husband: the first requested the court to alter or amend the judgment and set aside the Wyoming judgment, and the second requested that summary judgment in the wife's favor be vacated. As we correctly stated under those unique circumstances, \u201c[i]f the District Court granted Ian's request, the [Wyoming] judgment would have been set aside and summary judgment would not have been granted in the dissolution proceeding.\u201d <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 27. Unlike the present case, <em>Carr </em>did not involve a post-summary judgment effort to raise a factual dispute for the first time. Moreover, neither the unique circumstances in <em>Carr </em>nor any other extraordinary circumstances exist in the present case where both parties moved for summary judgment and, after losing in the summary judgment proceeding, one party attempts to raise an entirely new factual dispute via a Rule 59(g) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b685 In addition, while I agree with the Court's reiteration of the criteria set forth in <em>Nelson </em>for the grounds on which a Rule 59(g) motion to alter or amend may be premised, I strenuously disagree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the Court's application of <em>Nelson </em>to the present case. The \u201ccriteria\u201d are merely generic descriptions. Nothing in <em>Nelson </em>determines or even suggests that Rule 59(g) motions on such grounds are necessarily appropriate in the post-summary judgment context. Indeed, our sole reason in <em>Nelson </em>for setting out these four subject areas identified by commentators Wright, Miller and Kane as those where parties successfully pursued a Rule 59(g) motion was to address the issues before us there, which was whether the motion was one to alter or amend or to reconsider. <em>See Nelson, </em>285 Mont. at 360, 948 P.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"AO6\">\u00b686 Moreover, I simply cannot agree with the Court's implicit view that, under the facts of this case, the new factual dispute raised by Lee after summary judgment had been granted to USAA may even conceivably fall within the \u201cnewly discovered or previously unavailable evidence\u201d criteria stated in <em>Nelson. </em>Lee relied on an affidavit by Hoss to raise this new factual dispute. As pointed out above, it is undisputed that Hoss is Lee's live-in companion of 14 years' duration, the person with whom she co-owns the 1988 Acura, and the holder of the USAA insurance policy at issue in this case. Under these circumstances, it is inconceivable that any affidavit by Hoss could raise \u201cnewly discovered or previously unavailable evidence.\u201d In addition, under these circumstances, the Hoss affidavit clearly is an effort to accomplish three of the four things for which motions to alter or amend are <em>not </em>to be used, according to <em>Nelson: </em>(1) to allow a party to present the case under a new theory; (2) to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before judgment issued; and (3) to give a litigant a second bite at the apple. <em>See Nelson, </em>285 Mont. at 360-61, 948 P.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b687 Forcing the District Court to expressly address Lee's motion to amend under the facts, and in the summary judgment context, of this case is an invitation to disaster for summary judgment proceedings and trial courts. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., requires a district court to render summary judgment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">That is precisely what the District Court did in this case in granting USAA's motion for summary judgment and denying Lee's cross motion. If Lee wanted to raise the factual issue of whether Hoss contacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>USAA about her being a co-owner, she could and should have done so in her opposition to USAA's motion for summary judgment. If she were unable to do so because an affidavit could not timely be obtained from Hoss for purposes of opposing USAA's motion, procedures were available to her in the summary judgment rules for seeking a continuance. <em>See </em>Rule 56(f), M.R.Civ.P. I submit that the only portion of <em>Nelson </em>which has any application under the facts of this summary judgment proceeding is the part setting forth the purposes for which a Rule 59(g) motion to alter or amend is <em>not </em>to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b688 Finally, the Court observes that the District Court \u201csummarily ruled on Lee's motion to amend without discussion,\u201d states it cannot review said ruling, and remands for a factual inquiry and entry of judgment-which presumably must be carefully supported by the District Court. It certainly is true that the District Court summarily ruled on Lee's motion. On the basis of my discussion above, it is my view that the summary ruling was appropriate. Nor am I aware of any requirement that a district court support its denial of a post-trial or post-summary judgment motion via findings and conclusions or a memorandum of decision. Indeed, in the absence of a ruling on such motions within 60 days, the motions are deemed denied by operation of law pursuant to Rules 59(d) and (g), M.R.Civ.P. In such instances, which are the most common means used by trial courts to handle such motions, we do not receive a ruling at all, much less one supported by findings and conclusions or a memorandum of decision. Nor do we have any difficulty reviewing such deemed denials by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">\u00b689 In summary, it is my opinion that, by its decision in this case, the Court is creating a new and unwise method by which a party to a summary judgment proceeding can avoid the application of summary judgment rules and get a \u201csecond bite at the apple.\u201d In addition, it is creating a mountain of unnecessary work for already overloaded district courts. I do not agree with either result. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
