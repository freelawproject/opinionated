J., Eccleston, Tuck and Mason, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-8\"><em>Wm. P. Maulsby </em>for the appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\">That under the act of 1805, ch. 110, and its supplements, the appellant was <em>absolutely </em>released and discharged from all debts and causes of action existing and accruing prior to his application on the 5th of April 1850, and his plea of such discharge ousted the jurisdiction of the justice to render the judgment and issue the <em>ca. sa. </em>and commitment thereon. The demurrer admits the fact that the debt was incurred prior to the discharge, and the question therefore is distinctly presented, whether a justice of the peace has jurisdiction to enter a judgment and issue execution thereon against a party who has been duly discharged under the insolvent laws, for a cause of action arising prior to his application, when it appears by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>record that the plea of discharge was produced and not controverted, and no plea or evidence appears to take the claim out of the operation of these laws? The judgment was for a less sum than twenty shillings, and therefore being prior to the new constitution, and the acts of Assembly pursuant thereto, the appellant had no power of appeal from the judgment of the justice, and unless such judgment can be inquired into in this case it never can be inquired into before any tribunal. It is for the appellee to show <em>affirmatively </em>that there was a <em>new promise </em>if he makes this an objection to the replication.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-5\"><em>Joseph M. Palmer </em>for die appellee, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-6\">1st. That the facts set out in the replication do not necessarily present a case of want of jurisdiction in the justice to render the judgment. From any thing that appears in the replication the appellant may have made a <em>nexo pronvise </em>to pay this debt; or he may have acquired property which under the exceptions in the insolvent laws would have been liable for his debts. All these facts should have been negatived by the replication before the case of an ouster of jurisdiction will arise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-7\">2nd. The judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction over the subject matter, and was rendered after the appellant applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws, and hence his discharge thereunder could not render the appellee a trespasser in attempting to execute it. The discharge could in no way affect the judgment. The principle is incontrovertibly settled, that a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, when coming incidentally or collaterally in question in any other court, is conclusive upon the question decided and cannot be impeached on the ground of informality in the proceedings, or for error or mistake in the court in the matter which was adjudicated. 1 <em>Gill, </em>214, <em>Bowie vs. Jones. </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>218, <em>Magruder vs. Peter. </em>12 <em>Do., </em>442, <em>Miles vs. Knott. </em>8 <em>Do., </em>349, <em>Marshall vs. Greenfield. </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>50, <em>Raborg vs. Hammond. 6 H. &amp; J., </em>182, <em>Barney vs. Patterson. </em>4 <em>Do., </em>394, <em>Fishwick vs. Sewell. </em>3 <em>Md.

The plaintiff has misconceived his action, for if he has any remedy for the injury complained of, <em>case, </em>and not Ires<em>pass, </em>is the proper one. Whenever an injury to a person or his property is occasioned by regular process of a court of competent jurisdiction, even if maliciously adopted, the remedy is by an action on the case and trespass does not lie. 3 <em>Term Rep., </em>185, <em>Belk vs. Broadbent. 2 Saund.

It is said, however, in 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl., </em>181, <em>(Ed. of </em>1851:) \u201c In general no action whatever can be supported for any act, however <em>erroneous, </em>if expressly sanctioned by the judgment or direction of one of the superior courts at Westminster, or oven by an inferior magistrate, acting within the scope of his jurisdiction.\u201d Notwithstanding there may be exceptions to the general rule thus stated, yet it is certainly true, that if the inferior judge has jurisdiction, although he may give a wrong judgment, provided the error results from the erroneous conclusion at which he arrives, neither the judge nor the plaintiff in the judgment can be made a trespasser, by virtue of enforcing the same, if the judgment remains unrescinded and unpaid. Page of <em>Chitty </em>above cited. 3 <em>M. &amp; S., </em>425, 426, 427, 428, <em>Ackerley vs. Parkinson, et al. </em>3 <em>Wend., </em>205, <em>Putnam, vs. Man. 2 Wend., </em>604, <em>Relyea vs. Ramsay. 7 Wend., </em>203, 204, <em>Horton vs. Achmoody. </em>1 <em>Pet. S. C. Rep., </em>340, <em>Elliott, et al., vs. Peirsol, et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In 2 <em>Wils. Rep., </em>385, <em>Perkin vs. Proctor &amp; Green, </em>a distinction is taken between <em>irregularity </em>and <em>error </em>in reference to judgments. And the court say: \u201cWhere a judgment is vacated for irregularity, the party is never excused if an execution is executed thereupon; yet the sheriff\u2019s officer is excused, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>because <em>he </em>has the king\u2019s writ to warrant him.\u201d And again they say: <em>u </em>In the case of an irregular judgment against the plaintiff and a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>executed thereupon, in trespass and imprisonment, the party and the officer joined in a plea of justification under the writ, and the officer was therefore held guilty as well as the party; but where a judgment is reversed for error it is different, and stands good until reversed, one case is the fault of the party himself, the other is the error of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">After an examination of the autliorities referred to, and the cases of <em>Turner vs. Walker, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>385; <em>Warfield &amp; Mactier, vs. Walter, </em>11 <em>Ib., </em>85, 86, and <em>Ranoul vs. Griffie, 3 Md. Rep., </em>59, 60, we do not think the plaintiff can maintain his suit. The facts set out in the replication do not necessarily present a case of want of jurisdiction by the magistrate, and a mere error of judgment on his part, (if there was any,) will not give the plaintiff a right of action. The judgment below, upon the demurrer, in favor of the defendant will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
