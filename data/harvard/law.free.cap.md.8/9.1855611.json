That the copy of the will in question was admissible, the attestation and certificate thereof being in strict accordance with the requirements of the act of Congress of 1790, ch. 38. It was recorded by order of the county court of Warren county, in the State of Yirginia, and probate granted, as appears by the attestation of the clerk of said court and the seal of the court annexed, and (he certificate of the presiding justice that the attestation of the clerk is in due form. It is difficult to conjecture upon what principle the court below refused to suffer this transcript to be read in evidence, for even admitting it is not attested and certified, as required by the act of Congress, it was certainly admissible under the provisions of the act of Assembly of this State of 1785, ch. 46, sec. 2, which makes the record evidence without the certificate of the presiding justice. If is well settled, that the method of authentication of public documents under the act of Congress of 1790, ch. 38, is not to be considered exclusive of any other method of authentication which the States may think proper to adopt. 12 <em>Serg. &amp; </em>Rawle, 203, <em>Kean vs. Rice. </em>1 <em>Chipman, </em>303, <em>State vs. Stade. </em>3 <em>Pick., </em>293, <em>Raynham vs. Canton. </em>6 Binney, 321, <em>Biddis vs. James. </em>3 Leigh, 816, <em>Ex-parte Povall, </em>which is a case directly in point. 1 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., secs. </em>489, 504, 505, 506, 519.

This last case is very much like the one under consideration. It was a will attested by the clerk of the county court of Jefferson county, Yirginia, with the certificate of the presiding justice of said court,, as in this case. The <em>transcript </em>of the proceedings of the county court in this case is authenticated in due form of law. 2 <em>English, </em>369, <em>Butler vs. Owen. </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>408, <em>Ferguson vs. Harwood. </em>13 <em>Serg.

P. Maulsby </em>for the appellee,.argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">That this is not a record or judicial proceeding of a court of the State of Yirginia, but a record kept, in a public office not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>appertaining to a court, and therefore to be authenticated by the attestation of the keeper and the seal of his office thereto annexed, with a \u25a0certificate of the presiding justice of the county court of the county in which the office is kept, and <em>further, </em>by the certificate -of tile clerk of said court that the said presiding justice is duly commissioned and qualified, as required by the act of Congress of 1804, ch. 56. In this case the latter certificate is omitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-5\">The will is not authenticated according to our act of 1785, \u25a0ch. 46. There is no evidence that the laws of Yirginia require this will to fee recorded, for those laws are not in evidence in this case. The case cited from 1 <em>Rawle, </em>is one relating to the sufficiency of the <em>prohate </em>of the will, whereas the question here is as to the sufficiency of the <em>authentication; </em>in that case there was no question made as to- the mode of authentication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">The act 'of Congress of 1790 applies to one species of evidence and the act of 1804 to another. Now to which species or class does this evidence belong? The act of 1790 relates to the <em>records and judicial proceedings </em>of the courts of the several States. The evidence here <em>sought to be offered </em>is a <em>copy of the </em>will, and not the <em>judicialproceedings </em>of the court of Warren county \u2014 not <em>the judgment of that court.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">It does not appear that the clerk of Warren county has the power to record wills, or that the county court has custody of the records so as to grant exemplifications. The certificate in this case is not that the copy of the will in the record is a <em>true copy </em>extracted from the records. It merely certifies that the <em>aforegoing; </em>that is, th <em>&amp; judgment </em>ordering probate and record, and <em>not the </em>will, is a <em>true </em>transcript of the proceedings of said court. The certificate therefore is not in the proper form. 1 <em>Ev. Har., </em>23, 24, <em>notes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-8\">Now what papers does the act of 1804 contemplate as appertaining to courts? If a will appertains to the proceedings of the orphans court, then a <em>deed </em>appertains to the proceedings of the county courts. The fact that the keeper of the records is the clerk of the court, cannot make papers kept and recorded by him pertain to th <em>e, judicial proceedings </em>of the court in contemplation of the act of Congress.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Mason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Atb\">delivered tire opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The only question involved in this record is, whether the transcript of the will of Mary Ann Case, and the proceedings thereupon, in 'Warren county court, Virginia, were properly and duly authenticated, so as to make them admissible evidence in the courts of Maryland: and this involves the further inquiry, whether they are <em>\u201c </em>records and judicial proceedings\u201d <em>of a court </em>within the meaning of the act of Congress, passed May 26th, 1790, relating to the authentication of public records? &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">The probate and- recordation of this will, as appears from the certificate, are themselves <em>judicial acts. </em>The will being the foundation or basis of the whole proceeding must be treated as part of the proceedings themselves, and is therefore properly authenticated under the act of 1790.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The act of 1790 rests upon the assumption that a proceeding of a court of a different State, if authenticated according to that act, is warranted by, and in accordance with, the laws of that State, and from this proceeding it appears, that probate and recordation of the will are both necessary to give it vitality. Therefore we are to assume that a mere authenticated copy of a will, without any thing more, would not be sufficient, because it would not therefrom appear to have been admitted to probate and record in drre course of law by the proper tribunal. Without these legal attributes it could not have had the effect of a valid will in Virginia, and therefore, when authenticated without these acts appearing to have been done, could not have any legal effect in this State. These acts being <em>judicial </em>proceedings, could only be authenticated in the manner pointed out by the act of 1790. 1 <em>Rawle\u2019s Rep., </em>386.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The paper offered in evidence in this case, as appears from its face, is not a mere <em>exemplification of a record or office book, not appertaining to a court, </em>within the meaning of the act of Congress of March 29th, 1804. As has airead}' been said, but for the judicial action of the court, this will would not have been a part of the records or proceedings of the court, and therefore not embraced within that act, which relates to the authentication of papers which are admitted to record as a matter of course, and not in virtue of any judicial mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>It lias been said that tbe certificate of tbe clerk of Warren county court, is not full and specific enough to gratify the act of 1790. Though it may not have been, strictly speaking, a literal compliance with the law in this particular, nevertheless we think it a <em>substantial compliance, </em>which is sufficient. <em>Washington vs. Hodgskin, 12 Gill &amp; Johns., </em>356. <em>Warner vs. Hardy, </em>6 <em>Md.
