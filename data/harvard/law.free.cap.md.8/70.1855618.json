Rep., </em>271, <em>Mitchell vs. Smith. </em>9 <em>Gill, 56, Ramsay vs. Glass. 5 Md.

The 10th section of the act of 1825, ch. 205, simply requires the provisional trustee to execute a deed conveying to the permanent trustee that property only which had come into his hands under the previous laws. The act of 1829, ch. 208, sec. 3', dispenses with the necessity of a deed from the insolvent to the provisional trustee, and, according to my construction of it, vests in him all the property, effects and claims of the <em>insolvent debtor; </em>that is, such as the <em>debtor himself </em>could sue <em>for and recover. </em>But property fraudulently conveyed by the insolvent is not that to which the insolvent himself has any <em>title or claim. </em>This act therefore refers only to the powers conferred upon the provisional trustee <em>by 'previous laws, </em>and invests him with no <em>neto powers. </em>There is a very good reason why the provisional trustee should not have the power to sue in such a case as this. The law nowhere provides that the permanent trustee may <em>carry on </em>a suit instituted by the provisional trustee, and the suit so instituted must therefore fail. See also on this point 2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>24, <em>Brown vs. Brice. </em>4 <em>G. &amp; </em>J., 385, <em>Glenn vs. Karthaus. </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>138, <em>Alexander vs. Ghiselin,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">2nd. The appeal of the complainant presents the two general questions: \u2014 1st, whether the plea of limitations allowed by the court below is a defence to the claim <em>made by the </em>bill? and 2nd, whether in <em>the form </em>in which it is pleaded it is a good defence?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">The bill by its allegations and prayers seeks two measures of relief which are perfectly consistent with each other, and to neither of them is the plea 6f limitations of three years either applicable or a bar: \u2014 1st. So far as the bill charges a transfer of assets by way of <em>security </em>against <em>liabilities, </em>and prays an account of the assets transferred, and of the liabilities actually existing or discharged, and for payment and delivery to the trustee of the assets not collected or not actually applied, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>limitation of three years has and can have no application. The plea <em>confesses </em>the <em>mortgage. </em>It does not aver an adverse possession, but leaves it where the bill leaves it, \u2014 a possession as <em>mortgagee. </em>And on that fact alone the case of <em>Alexander vs. Ghiselin vests </em>the right of the insolvent trustee to the possession of the assets so mortgaged, and when they get into his hands he administers them according to the liens and priorities recognised by the law. No court has ever held the plea of possession of a mortgaged chattel, note or money, for three or six years any bar to a suit for an account and payment of the residue, <em>A fortiori, </em>can such plea be no bar to a bill for an .account of a general transfer, of notes, open accounts and bonds, which must be collected, and of goods which must be sold, where the time assigned to sell and collect must be of uncertain, duration, and where the liabilities which they are to meet and protect are not specified and may not be due for months or years, or may be matter of dispute and litigation? yet <em>suck </em>is the <em>exact </em>case made by the bill, and the consequence of sustaining the plea is to give the whole assets transferred to the defendant without account, though on the face of the bill, and admitted by the plea, they are twice or three times the liabilities <em>alleged </em>but not <em>admitted </em>to exist. These propositions cover so much of the bill as relates to the assets unliquidated and unapplied to the discharge of liabilities actually incurred and paid, it is simply the claim of a mortgagor to an account and payment of the balance, which entities him to the balance on a final settlement of the whole matter, united with the claim of the insolvent trustee under our acts to receive possession of the unapplied assets, and to administer them himself under his responsibility as representative of the creditor and debtor. As to limitation to a mortgage, see 3 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>328, <em>Lamar vs. Jones. </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>389, <em>Green vs. Johnson. </em>6 <em>Do., </em>80, <em>Callis vs. Tolson.

But the bill, after praying that relief, asks <em>the additional relief </em>that the assignment may be declared fraudulent and void against creditors. The result of obtaining this relief, in addition to that above mentioned, is, that if the defendant has actually received any money from the things transferred,, <em>over and above his dividend under the insolvent assignment, </em>he will under this prayer be obliged to pay such difference to the trustee.for the benefit of the other creditors. It is therefore plain that <em>this </em>relief is not inconsistent with the former, but in addition to it and of the same nature, and that the former may be granted and this fail. <em>Albert &amp; Wife, vs. Winn &amp; Ross, 7 Gill, </em>446, and 5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>66, and 2 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>42, 169. <em>Thomas vs. Doub, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>1.

Ibid., </em>292, <em>Drury vs. Conner. </em>Therefore, even if the plea be a bar to this part and purpose of the bill, it was erroneous to hold it good as to the other relief for being a good plea as to part only, and yet pleaded to the whole bill it was too wide, and for that reason alone should have been overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-6\">3rd. But the plea, if intended to apply to this bill, considered as a bill, to avoid a fraudulent assignment, is entirely misconceived. A conveyance, giving an improper' preference against the insolvent laws is fraudulent and void, because a fraud on the rights of creditors to have the property equally distributed among them. It is not merely an implied and constructive fraud, but an actual, intentional and dishonest fraud, which knowingly attempts to take from the other creditors the difference between the dividend and the property conveyed. It is a worse fraud than taking property by a voluntary conveyance. <em>Act of </em>1816, ch. 221, <em>sec. </em>6. <em>7 G. &amp; J., </em>170, <em>Dulaney vs. Hoffman. </em>1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>455, <em>Waters vs. Dashiell. </em>1 <em>Am. Lead. Cases, </em>50. 5 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>403, <em>Kennedy vs. Boggs. </em>The question then is, when does the statute begin to run in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>cases of <em>such,fraudulent preferences. </em>If the fraud exists and be not known, the rule of equity is clear that the statute only begins to run from <em>the discovery of the fraud. 2 Story\u2019s Eq., (Sec. </em>1521, <em>(a.) </em>6 <em>Wheat., </em>497, <em>Prevost vs. Gratz. </em>The bill here alleges that this discovery was made within three years before filing the bill, and the plea <em>admits </em>this allegation, not being accompanied with an answer denying the fraud <em>or the time of its discovery. </em>Now the plea, if available <em>at all, </em>must go either: \u2014 1st, to the possession of the property, or, 2nd, to the debts of the creditors represented by the complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-5\">1st. A fraudulent <em>assignee </em>stands exactly in the place of the fraudulent <em>assignor </em>as against a suing creditor of the assignor. He can take <em>all </em>the defences which would be available for the assignor at the same time a.nd under the same circumstances, but he can take no other. The insolvent trustee in this suit represents as well the <em>creditor </em>as the assignor, and has the right of both free from the disabilities of the assignor. The first principle of the statute against conveyances to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, is, that as respects the claim of the <em>creditor </em>the property is considered as never having been out of the hands of the <em>debtor, </em>entirely irrespective of the length of time during which it may have been held by the <em>fraudulent donee. </em>No instance exists of a plea of limitations based on the <em>possession </em>of the property by a fraudulent donee in the English courts, and there is none in the Maryland courts. This court has never decided that a fraudulent grantee can plead that he has <em>held </em>the property <em>for nwre than three </em>years, and thus interpose the plea of limitations. They have only decided that he may plead limitations to the <em>debts of </em>the suing <em>creditors. </em>The reason is that the fraudulent <em>donee </em>stands in the place of the <em>donor; </em>the property is regarded as in the <em>donor\u2019s </em>possession, and a plea by <em>him of </em>limitations based on possession would he an <em>absurdity. </em>The only mode in which limitations ever did, or ever could apply, in England, was on the ground of <em>laches, </em>in failing to prosecute the fraudulent donee after obtaining <em>judgment </em>and a <em>right </em>to execution against the donor, which was the condition precedent to a right to sue the <em>donee. </em>On these points see 5 Gill, 449, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Worthington vs. Shipley. </em>1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>455, 470, 472, <em>Waters vs. Dashiell. </em>2 <em>Brock., </em>285, 288, 289, <em>Gallego vs. Gallego. </em>5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>432, <em>Birely &amp; Holtz, vs. Staley. </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>191, <em>Strike vs. McDonald. </em>7 <em>How., </em>220, <em>McLaughlin vs. Bank of Potomac. </em>11 <em>Wheat., </em>213, <em>Hinde vs. Longworth. </em>2 <em>Dessa., </em>215, <em>Buist vs. Smyth. </em>4 <em>How., </em>503, 560, <em>Michoud vs. Girod. </em>11 <em>Wheat., </em>78, <em>Brooks vs. Marbury. </em>6 <em>Wheat., </em>481, <em>Prevost vs. Gratz. </em>8 <em>Pet., </em>244, <em>Gregg vs. Sayre. </em>2 <em>Bland, </em>26, <em>Kipp vs. Hanna. </em>10 <em>Pet., </em>177, <em>Boone vs. Chiles.

The only other aspect in which a plea of limitations can be considered hi such a suit is as applicable to the <em>debt </em>of the creditor. Here again the right of the <em>donee </em>is the right of the <em>donor. </em>He has <em>all </em>his rights, but he has <em>no more </em>than his rights; for the principle of the law is, that it does not regard the property as <em>at all, </em>for <em>any purpose, </em>altered by the fraudulent conveyance. How far then is the plea of limitations applicable to the creditor\u2019s <em>debt </em>? As far in the mouth of the <em>donee </em>as it was in that of the <em>donor, </em>and <em>no farther. </em>In England there was no limitation to a judgment, and therefore there was <em>none </em>to a suit to enforce the judgment against the fraudulent donee, but the presumption of satisfaction from the lapse of twenty years. So long as execution can be obtained the right to levy it on the property fraudulently conveyed exists. This was available to the donee just as a plea of payment, accord and satisfaction or release would have been. In Maryland the plea of twelve years\u2019 limitation to a judgment would protect the <em>donee </em>if not sued until after judgment against the donor. If the donee be sued <em>before </em>judgment, under our act, then also he has open all the defences of the donor and <em>none other. </em>He may plead accord and satisfaction or release, or he may deny the debt by <em>non-assumpsit; </em>as to a judgment, he may plead <em>nul tiel record </em>if the proceeding were after judgment; or he may plead limitations of <em>three </em>years to the debt if simple contract, or twelve years if under seal. And so this court have held in <em>McDowell vs. Goldsmith, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>319, and <em>2 Md. Ch. Dec., 370. </em>But <em>in no case </em>has he ever been allowed to go behind a judgment and plead limitations to the original claim, because the judgment concludes him as well as the donor, unless rendered by fraud. <em>2 Pet., 107, Venable vs. Bank of U. </em>S. 4 <em>Wheat., </em>503, <em>Wheaton vs. Sexton. </em>It is therefore plain, that the plea of limitations in <em>this </em>case is utterly untenable, for there is no plea that <em>all debts </em>are barred by any limitation, and there may be debts by judgment or specialty which would not be barred for <em>twelve years, </em>while <em>three years </em>is the limitation here relied on. .And there is no plea <em>at all </em>going to <em>this point, </em>but it rests exclusively on the accrual of the trustee\u2019s right against the <em>donee, </em>and has no relation to the <em>debts </em>he represents. The two points are totally distinct: \u2014 1st. If <em>possession </em>of the assets by the <em>donee </em>be the point, then it is immaterial whether the <em>debt </em>accrued yesterday or ten years ago. 2nd'. If the plea goes to the <em>debt </em>then the possession may have been only of <em>yesterday, </em>and yet the debt being barred cannot, be enforced against the <em>donee, </em>because it could not against the <em>donor. </em>The plea in this case involves the additional absurdity, that but for the <em>fraud </em>the mortgagee could be compelled to account, but because of the fraud his possession is argued to have been <em>adverse, </em>and not as <em>mortgagee, </em>and so barred by lapse of three years. The complainant had no remedy <em>at law </em>which he could enforce and which he is now seeking to enforce in equity, and it is therefore absurd to say that there is any <em>analogy </em>in such a case between law and equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-4\">3rd. But if applicable the plea is badly pleaded; for, <em>1st it </em>goes to the whole relief when it should be confined to so much of it as prays a decree avoiding the assignment; 2nd, it does not meet the averments of a discoveiy of the fund within three years; nor of the other fact, of the time consumed in vacating a fraudulent assignment of the equity of redemption of these assets to Hinkley and Woodward within three years from which this suit was brought; 3d, nor is the plea accompanied with an answer going to the denial of these particular facts of avoidance by anticipation of <em>the </em>plea <em>of </em>limitations; nor is there airy answer denying the <em>fund </em>in the assignment alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>in the <em>bill.

That as the appeal is from the decree <em>dismissing the bill </em>every point which will sustain the action of the court below is open upon the complainant\u2019s appeal, whether decided in favor of the defendant or against, or which are in fact presented by the record. Upon appeal from such a decree the simple question is, did the court below do right <em>in dismissing the bill </em>? This court has nothing to do with <em>the reasons </em>upon which the bill was dismissed. This is the result of the general principles of chancery law. 15 <em>How., </em>465, 466. <em>Corning vs. Troy Iron &amp; Nail Factory. </em>1 <em>Md.

Even <em>at law </em>such questions as arise on this appeal in favbr of the appellee are examined on the appeal of the plaintiff when the judgment is against him and he alone appeals.

Thai the <em>special plea </em>of limitations by the defendant is a complete bar to the suit, and completely bars the complainant until he avers that the provisional trustee had been kept in ignorance of his right of action by the concealment and fraud of the defendant, and such averment could not in truth be made, because Hinkley, the provisional trustee, was himself one of the grantees in the deed of trust from which the complainant alleges that he first discovered the transfer assailed by the hill. The complainant is the permanent trustee and he Iras no independent right to sue, but a <em>derivative </em>one only, through the <em>provisional trustee. </em>The act of 1816, ch. 221, undoubtedly intended that the title to sue should be vested in the provisional trustee, but the legislature omitted to make him a <em>bonded officer. </em>This defect was remedied by the act of 1819, ch. 84, secs. 7 &amp; 8. Then came the act of 1825, ch. 205, sec. 8, which requires a deed from the insolvent to the provisional trustee of <em>all his estate, both real and, personal. </em>Then the act of 1829, ch. 208, sec. 3, which <em>vests </em>in the provisional trustee, when he has filed his bond, \u201call the estate, property, effects, rights and claims of the insolvent debtor,\u201d and enacts that his appointment and bonding \u201cshall operate as an authority to such trustee or trustees to take possession, for the benefit of the creditors of such insolvent, of all property, estate and effects, books, papers, accounts, bonds, notes and evidences of debt of such insolvent, without the necessity of such insolvent\u2019s executing a deed thereof, and to entitle such trustee or trustees <em>to use all legal means for the recovery </em>thereof.\u201d These various acts are all to be construed together, and they clearly intended to give the provisional trustee as full and ample powers to sue for and recover property fraudulently conveyed away by the insolvent, as to the permanent trustee. On this point see <em>5 H. &amp; J., </em>408, <em>Kennedy vs. Boggs. 2 Daniel\u2019s Ch.

The questions arising upon the <em>second plea, </em>which was sustained by the court below, relate, 1st, to the form of the bill and its allegations. As to this the defendant insists, that the bill is simply one to vacate a transaction void by the insolvent laws, and only asking for an account and delivery of the balance as Subordinate to that design. The case of <em>Alexander vs. Ghiselin </em>only decides, that all the property to which the insolvent had the <em>right of possession </em>was transferred to his trustee, but it never decided that property deposited as security, apart from all fraud, could be taken possession of by the trustee. The bill therefore does not properly seek relief upon this transfer as a <em>valid mortgage. </em>It asks that the preference may be <em>set aside </em>as <em>fraudulent, </em>and because it calls for an account it is said to be a bill to <em>redeem a mortgage. </em>In such a bill as that there would be a tender of the <em>debts </em>due, and a bill which sets up <em>&amp; fraud </em>as the ground of relief cannot be <em>tortured </em>into a bill for the redemption of a <em>valid mortgage. 22 Eng.

All its allegations are to this point and it cannot, because it asks for an account, be treated as a bill for an account simply. The bill contains no charge that the transfer was fraudulent <em>at comnnon law. </em>2nd. But suppose the bill distinctly stated the three propositions: \u2014 1st, that the preference was fraudulent \u2022and ought to be set aside; 2nd, that the trustee was entitled to the funds in order for distribution, subject to hens and agreements to pay the defendant, and 3rd, that he was entitled to the surplus, treating the case as a mortgage, how then would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the case stand? Id such case the bill must advise the party of the alternative aspect of the case, so that he may answer, reply or plead. But no such case is presented by this bill, and if it was, the bill would still have been properly dismissed, because\u2019 the purposes are wholly inconsistent and the double aspect would not help the case. 4 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>444, <em>Burch vs. The State. </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>231, <em>State vs. Bank of Maryland.

There was adequate remedy <em>at law, </em>and therefore the bill was properly dismissed.

As to the question of limitations, the defendant insists that the general plea of limitations is a good bar. The creditors cannot pursue the property thus fraudulently as is alleged transferred. The trustee alone can do it. The plea of limitations tiren must be directed against him alone, and the question then is, when did the right of action accrue to him? The transfer being fraudulent it accrued <em>immediately </em>and .the\u2019statute began to run from that time. The trustee\u2019s right to sue vested immediately upon his bonding, and the possession of the defendant from that moment as against him was <em>tortious. </em>As against this right of the trustee we plead <em>the </em>statute of <em>limitations, </em>and we say it is a flat bar. . At law there are no exceptions to be engrafted upon the statute except tir\u00f3se found in the act itself, of 1715, ch. 23. Nor is there any difference between a court of equity and a court of law in this respect. In cases of concurrent remedy equity <em>follows </em>and <em>obeys </em>the law. 3 <em>Md.

The next question is, has the amended bill made any difference in the case? We say it has not, because fraud or ignorance makes no defence in cases where the remedy is concurrent at law and in equity. The question simply is, did \u2022a right of action accrue or exist for three years before the filing of the bill. If the amendment avails any thing, it changes the case to one of <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction <em>in equity, </em>and this cannot be done by <em>amendment, </em>for it in effect makes a new case. 17 <em>How., </em>144, <em>Shields vs. Barrow. </em>10 <em>Pick., </em>128, <em>Pratt vs. Bacon. </em>1 <em>Eng.

It is simply a sheer case of igno. ranee on the part of the complainant, without any fraud or concealment, on the part of the defendant. In such cases <em>ignorance </em>is no bar to the plea of limitations. 11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>372, <em>Abell vs. Harris. </em>24 <em>Wend., </em>605, 606, <em>Humbert vs. Trinity Church. 2 Jac. </em>&amp; <em>Walk., </em>139, 142, <em>Cholmondeley vs. Clinton. </em>1 <em>Eng.

Dec., </em>391, <em>McDowell vs. Goldsmith. </em>We therefore insist: \u2014 1st, that the complainant should not have been allowed to amend his bill as he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>after - <em>hearing </em>of the pleas of the defendant; 2nd, that the amendment was not sufficient in law after the pleas filed by \u25a0 the defendant; and 3rd, that, at all events, the amendment extended the limitation down to the time of applying therefor, on the 14th of February 1853.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">7th. That the pleas were not too wide and did not need the support of an answer, see <em>Story's Eq. Pl., secs. </em>751, 753, 754. 1 <em>Daniel's Ch. Pr., </em>598, <em>note </em>2. 6 <em>Pet., </em>326, <em>New Jersey vs. New York. </em>8 <em>How., </em>222, <em>Maxwell vs. Kennedy.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-6\">Mason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1f\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Many grave and important questions have been discussed with much ability by counsel in the progress of their argument, which we think the exigencies of this \u2022 case do not require us to determine upon the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Whatever <em>force there </em>would have been in the suggestion, if made at the proper time, that a court of equity had no original jurisdiction over this case, it is now too late for us to entertain such an objection, inasmuch as none was taken, as required by the act of 1841, chap: 163, in the court below. By that act it is provided, that the defendant shall not, in the Court of Appeals, rely upon any objection to the jurisdiction of the court below, unless it appear by the record, that such objection was raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The appellant as permanent trustee in insolvency of Carey, Wethered and O\u2019Donnell, on the 8th of December 1850, filed his bill in equity, making substantially the following case: that the firm above named became embarrassed in 1839; and being absolutely insolvent in the following year, with full knowledge of their condition, transferred large sums of money and other property, constituting nearly the whole assets of the firm, to several preferred creditors. That Gibson, the defendant, received of such assets more than $18,000, which sum exceeded his claim against the firm, and his liabilities for them; that at the time of the said transfer the film was utterly insolvent, and Gibson knew of such condition; that the several members of the firm applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws in 1841, and that the appellant became permanent trustee for all the parties, on the 23rd of October 1846; that Gibson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>has never accounted for any of the assets which came into his hands, &amp;e.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Subsequently, by an amended bill, it was further alleged, that after the assignment to Gibson the insolvents made a deed to Hinldey and Woodward, dated September 24th, 1840, embracing the balance of their assets and property, and under which deed the grantees took possession of the books and papers of the firm. Upon a bill filed in equity by the permanent trustee to vacate this deed, a decree was passed 12th of July 1848, vacating the deed and transferring the property, books and papers of the insolvent, embraced by said deed, to the trustee. Prom these books he discovered, for the first time, the transfers above mentioned to the present defendant, and that he had no other means of ascertaining the fact. The prayers of the bill were for a discovery, an account, and for a delivery of the assets in the defendant\u2019s possession to the complainant, and for general relief, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The defendant pleaded two pleas of limitation, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">1. That Hinkleywas appointed provisional trustee of Carey on the 12th of January 1841; and of Wethered on the 13th of August 1841; and Horsey became provisional trustee of O\u2019Donnell on the 13th of July 1841; and that the cause of action accrued to Hinkley, as provisional trustee of Carey, Wethered &amp; Co.; and to Horsey, as provisional trustee of O\u2019Donnell, more than three years before <em>bill </em>filed, or before <em>serving or suing </em>out process, and also more than three years before the appointment of complainant as permanent trustee; nor did the defendant promise within three years before <em>bill </em>filed, or process <em>served </em>or <em>issued, </em>nor either when or since the provisional trustees were in office, to account or make satisfaction for any matters in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">2. That the cause of action accrued to the complainant more than three years before bill filed, or before serving or suing out process; and defendant did not promise complainant to account for, or pay any thing for any matter charged in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The conrt. overruled the <em>first </em>and sustained the <em>second </em>plea, and dismissed the bill. Both parties it seems appealed from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Without inquiring into the regularity of the appeal of the defendant, because of the circumstance that the decree was in his favor, the court is nevertheless of opinion, that all the advantages which he seeks under his appeal can be attained under the complainant\u2019s appeal. The question presented upon the appeal regularly before us is, whether the decree dismissing the bill was properly passed ? and if either of the defendant\u2019s pleas presents a good ground of defence to the case as made by the complainant\u2019s bill, the decree must be affirmed, and it matters not upon which plea the court below based the dismissal of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The <em>second plea, </em>in its connection with the amended bill, raises the question, in addition to the question of the general inapplicability of either plea to this particular transaction, whether the three years\u2019 limitation began to ran from the appointment and qualification of the permanent trustee, or from the time the fact of the alleged fraudulent transfer to Gibson came to his knowledge ? This is a most important question, and one by no means free from difficulty, but as it does not enter into the first plea, and as the court have no difficulty in determining that that plea was improperly overruled, we are relieved from the necessity of deciding the question upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It is not charged in the bill that the provisional trustees had no knowledge of this alleged fraudulent transaction. Indeed such a theory is expressly negatived by the fact that Hinldey, who was the provisional trastee of two of the three insolvents, was also one of the grantees of the deed, under which the possession of the books and papers of the insolvent firm passed to him, and from which knowledge of the transfer was to be acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The two remaining questions presented by the first plea, which we are required to determine, are, first, does the present proceeding disclose such a transaction or trust to which the plea of limitations would be inapplicable ? and if not, then, secondly, does the insolvent system of Baltimore city confer power upon the provisional trustee to sue in such a case as the present, and thereby bring him and the creditors he represents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>williin the operation of the statute of limitations, which statute begins to run from the time the cause of action accrued, provided there is no disability existing at the time in the party entitled to sue ?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">It is certain upon the facts disclosed by the bill, that an action or actions at law would have been maintained by which the relief now sought couid have been fully secured, whether equity possesses concurrent jurisdiction or not. This being conceded, it has been settled by this court, that in all cases of concurrent jurisdiction, between courts of law and equity, the <em>statute </em>of limitations is equally obligatory in each court. <em>Watkins vs. Harwood, 2 G. &amp; J., </em>307. <em>Dugan vs. Gittings, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>161. <em>Hertle vs. Schwartze, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>383.</p>\n<p id=\"ABYa\">W'e think this principle disposes of the first objection taken to this plea of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Next, as to the second point, namely, the right of the provisional trustee to sue. True it is, that the case of <em>Kennedy vs. Boggs, 5 H. &amp; G., </em>403, expressly decided, <em>that the act </em>of 1816, chap. 221, the act under which the local system of insolvency for Baltimore city was created, did not confer any power upon the provisional trustee to sue for the recovery of the property of the insolvent from third parties, and if the legislation upon this subject had rested here, we would have had no difficulty in sustaining the views of the appellant upon this point. But to meet a case like the present it would seem that the act of 1829, chap. 208, was enacted. By the third section of that act, in express terms, the right to the possession of all the property, <em>&amp;c., </em>of the insolvent, is conferred upon the provisional trustee, with power \u201cto use all legal means for the recovery thereof. \u201d Under this act there is no room-to doubt that there was full power in the provisional trustees to sue in this case as fully as the permanent trustee, and that limitations began to run against them from the time of their appointment and qualification as such, and when once commenced limitations continued to run against, also, die permanent trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">For the reasons assigned we regard the plea of limitations as a flat bar to a recovery in this proceeding, and therefore affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
