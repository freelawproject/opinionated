The plea was <em>non cvl.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\"><em>Exception. </em>The plaintiff proved the speaking of the words substantially as laid in the declaration.

The claim upon which Fowler sued amounted to $7.48. The plaintiff then rested his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">The defendant then asked die court to instruct- the jury, that upon the pleadings and evidence, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for the following reasons: 1st, because the declaration does not set out a good and sufficient cause of action; 2nd, because the evidence is not legally sufficient to warrant the jury in finding all the material and necessary allegations in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">Upon these prayers the court, (Nelson, J.,) instructed the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, because the account proved to be the paper referred to in the declaration, and in speaking the words charged to have been spoken by die defendant, was not such a paper or account as the party making the affirmation could legally affirm to, under the act of Assembly authorising a party to swear- to his account, because there was no date upon the paper to show affirmatively that the affirmation was made within one year after the account accrued due, according to said act of Assembly, that therefore said affirmation not having been made within the time prescribed by said act, the affirmation was extra-judicial, and the party making the same cannot be guilty of peijury. To the instruction so given the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>2nd Exception. </em>The plaintiff then offered further evidence, that in 1849 or 1850, Fowler had used the wagon of the plaintiff, but the witness could not fix the precise date. He then offered in evidence the account upon which Fowler sued, dated in 1850, for the purpose of proving that Fowler, at the time of the affirmation by Warner was made, was indebted to the plaintiff, as charged in the account affirmed to. The plaintiff then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they believe all the evidence in the case, tire plaintiff is entitled to recover; which prayer the court refused to grant and instructed the jury, that upon the pleadings and all the evidence in the cause, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for the reasons assigned in the instruction first given. To this ruling the plaintiff excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C. J., Eccleston, Tuck and Mason, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\"><em>James Raymond </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3kZ\">argued, that the swearing or affirming to an account by the creditor of a less sum than ten pounds, current money, is an oath or affirmation <em>in the course of a judicial proceeding, </em>and if false is peijuiy. The act of 1729, ch. 20, sec. 11, says, that the accounts shall be proved within twelve months after the <em>first </em>article therein charged shall <em>\u201cbecome due,\u201d </em>not after it was <em>charged. </em>The language of this section clearly refers the decision of the time within which the oath is to be made to the tribunal before whom such oath comes as <em>evidence. </em>It is not the duty of the magistrate before whom the oath <em>is taken </em>to see that the account is within twelve months. He is bound to administer the oath, and when that oath is offered in evidence, the magistrate before whom it is offered decides whether or not it is within time; and the fact that it is <em>rejected </em>as evidence, does not show that the magistrate was not <em>bound </em>to administer the <em>oath. </em>To render the charge of false swearing actionable, all that is necessary is, that the false swearing should be before court or magistrate having legal authority to administer an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>oath.\u201d 10 <em>Johns., </em>177, <em>Van Steenbergh vs. Kortz. </em>Besides this, the 15th section of the act of 1729 expressly makes it <em>perjury </em>for any person wilfully to swear or affirm falsely to <em>&lt;c any account </em>before any provincial or county justice,\u201d and in my judgment, this section is not repealed by the 8th section of the act of 1785, ch. 46. The latter act, according to my reading of it, continues in force <em>all the provisions </em>of the act of 1729, so far as accounts not exceeding ten pounds, current money, are concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-4\">But again, the record shows that this affidavit was offered in evidence <em>oxA plead in bar </em>in the <em>trial </em>before the magistrate, and having been received, though illegally received, it stands in the same position as a witness who has been erroneously admitted to testify, though not a competent witness, in which case it is <em>perjury </em>if he swears <em>falsely, </em>because his oath was received and used. 10 <em>Ohio, </em>220, <em>Montgomery vs. The State. </em>26 <em>Maine, </em>33, <em>State vs. Keene. 2 Russell on Crimes, </em>598 to 603.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">There can be no objection to the <em>form </em>of this affidavit, for it is clearly within the act; the words, <em>\u201cexcept an account in bar\u201d </em>gratify the provision, <em>um.ore than credit shall be given for.\u201d </em>Similar language in the act of 1798, ch. 101, sub-ch. 9, sec. 8, <em>\u201c except what, if any, is credited,\u201d </em>has always been construed to mean <em>\u201cexcept an account in bar.\u201d</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\"><em>William P. Maulsby </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVT\">argued, that to constitute <em>perjury, </em>the oath or affirmation must be falsely taken in a judicial proceeding before a <em>\u201c competent jurisdiction, </em>and it must also be <em>material </em>to the question depending.\u201d <em>Arch. Cr. Pl., </em>672. The only question then is, what is the construction of this act of 1729, ch. 20? But for this act, no man\u2019s oath in his own favor could be allowed; it is, therefore, an act to be <em>strictly construed, </em>being in <em>derogation of the common, law </em>in allowing a party to be a witness in his own case. Now by this act, the oath must be administered <em>%cithin twelve months </em>after the first article therein <em>charged becomes due, </em>and <em>then </em>the account is made evidence, and <em>not otherwise. </em>The oath then is <em>only </em>authorised when the account appears upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>its face </em>to have its <em>first article </em>charged <em>within twelve months. </em>If hot <em>thus made, </em>it cannot be evidence; and not being evidence, it cannot be <em>material </em>to the question depending. The party cannot resort to evidence <em>dehors </em>his affidavit to show that it was made within the time required by law. The act creates one <em>entire </em>and simple piece of evidence which must be complete in all its parts, and it cannot be thus complete unless it appears upon its face to be made <em>within time.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">It nowhere appears from the. record that this affirmation was admitted and received by the magistrate <em>as evidence. </em>The record merely states that it was <em>offered and plead in bar. </em>Again, the affirmation must be in strict confoimity with the act. There is no proof here that the party making it was a <em>quaker, </em>and therefore the affirmation does not come within the law. The 15th section of tire act of 1729 is, in my judgment, expressly <em>repealed </em>by the 8th section of the act of 1785, ch. 46.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-6\">Le Grand, <em>C. J.,</em></author>\n<p id=\"A6Y\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"A85\">Waiving all question as to the alleged generality, under the act of 1825, ch. 117, of the several prayers to be found in the record, we are of opinion, that the instruction actually given by the judge of the circuit court was substantially correct, The act of Assembly under which the affirmation was made is one, <em>in this particular, </em>in derogation of the course of the common law, and like all such legislation, is to be construed <em>strictly. </em>See <em>Dyson vs. West's Exc'r, </em>1 <em>Har. &amp; John., </em>567. According to the principles of the common law, a party is denied the right of being a witness in his own case; and under our act of Assembly, he is only allowed the privilege if his account does <em>\u201c not exceed ten pounds, current money, in the course of any whole year,\" </em>and if it <em>u be proved within twelve months after the first article therein charged shall become due, and not otherwise.\" </em>The account in this case ought, in our judgment, to show <em>affirmatively </em>on its face a compliance with the requisitions of the act of Assembly. This not being so, there was no right in tire party to make the affirmation, and as a consequence, it was <em>extra-judicicil. </em>In addition to this it should be recollected, that, the 15th section of the act of 1729, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ch. 20, is <em>repealed </em>by the 8th section of the act of 1785, ch. <em>46.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
