The plea was <em>non assumpsit.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\"><em>Exception. </em>The plaintiff proved by a competent witness, that on the evening after the burial of tire testator witness read his will hr the presence of tire defendant, and the plaintiff and his wife Rachel, a daughter of the testator, and several other parties; that plaintiff\u2019s wife complained veiy much about the provisions of the will, and said it was not the will of the testator, that he had been unduly influenced by other persons to make it, and that there would be a law-suit about it. He then offered the will, by which the testator devised to his two sons, Zachariah and Challes, (the defendant,) all his real estate, comprising part of two tracts of laird which are described in the will, and also all his personal estate not hereinbefore willed. After other pecuniary bequests, the testator also be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>qucathed to his daughter, Belinda Jacobs, $200, to be paid by his two sons seven years after his decease without interest. The plaintiff then further proved by another witness, that some two or three years after the death of the testator, witness went to the house of the plaintiff in company with the defendant, and whilst there plaintiff\u2019s wife, Rachel, asked defendant Avheiher he did not promise her on the evening after her father\u2019s burial that he would give her $200 if she Avould say no more about her father\u2019s will ? that defendant thereupon replied to said Rachel\u2019s inquiry, <em>\u201c\u25a0 </em>Rachel, I did tell you that you should have as much as Belinda Jacobs Avas to get under the will, but I did not tell you when you Avould get it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that from the pleadings and evidence in the case the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, <em>because: </em>\u2014 1st, his declaration is radically\u2019 defeclivc and bad on genera) demurrer, there being no good and legal consideration to support the promise set out in it,. 2nd, there is a material variance between the allegations of the declaration and the evidence to sustain the case, in this, that, the promise alleged is a promise made to the plaintiff, Avdiereas the proof is that the promise Avas made to Rachel, his Avife. (This 2nd reason Avas abandoned in argument in this court.) 3rd, there is a material variance between the declaration and the evidence, and the latter is not sufficient in point of laAV to entitle the plaintiff to recover on the promise alleged in the declaration. 4th, the plaintiff has not offered any legal and competent evidence, of a good and legal consideration, sufficient in laAV to sustain the allegations in the declaration and the promise upon Avhich he seeks to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">The court, (Net,son, J.,) granted this prayer, and to this ruling the plaintiff excepted and appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">The cause Avas argued before Le Grand, C.

Rep., </em>492, <em>Ellicott vs. Peterson. </em>This case differs from that of <em>Seaman vs. Seaman, 12 Wend., 381, </em>thus: in that case the declaration alleged the making of a will and the devise of a large amount of property to the defendant and others, but, <em>non constat, </em>the plaintiff was not one of those others and equally interested with defendant in admitting the will to probate. In this case the declaration avers the devise by the will to the defendant alone, and on the face of the declaration the defendant was the only party interested in sustaining it. It also alleges that plaintiff\u2019s wife was heir at law, and therefore necessarily injured by the devise to defendant of the whole estate of the testator, so far as appears on tire face of the declaration. The declaration therefore shows all that it is requisite.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-5\"><em>Joseph M.

That the plaintiff has not alleged in his declaration any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>sufficient consideration to enable him to sustain his action upon the supposed promise against the defendant. There must be, to make a promise obligatory, some injury to the plaintiff or some benefit to the defendant, and this must appear in <em>the </em>declaration, otherwise it is considered a <em>nudum pactum. </em>3 <em>Burr., </em>1673, <em>Pillans vs. Van Mierop. </em>4 East., 463, <em>Jones vs. Ashburnham. 12 Wend., </em>383, <em>Seaman vs. Seaman. 1 Parsons on Cont., </em>367. 11 <em>Mees. &amp; Wels., </em>641. 1 <em>Strange, </em>94, <em>Loyd vs. Lee. Forbearance </em>to sue and the <em>settlement </em>of a claim are different things. Where an action is brought on a promise to forbear to sue, the plaintiff must allege in his declaration that he had a <em>right of action. </em>In case of an action on a promise to settle a suit he must allege a <em>pending </em>suit, and in case <em>o\u00ed forbearance </em>he must allege a <em>claim, </em>which <em>could hare been enforced. </em>There could have been no suit against the defendant here, and the only allegation is of a, forbearance to file <em>a caveat. </em>This is <em>no claim. </em>It is only a fact <em>to </em>be established in order to lay the foundation for a claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">2nd. It is not alleged in the declaration that the plaintiff was in any way interested in setting aside the will, or that he could be in the least benefited by contesting the will before the orphans court. There is no allegation that he or his wife would be entitled to a distributive share <em>after debts were paid. </em>12 <em>Wend., </em>383. 4 <em>East, </em>463. 1 <em>Stephen's N.

There is no distinct and affirmative allegation. in the declaration, that the testator was of unsound mind and incapable of making a valid deed or will, or that the will was obtained by fraud or undue influence, and even if there were apt and proper averments to this effect, there is not one particle of proof to show that there was the slightest cause or foundation for filing and sustaining a <em>caveat </em>to the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">4th.

There the <em>nar </em>alleged that the father of the plaintiff and of the defendants left a will, in which he gave to the <em>defendants and others </em>a large amount of property, real and personal; that after death of the father and before the will was proved, the plaintiff became dissatisfied with its provisions, and entertaining doubts in regard to the sanity of the testator at die time of the execution of the will, he filed a <em>caveat </em>against its being admitted to probate. That subsequenfiy, in consideration that the plaintiff would withhold all opposition to the proving of the will, the defendants promised, in case the will should be proved and allowed, to pay to the plaintiff $500. The plaintiff also averred, that in consideration of the promise of the defendants, he promised to wifiihold all opposition to the probate of the will, and that he made no further opposition thereto, and that the will was thereupon duly proved and allowed, and letters testamentary were issued thereon to the defendants, who were named as executors in the will. Upon a demurrer to the <em>nar </em>judgment was given in favor of the defendants. And Justice Nelson, speaking for the court, says: \u201cAs, however, it does not sufficiently appear in the declaration that the plaintiff was <em>particularly </em>interested in setting aside the will -of his father, and without this he could have no interest in contesting it before the surrogate, and of course lost nothing by the agreement, I think the demurrer well taken. \u2019 \u2019 In the particular which rendered that <em>nar </em>defective, the one before us is certainly quite as defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">In <em>Edwards vs. Baugh, </em>11 <em>Mees. &amp; Weis., </em>646, the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion being that, certain <em>disputes </em>and <em>controversies </em>were pending between the plaintiff and defendant, whether the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 173J?, 2s, 3d, and that in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s promise not to sue, the defendant promised to pay him lOO.J\u2019, the <em>nar </em>was held bad, as not showing a sufficient consideration, there being no allegation of any debt being due, but simply that a dispute and controversy existed respecting it. Lord Abinger thought there was nothing in the word \u201ccontroversy\u201d to render the alleged consideration a good one, and that the controversy merely was, that the plaintiff claimed the debt and <em>the </em>other <em>denied </em>it. See the cases referred to in the note on page 647. Also 4 <em>East, </em>455, 463, <em>Jones vs. Ashburnham; 2 Man., Gran. &amp; Scott, </em>548, in 52 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>546, <em>Wade vs. Simeon, </em>and 1 <em>Parsons on Cont., </em>365 <em>to </em>367.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In <em>Jones vs. Ashburnham, </em>the <em>nar </em>was held bad, because it did not show that at the time of the promise made by the defendant there was any administration upon the estate of the deceased original debtor, or that he left any assets. In regard to the rule that \u201c any damage to another, or suspension or forbearance of his right, is a foundation for an undertaking,\u201d &amp;c., as laid down by Mr. Justice Yates, in <em>Pillans vs. Van Mierop, </em>3 <em>Burr., </em>1673, when considering how that rule would apply to the case as stated by the <em>nar, </em>in <em>Jones vs. Ashburnham, </em>Lord Ellcnborough says: \u201cNow how does the plaintiff show any <em>damage </em>to himself by forbearing to sue, rvhen there was no fund which could <em>be the </em>object of suit; where <em>it does not </em>appear that any person <em>in rerum natura </em>was liable to be sued by him? No <em>right </em>can exist in this vague, abstract and indefinite way.\u201d And again he says: \u201cBut here, whether there were any representative, or any funds of the original debtor, does not appear.\u201d Grose, J., also refers to the defect in the <em>nar </em>for want of averring the existence of assets and an administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Rolfe, B., in <em>Edwards vs. Baugh, </em>denies the correctness of the proposition laid down by Mr. Henderson, in argument that forbearance would be a good consideration for a promise; so that, if it had appeared on the face of the declaration that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>nothing was due to the plaintiff, his forbearance to sue would even then' be a consideration. The Baron says: \u201cI cannot subscribe to that. I think the plaintiff is bound to show a consideration, in the shape of something, either beneficial to the opposite party or detrimental to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The present <em>nar </em>contains no allegation that Zachariah Oonoway, the testator, left any assets, either real or personal, after payment of his debts. Nothing is said having the slightest relation to the subject of assets, except simply that by the will, amongst other things, the testator devised and bequeathed to the defendant \u201creal and personal property and estate of a large value, to wit, of the value of $5000.\u201d The <em>nar </em>therefore does not sufficiently show that the forbearance promised by the plaintiff was either a detriment to him or a benefit to the defendant, which we consider necessary in a suit based upon <em>forbearance. </em>The statement here made in reference to the gift of property by the will, is very similar to that in <em>Seaman vs. Seaman, </em>where the averment is, that \u201cthe father of the plaintiff and of the defendants, in his lifetime, made and published his last will and testament, whereby he devised and bequeathed to the <em>defendants and others </em>a large amount of property, real and personal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">There is no proof before us except what was given by the plaintiff. And although its truth, in every particular; be admitted, and the declaration be assumed to contain the statement of a sufficient consideration for the alleged promise of the defendant, nevertheless we do not think the proof sustains the contract as laid. An affirmance of the judgment must therefore follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
