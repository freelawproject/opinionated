SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b255-19\">Defendant New Hampshire Insurance Company (\u201cNew Hampshire\u201d) appeals the denial of its motion for summary judgment and the grant of plaintiff Cindy Ehrlicher\u2019s motion for summary judgment seeking uninsured motorist insurance coverage for an accident incurred during the course and scope of her employment. Concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>that the district court erred in its application of Louisiana law, we reverse and render summary judgment in favor of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>employing the same standards as did the district court. <em>See Urbano v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 204, 205 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 509, 142 L.Ed.2d 422 (1998). Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-24, 106, S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Ehrlicher, an employee of American Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cAmerican\u201d), collided with an underinsured motorist while driving her own ear, allegedly during the course and scope of her employment. She recovered up to the limit of the underin-sured motorist\u2019s coverage as well as under her employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation policy. She now seeks benefits from American\u2019s insurance policy with New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The district court focused on interpreting American\u2019s insurance policy with New Hampshire, concluding that a signed endorsement modified the main policy so as to provide underinsured/uninsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage to employees of American driving their own vehicles in the scope of their employment. Specifically, the court found that the section of the endorsement entitled \u201cWho is an Insured\u201d extends the contractual scope of the UM coverage to employees in Ehrlicher\u2019s situation. Section B(5) of the endorsement defines \u201cWho is an Insured\u201d as \u201c[ajnyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 an \u2018auto\u2019 you do not own and that is a covered \u2018auto\u2019 under this coverage part for Liability Insurance and is licensed and principally garaged in Louisiana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Because the main policy defines a \u201ccovered auto\u201d as \u201cany auto,\u201d and because Ehrlicher\u2019s car is \u201clicensed and principally garaged in Louisiana,\u201d the court found that Ehrlicher can properly claim coverage under this provision. The court relied on a similar interpretation of a nearly identical provision in <em>Bays v. Estate of Zeringue, </em>584 So.2d 715 (La.App. 5th Cir.), <em>writ denied, </em>590 So.2d 79 (La.1991), <em>writ denied, </em>590 So.2d 576 (La.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">New Hampshire protests that this reading of \u00a7 B(5) would lead to the absurd result of extending coverage to \u201cany auto\u201d that is \u201clicensed and principally garaged in Louisiana.\u201d As another Louisiana court of appeal noted, the district court\u2019s reading could allow \u201ceven the members of this court [to] claim UM coverage under the policy as literally construed.\u201d <em>Ratcliff v. Theriot, </em>634 So.2d 1234, 1236 (La.App. 3d Cir.), <em>writ denied, </em>637 So.2d 1048 (La. 1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">The district court reasoned that extending UM coverage to an employee driving her own car in the course of her employment is hardly an absurd result. We agree with the <em>Ratcliff </em>court, however, that the reading urged by the plaintiffs and adopted by the district court provides no basis for limiting coverage to employees driving their own cars in the scope of then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>employment. Reading \u201ccovered auto\u201d to mean \u201cany auto\u201d would lead to absurd consequences, even if the particular application in this case does not seem so absurd. \u201cEven if the words are fairly explicit, it is our duty to refrain from construing them in such a manner as to lead to absurd consequences.\u201d <em>Cashio v. Shoriak, </em>481 So.2d 1013, 1015 (La.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">New Hampshire has offered a reasonable reading of \u00a7 B(5) that limits UM coverage to vehicles owned by American. It relies on the phrase \u201cunder this coverage part\u201d to limit the scope of \u201ccovered autos\u201d to those vehicles specified as covered in the UM coverage section of the policy. Because the declaration page for the UM coverage section states that only vehicles owned by American are UM-eovered vehicles, New Hampshire avers that \u00a7 B(5) is intended to provide UM coverage only to \u201canyone\u201d occupying a vehicle owned by American. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Because the district court found that the endorsement extended the policy\u2019s contractual coverage to Ehrlicher, it did not reach the question whether UM coverage is statutorily mandated under Louisiana law, which requires UM coverage for any person insured under a liability policy unless such coverage is waived. <em>See </em>La. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22:1406(d)(l)(a)(I). Therefore, we cannot grant summary judgment to New Hampshire unless we conclude that Ehrlicher is not a \u201cliability insured\u201d under the American policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Ehrlicher concedes that the original policy specifically excludes her and all other American employees from being \u201cliability insured[s]\u201d and would constitute a waiver under Louisiana law. She nevertheless argues that the endorsement replaces the original policy and broadens the group of \u201cliability insured\u201d persons to include any person driving a vehicle principally licensed and garaged in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">We agree with New Hampshire that the endorsements can be read to avoid conflicting with the original policy\u2019s liability provisions (as well as avoiding another absurd result). Nothing in the language of the UM coverage endorsement purports to change the group of \u201cliability insureds\u201d covered generally under the policy. Rather, the UM coverage endorsement focuses on defining who is contractually afforded UM coverage. This reading seems especially reasonable in light of the \u201cLouisiana Changes\u201d endorsement, which specifically states how it modifies the original policy\u2019s group of \u201cliability insureds.\u201d Therefore, we reject Ehrlicher\u2019s claim of statutory UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the summary judgment in favor of Ehrlicher and RENDER summary judgment for New Hampshire.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-12\">. <em>Bays </em>and <em>Ratcliff </em>represent a circuit split within Louisiana between the Fifth and Third Circuits. Unfortunately, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied writs for certiorari in both cases without explanation. This leaves us with no binding authority to resolve the question, because \"a denial of a writ of certio-rari neither constitutes an approval of the court of appeal's decision nor does it create precedent.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Robinson, </em>521 So.2d 1241, 1248 (La.App. 3d Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
