Brown was convicted of aggravated burglary in 1983. His conviction was affirmed on appeal and has been tested in several collateral attacks, state and federal. In 1996, in accordance with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown moved for authorization to file a successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contending that the instruction on reasonable doubt given to his jury violated his constitutional rights under <em>Cage v. Louisiana</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A panel of this court autho-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>nzed the filing, noting that Brown had satisfied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) by making a prima facie case \u201cthat the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADF\">Thereafter, in <em>In re </em>Smith<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we addressed the question whether the type of <em>Cage </em>claim pressed by Brown qualifies under \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A), holding that the petitioner was not entitled to file a successive habeas petition because he had failed to \u201c \u2018identify a Supreme Court edict that renders <em>Cage </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agreed with our colleagues in the First, Fourth, and Eleventh Circuits that the plain language of the statute requires an applicant to \u201cpoint to a Supreme Court decision that either expressly declares the collateral availability of the rule ... or applies the rule in a collateral proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJt\">In a thorough and careful opinion, the trial court determined that Brown had failed to identify any decision by the Supreme Court authorizing collateral review of his <em>Cage </em>claim, and dismissed the claim, citing <em>In re Smith. </em>The court then granted a certificate of appealability solely on the <em>Cage </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AdiJ\">We conclude that the trial court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s petition. <em>In re Smith </em>is controlling, binding precedent. Our authorization for Brown to file a successive petition is not dispositive of the critical question. The statute specifically directs the trial court to \u201cdismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court was obliged by the statute to dismiss Brown\u2019s claim if it did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 2244.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYL\">The trial court granted the certificate of appealability only as to the <em>Cage </em>claim; we therefore do not address Brown\u2019s ineffective assistance claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We deny Brown\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"ADFX\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-14\">.

That holding is irreconcilable with \u00a7 2244(b)(4). Commentators agree that the trial court must make its own determination that the statutory prerequisites are satisfied. <em>See, e.g., </em>Robert S. Madancy, Jr., Shawn M.
