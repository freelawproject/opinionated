In his plea agreement, he waived the right to appeal his sentence unless it was based on an \u201cupward departure\u201d from the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-27\">Douglas M. Durham was appointed to represent Gaitan on appeal. Although the district court did not make an upward departure, Gaitan, represented by Durham, challenged the two-level increase in Gaitan\u2019s base offense level, imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), for Gaitan\u2019s role in the offense. Nor did Gaitan file a reply brief in response to the assertion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the Government that the waiver precluded the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Based on the waiver, we dismissed Gai-tan\u2019s appeal as frivolous. And, we ordered Durham to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed against him for pursuing Gaitan\u2019s appeal in the light of Gaitan\u2019s waiver and for failing to address the waiver in the appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In response to the show-cause order, Durham asserts that he viewed the issue raised by Gaitan (claimed error for increasing Gaitan\u2019s offense level by two levels for his role in the offense) as falling within the exception to the waiver of appeal language in the plea agreement (for \u201cupward departures\u201d from the Sentencing Guidelines). He states that he did not address the waiver in his brief because he did not perceive it to be in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Durham maintains that he treated the \u201cupward adjustment\u201d to Gaitan\u2019s offense level as an \u201cupward departure\u201d, based on our comb\u2019s statement in <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>105 F.3d 976 (5th Cir.1997), that \u201cthere is \u2018little functional difference\u2019 between an enhancement and an upward departure\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 980-81 (quoting <em>United States v. Knight, </em>76 F.3d 86, 88 (5th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Although Durham is correct that our court has stated that there is little <em>functional </em>difference between an increase in offense level and an upward departure, we nevertheless have recognized that there are important differences. For example, the district court must give a defendant notice of its intention to depart upward on a ground not identified as a ground for upward departure either in the presentence report (PSR) or in a prehearing submission by the Government. <em>See Bums v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). But, such notice is not required for an upward adjustment to the offense level, because \u201c[t]he Guidelines themselves put defense counsel on notice that all possible grounds for enhancement or reduction are on the table at a sentencing hearing\u201d. <em>United States v. Knight, </em>76 F.3d 86, 88 (5th Cir.) (district court not required to give defendant notice that it is considering rejecting PSR\u2019s recommendation for decrease in offense level for acceptance of responsibility and imposing two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice), <em>cert. denied, </em>518 U.S. 1011, 116 S.Ct. 2538, 135 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\"><em>Perkins, </em>which cited <em>Knight </em>for the proposition that there is little functional difference between an upward adjustment and an upward departure, does not support Durham\u2019s position. At issue in <em>Perkins </em>was the propriety of an increase in Perkins\u2019 offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), which authorizes a two-level increase in the offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d involving less than five participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). (Gaitan\u2019s appeal similarly challenges a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) upward adjustment; the adjustment was based on Gaitan\u2019s supervision of two individuals who delivered heroin pursuant to his instructions.) The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At3\">To qualify for an <em>adjustment </em>under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An <em>upward departure </em>may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 2) (emphasis added). Perkins asserted, for the first time on appeal, that his management of assets of the organization did not warrant an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Our court stated that, because Perkins did not exercise control over another participant, the district court erred by enhancing Perkins\u2019 sentence under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Nevertheless, it exercised its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>discretion not to correct the error, because the district comb \u201ccould have validly departed upward based upon [Perkins\u2019] management of the organization\u2019s assets\u201d, and Perkins had notice that the increase would be considered. <em>Id. </em>at 980-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">For \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), other cases have also distinguished between upward adjustments and upward departures. In <em>United States v. </em>Jobe, 101 F.3d 1046 (5th Cir.1996), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 81, 139 L.Ed.2d 39 (1997), the district court increased Novoa\u2019s offense level by two levels pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Our court vacated the sentence, because Novoa did not manage or supervise any other criminal participant in the check kiting scheme. However, our court noted that its decision was \u201cwithout prejudice to the possibility that an upward departure for No-voa\u2019s management responsibility over the assets involved in the check kiting might be warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">A similar distinction was recognized in <em>United States v. Giraldo, </em>111 F.3d 21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 322, 139 L.Ed.2d 249 (1997). There, the district court increased the defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(e), based on the defendant\u2019s obtaining the $180,000 that completed the drug transaction. Our court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">Insofar as the district court relied on the asset management exception to make an <em>upward adjustment </em>to the offense level, it misapplied the guidelines. That exception clearly applies to an <em>upward departure </em>only. The PSR expressly concludes that there were no aggravating or mitigating circumstances that would merit consideration for a <em>departure </em>in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 24 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, our court did not vacate the sentence, because it concluded that the district court would have imposed the identical sentence based on the defendant\u2019s role as an organizer of other criminal participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s reliance on the functional similarity between \u201cupward' adjustments\u201d and \u201cupward departures\u201d to justify pursuing this appeal in the light of Gaitan\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal in the absence of an upward departure, is quite misplaced. At the very least, he should have explained such reliance in his brief. And counsel certainly should have filed a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">IT IS ORDERED that, as a sanction for pursuing this appeal contrary to the waiver, Durham shall not receive any payment for services rendered and expenses incurred in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">\n<em>SO ORDERED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
