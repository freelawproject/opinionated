Code, former \u00a7 192, subd. (c)(3))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and driving under the influence of alcohol causing injury (count 2, Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)). She admitted the special allegations of causing injury to more than one victim (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23558) as to both counts and causing great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)) as to count 2. The trial court sentenced her to five years four months in state prison on count 2 including enhancements, and stayed imposition of sentence on count 1. (\u00a7 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Appellant contends the trial court improperly entered judgment on count 2 because it is necessarily a lesser included offense of count 1, and that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing to the court that she was ineligible for probation. We conclude that driving under the influence of alcohol causing injury (count 2) is a necessarily lesser included offense of vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence (count 1). Accordingly, we reverse the conviction on count 2 and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">On August 6, 2006, appellant attended a party in Santa Barbara at which she consumed alcohol. Appellant offered Alexander Baer a ride home and left the party at 1:30 in the morning, with appellant driving and Baer in the front passenger seat. On her way home, appellant veered into the northbound lane of traffic on Highway 154, hitting Sara Maynez\u2019s car head on. Alexander Baer was killed; Sara Maynez and appellant were injured. Approximately one hour after the collision, appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was 0.20 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Appellant was charged in the amended complaint with vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence (count 1, former \u00a7 192, subd. (c)), driving under the influence of alcohol causing injury (count 2, Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)), and driving with a blood-alcohol content of 0.20 percent or higher causing injury (count 3, Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The named victim in each count was Alexander Baer, the passenger in appellant\u2019s car. The complaint further alleged that appellant caused bodily injury to more than one victim (i.e., Sara Maynez), while committing the offenses charged in all three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>counts, within the meaning of Vehicle Code section 23558. Attached to counts 2 and 3 were special allegations of great bodily injury to Alexander Baer. (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a).) Appellant pled no contest to counts 1 and 2 and admitted the special allegations. Count 3 was dismissed on the district attorney\u2019s motion. The court sentenced appellant to the low term of 16 months on count 2 (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23554), plus a three-year enhancement for causing great bodily injury to Alexander Baer (\u00a7 12022.7), plus a one-year enhancement for the injury to Sara Maynez (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23558), for a total of five years four months in prison. Sentencing on count 1 was stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">\n<em>Validity of Conviction for Violating Vehicle Code Section 23153, Subdivision (a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in convicting her of count 2, driving under the influence of alcohol causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)), because it is a necessarily lesser included offense of vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence (former \u00a7 192, subd. (c)(3)). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">A defendant cannot be convicted of both an offense and a lesser offense necessarily included within that offense, based upon his or her commission of the identical act. <em>(People v. Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351, 355 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595].) In deciding whether an offense is necessarily included in another, we apply the elements test, asking whether \u201c \u2018 \u201call the legal ingredients of the corpus delicti of the lesser offense [are] included in the elements of the greater offense.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 282, 288 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 195, 965 P.2d 713]; see <em>People v. Sloan </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 110, 113 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 137, 164 P.3d 568]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Izaguirre </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 126, 128 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 148, 164 P.3d 578]; <em>People v. Reed </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1224, 1227 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 353, 137 P.3d 184].) In other words, \u201cif a crime cannot be committed without also necessarily committing a lesser offense, the latter is a lesser included offense within the former.\u201d <em>(Lopez, supra, </em>at p. 288; see <em>Sloan, supra, </em>at p. 116.) At the time of appellant\u2019s offense, former section 192, subdivision (c)(3) defined vehicular manslaughter as \u201c[d]riving a vehicle in violation of Section 23140, 23152, or 23153 of the Vehicle Code and in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to felony, but without gross negligence; or driving a vehicle in violation of Section 23140, 23152, or 23153 of the Vehicle Code and in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, but without gross negligence.\u201d Under Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (a), \u201cIt is unlawful for any person, while under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug, ... to drive a vehicle and concurrently do any act forbidden by law, or neglect any duty imposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>law in driving the vehicle, which act or neglect proximately causes bodily injury to any person other than the driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">In pleading no contest to violating former section 192, subdivision (c)(3), appellant necessarily admitted violating Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (a). Both offenses require proof appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol when she violated the law, in this case crossing the double yellow lines in violation of Vehicle Code section 21460, subdivision (a). The two statutes differ to the extent that section 192, subdivision (c)(3) is committed when another person dies as a result of these acts, while Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (a) is committed when the other person is injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">In <em>People v. Miranda </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1464 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 610], the Court of Appeal held that \u201cVehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (a) is necessarily included in Penal Code section 191.5 [gross vehicular manslaughter]. One person who injures a person while driving under the influence commits a violation of Vehicle Code section 23153; and if that person dies from that injury\u2014whether immediately or sometime later\u2014a violation of Penal Code section 191.5 has occurred.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1468.) Here, appellant pled no contest to both counts 1 and 2, which had the same named victim, Alexander Baer. Appellant could not commit a violation of count 1 (former \u00a7 192, subd. (c)(3)), without injuring that same victim, as charged in count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The People argue that Vehicle Code section 23153 is not necessarily included in former section 192, subdivision (c)(3), because a violation of section 192 could be predicated upon the violation of Vehicle Code section 23140. Vehicle Code section 23140, subdivision (a), makes it \u201cunlawful for a person under the age of 21 years who has 0.05 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle.\u201d The People argue that the \u201cunder the influence\u201d element of Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (a), is an additional element not required for a conviction under Vehicle Code section 23140. (See <em>McDonald v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 677, 686, 688 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 826] [the term \u201cunder the influence\u201d for purposes of Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152 means the consumption of an alcoholic beverage has impaired the driver\u2019s mental and physical abilities to such a degree that the driver no longer has the ability to drive the vehicle with the caution characteristic of a sober person of ordinary prudence under the same or similar circumstances].)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">The People\u2019s argument is unconvincing. First, contrary to the People\u2019s contention, Vehicle Code section 23140 does include an \u201cunder the influence\u201d element. For example, in cases where a driver under the age of 21 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>charged with violating Vehicle Code section 23140, but no chemical test is conducted to determine the blood-alcohol content, the trial court must make a finding of \u201cunder the influence,\u201d as stated in subdivision (b) of section 23140.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Second, former section 192, subdivision (c)(3) is written in the disjunctive. The statute is violated if one drives a vehicle in violation of <em>either </em>Vehicle Code sections 23140, 23152, <em>or </em>23153. The statute does not provide that one has to violate all three sections of the Vehicle Code to commit the offense of vehicular manslaughter. Here, appellant was charged with violating Penal Code former section 192, subdivision (c)(3), by driving a vehicle in violation of Vehicle Code sections 23152 and 23153. She was over the age of 21 at the time and could not be charged with violating Vehicle Code section 23140.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Third, accepting the People\u2019s argument would mean that there could never be a lesser included offense of former section 192, subdivision (c)(3). This is incorrect. In cases where one victim dies from an alcohol-related accident due to a violation of Vehicle Code sections 23140, 23152, or 23153, the Vehicle Code violation would always be a lesser included offense of section 192, subdivision (c)(3). In this case, the prosecution charged appellant with violating Vehicle Code section 23153 and section 192, subdivision (c)(3), by injuring and causing the death of the same victim. As in <em>Miranda, </em>\u201c[t]he People do not suggest how a victim could be killed by a moving vehicle and not incur injury in the process. We cannot envision such a scenario, nor is one created by a hypertechnical reading of Penal Code section [192, subdivision (c)(3)].\u201d <em>(People v. Miranda, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 1468.)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Fourth, in a related context, the Legislature expressly recognizes that a conviction for violating former section 192, subdivision (c)(3), necessarily encompasses a violation of Vehicle Code section 23153. Vehicle Code section 13350.5 requires mandatory license revocation for certain habitual traffic offenders. Section 13350.5 provides: \u201cNotwithstanding Section 13350, for the purposes of this article, conviction of a violation of paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 192 of the Penal Code is a conviction of a violation of Section 23153.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Finally, the Legislature has provided a specific penalty for a conviction of manslaughter occurring as a result of driving while intoxicated without gross negligence, i.e., former section 192, subdivision (c)(3). \u201cThe fact that the Legislature has enacted a specific statute covering much the same ground as a more general law is a powerful indication that the Legislature intended the specific provision alone to apply.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 494, 505 [170 Cal.Rptr. 1, 620 P.2d 587]; see <em>People v. Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 153-154 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].) In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>addition, the great bodily injury enhancement alleged in this case under section 12022.7 for the death of Alex Baer is inapplicable to a conviction for section 192, subdivision (c)(3). (See \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (g) [this enhancement \u201cshall not apply to murder or manslaughter\u201d].) Sentencing appellant on the lesser included offense of Vehicle Code section 21353, with a great bodily injury enhancement under section 12022.7 as alleged in count 2 for the injuries suffered by the deceased victim Alex Baer circumvents the statutory scheme for vehicular manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We conclude the reasoning in <em>Miranda </em>is dispositive. Under the statutory elements test, the violation of Vehicle Code section 23153 is necessarily a lesser included offense of former section 192, subdivision (c)(3), and appellant cannot be convicted of violating both statutes. Appellant\u2019s conviction on count 2, for violating Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (a), cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">The probation department recommended that appellant be placed on probation with terms and conditions, including serving 270 days in jail. In the prosecution\u2019s sentencing memorandum, the People erroneously argued that appellant was presumptively ineligible for probation. At the sentencing hearing, neither the prosecutor nor the defense addressed the prosecution\u2019s erroneous statement in the sentencing memorandum. Following the imposition of the prison sentence, appellant moved to vacate the conviction and withdraw the pleas of nolo contendere and/or to correct the illegal sentence. Appellant argued in part that she had been prejudiced by the prosecution\u2019s erroneous argument concerning probation eligibility. At the hearing on the motion, the prosecutor conceded the error in the sentencing memorandum. The trial court denied the motion, clarifying that it had not considered her ineligible for probation at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Appellant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by erroneously arguing to the trial court in the sentencing brief that she was not eligible for probation. Because we are remanding this case for resentencing on count 1, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Appellant\u2019s conviction for driving under the influence causing injury (count 2) is reversed and the enhancements alleged for count 2 are stricken. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>We remand this case with instructions to resentence appellant consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Gilbert, P. J., and Yegan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">On October 31, 2007, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 16, 2008, SI58229.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-8\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated. Effective January 1, 2007, the offense formerly specified in section 192, subdivision (c)(3), vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, was replaced by section 191.5, subdivision (b). Hereafter, all references to section 192, subdivision (c)(3), are to the former section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\"> Under Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivision (b), this offense is complete when one operates a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol level of .08 percent or higher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\"> Appellant concedes that the Vehicle Code section 23558 enhancement properly applies to count 1 because she caused injury to more than one person.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
