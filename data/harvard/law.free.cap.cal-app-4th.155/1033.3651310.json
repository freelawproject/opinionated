J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU9\">Maria Antonia Speiser and defendant Leonard John Ross II engaged in a hostile verbal exchange, at the culmination of which she slapped him. Defendant responded with a blow that fractured her cheekbone. We are called upon to consider whether the participants were engaged in \u201cmutual combat\u201d for purposes of the law of self-defense. Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault and battery after the trial court instructed the jury, over defense objection, that one charged with assault cannot successfully plead self-defense if he was engaged in \u201cmutual combat\u201d with the alleged victim. Further, the court refused the jury\u2019s request during deliberations for a legal definition of \u201cmutual combat,\u201d telling jurors instead to rely on the ordinary meaning of those words. This left the jury free to suppose that any exchange of blows disqualifies both participants from claiming a right of self-defense. In fact the doctrine applies only to a violent confrontation conducted pursuant to prearrangement, mutual consent, or an express or implied agreement to fight. Since the evidence here was insufficient to establish any such arrangement or agreement, and there was a substantial basis for the jury to find that defendant may have acted in self-defense when he struck the blow on which the verdict was based, we find it reasonably probable that a properly instructed jury would have returned a verdict more favorable to defendant. We therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">On a June morning in 2004, defendant visited his friend Henry Mestaz at the latter\u2019s home in a Morgan Hill trailer park. Also living at the trailer, and present that day, were Henry\u2019s then girlfriend Amy Jonathans, whom he later married; Amy\u2019s four children, aged two to nine; and Amy\u2019s mother, Wendy Sue Bums. Toni Speiser, the alleged victim in this case, visited off and on during the day, as did her then boyfriend Donny, and his two children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>Around 3:30 that afternoon, defendant and Henry were sitting at a picnic table under an awning outside the trailer, in a porch or patio area. According to defendant, they had been playing dominos. Toni was sitting on a futon-couch near the table and against the side of the trailer. Amy was standing near a rose bush. As many as three children were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Amy was upset because Henry had invited defendant to move into the trailer. Amy felt there was not enough room. Also, she had three daughters in the house and did not like men staying there. Amy let defendant know that she wanted him to leave. According to defendant, however, Henry urged him to remain, and he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Amy then began declaiming upon the undesirability of having strange men around young children. She asked Toni how she felt about it, and Toni concurred, saying that \u201cyou never know what\u2019s going to happen\u201d when there are lots of men around a house with children. According to defendant, Toni\u2019s remarks culminated in the imprecation, \u201c \u2018Fuck you.\u2019 You know. \u2018Fuck those guys,\u2019 you know, \u2018those guys that come around.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Defendant testified that he now told Toni, \u201c \u2018Hey, you need to watch your language.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018There\u2019s kids around.\u2019 \u201d He professed not to approve of cursing around children, and some support for this assertion appears in Amy\u2019s testimony that defendant \u201cvery seldom ever cussed.\u201d Amy agreed that defendant told Toni to stop cussing and have some respect. She said that there probably was swearing going on, though she did not specifically recall it because she considered it normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Toni did not recall saying anything foul, but acknowledged that she might have done so. She testified that before this became an issue, defendant had interjected something into the conversation between the two women, whereupon Amy had \u201ctold him to stay out of it, because she wasn\u2019t talking to him; she was talking to me.\u201d Amy and Toni had then both told defendant to \u201c \u2018Mind your own business\u2019 or \u2018Butt out of the conversation\u2019 or \u2018We\u2019re not talking to you.\u2019 \u201d According to Toni, this seemed to anger defendant, who only then started telling her she was cussing and using foul language in front of the children and should shut up.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">A heated exchange ensued. According to Toni, defendant \u201cstarted saying that I was using a lot of profanity and that\u2014to stand up and go behind the trailer, that he was going to kick my ass.\u201d She told him to wait until her boyfriend Donny got back. Defendant testified that when he objected to Toni\u2019s language, she responded, \u201c \u2018You don\u2019t tell me what to do. This\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>you\u2019re not my old man.\u2019 Like, T\u2019m going to tell Donny,\u2019 you know. \u2018You don\u2019t be telling me nothing.\u2019 \u201d Defendant said that he responded in a playful, nonthreatening manner. Toni then said, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll get somebody,\u2019 you know, \u2018to kick your ass.\u2019 \u201d Defendant said, \u201c \u2018What? What? You want to\u2014you\u2014what? You threatening me? You want to kick my ass? We can go around the back. Is that what you want to do?\u2019 \u201d This was uttered, he testified, not in a literal sense but in a \u201cjoking manner\u201d as a way of \u201cclown[ing]\u201d with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">According to Amy, the argument went back and forth for some minutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Toni was saying that she would \u201chave somebody\u201d take care of defendant or would get someone to \u201ckick [his] ass.\u201d Defendant responded to one such remark with the query, \u201c[W]hy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d He also said something like, \u201cLet\u2019s go out back and take care of business.\u201d Amy acknowledged that this might have been said in a \u201chumorous\u201d vein. Toni, however, was not joking. Amy described her as \u201cchallenging\u201d defendant in a manner Amy found shocking. The only specific challenge Amy attributed to Toni was that she would have somebody else \u201ctake care of\u2019 defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">At some point defendant stood up. He testified that he did so because Henry was talking to him about getting some beer, and he wanted to check his pockets for his wallet. Amy felt that defendant might have been getting up to light a cigarette; in any event \u201cit wasn\u2019t to go towards [Toni] or anything like that. . . .\u201d According to defendant and Amy, defendant now said to Toni, \u201c \u2018You sound like an old whore.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Toni, defendant called her \u201ca fucking whore.\u201d Whatever his exact words, they angered Toni. Upon hearing them, she rose and walked toward defendant with her right hand open, intending to hit him. She believed she had her glasses and cigarettes in her left hand. She did not remember anything after approaching defendant, and could not say whether she hit him hard or soft, with an open hand or a closed one. It was undisputed, however, that she struck him. Defendant described the blow at trial as a \u201cpunch,\u201d though Officer Ray testified that defendant told him Toni had \u201cslapped\u201d him twice. Amy testified somewhat tentatively that she thought Toni\u2019s hand was open. The blow did not seem to her to have been delivered with \u201ca lot of force,\u201d but neither was it \u201clight.\u201d It was audible.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>It appeared to Amy that defendant was not expecting the blow. He \u201ctook a couple steps back,\u201d she thought more from \u201cshock\u201d than from the force of it. Defendant testified that, indeed, the blow took him by surprise. When it landed, he said, his attention was diverted to the child Donald, whom Toni had pushed out of the way. As Toni approached, defendant testified, he \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking about we were going to fight or anything. I just thought we were talking, to be honest. I mean, I didn\u2019t think she was that kind of woman to start, you know . . . .\u201d He testified that in response to the blow he may have closed his eyes. He lifted his arm and felt a second blow. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that woke me up or what. I don\u2019t even know if I was really struck again. I just know my eyes opened up and I seen somebody\u2014like I was boxing somebody. I came over with a overhand right, and I hit the person right on the cheek.\u201d In doing so, he testified, he believed he was going to be hit again. He believed his first punch either was or may have been part of a right-left combination, so that he \u201ccame over with a left,\u201d and perhaps a third blow. Toni fell back on the futon. By then Henry had stood from the table. In response to Amy\u2019s excited exclamations, he stepped between defendant and Toni, pushing them apart. At Henry\u2019s urging, defendant left.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Amy recalled defendant\u2019s response as more protracted. She testified that after Toni slapped defendant, he \u201cjust started hitting her.\u201d His first blow was a punch so hard it \u201cshocked\u201d Amy. He seemed to strike with all his might. Amy thought he hit Toni 10 to 15 times. He might have used both hands. Most of the blows were struck after Toni was \u201claid down on the futon . . . .\u201d Amy thought the later punches were thrown with force similar to the first. She could not be sure how many of them connected; she could only be sure of the one that caused Toni to fall back on the futon. Toni was screaming, and probably putting her hands up to block.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Throughout this time Amy was yelling at Henry to get defendant \u201cout of here,\u201d \u201cget him to stop,\u201d and \u201c[g]et him off of her.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of yelling going on. Like, kids were screaming and everything.\u201d Amy hit defendant over the head with a cordless telephone, but this appeared not to faze him. Eventually Henry grabbed defendant by the waist and pulled him off Toni. As he did so defendant was pulling Toni\u2019s hair. Defendant left, perhaps after standing around talking for a minute. Toni, still screaming, ran into the kitchen to get something to put on her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Toni testified that after she approached defendant to hit him, the next thing she remembered was \u201clying down on the futon and . . . being hit.\u201d It seemed like he hit her many times. It hurt. She could feel and hear bones breaking. After what seemed like a long time, she got up and ran into the house. She applied a bag of frozen vegetables to her face. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where she underwent surgery. At the time of her testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>she could feel the metal they put in her face. Sometimes it stuck out, and sometimes it hurt. She sometimes had blurry vision in her left eye. She also suffered depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Officer David Ray testified that he arrested defendant near the trailer park for battery. After declining to assert his Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights, defendant told the officer that Toni was cursing around the children and cursing and yelling at him. He told her that only a whore would use that sort of language, whereupon she slapped him twice. He then \u201cpushed\u201d her \u201cwith his fist.\u201d Asked to explain the term \u201cpush,\u201d he told the officer that he was \u201ctrained as a boxer and that a boxer does not state that they hit anyone. They use the word \u2018push\u2019 instead.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He said he struck her \u201cseveral\u201d times. He said he was just defending himself, and expressed the belief \u201cthat if somebody starts a fight, in self-defense you\u2019re permitted to finish that fight. And since Ms. Speiser had started this fight by slapping him, anything he did thereafter was self-defense.\u201d He said that \u201cshe started it, and he finished it.\u201d He said that she\u2019s a big woman and he dealt with her as though she wanted to fight.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When arrested defendant had a small red mark under his left eye. He said he believed it was from Toni slapping him. He declined medical attention. Officer Ray testified without objection that he had noticed that defendant\u2019s pupils did not contract, and attributed this to ingestion of a stimulant, though a blood test was negative. The failure to contract could also be explained by a concussion. Normally, however, a concussion will only affect one eye, and defendant\u2019s eyes showed \u201capproximately the same dilation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Officer Ray also interviewed Toni, who told him that she had gotten up and slapped defendant, in response to which he had punched her in the face, causing her to fall on the couch. She said \u201cthat she blacked out several times during the ordeal.\u201d The only injuries the officer observed on her were to the left side of her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Called by the defense as an expert, plastic surgeon David Kaufman testified that he had operated on Toni for a fractured cheekbone. The bone was fractured at four points where it joined other parts of the face. In Dr. Kaufman\u2019s opinion this injury was caused by a single blow. Apart from associated swelling, he observed no other injuries. Toni complained of none, and none were reflected in her records. A radiologist had noted a possible jaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>fracture, but Dr. Kaufman saw no appreciable evidence of that. If someone were hit on the head 10 to 15 times, he would expect to observe additional injuries, e.g., a fractured nose or jaw, teeth knocked out, or cut lips. If more than one blow had in fact been struck, he could not say with certainty which one inflicted the injury. If it were known that defendant delivered a \u201cright punch and a left punch, one right after the other,\u201d he would bet that \u201chis right hook did it,\u201d because that is the common pattern when a right-handed person fractures another\u2019s left cheekbone. It is very \u201cunlikely\u201d that even a person with boxing training would break someone\u2019s left cheekbone with his left hand. It was also \u201cpretty unlikely\u201d that an initial blow might have weakened the bone such that a later one \u201cactually . . . [got] it to collapse.\u201d A blow sufficient to inflict the injury he observed would \u201c[v]ery typically\u201d knock the recipient \u201cdown and out,\u201d meaning it would render them unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">As relevant here, defendant was charged with battery causing serious bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 242, 243, subd. (d)), and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)). As to each count it was alleged that he personally inflicted great bodily injury for purposes of Penal Code sections 667 and 1192.7. It was further alleged that he had sustained four prior convictions of serious or violent felonies for purposes of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1170.12, 667, subds. (b)-(i)), one of which also qualified as a prison prior under Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (c), and one of which also qualified as a serious felony under Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In the first trial of this matter, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on these charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the second trial the court instructed the jury, as it had not in the first, on the doctrine of \u201cmutual combat.\u201d The jury found defendant guilty of aggravated assault and aggravated battery, and sustained the great bodily injury allegation. The trial court denied a motion to strike prior convictions, and sentenced defendant to 25 years to life plus 11 years. Defendant filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention is that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on the doctrine of \u201cmutual combat\u201d as it affects a plea of self-defense. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>the first trial, the court refused to instruct on this subject. The filed copy of the instruction as proposed at that time bears the handwritten notation, \u201crefused[,j no evidence].\u201d At the second trial the court seemed to initially reach the same conclusion, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s no mutual combat.\u201d The prosecutor protested, arguing that the instruction was necessary to meet a defense theory that defendant was not guilty of aggravated assault and battery but only of lesser included offenses. The court reversed itself and agreed to give the instruction \u201cbecause of the lessers.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Consistent with this ruling, the court instructed the jury that one engaged in \u201cmutual combat\u201d cannot invoke the right of self-defense unless he has first taken specific steps to terminate, or withdraw from, the conflict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After retiring to deliberate, the jurors sent a note asking the court to \u201cclarify jury instruction 38 \u2018mutual combat.\u2019 \u201d Questioned by the court, jurors confirmed that they sought \u201c[a] legal definition of what it constitutes.\u201d The court recessed for the day, and according to a notation in the minutes, the clerk telephoned counsel and read them the jury\u2019s note, in response to which \u201c[ejach indicate[d] that they ha[d] nothing to add to jury instruction # 38.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When proceedings resumed the next day, the court told the jury, \u201c[Regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>your request yesterday for a legal definition of mutual combat, there is no legal definition. You\u2019re going to have to use your common, everyday meaning of those words or that phrase. Okay. I know that instruction that you were dealing with, No. 38, is about mutual combat, but there is no legal definition of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The case presents four questions: (1) What is the meaning of \u201cmutual combat\u201d as that phrase is used in this state\u2019s law of self-defense? (2) Was there sufficient evidence of \u201cmutual combat,\u201d so understood, to justify an instruction to the jury on that subject? (3) Did the court adequately instruct the jury on the subject? (4) If the trial court erred with respect to question 2 or question 3, does the error warrant reversal?</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">B. <em>Mutual Combat</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Like many legal phrases, \u201cmutual combat\u201d has a dangerously vivid quality. The danger lies in the power of vivid language to mask ambiguity and even inaccuracy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here the jury was told that participation in \u201cmutual combat\u201d conditionally bars the participants from pleading self-defense if either is prosecuted for assaulting the other.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The \u201ccombat\u201d element of this rule is clear enough, at least for present purposes. It suggests two (or more) persons fighting, whether by fencing with swords, having a go at fisticuffs, slashing at one another with switchblades, or facing off with six-guns on the dusty streets of fabled Dodge City. The trouble arises from \u201cmutual.\u201d When, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>for these purposes, is combat \u201cmutual\u201d? What distinguishes \u201cmutual\u201d combat from combat in which one of the participants retains an unconditional right of self-defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The trial court told the jury that the law furnishes no special answer to these questions, and that any answer must be found in the \u201ccommon, everyday meaning of those words or that phrase.\u201d Respondent presses this view before us, asserting that \u201cthe phrase \u2018mutual combat\u2019 has the common everyday meaning that the combatants want to fight. . . .\u201d But this is not true, and even if it were true it would only establish that the lay meaning of \u201cmutual combat\u201d is too broad to convey the correct legal principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The dictionary meaning of \u201cmutual\u201d does not necessarily convey any particular intention on the part of persons whose conduct it is used to describe. It is defined as \u201cdirected by each toward the other,\u201d \u201cshared in common,\u201d or \u201cjoint\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1999) p. 768), \u201c[h]aving the same relationship to each other,\u201d \u201c[djirected and received in equal amount,\u201d or \u201creciprocal\u201d (American Heritage College Dict. (3d ed. 1997) p. 901). Thus any combat may be correctly described as \u201cmutual\u201d so long as it is seen to possess a quality of reciprocity or exchange. In ordinary speech, then, \u201cmutual combat\u201d might properly describe any violent struggle between two or more people, however it came into being. If A walks up to B and punches him without warning, and a fight ensues, the fight may be characterized as \u201cmutual combat\u201d in the ordinary sense of those words. But as this example demonstrates, the phrase so understood may readily describe situations in which the law plainly grants one of the combatants a right of self-defense. In the case above, B would be entitled under the law of this state to punch A immediately, without further ado, provided he acted out of an actual and reasonable belief that such action was necessary to avert imminent harm <em>(People v. Stitely </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 514, 551-552 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 108 P.3d 182]), and he used no more than reasonable force (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Defenses, \u00a7 72, p. 407). That right cannot be forfeited or suspended by its very exercise. Yet that is the effect of relying on the everyday meaning of \u201cmutual combat.\u201d B\u2019s entitlement to strike back in self-defense would then be conditioned, absurdly, on his first refusing to fight, communicating his peaceable intentions to his assailant, and giving his assailant an opportunity to desist.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By then, of course, his assailant might have beaten him senseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>As used in the present context, the phrase \u201cmutual combat\u201d is not only ambiguous but a misnomer. The mutuality triggering the doctrine inheres not in the combat but in the <em>preexisting intent to engage in it. </em>Old but intact case law confirms that as used in this state\u2019s law of self-defense, \u201cmutual combat\u201d means not merely a reciprocal exchange of blows but one <em>pursuant to mutual intention, consent, or agreement preceding the initiation of hostilities. </em>The lead case appears to be <em>People v. Fowler </em>(1918) 178 Cal. 657, 671 [174 P. 892] <em>(Fowler), </em>disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1945) 25 Cal.2d 880, 901 [156 P.2d 7], where the court wrote, \u201cIt has long been established that one who <em>voluntarily engages </em>in mutual combat with another must have endeavored to withdraw therefrom before he can be justified in killing his adversary to save his own life. . .. Both before and since [the 1872 enactment of Penal Code section 197] the phrase \u2018mutual combat\u2019 has been in general use to designate the branch of the law of self-defense relating to homicides committed in the course of <em>a duel or other fight begun or continued by mutual consent or agreement, express or implied. </em>[Citations.]\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, it is not merely the <em>combat, </em>but the <em>preexisting intention to engage in it, </em>that must be mutual.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">This principle is supported by every decision we have found in which a pertinent point is considered. In <em>People v. Hecker </em>(1895) 109 Cal. 451 [42 P. 307], the court wrote that self-defense \u201cis not available as a plea to one who[,] <em>by prearranged duel, or by consent, </em>has entered into a deadly mutual combat in which he slays his adversary.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 462, italics added.) In <em>People v. Hatchett </em>(1944) 63 Cal.App.2d 144 [146 P.2d 469], the evidence suggested that the defendant shot the victim, a former lover, either in cold blood or under threat of imminent assault. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 148-149.) The Court of Appeal held that there was no evidence to support an instruction on mutual combat, i.e., \u201ccombat <em>entered into </em>voluntarily,\u201d as distinct from combat \u201cunder circumstances which did not compel her to retreat.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 163, italics added.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 555 [331 P.2d 163], a dispute between two drivers escalated into a \u201cgeneral melee\u201d when the first driver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>accompanied by a group of friends, attacked the second driver, and his friends, at the second driver\u2019s home. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 557.) The defendant, a member of the defending group, was charged with fatally stabbing one of the attackers. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The jury was instructed on the duty to desist as a precondition to self-defense when \u201c \u2018two persons ... by prearrangement, or otherwise by agreement, enter into and carry on a duel or deadly mutual combat.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 558.) The reviewing court held this instruction \u201cwholly outside the evidence\u201d because there was \u201cno showing, directly or by inference, that defendant had any <em>prearrangement to fight </em>anybody, and certainly none connecting him in any such way with decedent.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) The case did not present a situation where \u201ctwo gangs agree to meet for combat.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] Rattier, as the record now stands, [the defending driver] merely refused to flee his home in the face of [the invading driver\u2019s] threat to return there. Even if [the former\u2019s] words and deeds are imputable to defendant, they do not show an agreement or arrangement for mutual combat.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">A more recent case, <em>People v. Quach </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 294 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 196], might be cited to support a broader definition of \u201cmutual combat,\u201d but does not actually address the issue before us. The relevant evidence there was complicated by numerous varying versions of events, and the pertinent facts are not readily apparent, except that two groups of rival gang members left a bar and eventually engaged in a \u201cshootout\u201d in which the defendant injured the victim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 297.) The reviewing court opined in passing that \u201c[t]he jury could quite reasonably have concluded this was a mutual combat situation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 300-301.) But there appears to have been no dispute on that point, and there is no indication that the court viewed it as controversial. Certainly it acknowledged none of the cases we have cited. Instead the court held that on the facts there, it was reversible error to instruct on mutual combat without further instructing on the right of a mutual combatant to reclaim the privilege of self-defense when subjected to an attack \u201c <em>\u2018so sudden and perilous that he cannot withdraw. . . </em>.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 302, quoting <em>People v. Sawyer </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 66, 75, fn. 2 [63 Cal.Rptr. 749].)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">We are satisfied that \u201cmutual combat\u201d consists of fighting by mutual intention or consent, as most clearly reflected in an express or implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number><em>agreement </em>to fight. The agreement need not have all the characteristics of a legally binding contract; indeed, it necessarily lacks at least one such characteristic: a lawful object. But there must be evidence from which the jury could reasonably find that <em>both combatants actually consented or intended to fight before the claimed occasion for self-defense arose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">C. <em>Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">1. <em>Response to Jury Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">By statute, trial courts are required, on request of a deliberating jury, to instruct \u201con any point of law arising in the case.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1138.) The meaning of \u201cmutual combat\u201d was clearly a \u201cpoint of law arising in the case,\u201d and one on which the jury explicitly sought guidance. The trial court erred by leaving the jury to suppose that \u201cmutual combat\u201d involved no particular legal requirement, but should be understood and applied in an ordinary, lay sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Respondent contends that defendant forfeited the claim of error because he did not request any elaboration on the mutual consent instruction before it was given. This failure, however, would at most pose an obstacle to an appellate challenge based on the inadequacy of the <em>original instruction. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Solis </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1002, 1014-1015 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 464] [where defense did not request further definition of \u201c \u2018sustained\u2019 \u201d as used in criminal threat statute, \u201cthe court had no sua sponte obligation to define that word because it is a commonly understood word and was not being used in a technical sense peculiar to the law\u201d].) We are more concerned with the court\u2019s failure to elaborate on the instmction after the jury expressly asked the court for a \u201clegal definition\u201d of mutual combat. Penal Code section 1138 cast upon the court a \u201c \u2018mandatory duty\u2019 \u201d to \u201cclear up\u201d the jury\u2019s misunderstanding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1212 [275 Cal.Rptr. 729, 800 P.2d 1159].) The court need not always elaborate on the instructions already given if they were \u201cfull and complete.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1213; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 1009 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171] [\u201cthe court has an obligation to rectify any confusion expressed by the jury regarding instmctions, but has discretion to determine what additional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the jury\u2019s request for information\u201d].) \u201cHowever, \u2018[a] definition of a commonly used term may nevertheless be required if the jury exhibits confusion over the term\u2019s meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Solis, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015, quoting 5 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Criminal Trial, \u00a7 633, p. 906.) That further guidance may not come easily to hand, or is not supplied by counsel, does not excuse the court from its statutory duty. Reluctance to \u201cstrike out on its own\u201d does not permit the court to \u201cfiguratively throw up its hands and tell the jury it cannot help.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Beardslee </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 68, 97 [279 Cal.Rptr. 276, 806 P.2d 1311]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1331 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Respondent contends that defense counsel, by failing to object, waived any challenge to the court\u2019s failure to define \u201cmutual combat.\u201d According to the minutes, the clerk telephoned both counsel and \u201cread[] each of them the request as stated in [jury] Communication #4,\u201d whereupon each said that he had \u201cnothing to add to jury instruction #38,\u201d i.e., the mutual combat instruction already given. But the cited communication was nebulous: \u201cJudge, clarify jury instruction 38, mutual combat.\u201d Upon questioning by the court, jurors further said that they \u201cneeded a clear definition of mutual combat.\u201d Someone, presumably the court, added a notation to the request which we take to read, \u201clegal def of MC\u2014what it constitutes.\u201d However there is no clear indication that this clarification was conveyed to counsel. Certainly there is no evidence that counsel was ever apprised of the court\u2019s intention to tell the jury, mistakenly, that there <em>is </em>no legal definition of \u201cmutual combat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">No well-reasoned case predicates a forfeiture of a similar objection upon similar conduct. A defendant may forfeit an objection to the court\u2019s response to a jury inquiry through counsel\u2019s consent, or invitation or tacit approval of, that response. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1193 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1] [\u201cInasmuch as defendant both suggested and consented to the responses given by the court, the claim of error has been waived.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 402 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432] [claim of error was \u201cwaived by defense counsel\u2019s agreement with the trial court that informing the jury of the consequences of a deadlock would have been improper\u201d]; <em>People v. Bohana </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 360, 373 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 845] [counsel invited and consented to failure to instruct on lesser offenses in response to jury inquiry]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thoi </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 689, 698 [261 Cal.Rptr. 789] [error invited or waived, where counsel \u201cactively and vigorously lobbied against further instruction\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kageler </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 738, 746 [108 Cal.Rptr. 235] [where clarification would have adversely affected defense, failure to object had possible tactical motive and could be viewed as \u201c \u2018tacit approval\u2019 \u201d].) But this rule obviously cannot apply unless it appears that counsel was aware of the court\u2019s response at before the time it was effected. \u201cTacit approval\u201d of the court\u2019s response, or lack of response, may be found where the court makes clear its intended response and defense counsel, with ample opportunity to object, fails to do so. (See <em>People v. Boyette </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 430 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 58 P.3d 391].) At its furthest reach the rule has been held to justify a forfeiture where defense counsel sat mute while the court provided a response later challenged on appeal. <em>(People v. Roldan </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 729 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 360, 110 P.3d 289].) Here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>defense counsel could not sit mute while the court refused to assist the jury, if only because he was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Waiver has also been found where the court responds to an inquiry with a correct and germane statement of the law, and the defense proposes no further clarification. <em>(People v. Marks </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 197, 237 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 252, 72 P.3d 1222].) But this obviously does not describe the present case, where the court affirmatively told the jury to use its own lay understanding of a term that in fact possessed, in law, a specific and inobvious meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Respondent cites broad language in <em>People v. Litteral </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 790, 796 [145 Cal.Rptr. 186], that failure to object to a violation of Penal Code section 1138 may effect a waiver, but that statement was a noncommittal dictum; the judgment there was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">In sum, we see no justification in existing law to hold defendant to a \u201cwaiver\u201d of the court\u2019s incorrect response to the jury\u2019s inquiry. The record fails to show that counsel knew how the court intended to respond to the question, let alone that counsel assented to that response, tacitly or otherwise. Counsel\u2019s failure to provide the correct answer to the jury\u2019s question did not excuse the court from its \u201cprimary duty\u201d to do so. Defendant has not forfeited his objection to the court\u2019s error in failing to answer the jury\u2019s question about the meaning of \u201cmutual combat.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">2. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The more difficult question is whether <em>any </em>instruction on mutual combat should have been given. Discussion of this issue is not strictly necessary to our decision if the erroneous answer by itself was sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal. However, the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a mutual combat instruction is an issue that appears likely to arise again on remand. We will therefore address it. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 43; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 337, p. 378.)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">A party is entitled to a requested instruction if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Norman </em>v. <em>Life Care Centers of America, Inc. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1242 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 765].) Evidence is \u201c[substantial\u201d for this purpose if it is \u201csufficient to \u2018deserve consideration by the jury,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>that is, evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive.\u201d <em>(People v. Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201, fn. 8 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531].) At the same time, instructions <em>not </em>supported by substantial evidence should not be given. <em>(People v. Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 39-40 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262].) \u201cIt is error to give an instruction which, while correctly stating a principle of law, has no application to the facts of the case. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116, 1129 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">For the jury here to find defendant guilty as charged, it had to find <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that defendant struck at least one blow against Toni that (1) was unlawful, i.e., not struck in self-defense (see <em>People v. Tewksbury </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 953, 963 [127 Cal.Rptr. 135, 544 P.2d 1335]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(1967) 67 Cal.App.3d 379, 384 [137 Cal.Rptr. 652]); and (2) caused serious or great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 243, subd. (d), 245, subd. (a)(1)). For the prosecution to carry this burden by way of a mutual combat theory, it had not only to persuade the jury that the blows were struck in the course of a fight into which defendant and Toni mutually consented to join, but to persuade them of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. This standard of proof must inform any evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain such a finding. (See <em>People v. Kunkin </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 245, 250 [107 Cal.Rptr. 184, 507 P.2d 1392] [in reviewing sufficiency of evidence to support conviction, \u201c \u2018The appellate court must determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781] [\u201c[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction must be . . . whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . [Citation.] . . . [T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Although the question is made difficult by some vague or equivocal testimony, we have concluded that on this record, viewed in its entirety, no reasonable juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant and Toni were engaged in \u201cmutual combat\u201d when he punched her.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The trial court, which twice saw the witnesses give their accounts of the incident, appeared to conclude both times that there was <em>no evidence </em>of mutual combat. In the first trial the court refused an instruction on that subject, evidently memorializing its reasons with the notation \u201crefused[,] no evidence].\u201d At the second trial the court seemed to reach the same conclusion, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s no mutual combat.\u201d There is no indication that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>court changed its mind on this point. Instead it agreed to give the instruction based upon the prosecutor\u2019s insistence that he required it <em>for tactical reasons, </em>i.e., to meet the defense theory concerning the lesser offenses of simple assault and battery. (See, <em>ante, </em>fn. 7.) In response to this rationale, the court said it would give the instruction \u201cbecause of the lessers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">A party\u2019s wish to have the jury instructed on a certain point cannot be honored based only upon the party\u2019s desire to make rhetorical or tactical use of the instruction. As noted above, the necessary condition for giving a requested instruction is the presence of sufficient evidence to establish the facts whose existence it presupposes. Before reaching that question, however, we cannot help but note that the rationale offered by the prosecutor does not withstand the most casual critical scrutiny. The defense theory which so concerned the prosecutor rested on the premises that (1) defendant\u2019s first blow or combination of blows against Toni was struck in self-defense; (2) only that first blow was struck with sufficient force to sustain the charges of <em>aggravated </em>assault and battery; but (3) defendant may have committed simple assault or battery by continuing his counterattack after any apparent necessity for self-defense had passed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The manifest tactical purpose of the defense strategy was to give the jury an outlet for its inevitable disapproval of defendant\u2019s conduct while inducing it to view defendant\u2019s first (and arguably only injurious) blow separately from the ensuing ones. If the tactic succeeded, the jury would acquit defendant of the aggravated charges, while finding him guilty of the lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The doctrine of mutual combat could logically defeat the claim of <em>self-defense, </em>but it had no tendency to overcome the particular defense theory cited. It would overcome the contention that defendant was guilty of lesser included offenses only by establishing defendant\u2019s guilt of the <em>charged </em>offenses. That of course is what the prosecution had undertaken to do regardless of any particular defense tactic or theory. The doctrine of mutual combat was germane, if at all, to the claim of self-defense; it was made no <em>more </em>germane by the defense tactic of offering lesser offenses to the jury. Nor, obviously, could the instruction be justified on some kind of horsetrading rationale, as suggested by the prosecutor\u2019s comment, \u201cIf Counsel doesn\u2019t get the lesser[s], then I\u2019m not asking for this instruction.\u201d In sum, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>suggestion that a mutual combat instruction was warranted \u201cbecause of the lessers\u201d is manifestly unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Even if the instruction were made more theoretically applicable or more tactically valuable by defense tactics, that alone would not justify giving it to the jury. Nor can an instruction unsupported by the evidence be justified by a prosecutorial fear that jurors might stray from their charge. <em>(People v. Michaels </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 486, 531 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 285, 49 P.3d 1032] [where no defense of necessity raised, error to instruct on limitations on that defense in order to assuage prosecutor\u2019s concern that \u201cthe jurors would on their own come up with such a defense and apply it in this case\u201d].) As we have noted, the dispositive consideration is whether the instruction is supported by substantial <em>evidence. </em>Here, the mutual defense instruction was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Viewed most favorably to the prosecution, the evidence showed an exchange of belligerent comments culminating in an impulsive and unexpected blow by Toni to which defendant responded with a combination, flurry, or barrage of blows. There is simply not enough evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that when these blows were exchanged, both parties had formed the intent to engage in a fight. The transcript contains some evidence that would, standing alone, suggest a willingness on <em>defendant\u2019s </em>part to fight. Amy thought he responded to Toni\u2019s threats of getting somebody to take care of him by asking, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d All three eyewitnesses agreed that he said something about going behind the trailer to fight. It is doubtful that a reasonable juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that either of these remarks constituted an earnest proposal to fight or expression of intent to do so. The first appears more in the nature of a rhetorical question than a serious proposition, and Amy acknowledged that the second might have been made in a \u201chumorous\u201d vein, as defendant testified it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Toni never contradicted this testimony; she was not asked whether defendant seemed in earnest, or whether she believed he was. Indeed, during the evidentiary phase of the trial, the prosecutor himself manifestly did not view the case as one of mutual combat. He made no attempt to establish that the parties were engaged in mutual combat by any definition. Quite the reverse; he sought to exclude evidence directly bearing on that issue. The only reference to \u201cmutual combat\u201d during the evidentiary phase of the trial occurred when defense counsel asked Officer Ray if he had inquired of Toni whether \u201cshe expected to be in a mutual combat when she got up and went towards Mr. Ross and smacked him?\u201d Counsel, who presumably expected the officer\u2019s negative answer, posed the question as part of an effort to establish a lack of thoroughness in the officer\u2019s interrogation of witnesses. The prosecution had opened the door to such evidence by insinuating that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>fabricated details of his testimony not included in the account he gave to Officer Ray. But if the case truly presented an issue of mutual combat, the prosecutor\u2019s relevance objection would have been properly overruled even without that rationale.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">At the same time, there was considerable evidence that defendant had no present intention or expectation of fighting with Toni. He directly so testified, saying that he \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking about we were going to fight or anything. I just thought we were talking, to be honest. I mean, I didn\u2019t think she was that kind of woman . . . .\u201d Toni gave him no apparent reason to expect a fight. She showed no sign of herself engaging in combat with him. Nor did defendant appear to be preparing to do so. Amy testified, and even Toni seemed to acknowledge, that defendant did not move towards Toni. Toni said that he was \u201cpushing\u201d or \u201cpulling\u201d his sleeve \u201cup to his elbow.\u201d But insofar as this might otherwise support an inference of preparation to fight, Amy again cast serious doubt on it, testifying that defendant appeared not to be expecting the blow, and that when it landed he \u201ctook a couple steps back,\u201d she thought more from \u201cshock\u201d than from the force of it. Indeed it seems unlikely that Toni\u2019s blow would ever have landed on defendant\u2019s cheek\u2014as it indisputably did, leaving a mark\u2014had he been expecting it. Having received some training in boxing, it is difficult to believe that defendant could not have deflected the blow, particularly if, as the evidence strongly indicated, it was a slap rather than a punch.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Even if a reasonable juror could be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant wanted to fight, the record presents no substantial evidence of a reciprocal willingness on Toni\u2019s part. A contrary finding is supported by overwhelming evidence. Toni flatly testified that she did not \u201cwant to fight him.\u201d Nor did she manifest an intention to fight by her words or conduct. Her own account had her steadfastly refusing defendant\u2019s invitations to fight, telling him instead to wait for her boyfriend, who would \u201ctalk to him about that,\u201d i.e., defendant\u2019s supposed \u201cwanting to go out back and kick your ass . . . .\u201d That she ultimately formed the intention to <em>hit </em>defendant is unquestioned. But her testimony had her walking up to him <em>with her glasses and cigarettes in one hand </em>and <em>slapping </em>him with the other. This is not the conduct of someone entering into \u201ccombat.\u201d A slap may have been a prelude to a <em>duel </em>in the days of matched pistols at 20 paces, but it is hardly the way one initiates serious hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Admittedly, there is some evidence that, standing alone, could support an inference of an intent on Toni\u2019s part to fight. Amy testified that Toni\u2019s <em>demeanor </em>toward defendant was so \u201cchallenging\u201d that Amy was \u201cshocked\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>by it. In response to highly leading questions, Amy acceded to the characterization that it was \u201cas if\u2019 she were \u201cwatching two men\u201d \u201cgetting into it,\u201d and that Toni was issuing challenges \u201cas if to a physical altercation . . . .\u201d Asked if \u201c[i]t was like, \u2018If you don\u2019t stop talking to me, we\u2019re going to get into it right here and now,\u2019 basically,\u201d Amy replied, \u201cSomething like that, yeah.\u201d But the only specific \u201cchalleng[e]\u201d Amy ascribed to Toni was the threat to have somebody else \u201ctake care of\u2019 defendant. No witness suggested that Toni was threatening or offering to fight defendant herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We do not believe any reasonable juror faced with this evidence could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant and Toni at any time mutually agreed, consented, arranged, or intended to fight one another. Instead the evidence strongly suggests that the parties exchanged contemptuous remarks until Toni lost her temper and slapped defendant, whereupon he punched her back.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is not \u201cmutual combat\u201d as that term has been explicated in California precedents. This does not mean that defendant was legally entitled to punch Toni. That was and remains a legitimate question for the jury. But the answer must hinge on whether defendant responded with reasonable force to avert a threat of violence against his person. There is no adequate basis here for a finding that defendant was at any time engaged in mutual combat with Toni.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">D. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Defendant contends that the error requires reversal unless it is shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This contention rests on the premise that the error \u201ceffectively removed . . . appellant\u2019s defense from the jury\u2019s consideration.\u201d The cases cited by defendant on this point hold that <em>\u201cfailure to instruct... on the defendant\u2019s theory </em>of the case, where there is evidence to support such instruction, is reversible per se and can never be considered harmless error.\u201d <em>(U. S. v. Zuniga </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 989 F.2d 1109, 1111, italics added; see <em>U. S. v. Mason </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 902 F.2d 1434, 1438.) Assuming the accuracy of this statement, we doubt its pertinence. The trial court here did not \u201cfail[] to instruct\u201d on a defense theory but gave an unwarranted and dangerously incomplete instruction on a <em>prosecution </em>theory in <em>rebuttal </em>of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Such authority as we have found indicates that failure to clarify the applicable law upon inquiry by the jury is ordinary error the effect of which is tested under the relatively lenient standard of <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]. <em>(People v. Solis, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015.) Under that standard, an error warrants reversal \u201conly if, \u2018after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13), it appears \u2018reasonably probable\u2019 the defendant would have obtained a more favorable outcome had the error not occurred <em>(Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836).\u201d <em>(People v. Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 178 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].) A \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d for these purposes \u201cdoes not mean more likely than not, but merely a reasonable chance, more than an abstract possibility.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Ghilotti) (2002) 27 Cal.4th 888, 918 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 44 P.3d 949]; see <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 693-694, 697, 698 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052] [for purposes of determining whether it is reasonably probable that defense counsel\u2019s deficient representation adversely affected outcome, \u201creasonable probability\u201d does not mean \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d but merely \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We find the likelihood that defendant would have achieved a more favorable result in the absence of the errors to be more than \u201cmerely a reasonable chance,\u201d and considerably more than an \u201cabstract possibility.\u201d We begin with the fact that the jury in the first trial was unable to reach a verdict, and that its last communication before deadlocking was a question about self-defense.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That jury had apparently not heard the testimony of Dr. Kaufman, which strongly suggested that only defendant\u2019s opening blow (or combination) was struck with sufficient force to support the charged offenses of aggravated assault and battery. That testimony rendered it unlikely that a jury would sustain those charges if it found the opening blows to have been struck in self-defense. Again, for defendant to prevail on these points, the jury did not have to affirmatively conclude that he acted initially in self-defense, and that the first blows were the only ones struck with sufficient force to sustain the charges. It had only to entertain a <em>reasonable doubt </em>on those questions. The testimony of the sole independent eyewitness, Amy, strongly suggested that Toni attacked defendant unexpectedly. A properly instructed jury would have understood that defendant was entitled to defend himself if he actually and reasonably anticipated that a further blow\u2014even a slap\u2014was imminent. Defendant testified that Toni struck him twice. This was consistent with his statements to Officer Ray shortly after the incident, and was uncontradicted by any other witness. This evidence supported a reasonable doubt, at least, about whether he reasonably expected to be slapped again.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Respondent contends that the instruction was harmless because juries are said to ignore irrelevant instructions. (See <em>People v. Rollo </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>109, 123 [141 Cal.Rptr. 177, 569 P.2d 771] [instructing on irrelevant point \u201cis usually harmless, having little or no effect \u2018other than to add to the bulk of the charge\u2019 \u201d].) Had the jury been properly instructed on the meaning of \u201cmutual combat,\u201d and were the record otherwise silent on the subject, this supposition might obtain. A properly instructed jury would not find \u201cmutual combat\u201d on the present facts, and would therefore presumably ignore the instruction. But the jury here was <em>not </em>properly instructed. It was left to suppose that the instruction might apply to <em>any </em>exchange of blows. Moreover the record affirmatively shows that jurors did not ignore the instruction. They petitioned the court in vain to clarify it. This fact turns respondent\u2019s generalization on its head: the very fact that jurors did not ignore the instruction suggests that they misunderstood it in precisely the way we have outlined, and thus misapplied it to improperly disqualify defendant from asserting a right to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Respondent further contends that any error was harmless because \u201c[t]he overwhelming evidence established [that] appellant\u2019s response to a slap in the face was grossly disproportionate.\u201d This assertion does not fully meet the issue, because a properly instructed jury could well agree with it and still not find defendant guilty of the aggravated offenses for which the court sentenced him to life in prison. This was precisely the defense strategy we have outlined, i.e., to permit the jury to find that defendant exceeded the scope of lawful self-defense, and thus committed simple assault and battery, by continuing to hit Toni, or attempt to do so, after his first blow or blows\u2014 which were justified self-defense\u2014had clearly rendered her <em>hors de combat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Respondent apparently means to allude to the possibility that the jury could reject the plea of self-defense in its entirety if it found that defendant used excessive force <em>ab initio. </em>Most of the cases involving questions of excessive force consider the use of <em>lethal </em>force in response to a nonlethal attack. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Gleghorn </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 196, 202 [238 Cal.Rptr. 82] [victim may have responded unreasonably to simple assault by shooting defendant with bow and arrow, but defendant continued to beat victim long after necessity had passed]; <em>People v. Clark </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 371, 380 [181 Cal.Rptr. 682] [defendant shot victim who intended to \u201c \u2018beat him up\u2019 \u201d], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 92 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heffington </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 1, 14 [107 Cal.Rptr. 859] [defendant used knife in defending against assault with fists]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 534, 537 [97 Cal.Rptr. 883] [defendant shot victim]; <em>People v. Lewis </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 698, 702 [81 Cal.Rptr. 900] [same]; <em>People v. Garcia </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 517, 523 [79 Cal.Rptr. 833] [assuming defendant could be found to act in self-defense in resisting victim\u2019s efforts to disarm him, shooting the victim with an arrow was excessive force]; cf. <em>People v. Beyea </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 176, 190 [113 Cal.Rptr. 254] [two defendants fatally beat and kicked victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>at length; jury \u201ccould well conclude\u201d that they \u201cused excessive force and continued to do so long after the decedent had been disabled\u201d].) We are not asked to decide under what circumstances, if any, a single punch or combination of punches may be found to constitute an excessive response to avert a second or third slap. There is reason to doubt that the jury ever reached the question, since it was apparently distracted, and its deliberations were quite possibly determined, by the mutual combat instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We note that in his argument to the jury on this point, the prosecutor conflated defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>with the <em>consequences </em>it produced: \u201cEven if you believe that she was going to slap him again, you\u2019d also have to find that his response was reasonable to an objective and reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances. <em>He responds by breaking bones in her face.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) But punching one\u2019s assailant in the face is not like shooting him in the head or stabbing him in the heart. The test is not whether the force used appears excessive in hindsight but whether it appeared reasonably necessary to avert threatened harm under the circumstances at the time. The law grants a reasonable margin within which one may err on the side of his own safety, and so long as he is found to have done so reasonably, no abuse of the right of self-defense should be found to have occurred. A leading forms book makes a similar point in a proposed jury instruction: \u201c[I]n using force in self-defense, a person may use only that amount of force, and no more, that is reasonably necessary for that person\u2019s protection. However, since in the heat of conflict or in the face of an impending peril a person cannot be expected to measure accurately the exact amount of force necessary to repel an attack, that person will not be deemed to have exceeded his or her rights unless the force used was so excessive as to be clearly vindictive under the circumstances. Thus, a person\u2019s right of self-defense is limited by the reasonableness of his or her belief that such force was necessary at that time and under the particular circumstances.\u201d (2A Am. Jur. Pleading and Practice Forms (2000), Assault and Battery, \u00a7 164, pp. 516-517; see <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Watley </em>(1997) 548 Pa. 574, 581 [699 A.2d 1240, 1243] [jury instructed in part, \u201cA Defendant is entitled to estimate the necessity for the force he employs under the circumstances as he reasonably believes them to be at the time.\u201d]; <em>Hommer v. State </em>(Okla.Crim.App. 1983) 1983 OKCR 2 [657 P.2d 172, 174] [\u201cIt would be absurd to anticipate that a defendant could calculate a mathematically accurate quantity of force essential to do no more than repel an attack, at the moment of the attack\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Here the prosecution had a strong argument that defendant\u2019s response to Toni\u2019s blow was excessive at least in duration. Whether it was excessive <em>ab initio </em>was a question entrusted to the jury. Unfortunately it does not appear from this record that the jury ever reached that question. Instead it is entirely likely that the case was decided on the basis of a mistaken understanding of \u201cmutual combat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Premo, J., and Elia, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 16, 2008, S158026.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-11\"> For the sake of narrative clarity, we will refer to participants other than defendant by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\"> Amy testified that she had a bad cold at the time of trial, had taken an over-the-counter medication for it, and that her thought processes were clouded.

The phrase \u201cmutual combat\u201d appears in at least three different legal settings, and its meaning may be expected to vary depending on its role in each. In the law of torts, a plaintiff\u2019s involvement in mutual combat with the defendant may or may not, depending on the jurisdiction, furnish a defense to a cause of action for battery. (See Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 892C, com. b &amp; illus. 1-3, pp. 376-377; Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 18, p. 118; <em>Hudson v. Craft </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 654, 656 [204 P.2d 1].) In the law of criminal homicide, the victim\u2019s participation in mutual combat with the defendant may mitigate the latter\u2019s offense from murder to manslaughter. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitfield </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 605, 609 [66 Cal.Rptr. 438]; <em>People v. Bush </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 129, 132 [3 P. 590].) And as relevant here, involvement in mutual combat may preclude reliance on self-defense to defeat a charge of assault, or similar offense, unless the defendant took specific steps to desist from the combat. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 197 (section 197).) We note that even in the context of tort law, where the phrase might well be expected to take on different connotations than in the context of criminal assault and battery, it is said that \u201c[t]o constitute mutual combat... a mutual intent and willingness to fight must exist.\u201d (6A C.J.S.

Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Defenses, \u00a7 74, p. 408.)
