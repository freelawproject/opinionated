Appellant Jacqueline T., individually and as guardian ad litem for minors Roes 1 through 3 (collectively, Minors), filed a complaint alleging several causes of action sounding in negligence and negligence per se based on Employees\u2019 conduct in investigating reports of possible sexual abuse of Minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Respondents moved for summary judgment, which the trial court denied. Respondents then filed a petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition in this court, which we granted after concluding respondents were immune from liability under Government Code section 820.2 and/or section 821.6. Complying with the alternative writ, the trial court vacated its order denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>respondents\u2019 summary judgment motion and entered a new order granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On appeal, Jacqueline T. raises essentially the same arguments she relied upon in opposing summary judgment and the petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition. And for the same reasons we rejected her arguments previously, we reject them here. The judgment will thus be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Jacqueline T. is mother to Minors with her former husband, Albert G. (collectively, parents). After they divorced, parents shared joint custody of Minors, while primary physical custody remained with Jacqueline T. Minors routinely had weekend visits with Albert G. at the house he shared with his girlfriend, Kelly D., and her 11-year-old son, N. On three occasions\u2014in 1998, 1999, and 2000\u2014County received reports alleging that N. was sexually abusing Roes 1 and 2 during their weekend visits with Albert G.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The first report was submitted on August 27, 1998, by Minors\u2019 therapist, Dr. Clark Conant. According to the report, Dr. Conant informed County that, during a visit to his office, Roe 2 screamed when using the toilet. Jacqueline T. then examined Roe 2 and found redness in her vaginal area. When asked about the redness, Roe 2 explained she \u201chate[s] N.\u201d because \u201che sits on me and kisses me.\u201d Roe 1 then said that N. asked Roe 2 to kiss Roe 1 and to suck his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">After receiving the report, County immediately completed an emergency response unit child protective services (CPS) intake form and screener narrative, and the matter was referred to respondent Michael Yee, a County social worker, for investigation. During his subsequent investigation, Yee, among other things, contacted Jacqueline T.; prepared a history; visited the homes of both Jacqueline T. and Albert G.; conducted interviews of N., N.\u2019s mother and siblings, and Minors; and spoke by telephone with Albert G.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, on September 26, 1998, Yee cross-reported the alleged abuse to the Newark Police Department, which decided not to pursue any action at that time. Ultimately, Yee concluded in a written investigative narrative that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>child abuse allegations were unsubstantiated, noting in doing so that parents were engaged in a \u201cmessy child custody fight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The second report was submitted on October 29, 1999, by Minors\u2019 maternal great-grandmother. According to this report, Roe 2 told her great-grandmother during a bath to \u201click her bootie.\u201d When the great-grandmother asked Roe 2 where she learned to say that, Roe 2 said from N.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Again, after receiving the report, County immediately conducted an emergency response unit CPS intake form and screener narrative, and the matter was referred to respondent Paula Richards, another County social worker, for investigation. During Richards\u2019s subsequent investigation, she reviewed the file from Yee\u2019s investigation the prior year, and noted that the screener narrative identified the new allegations as substantially similar to the earlier ones that Yee had found unsubstantiated. Richards spoke several times by telephone with Jacqueline T. and attempted a home visit, but no one answered the door. She also obtained authorization from Jacqueline T. to speak to Minors\u2019 family court therapist, and thereafter spoke to the therapist several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Like Yee, Richards also cross-reported the alleged abuse to the Newark Police Department. In doing so, Richards spoke to the officer assigned to the case, Detective Ramirez, who informed her that she was familiar with the family and had decided against pursuing a criminal investigation at that time, noting the family was dealing with several custody issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Ultimately, Richards deferred further investigation due in part to the ongoing and contentious family court proceedings and mediation. But Richards kept the matter open until 2000, when the third report of suspected abuse was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The third report on June 29, 2000, was again submitted by Minors\u2019 maternal great-grandmother, and then referred to Richards upon the immediate completion of an emergency response unit CPS intake form and screener narrative. In the third report, the great-grandmother stated, among other things, that Roe 1 had told her N. was \u201cgay,\u201d and when she asked him to explain why he believed this, Roe 1 had explained N. pulls his own and Roe l\u2019s pants down and puts his private part on Roe 1 and in his face. The great-grandmother also reported that, when Jacqueline T. asked Roe 2 whether anyone had touched her private parts, she replied: \u201cN. sometimes touches me with my pants off and my pants on.\u201d Roe 2 further told her: \u201cI hate going there [to N.\u2019s house] every time he does it, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Jacqueline T. then asked Roe 1 whether N. touched his private parts, and he responded, \u201cnot me, just [Roe 2].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In response to the third report, Richards again cross-reported to the Newark Police Department, speaking to Detective Ramirez on July 7, 2000. County, in conjunction with the Newark Police Department and the Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office, then arranged for Child Abuse Listening, Interviewing and Coordination Center (CALICO) interviews of Roes 1 and 2, which were conducted one-on-one by a forensic child interviewer on July 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Ultimately, all three agencies\u2014County, the Newark Police Department and the Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office\u2014concluded based on the evidence that the sexual abuse allegations were unsubstantiated. Thereafter, Richards concluded in a written investigative narrative that nothing the children said during the CALICO interviews indicated they had been sexually abused, and that their encounters with N., including one in which, according to Roe 1, N. \u201cput his dick\u2014his private part on my face,\u201d were best described as \u201chorseplay.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Richards thus closed the case file.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Sometime after the case was closed, N. admitted sexually molesting Roes 1 and 2. And during subsequent CALICO interviews, the children revealed much more specific evidence of N.\u2019s abuse. N. was thus criminally charged for the abuse and detained in a juvenile detention facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">On June 8, 2004, Jacqueline T. filed this lawsuit, asserting causes of action for (1) child endangerment/negligence per se, (2) statutory violations/negligence per se, (3) negligence, and (4) negligent hiring, supervision and retention. After two rounds of amendments, respondents demurred to the second amended complaint on the ground that they were immune from liability under Government Code sections 821.6 and 820.2. The trial court overruled the demurrer. Respondents then moved for summary judgment on the same ground, which the trial court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">On June 26, 2006, respondents filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition in this court, challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment. After permitting informal briefing, this court issued an alternative writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside and vacate its order denying summary judgment and to enter an order granting the motion. Alternatively, this court ordered the trial court to show cause why it should not be compelled to comply with the alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>On August 11, 2006, the trial court complied with the alternative writ, issuing an order granting summary judgment to respondents. This court thus discharged the alternative writ and summarily denied the petition as moot. As such, no formal briefing was ordered, and the matter never came on calendar for hearing. Respondents have included the alternative writ as exhibit B to respondents\u2019 brief. <em>(Alameda County Child Protective Services v. Superior Court </em>(Aug. 3, 2006, A114230) [order issuing alternative writ].)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">On September 12, 2006, Jacqueline T. filed a petition for review in the California Supreme Court, which was denied. On October 18, 2006, judgment was entered in favor of respondents, leading to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review this question of law independently. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Preach v. Monter Rainbow </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1449-1450 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 320].) In doing so, however, \u201cwe must view the evidence in a light favorable to . . . the losing party [citation], liberally construing [his] evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing [the prevailing party\u2019s] own showing, and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in [the losing party\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>(Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 768 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143]; see <em>Barton v. Elexsys Intern., Inc. </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1187-1188 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 212].)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Here, summary judgment was granted on the ground that, as a matter of law, respondents are immune from liability for alleged negligence and negligence per se in connection with reporting, investigating and cross-reporting allegations that Roes 1 and 2 had been sexually abused. Jacqueline T. contends this grant of summary judgment on immunity grounds was erroneous because respondents\u2019 alleged investigatory failures amounted to breaches of \u201cmandatory and ministerial\u201d duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">This court has once before addressed the issue of respondents\u2019 immunity under California law. As set forth above, in issuing an alternative writ of mandate ordering the trial court to grant summary judgment in favor of respondents, we concluded both County and Employees were immune from liability under two statutes\u2014Government Code sections 821.6 and/or 820.2. In so concluding, we reasoned that \u201cthe investigation of allegations of child abuse and the decision of what action, if any, should be taken are uniquely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>governmental functions. [Fn. omitted.] A decision to remove a child from his/her home or not to do so and the investigation that informs that decision involve precisely the kinds of \u2018sensitive policy decisions] that require[] judicial abstention to avoid affecting a coordinate governmental entity\u2019s decisionmaking or planning process.\u2019 <em>(Barner </em>[v. <em>Leeds </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 676,] 688 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 97, 13 P.3d 704].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Despite having previously explained via the alternative writ our conclusion that respondents are entitled to immunity, we consider the issue anew on appeal, given that we summarily denied respondents\u2019 writ petition as moot, without ordering formal briefing or giving the parties the opportunity for oral argument, when the trial court complied with the writ. <em>(Kowis v. Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888, 894, 899 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250] [where a respondent to a petition for writ of mandate chooses to act in conformity with the alternative writ, the petition becomes moot and there is no cause to be decided by the Court of Appeal in a written opinion].) We therefore turn again to the relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Under the California Tort Claims Act, Government Code section 810 et seq.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute: [\u00b6] (a) A public entity <em>is not </em>liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 815, subd. (a), italics added; Stats. 1963, ch. 1681, \u00a7 1, pp. 3266, 3268.) \u201cThe liability of a public entity established by this part (commencing with Section 814) is subject to any immunity of the public entity provided by statute, including this part, and is subject to any defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person.\u201d (\u00a7 815, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Here, Jacqueline T. sets forth two statutory bases for holding respondents liable under the California Tort Claims Act. First, Jacqueline T. seeks to hold County derivatively liable for the alleged acts or omissions of Employees under section 815.2. Second, she seeks to hold County directly liable for alleged acts or omissions under section 815.6. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">A. <em>Liability Under Section 815.2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u201cA public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.\u201d (\u00a7 815.2, subd. (a); Stats. 1963, ch. 1681, \u00a7 1, pp. 3266, 3268.) \u201cExcept as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>otherwise provided by statute, a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.\u201d (\u00a7 815.2, subd. (b); Stats. 1963, ch. 1681, \u00a7 1, pp. 3266, 3268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Here, Jacqueline T. seeks to hold County derivatively liable for Employees\u2019 alleged acts or omissions in investigating allegations that Roes 1 and 2 had been sexually abused. Respondents, in turn, argue Employees, and thus County, are immune from such liability under section 820.2 and section 821.6. Section 820.2 provides: \u201cA public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.\u201d Section 821.6, in turn, provides: \u201c. . . a public employee is not liable for injury caused by his [or her] instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his [or her] employment, even if he [or she] acts maliciously and without probable cause.\u201d (See Stats. 1963, ch. 1681, \u00a7 1, pp. 3266, 3269, 3270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Our California Supreme Court has recently considered a claim of a public employee\u2019s so-called discretionary act immunity under section 820.2. In <em>Barner v. Leeds, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 676, the court concluded \u201cnot all acts requiring a public employee to choose among alternatives entail the use of \u2018discretion\u2019 within the meaning of section 820.2.\u201d <em>(Barner, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 684\u2014685 <em>(Barner).) </em>Rather, immunity is limited to policy and planning decisions, and does not reach \u201clower level decisions that merely implement a basic policy already formulated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.) \u201cThe scope of the discretionary act immunity \u2018should be no greater than is required to give legislative and executive policymakers sufficient breathing space in which to perform their vital policymaking functions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Applying this rule to the facts before it, the <em>Barner </em>court concluded a public defender\u2019s initial decision to provide representation to a criminal defendant was a \u201csensitive policy decision\u201d subject to discretionary act immunity under section 820.2. <em>(Barner, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 688.) A public defender\u2019s subsequent decisions in implementing that initial decision, such as decisions regarding the type and extent of legal services to provide the defendant, however, were \u201coperational,\u201d i.e., related to policy implementation, and thus not subject to immunity under section 820.2. (24 Cal.4th at p. 688.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Here, not surprisingly, Jacqueline T. argues Employees\u2019 alleged tortious acts were \u201coperational decisions,\u201d and thus not immunized by section 820.2. She reasons that \u201c[m]any of the decisions inherent to th[e] [investigatory] process\u201d\u2014including whether to accept a report of child abuse from a reporter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>whether to prepare an internal report and to timely cross-report to other agencies, whether to respond immediately, whether to utilize social workers skilled in emergency response, whether to interview certain individuals regarding the allegations or to have in-person contact with the alleged victim, and whether to take further actions to protect the victim\u2014are \u201clargely <em>operational </em>or <em>ministerial </em>decisions pertinent to the \u2018implementation\u2019 of those and other prescribed duties, as well as to the overall investigative function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Several appellate courts, however, have rejected such reasoning. Those courts have held that a social worker\u2019s decisions relating to, as here, the investigation of child abuse, removal of a minor, and instigation of dependency proceedings, are discretionary decisions subject to immunity under section 820.2, and/or prosecutorial or quasi-prosecutorial decisions subject to immunity under section 821.6. (E.g., <em>Alicia T. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 882-883 [271 Cal.Rptr. 513] <em>(Alicia T.) </em>[county and its social workers held immune from liability under \u201ceither or both of [sections 820.2 and 821.6]\u201d for alleged negligence in investigating report of child molestation]; <em>Jenkins v. County of Orange </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 278, 282-283 [260 Cal.Rptr. 645] <em>(Jenkins) </em>[county and its social workers held immune from liability under \u00a7 821.6 for \u201cfailing] to use due care by not thoroughly investigating the child abuse report and failing] to weigh and present all the evidence\u201d]; <em>Newton v. County of Napa </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1551, 1559-1561 [266 Cal.Rptr. 682] <em>(Newton) </em>[citing \u00a7 820.2 in holding county immune from liability for actions \u201cnecessary to make a meaningful investigation\u201d of child abuse]; <em>County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 627, 633, 644-645 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 637] <em>(Terrel R.) </em>[county held immune from liability under \u00a7 820.2 for alleged negligent placement and supervision of child in foster home where child was sexually molested]; see also <em>Ronald S. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 887, 899 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 418] <em>(Ronald S.) </em>[county held immune from liability under \u00a7 821.6 for negligent selection of an adoptive home for a dependent child].) Such courts have reasoned that \u201c[c]ivil liability for a mistaken decision would place the courts in the \u2018unseemly position\u2019 of making the county accountable in damages for a \u2018decision-making process\u2019 delegated to it by statute.\u201d <em>(Newton, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at p. 1560; see also <em>Ronald S., supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 897 [\u201c[t]he nature of the investigation to be conducted and the ultimate determination of suitability of adoptive parents [by social workers] bear the hallmarks of uniquely discretionary activity\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Alicia T. </em>is illustrative. There, the plaintiff argued, as Jacqueline T. does here, that a social worker\u2019s investigative decisionmaking is ministerial and not discretionary. Rejecting this argument, the court explained: \u201cIt is necessary to protect social workers in their vital work from the harassment of civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>suits and to prevent any dilution of the protection afforded minors by the dependency provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Therefore, social workers must be absolutely immune from suits alleging the improper investigation of child abuse, removal of a minor from the parental home based upon suspicion of abuse and the instigation of dependency proceedings.\u201d <em>(Alicia T., supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Similarly, relying on section 821.6, the court in <em>Jenkins </em>concluded a social worker was entitled to absolute immunity from liability arising out of her actions in investigating child abuse allegations, initiating dependency proceedings and removing a child from his custodial parent. <em>(Jenkins, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at pp. 283-284, 287.) In doing so, the court explained immunity under section 821.6 covers not just the act of filing a criminal complaint, but also other prosecutorial or quasi-prosecutorial functions such as weighing and presenting evidence when rendering a decision on whether to proceed with litigation. <em>(Jenkins, </em>at p. 284; see also <em>Kemmerer v. County of Fresno </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1426, 1436-1437 [246 Cal.Rptr. 609]; <em>Amylou R. v. County of Riverside </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1209-1210 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 319] [concluding that \u201csince investigation is part of the prosecution of a judicial proceeding\u201d <em>(Amylou R., </em>at p. 1211), acts committed in the course of the investigation are covered by \u00a7 821.6].)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Of course, particularly in light of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Barner, </em>we would be remiss to interpret the case law as supporting the proposition that all actions by social workers involve policy or prosecutorial decisions falling within the scope of statutory immunity. On this point, <em>Scott v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 125, 141 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 643] <em>(Scott), </em>is illustrative. There, the court held a social worker could be held liable for negligent supervision of a foster child where she failed to comply with regulations requiring her to make monthly home visits to the child. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 142.) In doing so, the court reaffirmed <em>Alicia T.\u2019s </em>holding that a social worker\u2019s decision to initiate dependency proceedings is a quasi-prosecutorial decision immunized by section 821.6. The court clarified, however, that the \u201cactual delivery of public social services, such as foster care, to abused, neglected or exploited children,\u201d are actions governed by specific statutory or regulatory directives \u201cwhich leave the officer no choice.\u201d (27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 143, 141.) As such, they would not be subject to immunity. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>Newton </em>is also helpful. There, the court held a county was immune from liability for conduct relating to its investigation of reported child abuse, including \u201c \u2018failing to properly, thoroughly and completely investigate the source and basis for the underlying [child abuse] complaint.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Newton, </em>217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Cal.App.3d at pp. 1561-1562 &amp; fn. 5, italics omitted.) Immunity did not extend, however, \u201cbeyond actions implied in the decision to investigate\u201d to \u201cgratuitous actions, unnecessary for a proper investigation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1560-1561.) The county was thus not immune for such gratuitous actions as causing the minors to disrobe and stand naked in the presence of strangers and failing to seek or receive voluntary consent to disrobe them. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1562 &amp; fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">With this case law in mind, we turn to the facts before us. Unlike in <em>Scott, </em>we are not concerned with the actual delivery of public social services to abused, neglected or exploited children. Rather, we are concerned with social workers\u2019 preliminary determinations regarding whether such services, including removal, were in fact necessary. Moreover, unlike in <em>Newton, </em>Jacqueline T. makes no claim that Employees engaged in \u201cgratuitous actions\u201d unnecessary for a proper investigation. Rather, the alleged acts and omissions of which Jacqueline T. complains\u2014including the failure to conduct a reasonable and diligent investigation and to timely cross-report to other agencies\u2014 were incidental to Employees\u2019 investigation, within the scope of their employment, of reports of possible abuse of Roes 1 and 2, and Employees\u2019 subsequent conclusion that such reports did not warrant initiation of dependency proceedings. <em>(Newton, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1561-1562 &amp; fn. 5 [\u201c \u2018failing to properly, thoroughly and completely investigate the source and basis for the underlying [child abuse] complaint\u2019 \u201d (italics omitted) were not gratuitous actions unnecessary for a proper investigation].) As such, we conclude as a matter of law that Employees\u2019 alleged acts and omissions are covered by the broad grant of immunity section 821.6 affords to \u201c[a public employee\u2019s] instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his [or her] employment\u201d (\u00a7 821.6), as well as the grant of immunity section 820.2 affords to sensitive policy decisions that result from a governmental entity\u2019s unique decisionmaking or planning process (\u00a7 820.2; <em>Barner, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 688).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Further, because we conclude Employees are immune from liability for their alleged acts and omissions under sections 820.2 and 821.6, we conclude County is likewise immune. \u201cThough sections 821.6 and 820.2 expressly immunize only the employee, if the employee is immune, so too is the County.

Section 815.6 \u2019provides; \u201cWhere a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.\u201d (See Stats. 1963, ch. 1681, \u00a7 1, pp. 3266, 3268.)  An enactment for purposes of section 815.6 may include both formal legislative measures, such as statutes, and quasi-legislative measures, such as regulations adopted by a state agency. <em>(Scott, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 134, 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">A public entity may <em>avoid </em>direct liability under section 815.6, as it may avoid derivative liability under section 815.2, by establishing that it has statutory immunity. Section 815, subdivision (b) provides: \u201c[t]he liability of a public entity established by this part (commencing with Section 814) is subject to any immunity of the public entity provided by statute, including this part, and is subject to any defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person.\u201d Further, as set forth above, section 815.2, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.\u201d (See Stats. 1963, ch. 1681, \u00a7 1, pp. 3266, 3268; see also <em>Kemmerer, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 1435 [\u201c[t]hough sections 821.6 and 820.2 expressly immunize only the employee, if the employee is immune, so too is the County\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Here, Jacqueline T. claims County may be held directly liable under section 815.6 for breach of mandatory duties imposed by the following enactments: (1) Penal Code section 11164 et seq.; (2) Penal Code section 11166, subdivisions (a), (f), and (i); (3) Penal Code section 11166.3; (4) Penal Code section 11165.7; (5) Penal Code section 11165.9; (6) Welfare and Institutions Code section 16501, subdivision (f); and (7) California Department of Social Services Manual of Policies and Procedures (DSS Manual) regulation 31-101.2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We consider each claim below.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>(1) <em>Penal Code former section 11164 et seq. (Stats. 1987, ch. 1444, \u00a7 1.5, p. 5369.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Jacqueline T. contends Penal Code former section 11164 et seq., also known as the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (CANRA), imposed a mandatory duty on County and Employees to investigate suspected child abuse. Moreover, Jacqueline T. contends County and Employees breached this mandatory duty, not by failing to investigate the alleged abuse, but rather by failing to \u201creasonably and diligently\u201d investigate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Former Penal Code section 11164 provided;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201c(a) This article shall be known and may be cited as the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201c(b) The intent and purpose of this article is to protect children from abuse. In any investigation of suspected child abuse, all persons participating in the investigation of the case shall consider the needs of the child victim and shall do whatever is necessary to prevent psychological harm to the child victim.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">As is clear from this language, the statute imposed no mandatory duty on County or Employees. Rather, the statute merely stated the Legislature\u2019s \u201cintent and purpose\u201d in enacting CANRA, an article composed of over 30 separate statutes. As such, former section 11164 provided no statutory basis for liability under section 815.6. <em>(Terrell R., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 639 [an enactment creates a mandatory duty for purposes of \u00a7 815.6 only if \u201cit requires a public agency to take a particular action. [Citation.] An enactment does not create a mandatory duty if it merely recites legislative goals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>policies that must be implemented through a public agency\u2019s exercise of discretion\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Moreover, to the extent Jacqueline T., in citing Penal Code former section 11164 generally, actually seeks to rely on unspecified sections of CANRA to establish liability, such attempt would likewise fail. The law is clear that, to prove a violation under section 815.6, a plaintiff must plead the existence of a specific statutory duty. \u201c \u2018 \u201cUnless the applicable enactment is alleged in specific terms, a court cannot determine whether the enactment relied upon was intended to impose an obligatory duty to take official action to prevent foreseeable injuries or whether it was merely advisory in character.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Terrell R., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">(2) <em>Penal Code section 11166, subdivisions (a), (f), and (i).

The relevant version of former section 11166, subdivision (f) permitted, but did not require, \u201c[a]ny other person who has knowledge of or observes a child whom he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been a victim of child abuse may report the known or suspected instance of child abuse to a child protective agency.\u201d And the relevant version of former section 11166, subdivision (i) required, with some exceptions, a county welfare department to \u201cimmediately, or as soon as practically possible\u201d cross-report to law enforcement and certain other agencies by telephone \u201cevery known or suspected instance of child abuse,\u201d and to submit a written report of the known or suspected abuse to such agencies \u201cwithin 36 hours\u201d of receiving the relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We conclude Jacqueline T.\u2019s reliance on these three provisions to prove violations of section 815.6 is misplaced. With respect to Penal Code former section 11166, subdivision (a), a mandatory duty was imposed on certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>mandated reporters, including child care custodians, of child abuse. Here, County and Employees were the alleged <em>receivers </em>of three reports of alleged child abuse from third parties rather than the reporters themselves. As such, they could not, as a matter of law, have breached a mandatory duty to report pursuant to this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">With respect to Penal Code former section 11166, subdivision (f), it simply imposed no mandatory duty. Rather, it permited, but did not require, certain voluntary reporters to submit reports of child abuse. As such, neither County nor Employees could, as a matter of law, have violated a mandatory duty pursuant to this provision. <em>(Terrell R., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 639 [\u201c \u2018application of [Government Code] section 815.6 requires that the enactment at issue be obligatory\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Finally, as set forth above, the relevant version of Penal Code former section 11166, subdivision (i) required a county welfare department to \u201cimmediately, or as soon as practically possible\u201d cross-report by telephone to certain public agencies \u201cevery known or suspected instance of child abuse,\u201d and to then submit certain written reports within 36 hours. Here, it is undisputed that Employees cross-reported to the Newark Police Department each of the three reports of alleged abuse it received. It is further undisputed that, following receipt of each of those cross-reports, the Newark Police Department determined based on the evidence that the abuse allegations were unsubstantiated. As such, even assuming County or Employees breached a mandatory duty to <em>timely </em>cross-report under former subdivision (i), Jacqueline T. could not, as a matter of law, establish that such breach was a proximate cause of Minors\u2019 alleged injuries, which section 815.6 requires.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Wilson v.

Code, former \u00a7 11166.3, subd. (a), italics added.) Here, undisputedly, no petition to initiate dependency proceedings had been filed pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 300 when County\u2019s alleged breach of this duty occurred. As such, Penal Code section 11166.3 provided no basis for liability under section 815.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(4) <em>Penal Code section 11165.7.

(Stats. 1987, ch. 1459, \u00a7 16, p. 5521.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Jacqueline T. contends County and Employees breached a mandatory duty under Penal Code section 11165.9 to accept reports of suspected child abuse from mandated, voluntary and anonymous reporters. As Jacqueline T. concedes, however, a different version of this statute\u2014one that merely set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the statutory definition of \u201cchild protective agency\u201d and did not purport to impose any duty\u2014was in effect when the alleged child abuse was occurring between 1998 and 2000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, even assuming County or Employees were subject at the relevant time to a mandatory statutory duty to accept reports of abuse, Jacqueline T. neglects to inform us how or when they breached such duty. The undisputed evidence proved County received three reports of possible child abuse of Roes 1 and 2\u2014Yee received one report from Minors\u2019 therapist, and Richards received two reports from Minors\u2019 great-grandmother. While Jacqueline T. complains County and Employees failed to adequately respond to these reports, she does not contend County or Employees refused to accept them. Given this, we conclude Jacqueline T. cannot as a matter of law prove any breach of a mandatory duty to accept reports of abuse.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u201c(a) As used in this article, \u2018child care custodian\u2019 means a teacher; an instructional aide, a teacher\u2019s aide, or a teacher\u2019s assistant employed by any public or private school, who has been trained in the duties imposed by this article, if the school district has so warranted to the State Department of Education; a classified employee of any public school who has been trained in the duties imposed by this article, if the school has so warranted to the State Department of Education; an administrative officer, supervisor of child welfare and attendance, or certificated pupil personnel employee of any public or private school; an administrator of a public or private day camp; an administrator or employee of a public or private youth center, youth recreation program, or youth organization; an administrator or employee of a public or private organization whose duties require direct contact and supervision of children; a licensee, an administrator, or an employee of a licensed community care or child day care facility; a headstart teacher; a licensing worker or licensing evaluator; a public assistance worker; an employee of a child care institution including, but not limited to, foster parents, group home personnel, and personnel of residential care facilities; a social worker, probation officer, or parole officer; an employee of a school district police or security department; any person who is an administrator or presenter of, or a counselor in, a child abuse prevention program in any public or private school; a district attorney investigator, inspector, or family support officer unless the investigator, inspector, or officer is working with an attorney appointed pursuant to Section 317 of the Welfare and Institutions Code to represent a minor; or a peace officer, as defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of this code, who is not otherwise described in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">\u201c(b) Training in the duties imposed by this article shall include training in child abuse identification and training in child abuse reporting.

As such, County\u2019s or Employees\u2019 determination that no imminent danger existed is protected by the broad grant of immunity sections 820.2 and 821.6 afford county welfare departments and their officials in investigating alleged acts of child abuse and thereafter deciding whether to instigate dependency proceedings. <em>{Newton, supra, </em>at p. 1560 [concluding that county welfare department officials were immune from liability for their determination regarding whether an \u201cemergency situation!]\u201d existed that would trigger a mandatory duty to conduct an immediate in-person response pursuant to Welf. &amp; Inst.

Nowhere does the statute define \u201crespond\u201d or mandate a particular response. And here, County officials undisputedly responded to each report of alleged abuse of Roes 1 and 2 by promptly generating screener narratives and then referring the matters to social workers for investigation, well within 10 days of receiving the reports. To the extent Jacqueline T. contends these responses were inadequate, County\u2019s and Employees\u2019 decisions in this regard were again discretionary, and thus immunized under sections 820.2 and 821.6 for the reasons discussed.

(See <em>Scott, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 141.) However, even if County could be held liable for failing to obey this order, the record reveals no facts, disputed or otherwise, tending to prove a failure occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In particular, Jacqueline T. has failed to set forth any evidence that identifies what it means to be \u201cskilled in emergency response.\u201d Further, the evidence Jacqueline T. has identified does not tend to prove that County utilized social workers <em>unskilled </em>in emergency response when responding to referrals with respect to the alleged abuse of Roes 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Jacqueline T. points us to nothing in the record tending to reveal a failure of skills or training with respect to Yee, and the undisputed evidence suggests otherwise. At the time of his investigation into the alleged abuse, Yee had been a social worker for 21 years, and had received extensive ongoing training in child abuse investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">With respect to Richards, Jacqueline T. points only to select portions of her deposition testimony where she admits to not being \u201caware of all the details of what [the DSS] manual says,\u201d to not knowing what the \u201c[DSS] manual states\u201d with respect to the significance to be given during an investigation (rather than during a referral) to a parent\u2019s history of substance abuse or criminal behavior, to receiving \u201cmore extensive training in Division 31 regulations . . . after [her] investigation\u201d in this case, and to not \u201chav[ing] [the department\u2019s protocols] memorized.\u201d Such evidence, however, without more, would not permit a reasonable person to conclude she was unskilled in emergency response. Rather, suggesting the contrary, undisputed evidence shows Richards held a degree in psychology and an advanced degree in social work, was assigned to County\u2019s emergency response unit in 1998, over a year before she began investigating the alleged abuse of Roes 1 and 2, and began receiving ongoing professional training in child abuse investigation at the time of her hiring in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Based on this record, we conclude that, even viewing the evidence in a light favorable to Jacqueline T., as the law requires, no reasonable person could here find a breach of this duty.

Given her concession, we do not address these enactments here. .</p>\n<p id=\"A7L\">Finally, Jacqueline T. concedes she relied on several DSS Manual regulations in her opening brief that \u201care substantially similar to and cumulative of other code sections that have been cited by plaintiffs, and [that] are also similar and mostly cumulative as between themselves,\u201d including regulations 31-110.3, 31-115, 31-120, 31-125.22 and 31-125.2. Again, given her concession, we do not address these cumulative regulations here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\"> Penal Code section 11164 was amended effective January 1, 2001.

References here to Penal Code section 11164 are to the statute as it read prior to amendment, when the alleged child abuse occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> Jacqueline T. acknowledges the language in Penal Code section 11166, subdivision (j) and subdivision (g), upon which she relies on appeal, is part of the current version of the statute rather than the version in effect when the alleged breach occurred. Jacqueline T. explains, however, that the language in subdivision (j) is nearly identical to that found in subdivision (i) of the prior version of the statute, and that the language in subdivision (g) is nearly identical to that found in subdivision (f) of the prior version of the statute, both of which were in effect at the relevant time and were relied upon below. We find Jacqueline T.\u2019s reliance at various times on different versions of the same statute both confusing and frustrating. Nonetheless, rather than find waiver, which we are no doubt entitled to do, we give Jacqueline T. the benefit of the doubt and address the merits of her argument based on the version of section 11166 in effect during the relevant time period\u2014from 1998 to 2000\u2014which provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzA\">\u201c(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), any child care custodian, health practitioner, employee of a child protective agency, child visitation monitor, firefighter, animal control officer, or humane society officer who has knowledge of or observes a child, in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment, whom he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse, shall report the known or suspected instance of child abuse to a child protective agency immediately or as soon as practically possible by telephone and shall prepare and send a written report thereof within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident.
