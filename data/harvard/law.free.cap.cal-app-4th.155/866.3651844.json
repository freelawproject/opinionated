J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af3\">Ruling on an unfair labor practice charge brought by the California Faculty Association (CFA), the Public Employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Relations Board (PERB) concluded that Government Code section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), and Education Code section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), preclude the Board of Trustees of the California State University (the University) from insisting that a memorandum of understanding contain limits on the authority of an arbitrator to overturn a campus president\u2019s decision on faculty appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion. Because during negotiations on a new memorandum of understanding the University had insisted to impasse upon a proposal containing such restrictions, PERB found that the University had engaged in an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On this petition for review by the University (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3542, 3564; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.498), we hold that PERB\u2019s interpretation of the statutes is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d (See <em>Cumero v. Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 575, 586-587 [262 Cal.Rptr. 46, 778 P.2d 174] <em>(Cumero).) </em>Neither the plain language of the statutes, nor the relevant legislative history, supports PERB\u2019s interpretation. To the contrary, the statutes impose no prohibition against limiting the powers of an arbitrator hearing a faculty grievance to reverse a campus president\u2019s decision on appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion. We therefore issue a writ of mandate ordering PERB to reverse its decision sustaining CFA\u2019s allegation of unfair labor practice, and to enter a new decision denying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\n<em>Education Code Section 89542.5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Effective 1976, the Legislature enacted Education Code former section 24315, which was later renumbered section 89542.5. (Stats. 1975, ch. 912, \u00a7 1, pp. 2015-2016; Stats. 1976, ch. 1010, \u00a7 2, pp. 2384, 4470-4471.) Throughout our opinion, we refer to the statute by the latter number, section 89542.5, without code designation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">In terms substantively unchanged since its enactment in 1976, section 89542.5 requires the University to \u201cestablish grievance and disciplinary action procedures\u201d for academic employees. (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a).) Among these is that \u201c[grievances . . . shall be heard by a faculty hearing committee . . . which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>shall make a recommendation to the president of the state university\u201d (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(1)), and that \u201c[i]f there is disagreement between the faculty hearing committee\u2019s decision and the state university president\u2019s decision, the matter shall go before an arbitrator whose decision shall be final\u201d (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(4)). The term \u201cgrievance\u201d was defined in relevant part as \u201can allegation by an employee that he was directly wronged in connection with the rights accruing to his . . . appointment, reappointment, tenure, promotion, reassignment, or the like.\u201d (Stats. 1975, ch. 912, \u00a7 1, pp. 2015, 2016; see now \u00a7 89542.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>\n<em>Executive Order No. 201</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Before passage of section 89542.5, University grievance procedures were governed by \u201cExecutive Order No. 201,\u201d which the University adopted in 1974. That order, for the first time, introduced arbitration as a step in a multitiered grievance procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The arbitrator\u2019s power of review, however, was deferential to the president\u2019s decision, and substantive limits were placed on the ability of the arbitrator to overrule the president. Thus, the arbitrator\u2019s scope of review was limited to whether the president\u2019s rejection of the faculty grievance committee\u2019s recommendation was arbitrary, whether a substantially unfair departure from prescribed procedures had occurred that affected the president\u2019s decision, or whether the president ignored substantial evidence favorable to the grievant.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">As we explain in more detail below, the Legislature was well aware of Executive Order No. 201 when it enacted section 89542.5. Indeed, the definition of \u201cgrievance\u201d in section 89542.5, subdivision (b), was drawn from Executive Order No. 201. Further, the requirement of section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), that the arbitrator\u2019s \u201cdecision shall be final\u201d echoed the language of Executive Order No. 201, which provided that the \u201carbitrator\u2019s decision . . . shall be final and binding upon the campus and the grievant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\n<em>Executive Orders Nos. 240 and 301</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In 1976, following the passage of section 89542.5, the University enacted \u201cExecutive Order No. 240,\u201d and later followed it in 1978 with \u201cExecutive Order No. 301.\u201d The grievance procedures under both orders were substantially the same and contained limits on the authority of the arbitrator to set aside the campus president\u2019s decision when it disagreed with the recommendation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>the faculty grievance committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consistent with section 89542.5, Executive Orders Nos. 240 and 301 provided that the arbitrator\u2019s decision, \u201cinsofar as consonant with\u201d the law and University rules and policies, \u201cshall be final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\n<em>Enactment of HEERA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Effective July 1, 1979, the Legislature enacted the Higher Education Employer Employee Relations Act (HEERA), contained in Government Code section 3560 et seq. Among other things, HEERA granted the right of collective bargaining to University employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">As enacted, HEERA provided in Government Code section 3572.5, subdivision (a), that if the provisions of section 89542.5 \u201care in conflict with a memorandum of understanding, the memorandum of understanding shall be controlling.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, grievance procedures negotiated in a memorandum of understanding would supersede the procedures of section 89542.5, and the University and CFA were free to, and did, negotiate over such terms in reaching their first memorandum of understanding under HEERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">\n<em>The First Memorandum of Understanding Under HEERA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">In 1983, the University and CFA reached a first memorandum of understanding under HEERA procedures. This and all successive agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>contained the option of arbitration to resolve a faculty member\u2019s grievance concerning the campus president\u2019s decision on appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion. However, the agreements substantially restricted the authority of the arbitrator to set aside the campus president\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\n<em>The 1998-2001 Memorandum of Understanding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In 1999, CEA and the University agreed to a memorandum of understanding retroactive to 1998 and extending to June 30, 2001. Before obtaining an agreement, however, the parties reached impasse in their negotiations. Because no memorandum of understanding was then in effect, the grievance procedures of section 89542.5 became effective during the impasse. The University implemented Executive Order No. 702, which contained interim grievance procedures similar to those prescribed by the prior agreements, but with certain changes to comport with section 89542.5, such as the inclusion of a faculty hearing committee, required by the statute but missing from prior agreements. Executive Order No. 702 was in effect for approximately three months until the parties agreed on the 1998-2001 memorandum of understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">\n<em>Enactment of Senate Bill No. 1212\u2014Government Code Section 3572.5, Subdivision (b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The 1998-2001 memorandum of understanding expired on June 30, 2001. During negotiations on a successor agreement, the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed Senate Bill No. 1212 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.), sponsored by CEA and opposed by the University. The bill added subdivision (b) to Government Code section 3572.5, effective October 12, 2001 (hereafter section 3572.5, subdivision (b)). Section 3572.5, subdivision (b), provides that for any memorandum of understanding reached after January 1, 2002, Education Code section 89542.5 \u201cprovides a minimum level of benefits or rights, and is superseded by a memorandum of understanding only if the relevant terms of the memorandum of understanding provide more than the minimum level of benefits or rights set forth in that section . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>\n<em>Negotiations over a Successor Memorandum of Understanding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In negotiations over an agreement to succeed the 1998-2001 memorandum of understanding, CFA and the University disagreed on the effect of section 3572.5, subdivision (b). CFA argued that section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), confers unlimited power on an arbitrator to render a \u201cfinal\u201d decision reversing a campus president\u2019s decision in grievance proceedings involving appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion. Further, according to CFA, section 3572.5, subdivision (b), precludes placing any limits on that power through a memorandum of understanding. The University, on the other hand, argued that the statutes do not prohibit the parties from limiting the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority through collective bargaining. The University insisted that any new grievance procedure must maintain the existing contractual limits on the arbitrator\u2019s authority to set aside campus decisions on faculty grievances concerning appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion. Those limits were: (1) a campus president\u2019s decision could be overturned for procedural error only if the error was proved by clear and convincing evidence and was prejudicial; (2) the \u201cnormal remedy\u201d for such procedural error was a remand for reevaluation, with the arbitrator having authority to retain jurisdiction; and (3) the arbitrator could not grant appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion except in extreme cases where the campus decision was not based on reasoned judgment, where it was certain that appointment, reappointment, promotion, or tenure would have been granted but for the error, and where no other alternative was practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">\n<em>PERB Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">CFA filed with PERB a request for a determination that an impasse existed. PERB declared an impasse, and the parties participated in statutory impasse proceedings (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3590), but were unable to resolve their differences regarding the arbitration issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">CFA filed an unfair labor practice charge against the University. PERB concluded that by insisting to impasse upon a proposal that would preserve existing contractual limits on the authority of an arbitrator to decide grievances regarding appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion, the University violated its duty to bargain in good faith. PERB reasoned, in substance, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>section 3572.5, subdivision (b), guarantees a minimum right to an arbitration that will result in a \u201cfinal\u201d decision as provided in section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), and that limiting the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s power in the manner of prior agreements would dilute that right. PERB relied primarily on the language of the statutes, and on the legislative history of section 3572.5, subdivision (b). PERB rejected the University\u2019s contention that the legislative history of section 89542.5 was more relevant than that of section 3572.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The University petitioned for review. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3542, 3564; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.498.) We granted review, and now reverse PERB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The University contends that neither the plain meaning of the statutory language, nor the relevant legislative history, supports PERB\u2019s statutory interpretation. CEA and PERB disagree, echoing the reasoning of PERB\u2019s decision. We conclude that the University is correct. The plain meaning of the statutory language does not prohibit a memorandum of understanding from defining the powers of the arbitrator to review a campus president\u2019s decision on appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion. Moreover, consideration of the relevant legislative history\u2014that of section 89542.5, not that of section 3572.5, subdivision (b)\u2014leads to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">\n<em>Plain Meaning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Statutory interpretation begins with the plain meaning of the language used. When construing a statute, we must \u201c \u2018 \u201cascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] We begin by examining the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning. [Citation.] \u2018The words, however, must be read in context, considering the nature and purpose of the statutory enactment.\u2019 [Citation.] In this regard, sentences are not to be viewed in isolation but in light of the statutory scheme. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Torres </em>v. <em>Automobile Club of So. California </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 771, 777 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 937 P.2d 290].)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">PERB\u2019s interpretation of a statute within its area of expertise \u201c \u2018is to be regarded with deference by a court performing the judicial function of statutory construction, and will generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018It is, however, \u201cthe duty of this court, when ... a question of law is properly presented, to state the true meaning of the statute . . . even though this requires the overthrow of an earlier administrative construction.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cumero, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 586-587.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>In the instant case, the plain meaning of Government Code section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), and Education Code section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), does not support PERB\u2019s interpretation. According to PERB, the plain meaning of these statutes \u201cis that an employee, at minimum, has the right to a final decision by an arbitrator on the merits of the particular grievance. [\u00b6] Presumably, the Legislature was fully aware of the grievance procedures in the various MOUs and executive orders when it passed [Senate Bill No.] 1212. If the Legislature intended to incorporate specific aspects of these grievance procedures as part of the statutory floor, it could have done so. Instead, the Legislature in [Senate Bill No.] 1212 established a statutory minimum right to a final decision by an arbitrator (unless a greater benefit is negotiated) and it must be presumed that the Legislature intended as much. A proposal to limit the arbitrator\u2019s authority would create a lesser, not a greater, benefit or right than the right to a final decision by an arbitrator. To conclude otherwise would reduce the adoption of the minimum rights concept in [Senate Bill No.] 1212 to an idle act, changing nothing in the area of grievance and arbitration rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">This analysis is fatally flawed. Government Code section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), provides in relevant part that Education Code section 89542.5 establishes \u201ca minimum level of benefits or rights, and is superseded by a memorandum of understanding only if the relevant terms of the memorandum of understanding provide more than the minimum level of benefits or rights set forth in that section.\u201d By its plain meaning, this language simply establishes the \u201cbenefits or rights\u201d of section 89542.5 as a \u201cminimum level,\u201d and makes the terms of a memorandum of understanding ineffective to the extent they provide lesser \u201cbenefits or rights.\u201d This language does not declare what these minimum benefits or rights are.  Indeed, because \u201c[t]he words of a statute are to be interpreted in the sense in which they would have been understood at the time of the enactment\u201d <em>(People v. Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 775 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731]), it would be anomalous if the 2001 enactment of section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), purported to define the terms of section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), enacted 25 years earlier in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Even if Government Code section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), were relevant to discern the meaning of Education Code section 89542.5, PERB\u2019s reasoning would nonetheless be flawed. PERB concluded that the Legislature was aware of the grievance proceedings of prior executive orders and memoranda of understanding. Because the Legislature did not incorporate those procedures into section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), PERB inferred that the Legislature intended to preclude them. PERB\u2019s inference, however, is contrary to settled standards of statutory construction. When the Legislature is aware of prior practice, but fails to change it in a later statutory enactment, courts infer <em>not </em>that the enactment expresses legislative disapproval, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>rather that it expresses legislative acquiescence\u2014an acknowledgment that the practice is <em>consistent </em>with legislative intent. <em>(Elk County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1, 10 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 536]; <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 375, 382 [116 Cal.Rptr. 113].) Thus, the Legislature\u2019s failure to mention prior grievance procedures in section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), to the extent it is relevant at all, suggests implied approval of those procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">According to PERB, the conclusion that the parties may restrict the power of the arbitrator \u201cwould reduce the adoption of the minimum rights [in section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1)] to an idle act\u201d because it would change \u201cnothing in the area of grievance and arbitration rights.\u201d PERB is incorrect. Before Government Code section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), the University had the power to negotiate away the core grievance procedures of Education Code section 89542.5. Those procedures include the right of \u201call academic employees, including all temporary employees who have been employed for more than one semester or quarter\u201d to the following: a public hearing before a faculty hearing committee (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(1), (2)); the right to representation and to a complete record of the hearing (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(3)); the right to arbitration of any disagreement between the decision of the faculty committee and the decision of the campus president (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(4)); the right to have the University bear the costs of arbitration (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(5)); and the right to a procedure for selection of a neutral arbitrator (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The \u201cchange\u201d worked by section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1), was to deprive the University of the ability to eliminate these rights through collective bargaining. That change certainly was not an \u201cidle act.\u201d And in any event, it is an act that says nothing about the scope of the rights enshrined in section 89542.5\u2014an inquiry that depends on the language of <em>that </em>section.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Section 89542.5 requires the University to \u201cestablish grievance and disciplinary action procedures\u201d for academic employees that include certain listed requirements. Among these, as we have noted, is the requirement that grievances \u201cshall be heard by a faculty hearing committee . . . which shall make a recommendation to the president of the state university\u201d (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(1)), and that \u201c[i]f there is disagreement between the faculty hearing committee\u2019s decision and the state university president\u2019s decision, <em>the matter shall go before an arbitrator whose decision shall be final.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(4), italics added.) The requirement that a dispute be submitted to an arbitrator for a \u201cfinal\u201d decision does not preclude limits on the scope of review leading to the decision, or on the remedies that may be implemented by the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Historically in California, the concept of a final arbitral decision means that the arbitrator\u2019s resolution of a claim will be binding on the parties, and will settle the dispute presented without judicial intervention, save for the limited judicial review provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 1280 et seq. (See <em>Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9-10 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899] [agreement to arbitrate presumes that the arbitration award will be conclusive as to the parties, with minimal judicial intervention] (Moncharsh); <em>Cheng-Canindin v. Renaissance Hotel Associates </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 676, 687 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 867] [to constitute an arbitration, a proceeding must require, inter alia, a \u201cfinal and binding decision\u201d]; <em>Trollope </em>v. <em>Jeffries </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 816, 822-823 [128 Cal.Rptr. 115] [arbitral decision entitled to res judicata effect because it is conclusive as to parties\u2019 rights in the dispute they have presented to the arbitrator, subject to limited power of the court to confirm, correct, or vacate]; see also <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Crum </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 749, 759-760 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 27] [same]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1283.4 [arbitrators\u2019 award \u201cshall include a determination of all the questions submitted to the arbitrators the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy\u201d].) Although in this sense an arbitrator\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal,\u201d the parties are free to negotiate contract terms that define the arbitrator\u2019s powers and limit the available remedies. <em>(Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, 344 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 965 P.2d 1178]; see also <em>Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 8.) Nothing in the language of section 89542.5 suggests that by providing for a \u201cfinal\u201d decision by an arbitrator, the Legislature meant to depart from the common understanding of arbitral finality, and meant to refer only to a decision reached after unfettered review by the arbitrator. PERB\u2019s assumption that a final arbitral decision requires unlimited review and unlimited remedies is simply unsupported by the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The plain meaning of the statutory language is unambiguous as applied to the instant case, and controls the result. (See <em>J.A. Jones Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1575 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 206].) The present dispute arose because the University proposes to define the powers of the arbitrator to review a campus president\u2019s decision on matters of faculty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>appointment, reappointment, promotion or tenure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The proposed limits (1) would permit the arbitrator to overturn the decision for procedural error only if the error was proved by clear and convincing evidence and was prejudicial; (2) would provide that the \u201cnormal remedy\u201d for such procedural error is a remand for reevaluation, with the arbitrator having authority to retain jurisdiction; and (3) would restrict the arbitrator\u2019s power to grant appointment, reappointment, promotion or tenure to only extreme cases where the campus decision was not based on reasoned judgment, where it was certain that appointment, reappointment, promotion, or tenure would have been granted but for the error, and where no other alternative is practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">None of these proposed limits affects the finality of the arbitrator\u2019s decision within the meaning of section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4)\u2014the arbitrator\u2019s decision would be binding on the parties, would settle the dispute presented, and would be reached without judicial intervention save limited judicial review. Hence none of these provisions, if incorporated into a memorandum of understanding, would provide a lesser level of rights or benefits than those of section 89542.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">CEA asserts that by limiting the normal remedy for procedural error to a remand for reconsideration, the University\u2019s proposal would not ensure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>\u201cdecision [by the arbitrator] shall be <em>final.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(4), italics added.) According to CFA, a remand would require further proceedings, and possibly renewed arbitration. Perhaps so, but that does not violate the requirement of a final arbitral decision. As here relevant, a \u201c \u2018grievance\u2019 is an allegation by an employee that the employee was directly wronged in connection with the rights accruing to his or her . . . appointment, reappointment, tenure, promotion, reassignment, or the like.\u201d (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (b).) If the allegation were that the employee was directly wronged by a procedural error that led to the president\u2019s disagreement with the faculty committee\u2019s recommendation, an arbitral resolution finding procedural error but remanding for error-free reconsideration is a binding resolution of the particular claim made. It is thus \u201cfinal\u201d as the term is generally understood in the arbitration context. Moreover, that an additional arbitration proceeding may occur does not mean that no \u201cfinal\u201d arbitral decision will be reached consistent with section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4). The \u201cprinciple of arbitral finality . . . does not preclude the arbitrator from making a <em>final </em>disposition of a submitted matter in more than one award.\u201d <em>(Hightower v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1415, 1433 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">CFA erroneously contends that the University\u2019s proposal would permit review only of procedural errors, not the substance of the president\u2019s decision. Thus, according to CFA, the proposal fails to meet the mandate of section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), that \u201cthe matter\u201d\u2014in CFA\u2019s view, meaning the procedure <em>and </em>the merits of the president\u2019s decision\u2014be submitted to arbitration. However, the University\u2019s proposal contemplates review of both procedure and substance. Under the University\u2019s proposal, the arbitrator\u2019s award must be \u201cbased solely upon the evidence and arguments appropriately presented by the parties in the hearing and upon any post-hearing briefs.\u201d (See fn. 7, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Besides the provision governing procedural error, the proposal states that the arbitrator may grant appointment, reappointment, promotion or tenure, when (1) the president\u2019s decision \u201cwas not based on reasoned judgment\u201d; (2) \u201cbut for that [failure of reasoned judgment], it can be stated with certainty that appointment, reappointment, promotion, or tenure would have been granted\u201d; and (3) \u201cno other alternative except that remedy has been demonstrated by the evidence as a practicable remedy available to resolve the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">By requiring that the arbitrator\u2019s decision be based on the evidence and arguments, and by permitting the arbitrator to determine whether the president\u2019s decision was supported by \u201creasoned judgment,\u201d the University\u2019s proposal necessarily contemplates that the arbitrator would be empowered to examine the substance of the president\u2019s decision, albeit under a deferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>standard of review. Further, if the arbitrator concluded that the president\u2019s judgment was not reasoned, the arbitrator would be able to set aside the president\u2019s decision under the limited conditions specified\u2014certainty that appointment, reappointment, tenure, or promotion would otherwise have been granted; and the impracticability of any other remedy. Thus, CFA is incorrect in asserting that the University\u2019s proposal would prevent the arbitrator from examining the merits of the president\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In short, we find nothing in the plain meaning of the statutory language to support PERB\u2019s decision. On that basis alone, PERB\u2019s statutory interpretation is clearly erroneous. Nonetheless, because PERB reached the issue, we also consider the relevant legislative history. That, too, fails to support PERB\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">PERB looked exclusively to the legislative history of Senate Bill No. 1212 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.), which as enacted became section 3572.5, subdivision (b)(1). PERB concluded that \u201c[tjhe dominant thread that runs throughout the legislative history is that SB 1212 was intended to establish that the law relative to grievance and disciplinary actions was a statutory \u2018floor,\u2019 and that these rights (in particular, Education Code section 89542.5, which mandates that the arbitrator\u2019s decision \u2018shall be final\u2019) \u2018cannot be eliminated or reduced through collective bargaining.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Although PERB accurately describes the legislative history of Senate Bill No. 1212 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.), that history has nothing to do with defining the rights set forth in section 89542.5. In passing Senate Bill No. 1212, the Legislature did not purport to characterize the meaning of a \u201cfinal\u201d arbitral decision (\u00a7 89542.5, subd. (a)(4)). Even if it had, the validity of such a retroactive characterization would be questionable at best. (See <em>Peralta Community College Dist. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 40, 52 [276 Cal.Rptr. 114, 801 P.2d 357] [\u201cThe declaration of a later Legislature is of little weight in determining the relevant intent of the Legislature that enacted the law\u201d].) In short, the legislative history of Senate Bill No. 1212 shows that the Legislature intended to establish the grievance procedures of section 89542.5 as minimum rights\u2014but it shows nothing more. If legislative history must be examined to determine the meaning of a \u201cfinal\u201d arbitral decision, it is the history of section 89542.5 that is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>When section 89542.5 was under consideration as Assembly Bill No. 804 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) in 1975, the Legislature was aware of the University\u2019s Executive Order No. No. 201, which provided for final and binding arbitration, but which also set forth substantial limits to the arbitrator\u2019s authority. Throughout the legislative history there are references to Executive Order No. 201 and existing grievance procedures. For instance, Assembly Bill No. 804 was first referred to the Assembly Committee on Public Employees and Retirement, whose report on the bill referred to the arbitration procedures of Executive Order No. 201, and stated that Assembly Bill No. 804 established an alternative procedure to current law. The Senate Committee on Education reported that in June 1974 the University \u201cissued Executive Order No. 201, a comprehensive grievance policy for academic employees. The procedure has substantial similarities to that proposed in this measure.\u201d The education committee included a copy of Executive Order No. 201 with its report.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The Legislative Analyst\u2019s report on Assembly Bill No. 804 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) described the differences between \u201ccurrent grievance procedures\u201d (i.e., Executive Order No. 201) and those of Assembly Bill No. 804. The listed differences were that the bill included part-time and temporary employees, deleted a grievance committee\u2019s authority to screen out grievances, provided access to a tape recording of the hearing, and ensured a right to representation. The differences did <em>not </em>include any reference to the meaning of a \u201cfinal\u201d arbitral decision, thus suggesting that nothing in the procedure of Executive Order No. 201, including limits on the power of the arbitrator, was inconsistent with Assembly Bill No. 804. Moreover, an amended version of the bill adopted verbatim certain provisions in Executive Order No. 201, including the definition of the word \u201cgrievance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Thus, the clear inference from the legislative history of Assembly Bill No. 804 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) is that by providing for a \u201cfinal\u201d arbitral decision in section 89542.5, subdivision (a)(4), the Legislature did not intend to provide for unlimited arbitral review. To the contrary, the Legislature knew of the restrictions on arbitral review contained in Executive Order No. 201, and found nothing in them inconsistent with Assembly Bill No. 804. Like the plain meaning of the statutory language, the relevant legislative history leaves no doubt that PERB\u2019s statutory interpretation is incorrect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing PERB to vacate its decision sustaining CFA\u2019s unfair labor practice charge, and to enter a new and different order denying that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Manella, L, and Suzukawa, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 12, 2007, S157954.

The committee\u2019s recommendation was binding on the campus president, unless unsupported by the findings of the hearing officer (if any), or unless the president concluded that compelling reasons existed for a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">If the president\u2019s decision differed from the committee\u2019s recommendation, the grievant could request arbitration. The arbitrator would consider only the prior administrative record. Findings by a hearing officer, if any, were binding. The arbitrator had the authority to decide only whether the president\u2019s rejection of the committee\u2019s recommendation was arbitrary, whether a substantially unfair departure from prescribed procedures had occurred that affected the president\u2019s decision, or whether the president ignored substantial evidence favorable to the grievant. If one or more of these grounds existed, the arbitrator would decide if the president\u2019s decision should be upheld, or the committee\u2019s recommendation should be followed, or the matter should be remanded for review absent the defect determined to exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\"> Under both Executive Orders Nos. 240 and 301, a three-person faculty grievance committee would hold an evidentiary hearing on the grievance, and prepare a report stating the committee\u2019s findings and recommendation.

On the prior record, without a hearing, the arbitrator would decide if the president\u2019s disagreement was justified. The grounds on which the disagreement might be justified were the same grounds on which the committee\u2019s recommendation was not binding on the president: (1) the committee\u2019s findings were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) the recommendation was not supported by the findings; (3) the committee departed from prescribed procedures; or (4) the recommendation was beyond the president\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">If the arbitrator determined that the president\u2019s disagreement was justified, the arbitrator was required to adopt the president\u2019s decision.
