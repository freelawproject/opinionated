Fifth (Section 24 (Fifth)).) Courts have long recognized that the power conferred by Section 24 (Fifth) on national banks to dismiss its officers \u201cat pleasure\u201d is protected by the doctrine of preemption from all state law claims filed by their former officers for breach of an employment agreement. (See, e.g., <em>Mackey v. Pioneer Nat. Bank </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 867 F.2d 520, 524\u2014536.) Courts have also acknowledged the doctrine of preemption protects national banks that dismiss their officers under Section 24 (Fifth) from state law discrimination claims filed by their former officers, although in this regard, courts have differed on whether such preemption is total or partial. (Compare <em>Aalgaard v. Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 674, 695 [274 Cal.Rptr. 81] [claims under state age discrimination statute totally preempted by Section 24 (Fifth)] with <em>Marques v. Bank of America </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 356, 363-364 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 154] [state antidiscrimination claims under FEHA (California Fair Employment and Housing Act; Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900) preempted only to the extent they conflict with federal antidiscrimination laws].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">In this case, the trial court decided the state law discrimination claims filed by plaintiff and appellant Padmanabhan Ramanathan (Ramanathan) against defendant and respondent Bank of America (the Bank) were fully preempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>by Section 24 (Fifth) because Ramanathan was an officer of the Bank. On that basis, the trial court awarded summary judgment in favor of the Bank and dismissed Ramanathan\u2019s complaint. Ramanathan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In our view, the key issue on appeal is whether Ramanathan was an \u201cofficer\u201d of the Bank under Section 24 (Fifth). If he was not an \u201cofficer\u201d of the Bank under Section 24 (Fifth), then his state law discrimination claims are not preempted. If he was an \u201cofficer\u201d of the Bank under Section 24 (Fifth), then his state law discrimination claims are preempted, either totally or partially, under the NBA. The Bank\u2019s position, adopted by the trial court below, is that because its board of directors duly appointed Ramanathan as a vice-president and duly ratified his dismissal after the fact, then Ramanathan falls automatically within the provisions of Section 24 (Fifth) and all his state law discrimination claims are preempted. In essence, the Bank asserts it may invoke Section 24 (Fifth) and shield itself against state law discrimination claims so long as its board of directors appoints an employee to the status of a vice-president and ratifies that employee\u2019s subsequent dismissal, whatever may be the substantive nature of the duties and responsibilities of the employee under the appointed status of a \u201cvice-president.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">For reasons more fully explained below, we reject the Bank\u2019s interpretation of Section 24 (Fifth). Rather, we hold that where an employee asserts his or her position as \u201cvice-president\u201d is not vested with any of the duties or responsibilities normally associated with such a position\u2014as Ramanathan did here\u2014then to obtain summary judgment on preemption grounds under Section 24 (Fifth) the Bank must show the employee is \u201can officer\u201d of the bank pursuant to the criteria set forth in <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1082 [282 Cal.Rptr. 841, 811 P.2d 1025] <em>(Wells Fargo). </em>Because the Bank failed to prove Ramanathan was \u201can officer\u201d of the bank under <em>Wells </em>Fargo, it was not entitled to summary judgment on grounds of preemption under Section 24 (Fifth). Accordingly, we reverse the summary judgment awarded in favor of the Bank and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Ramanathan filed his complaint against the Bank on October 30, 2003, alleging, among other things, wrongful discharge in violation of public policy and discrimination on various grounds. In the complaint, Ramanathan states he is an observant Hindu and his race is Asian. Also, Ramanathan states he worked for the Bank as a consultant in computer programming from June 2001 until his employment was terminated on February 14, 2003. He alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>he was hired by two of the Bank\u2019s senior vice-presidents, Graham Seel and Allen Pampe, and that he was one of eight programming consultants working under a vice-president of the Bank, defendant Todd Atwood, who in turn was supervised by a senior vice-president of the Bank, defendant Anthony Calderone. Ramanathan also alleged his supervisors harassed and discriminated against him because of his race, religion and national origin, and asserts the bank terminated him in retaliation for complaining about these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Ramanathan alleged nine causes of action in his complaint. The first six alleged racial, religious and national origin discrimination in violation of California\u2019s Constitution, article I, section 8 and Government Code section 12940, subdivision (a) (California Fair Employment and Housing Act or FEHA). The seventh cause of action alleged retaliation in violation of FEHA; the eighth, wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, as expressed by FEHA; and the ninth stated a common law tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Bank filed its answer to the complaint on December 22, 2003. The Bank pleaded a general denial and asserted various affirmative defenses, including one that all Ramanathan\u2019s causes of action were preempted under Section 24 (Fifth) of the NBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The Bank filed its motion for summary judgment on September 2, 2005. In its summary judgment brief, the Bank stated it counseled and disciplined Ramanathan about his work performance before dismissing him effective February 14, 2003. At the time of his dismissal, Ramanathan held the position of a vice-president. The Bank averred that as a vice-president, Ramanathan served \u201cat the pleasure\u201d of the board of directors of the Bank, pursuant to the pertinent provisions of Section 24 (Fifth). The Bank argued it was entitled to summary judgment \u201cbecause it is undisputed that Plaintiff was a duly appointed Vice President under the NBA . . . and ... the Bank terminated him in accordance with the provisions of the NBA, [therefore] each and every one of his claims is preempted as a matter of law.\u201d The Bank submitted evidence in the form of a declaration by Allison Gilliam, its assistant corporate secretary, together with excerpts from official board of directors minutes, to show (1) the Bank is a national banking association; (2) vice-president is an officer title authorized by and identified in the Bank\u2019s bylaws; (3) Ramanathan was appointed a vice-president of the Bank by the Bank\u2019s board of directors on October 23, 2001, and was reappointed as such officer on April 23, 2002; (4) Ramanathan held the officer title of vice-president when he was dismissed; (5) Ramanathan\u2019s employment with the Bank terminated effective February 14, 2003; and (6) his dismissal was ratified by the Bank\u2019s board of directors at its next regularly scheduled meeting on April 22, 2003. Notably, the Bank\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts contains no reference to Ramanathan\u2019s actual duties and responsibilities during the time he held the position of \u201cvice-president.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>On December 2, 2005, Ramanathan filed his opposition papers to the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Ramanathan argued summary judgment should be denied on two independent grounds\u2014(1) his designated status as \u201cvice-president\u201d did not bring him within the scope of the Section 24 (Fifth); and (2) Section 24 (Fifth) does not preempt his FEHA claims. In support of the first contention, Ramanathan submitted a separate statement of undisputed facts asserting he was hired by the Bank in the position of \u201cConsultant\u2014Applications Programming.\u201d In this position, Ramanathan worked as a Web Architect in the Global Corporate Systems Shared Services Group, and his responsibilities included assisting with architecture, design and development of software applications using web technologies.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Regarding his duties and responsibilities, Ramanathan declared he had no employees working under his supervision, and was not responsible for making any decisions relating to the hiring, firing, or performance review of any other employee. Also, he declared his job did not entail entering any contracts on behalf of the bank, nor give him access to financial or mortgage documents or checks, or any information of that sort pertaining to the Bank\u2019s relationship with any of its customers. Further, Ramanathan declared that in his job capacity he did not interact or communicate with any of the Bank\u2019s customers and had no involvement with the Bank\u2019s day-to-day operations in the service of its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">After Ramanathan discovered he held the title of \u201cvice-president,\u201d he asked his supervisor, Allen Pampe, about it. Pampe told Ramanathan the title was \u201cinsignificant\u201d and had no effect on his wages, duties or responsibilities. Ramanathan also provided excerpts from Pampe\u2019s deposition testimony, in which Pampe stated all of the bank\u2019s employees have two job titles, one functional and one corporate, and the corporate title is really for use in interacting with other corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">On December 9, 2005, the Bank filed its reply to Ramanathan\u2019s opposition to its motion for summary judgment. In its reply brief, the Bank argued Ramanathan is automatically covered by Section 24 (Fifth) by dint of his title of \u201cvice-president.\u201d In its response to Ramanathan\u2019s additional separate statement of undisputed facts, the Bank deemed all facts relating Ramanathan\u2019s functional job duties \u201cimmaterial.\u201d On January 11, 2006, the trial court held a hearing on the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Ramanathan\u2019s counsel argued Ramanathan was not \u201can officer covered by the National Bank Act.\u201d The trial court issued its order granting motion for summary judgment on January 26, 2006. The trial court ruled as follows; \u201cPlaintiff was a vice president of Defendant Bank of America, National Association (the \u2018Bank\u2019) and the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors ratified the decision to terminate Plaintiff. (See <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court[, </em>supra,] 53 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>[at pp.] 1087-1088, 1103, in which the court held that the NBA preempts state law claims brought by a vice president\u2014one of the officers specifically enumerated at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, Fifth\u2014for a termination that was ratified by the bank\u2019s board of directors.) Although <em>Wells Fargo </em>did not include a FEHA claim, the Court concludes that the NBA preempts discrimination claims brought under FEHA. <em>Peatros </em>v. <em>Bank of America NT&amp;SA </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 147 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 659, 990 P.2d 539]. The Court finds the reasoning in <em>Peatros </em>of Justice Kennard, in her concurrence and dissent, and Justices Brown, George and Huffman, in their dissent, persuasive, although not binding.\u201d Notice of entry of judgment in favor of the Bank was filed on March 10, 2006, and Ramanathan filed a timely notice of appeal on March 23, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>(Merrill v. Navegar, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116]; <em>Saelzler </em>v. <em>Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 767 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143].) A motion for summary judgment \u201cshall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) To obtain summary judgment, defendant must show \u201ceither that one or more elements of plaintiff\u2019s claim could not be established, or that there existed a complete affirmative defense to it. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. (a), (o)(1), (2), (p)(2).)\u201d <em>(Martinez v. Chippewa Enterprises, Inc. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1184 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 152].) The moving party bears the burden of persuading the court. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In assessing a motion for summary judgment, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he moving party\u2019s affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Grant-Burton </em>v. <em>Covenant Care, Inc. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1369 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 204].) Here, the Bank persuaded the trial court it was entitled to the complete affirmative defense of federal preemption of Ramanathan\u2019s state law discrimination claims under Section 24 (Fifth). As intimated above, however, the underlying question of whether Ramanathan is an \u201cofficer\u201d of the Bank within the scope of the Section 24 (Fifth) must first be resolved before it can have any preemptive force on his state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">B. <em>Scope of Section 24 (Fifth) of the NBA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Section 24 (Fifth) grants each national bank the corporate power \u201c[t]o elect or appoint directors, and by its board of directors to appoint a president, vice president, cashier, and other officers, define their duties, require bonds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>them and fix the penalty thereof, dismiss such officers or any of them at pleasure, and appoint others to fill their places.\u201d Our Supreme Court considered the scope of Section 24 (Fifth) in <em>Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In <em>Wells Fargo, </em>three former Wells Fargo branch managers sued Wells Fargo under California law for its alleged wrongful termination of their employment. The branch managers \u201cheld appointments as assistant vice-presidents of the bank and exercised significant authority in transactions between the bank and third parties.\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1086.) After the trial court denied Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the Court of Appeal denied its request for peremptory writs, the Supreme Court granted review in order to consider, inter alia, the issue of whether the plaintiffs were \u201cofficers\u201d of a national bank under Section 24 (Fifth). (53 Cal.3d at pp. 1086-1087.) The court noted the plaintiffs sought a restrictive definition of Section 24 (Fifth) by contending it applied only to a bank\u2019s senior officers and not to branch managers, whereas Wells Fargo sought an \u201cexpansive construction\u201d by contending the plaintiffs were \u201c \u2018other officers\u2019 within the meaning of section 24 [(Fifth)], having been so designated by the bank.\u201d (53 Cal.3d at p. 1088.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The court began its analysis of the issue of whether the plaintiffs were officers of a national bank under Section 24 (Fifth) by examining the history and purpose of the NBA. The court noted the power \u201c \u2018to dismiss a bank officer at will reflects the Congressional mandate to establish an independent national system in order to maintain the stability of, and promote the welfare of, national banks.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1089.) The court quoted with approval from <em>Westervelt v. Mohrenstecher </em>(8th Cir. 1896) 76 Fed. 118, \u201cone of the earliest cases to consider the at-pleasure dismissal provision in the Act: \u2018Observation and experience alike teach that it is essential to the safety and prosperity of banking institutions that <em>the active officers, to whose integrity and discretion the moneys and property of the bank and its customers are intrusted, should be subject to immediate removal whenever the suspicion of faithlessness or negligence attaches to </em>them.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, </em>at p. 1089.) Indeed, in <em>Peatros v. Bank of America, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 147 <em>(Peatros), </em>the court acknowledged that \u201c[t]oday, more than 100 years later, the statement of the <em>Westervelt </em>court on the purpose of what is now section 24, Fifth, remains current. [Citations.] The provision\u2019s object is \u2018to give\u2019 national banks the \u2018greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their . . . officers\u2019 [citation], indeed, to allow them \u2018to remove and replace\u2019 them \u2018at will\u2019 [citation], in order to \u2018maintain\u2019 their \u2018stability\u2019 [citation], \u2018protect[]\u2019 their \u2018integrity\u2019 [citation], and \u2018promote\u2019 their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>\u2018welfare\u2019 [citation], all with an eye toward securing and preserving the \u2018public trust\u2019 [citation], [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Peatros, supra, 22 </em>Cal.4th at p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The <em>Wells Fargo </em>court reasoned that a \u201cbroad construction of the term \u2018officer\u2019 \u201d was necessary to give maximum effect to Section 24 (Fifth)\u2019s purpose of maintaining the stability and integrity of, and preserving the public trust in, the banking system, especially since larger banks are more likely to have \u201c \u2018such additional officers as comptroller, auditor, trust officer, and functional vice presidents in charge of particular divisions, with assistant officers in these categories . . .\u2019 [citation]\u201d who may all be \u201c \u2018held out to the public as having the authority to act\u2019 \u201d on behalf of the bank and \u201c \u2018bind the bank, in favor of third persons possessing no other knowledge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1089-1090.) Indeed, the court noted \u201ca general banking practice favoring large numbers of officers with the title of \u2018vice-president\u2019 who perform important banking functions under authority ultimately conferred by the bank\u2019s board of directors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1090.) The court also noted the position taken by the California Bankers Association appearing as amicus curiae that bank officers \u201c \u2018are those in positions of special trust\u2019 \u201d with the ability to \u201c \u2018sign documents which legally bind the bank.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1090-1091, italics omitted.) Accordingly, the court set forth a broad definition of the officers covered by Section 24 (Fifth) as follows: \u201cIn view of the language and purpose of section 24 and the history and practice of the banking industry, a bank \u2018officer\u2019 within the meaning of section 24 possesses the following attributes: <em>First, </em>he or she holds an office created by the board of directors and listed in the bank\u2019s bylaws. [Citation.] <em>Second, </em>he or she is appointed by the board of directors, either directly or pursuant to a delegation of board authority set forth in the bylaws. [Citations.] <em>Third, </em>he or she has the express legal authority to bind the bank in its transactions with borrowers, depositors, customers, or other third parties by executing contracts or other legal instruments on the bank\u2019s behalf. [Citation.] <em>Fourth, </em>his or her decisionmaking authority, however it might be limited by bank rule or policy, relates to fundamental banking operations in such a manner as to affect potentially the public\u2019s trust in the banking institution. [Citations.] If a particular bank employee holds a position possessing these features, he or she may be viewed as the bank itself in the eyes of third parties. Such an employee is an \u2018officer\u2019 and serves at the pleasure of the board of directors.\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Applying the above construction to the plaintiffs in question, the court noted that \u201c[t]heir officer positions were created by the board and referred to in the bank\u2019s bylaws; there is no dispute they had the authority to deal with third parties and bind the bank in third party transactions by executing contracts and instruments. For example, the record reveals plaintiffs could commit the bank to unsecured loans in the form of overdrafts in specified amounts ranging from $10,000 to $250,000. In addition, one of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>was dismissed because of alleged misfeasance in authorizing the negotiation and creation of instruments resulting in a $300,000 loss to the bank.\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1091.) Also, the court observed that \u201ca branch manager who oversees and supervises the branch bank operations engages in and supervises transactions involving large sums of money which could affect the integrity of the bank and the public trust reposed in it. Such a person is \u2018the bank\u2019 in a significant way in the eyes of customers and third parties. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1092.) Accordingly, the court concluded the plaintiffs, \u201c[a]s persons holding the office of vice-president and serving as branch managers, . . . were \u2018other officers\u2019 within the meaning of section 24.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Of significance for our purposes is that in formulating its definition of \u201cofficer\u201d under Section 24 (Fifth), the <em>Wells Fargo </em>court declined to employ \u201cthe rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>which provides that the general term \u2018other officers\u2019 should be construed as applicable only to \u2018persons ... of the same general nature or class\u2019 as the enumerated terms \u2018president,\u2019 \u2018vice president,\u2019 and \u2018cashier.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1092.) Justice Kennard proposed such an approach in her concurring opinion, stating: \u201cSection 24(5) applies to \u2018a president, vice president, cashier, and other officers\u2019 of a national bank. The term \u2018officers\u2019 is ambiguous. It may refer to anyone holding an office [citation], or it may refer to \u2018a person charged with important functions of management such as president, vice president, treasurer, etc.\u2019 [Citation.] The context in which the word is used in section 24(5), however, indicates that the term \u2018other officers\u2019 denotes individuals who perform functions similar to those performed by a bank\u2019s president, vice-president, or cashier, [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Section 24(5) specifically enumerates \u2018president, vice president, and cashier.\u2019 They are a bank\u2019s \u2018chief operating officers.\u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] The president of a bank is considered either the executive head of the institution, or the executive agent of the board of directors with authority similar to the authority of a director. [Citation.] . . . Thus, the president of a bank occupies its highest office and may be its most important operational officer. [Citations.] Next in the bank\u2019s hierarchy is the vice-president, who acts as the president in the event of the president\u2019s absence or inability to act. [Citation.] [\u00b6] The cashier is the bank\u2019s institution-wide managing and executive officer [citations] through whom all of the bank\u2019s financial operations are conducted. [Citations.] Because of these important and extensive responsibilities, the cashier is considered to possess greater power than the president of the bank. [Citation.] [\u00b6] It is readily apparent from the above analysis that the bank officers enumerated in section 24(5) share these characteristics: they occupy the highest positions in the institution, they have bank wide authority and responsibility, and they are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>institution\u2019s chief operational officers. The term \u2018other officers\u2019 follows the enumeration in the statute of \u2018president, vice president, and cashier.\u2019 Thus, the statutory language itself requires that the general words \u2018other officers\u2019 must \u2018 \u201cbe construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or class as those enumerated.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] The term \u2018other officer\u2019 must therefore possess the earlier-described characteristics of a president, vice-president, or cashier.\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1106-1107 (conc. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">As noted, the majority opinion in <em>Wells Fargo </em>rejected Justice Kennard\u2019s analysis and formulated a broader definition of \u201cofficer\u201d for purposes of Section 24 (Fifth). (See <em>Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1091.) In rejecting Justice Kennard\u2019s application of the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>the court stated \u201cbanks have historically created and empowered a wide variety of \u2018other officers\u2019 with varying functions and degrees of authority to carry out banking business. Congress has explicitly authorized a national bank\u2019s board of directors, not this court, to appoint \u2018other officers\u2019 and to \u2018define their duties.\u2019 [Citation.] Nothing in the language or history of the Act suggests that such duties must be \u2018high level\u2019 or \u2018bankwide.\u2019 ... As shown above, the use of the term \u2018officer\u2019 in the banking context imports no more than appointment by the board and authority to act for the bank in third party transactions. These characteristics are embodied in the four-part definition we have derived from the case law and relevant banking practice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1093.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In other words, although Section 24 (Fifth) specifically enumerates only the positions of president, vice-president and cashier as subject to its at-pleasure provisions, banks may extend its scope to \u201cother officers,\u201d who need not occupy such high positions in the institution or have bank wide authority and responsibility, <em>so long as </em>the duties of such \u201cother officers\u201d meet the four criteria set forth in <em>Wells Fargo. </em>(See <em>Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1093.) Accordingly, it would stand the logic of <em>Wells Fargo </em>on its head, to conclude, as the Bank would have us do here, that a vice-president <em>who does not meet </em>the four criteria is nonetheless \u201can officer\u201d of the bank under the NBA. Thus, we conclude that if the board appoints a vice-president with defined duties which do not meet <em>Wells Fargo's </em>four-part test, then the board is not entitled to the at-pleasure provisions of Section 24 (Fifth) with respect to such an appointment. To say that any employee designated a vice-president by a bank\u2019s board of directors falls automatically within Section 24 (Fifth)\u2019s at-pleasure provisions, regardless of such employee\u2019s actual responsibilities, goes against both the logic and spirit of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Wells Fargo. </em>Our conclusion is bolstered by the Supreme Court\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>closing remarks in <em>Wells Fargo. </em>After concluding \u201cthe term \u2018other officers\u2019 in section 24 is not restricted to any particular type of officer . . . [provided he or she meets the four criteria described,\u201d the Court noted \u201c[t]his case does not require us to determine the outer reaches of the term \u2018other officers.\u2019 We are satisfied that bank employees whose positions possess the four characteristics we have outlined are within the class of persons whom Congress desired to serve at the pleasure of the bank\u2019s board of directors. Obviously, bank employees such as janitors, tellers, or others who do not hold offices <em>or enjoy the requisite authority to deal with third parties on the bank\u2019s behalf </em>do not fall within the scope of section 24.\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1094, italics added.) Similarly, as discussed further below, this record indicates Ramanathan did not \u201cenjoy the requisite authority to deal with third parties on the bank\u2019s behalf\u2019 and therefore he does \u201cnot fall within the scope of section 24.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">We turn now to the issue of whether Ramanathan\u2019s position as vice-president meets the four-part test set forth in <em>Wells Fargo. </em>Ramanathan concedes his position satisfies the first two parts of the test\u2014he holds \u201can office created by the board of directors and listed in the bank\u2019s bylaws\u201d and his appointment was made by the board of directors \u201cpursuant to a delegation of board authority set forth in the bylaws.\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">However, Ramanathan contends his position does not meet the other two <em>Wells Fargo </em>factors. First, he states he was given no authority \u201cto enter into contracts or other transactions with third parties, including borrowers, depositors, or customers, and thus could not legally bind the bank.\u201d Moreover, his position \u201cas Consultant-Applications Programming was such that he was never put in a position where he would have an opportunity to enter into any contracts on behalf of the Bank, and no one ever told him that he did have that authority.\u201d Second, he states he had no access to \u201cfinancial or mortgage documents or checks, financial information about customers, bank statements, certificates of deposit, account numbers, account balances, customer names and addresses, or any other information pertaining to the Bank\u2019s relationship with any of the Bank\u2019s customers.\u201d \u201cSimply put,\u201d Ramanathan asserts, \u201c[he] was never in a position of authority, and had no decision making authority that related to fundamental banking operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">The Bank states Ramanathan \u201cworked as a \u2018web architect\u2019 . . . providing and evaluating technology solutions for the Bank\u2019s business operations\u201d but does not otherwise describe the specific nature of his duties or contest his assertions concerning the limits of his responsibilities as a \u201cweb architect\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>computer programmer. Instead, the Bank adheres to the position it took before the trial court, namely, under \u201cthe plain language of Section 24 (Fifth), officers with the title of \u2018vice-president\u2019 <em>automatically </em>satisfy\u201d the <em>Wells Fargo </em>test, and so Ramanathan, as a \u201cvice-president,\u201d is \u201cexpressly subject to the NBA without further analysis as to his authority.\u201d The Bank notes none of the plaintiffs in <em>Wells Fargo </em>held the position of vice-president but were assistant vice-presidents and branch managers, leading \u201cthe Court ... to explore whether they fell into the \u2018other officer\u2019 category referenced in the statute.\u201d By contrast, the Bank continues, Ramanathan was a vice-president, therefore <em>Wells Fargo's </em>\u201c \u2018other officer\u2019 test\u201d does not apply here and, \u201cas a matter of law, the dismissal-at-pleasure provision of the NBA applied to him____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">We have already rejected the Bank\u2019s interpretation in the discussion of <em>Wells Fargo </em>in part (ii), <em>ante. </em>Nonetheless, we acknowledge <em>Wells Fargo </em>never addressed the specific question of whether an employee is covered by Section 24 (Fifth) merely by virtue of his or her designation as a vice-president, regardless of whether such an employee has no significant banking duties. We also acknowledge that in <em>Wells Fargo </em>\u201c[njone of the plaintiffs held the positions of president, vice-president, or cashier . . . [and] [e]ach . . . was an assistant vice-president and branch manager\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1088), so the Court addressed the question of \u201cwhether he or she was one of the \u2018other officers\u2019 referred to in section 24.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But as explained above, <em>Wells Fargo </em>compels the conclusion that the duties of those appointed by the board of directors as the principal officers of the bank enumerated in Section 24 (Fifth)\u2014a president, vice-president or a cashier\u2014 must at least be as great as those \u201cother officers\u201d appointed by the board. In other words, the broader category of \u201cother officers\u201d subsumes the narrower category of principal officers, so that the <em>Wells Fargo </em>criteria are those possessed by a bank \u201cofficer,\u201d including vice-president. (See <em>Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">This is only fair, because under the NBA \u201c[a] national bank is granted a broad and unique exemption from state wrongful discharge law\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1099), so there must be room to factually dispute the issue of who qualifies under the NBA. Without such a check, a bank might be unduly motivated to label as many employees as possible \u201cofficers\u201d in order to preclude such state law claims. To decide Ramanathan falls within Section 24 as a matter of law based solely on his designation as \u201cvice-president,\u201d is really to decide the issue on the Bank\u2019s say-so. According to the Bank, the fact that its board gave Ramanathan the title is sufficient to bring him within the NBA, regardless of his actual position within the Bank or his job duties. We decline to adopt a holding which grants the Bank such unilateral power over its employment relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>Having rejected the Bank\u2019s argument, we are left with Ramanathan\u2019s essentially unrefuted assertions regarding the limited nonbanking nature of his duties and responsibilities as a computer programming consultant. Thus, the Bank has failed to show Ramanathan was an \u201cofficer\u201d of the bank subject to the at-pleasure provisions of Section 24 (Fifth). On the other hand, Ramanathan raised issues of material fact as to whether he qualifies as an \u201cofficer\u201d under the <em>Wells Fargo </em>criteria. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">We reverse the superior court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">McGuiness, R 1, and Siggins, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Judge of the Alameda Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-5\"> We therefore need not address the Bank\u2019s contention that Ramanathan\u2019s claims are totally preempted under <em>Peatros, </em>because unless and until the Bank shows Ramanathan is an \u201cofficer\u201d of the bank for purposes of the NBA, it may not invoke federal preemption to preclude his state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We also note <em>Peatros </em>has no bearing on the issue we must decide\u2014whether an employee is an \u201cofficer\u201d for purposes of the NBA merely by virtue of a bank\u2019s designation as such and regardless of that employee\u2019s actual duties and responsibilities. In <em>Peatros, </em>the \u201csole question on review\u201d was whether \u201cin the face of Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA\u201d <em>(Peatros, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 156; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 154, 167), <em>and the parties did not dispute Peatros was an \"officer\u201d for purposes of the NBA under the </em>Wells Fargo <em>criteria. </em>The facts bear this out because <em>in her complaint </em>Peatros alleged: \u201cThe bank employed her as an officer, specifically, a vice-president, and assigned her to work as a branch manager. . . .\u201d (22 Cal.4th at p. 154.) Undisputed facts showed that in course of her employment \u201cwithin a period of a single week, and at the hands of a single customer, she caused it to suffer losses in the amount of almost $135,000 when she approved for immediate credit, without any uncollected-funds hold, the deposit of a series of three checks in the amounts of $100,000, $20,000, and $15,000, which were drawn on out-of-state banks and later returned unpaid because they were not covered by sufficient funds.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">At oral argument, the Bank\u2019s counsel argued that if the Bank chose to designate all of its employees, \u201cincluding janitors, maintenance workers, everyone\u201d as \u201cvice-presidents,\u201d then they too would all be covered by the provisions of the NBA. For this startling assertion, the Bank\u2019s counsel relied on <em>Peatros, </em>which she argued held that a bank employee is an officer of the Bank for purposes of the NBA according to his or her designated job title, regardless of the actual duties he or she performed on behalf of the Bank. The <em>Peatros </em>court delivered no such sweeping holding. Counsel for the Bank referred us to <em>Peatros, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 177, where the three-justice lead opinion states: \u201cAs a vice-president, [Peatros] was one of the officers expressly enumerated by the provision, whether or not she would be included among its \u2018other officers\u2019 solely by virtue of her work as a branch manager.\u201d Such dicta is not central to the three-justice majority\u2019s holding in <em>Peatros. </em>We repeat, the sole question on review in <em>Peatros </em>was whether \u201cin the face of Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA\u201d <em>(Peatros, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 156, 167), and on that issue the three-justice lead opinion held that \u201csection 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, preempts FEHA to the extent that it conflicts, but it does not to the extent that it does not.\u201d <em>(Peatros, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 173.) The three-justice dissent focused exclusively on the issue of preemption, would have found \u201csection 24, Fifth, preempts plaintiff\u2019s FEHA and other state law causes of action\u201d <em>(Peatros, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 189 (dis. opn. of Brown, J.)), and did not even allude to, far less discuss, Peatros\u2019s job title or duties. Thus, we decline to ascribe any legal significance to the Bank\u2019s reference to the <em>Peatros </em>case on the issue before us today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
