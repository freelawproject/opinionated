J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOF\">This is an appeal by plaintiff and appellant, Gary Bailey (Bailey), from the judgment entered on November 29, 2005, in his favor and against defendants and respondents, Outdoor Media Group (OMG), Jon M. Gunderson, and Lamar Advertising Company (Lamar), following a court trial on Bailey\u2019s complaint for, among other things, damages based on trespass, wrongful occupation of land, and a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>count for money had and received. The trial court awarded Bailey compensatory damages of $108,069 against OMG and Jon M. Gunderson, its principal, and an additional $86,131 against Lamar, on the noted causes of action. Bailey challenges the damage awards, contending that the trial court did not apply the correct statutory measure of damages with respect to Lamar, and failed to correctly calculate damages with respect to OMG. We agree with Bailey\u2019s claim regarding Lamar, for reasons we now explain, and therefore we will modify the judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Bailey sued OMG and Lamar, both of which are billboard advertising companies, to recover damages for trespass and wrongful occupation of a strip of land in the City of Grand Terrace that Bailey had leased from the property owners and then subleased to OMG, which constructed billboards on the land and sold the advertising space. When OMG\u2019s 10-year sublease with Bailey expired in 1998, OMG continued to occupy the land and sell advertising on its billboards while it attempted to negotiate a new sublease agreement with Bailey. Bailey and OMG did not agree on the terms of a new sublease, and in 1999 Bailey sued OMG for damages based on, among other things, its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold. Bailey won that lawsuit (which the parties in this case refer to as <em>Bailey I, </em>a designation we adopt),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and recovered damages from OMG through August 2001. Although the trial court in that case awarded Bailey damages, it denied Bailey\u2019s cause of action for ejectment on the ground that ejectment could result in waste because the City of Grand Terrace had outlawed new billboard construction with the result that if the billboards were removed from the property, they could not be replaced. Bailey appealed the damage award in <em>Bailey I,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but he apparently did not challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to eject OMG from the property. In that appeal, this court modified the judgment by increasing the damage award and affirmed the judgment as modified. Despite its loss in <em>Bailey I, </em>both at trial and on appeal, OMG continued to occupy Bailey\u2019s property and sell advertising space on its billboards until May 2003, when it sold the billboards to Lamar.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In the sale to Lamar, OMG represented that it had a valid sublease with Bailey on the subject property and that it would assign that sublease to Lamar. OMG provided Lamar with a copy of what OMG represented to be the sublease agreement. The purported sublease in fact was an offer that Bailey had made to OMG nine months earlier and that OMG had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>accepted and that Bailey subsequently revoked. Because Bailey had signed the sublease offer, OMG backdated its acceptance, and represented to Lamar that the document was a valid sublease agreement with Bailey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Bailey learned of the transaction between OMG and Lamar, which occurred shortly after the transaction took place, he notified Lamar that OMG did not have a sublease on the property. In addition, when Lamar sent Bailey what it represented to be its first rent payment, Bailey returned the check, and advised Lamar that no sublease existed between Bailey and OMG. Lamar continued to occupy the property and send monthly rent payments to Bailey, only to have Bailey return the payments with a letter advising Lamar that OMG did not have a lease on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Bailey filed the instant action in July 2003, seeking among other things damages under Civil Code section 3334 for trespass measured by the gross revenue Lamar and OMG received from their respective sale of advertising space on the billboards located on Bailey\u2019s leasehold. Bailey also sought to recover from OMG the price Lamar had paid to purchase the billboards from OMG. A court trial took place in March 2005 at the conclusion of which the trial court found in favor of Bailey and against both OMG and Lamar. The trial court awarded damages to Bailey against OMG measured by the net profit it generated from the billboards ($108,069), rather than by gross revenue ($168,850), and against Lamar measured by the reasonable rental value of the land ($86,131), rather than its net profit ($99,580.64). The trial court denied Bailey recovery of the purchase price OMG had received from Lamar, and also found that Bailey was collaterally estopped by <em>Bailey I </em>from seeking ejectment, and in any event, ejectment would cause waste. After the trial court issued its tentative decision, Bailey moved for a new trial on the issue of damages or in the alternative to vacate the submission and reopen the case to evidence. The trial court denied that motion. Bailey appeals from the subsequently entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Bailey contends that the trial court incorrectly calculated the amount of damages to which he is entitled as the result of the wrongful occupation of his leasehold by OMG and Lamar. More particularly, Bailey claims that under Civil Code section 3334, he was entitled to recover the \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d by both OMG and Lamar as a result of their respective wrongful occupations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Bailey\u2019s leasehold, and that the benefit obtained consists of the gross revenue, not the net profit, generated by the billboards, along with the proceeds of OMG\u2019s sale of the billboards to Lamar. Although the trial court awarded Bailey the value of the use of the property measured by the benefits OMG obtained as a result of its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold, it determined that those benefits consisted of the profit OMG made on the billboards rather than its gross revenue, and did not include the proceeds of OMG\u2019s sale to Lamar. With respect to Lamar, the trial court found that its occupation of the property was the result of a mistake of fact, and therefore the trial court assessed damages under Civil Code section 3334, subdivision (b)(2), quoted below, based on the reasonable rental value of the property, an award Bailey also challenges. We first address Bailey\u2019s claim regarding the damage award against OMG, which turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d as used in Civil Code section 3334.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">MEASURE OF DAMAGES UNDER CIVIL CODE SECTION 3334</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Civil Code section 3334<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) The detriment caused by the wrongful occupation of real property ... is deemed to include the value of the use of the property for the time of that wrongful occupation, ... the reasonable cost of repair or restoration of the property to its original condition, and the costs, if any, of recovering the possession, [f] (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), for purposes of subdivision (a), the value of the use of the property shall be the greater of the reasonable rental value of that property or the benefits obtained by the person wrongfully occupying the property by reason of that wrongful occupation, [f] (2) If a wrongful occupation of real property subject to this section is the result of a mistake of fact of the wrongful occupier, the value of the use of the property, for purposes of subdivision (a), shall be the reasonable rental value of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The phrase \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d is not defined in section 3334. By urging that it means gross rather than net revenue, Bailey contends either that his interpretation is required as a matter of law, or that application of the trial court\u2019s interpretation is not supported by substantial evidence. We first address the assertion that \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d means gross revenue as a matter of law because that assertion, if correct, renders the alternate claim moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>At the outset, we note that we did not resolve this issue in <em>Bailey I </em>because the trial court in that case awarded Bailey damages under section 3334 based on the reasonable rental value of the property and rejected Bailey\u2019s claim that damages should be based on the benefit OMG obtained by its wrongful occupation of the property. We reversed, and held that damages should be measured by the benefit OMG obtained, which we concluded was the gross revenue generated by its sale of advertising space on the billboards because that amount was greater than the reasonable rental value of the property. We based that holding, in part, on the language of section 3334, and, in part, on the fact that OMG had not presented any evidence regarding the expenses it incurred in connection with the operation of the signs, and therefore its net income (or profit) could not be calculated. In this case, OMG did present evidence of the expenses it incurred. Therefore, the trial court found that the benefit OMG received was its profit from the sale of advertising space on the billboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Resolution of Bailey\u2019s claim in this appeal that, as used in section 3334, the phrase \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d means gross revenue requires us to construe, or interpret, section 3334. Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we conduct de novo. <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 799-801 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 883 P.2d 960].) In determining statutory construction we begin with the well-settled principle that the objective of the endeavor is to determine and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute in question. <em>(Hughes v. Board of Architectural Examiners </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 775 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641].)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Only two cases have discussed the \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d provision of section 3334, subdivision (b)(1), neither of which involves the specific issue presented in this appeal, but which both conclude that the phrase includes any financial benefit obtained as a result of the trespass. In the recently decided <em>Starrh &amp; Starrh Cotton Growers v. Aera Energy LLC </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 583 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 165] <em>(Starrh), </em>the issue was whether \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d was limited to the cost the defendant saved, or did not incur, as a result of the wrongful trespass, such as the cost of properly disposing of the wastewater at issue in that case. On appeal, the Fifth District held, in pertinent part, that damages under the benefits obtained provision are not so limited and may include profits the trespasser generated \u201cthat are directly linked to the wrongful trespass.\u201d <em>(Starrh, </em>at p. 604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>In <em>Watson Land Co. </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 69 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 343] <em>(Watson), </em>the issue was whether \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d included restoration or remediation costs that were paid by a codefendant and therefore were avoided by the trespasser. Division Two of the Second District held that benefits obtained do not include \u201cthe avoidance of remediation costs\u201d because remediation is a separate component of the damages specified in subdivision (a) of section 3334. \u201cIf \u2018benefits\u2019 included the cost of remediation (and the value of the use of the money saved, as [the plaintiff] suggests), then the language permitting recovery of \u2018the reasonable cost of repair or restoration\u2019 would be surplusage. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3334, subd. (a).)\u201d <em>(Watson, </em>at p. 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Both <em>Starrh </em>and <em>Watson </em>based their interpretations on the Legislature\u2019s intent as evidenced by the legislative history of section 3334. That history reveals that before 1992, section 3334 stated, in pertinent part, that, \u201cThe detriment caused by the wrongful occupation of real property ... is deemed to be the value of the use of the property for the time of such occupation.\u201d (Stats. 1979, ch. 373, \u00a7 47, p. 1264.) In 1992, the Legislature amended the section, first, by designating the above quoted language as subdivision (a) and, next, by adding to that language that the detriment \u201cis deemed to include the value of the use of the property for the time of that wrongful occupation, ... the reasonable cost of repair or restoration of the property to its original condition, and the costs, if any, of recovering the possession.\u201d (\u00a7 3334, subd. (a), as amended by Stats. 1992, ch. 469, \u00a7 1, p. 1847.) The 1992 amendment also added subdivision (b), which specifically defines \u201cthe value of the use of the property\u201d to mean \u201cthe greater of the reasonable rental value of that property or the benefits obtained by the person wrongfully occupying the property,\u201d and that the value of the use of the property is the reasonable rental value if the wrongful occupation is the result of a \u201cmistake of fact\u201d on the part of the wrongful occupier. (\u00a7 3334, subd. (b), as amended by Stats. 1992, ch. 469, \u00a7 1, pp. 1847-1848.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The 1992 amendment was sponsored by a resolution of the Conference of Delegates of the California State Bar Association. Its author explained in a letter to the State Bar\u2019s legislative counsel \u201cthat the resolution \u2018provides a definition for the \u201cvalue of the use\u201d which eliminates Section 3334\u2019s economic incentive to dump\u2019 toxic waste when the rental value [of the property on which the waste is dumped] is cheaper than the cost of disposal. \u2018The \u201cvalue of the use\u201d would be \u201cthe greater of the reasonable rental value or the benefits obtained by the trespasser by reason of the trespass.\u201d The measure of damages would take into account the benefit obtained by the trespass\u2014the cost saved by not properly disposing the pollutants.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Watson, supra, </em>130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 78.) The State Bar resolution prompted Assembly Bill No. 2663 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) pursuant to which section 3334 was amended in 1992. (See <em>Watson, supra, </em>at p. 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The legislative history \u201cdemonstrates that the Legislature intended to eliminate financial incentives for trespass by eradicating the benefit associated with the wrongful use of another\u2019s land.\u201d <em>(Watson, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 79.) The amendment \u201ccreated not only a measure of damages for the property owner, but an economic disincentive to [the] would-be polluters.\u201d <em>(Starrh, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th at p. 603.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In this case, OMG wrongfully occupied Bailey\u2019s leasehold in order to conduct a business enterprise on the property, i.e., to sell advertising space on billboards. The financial incentive for operating such a business is to generate profit. Bailey argues that gross revenue is the financial disincentive or the benefit obtained in such a situation. To support that claim, Bailey relies on <em>Starrh, </em>for the general, and unremarkable, proposition that section 3334 should not be read narrowly given the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute. As previously discussed, <em>Starrh </em>held that \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d includes profits the trespasser \u201cenjoyed . . . that are directly linked to the wrongful trespass.\u201d <em>(Starrh, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th at p. 604.) <em>Starrh </em>does not address gross revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Bailey also cites cases involving the wrongful extraction of minerals in which damages are measured according to a \u201charsh rule,\u201d applied when the misappropriation is willful, or a \u201cmild rule,\u201d which is applied when the extraction is unintentional or a mistake. (See <em>Whittaker v. Otto </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 666, 675 [56 Cal.Rptr. 836].) \u201cUnder this \u2018mild\u2019 rule, the measure of damages is the value of the ore extracted less the costs incurred by the defendants in the mining, transportation, and smelting of the converted ore, [citations], since this constitutes the value of the ore in place.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 675.) Under the \u201charsh\u201d rule, the measure of damages is the value of the ore without deductions for the previously noted costs of production, what the <em>Whittaker </em>court describes as \u201cthe net value of the ore converted without deduction for defendant\u2019s cost of mining, transportation, and smelting.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Whittaker v. Otto, supra, </em>at pp. 675-676.) Bailey argues that like the cited cases, when the defendant\u2019s wrongful occupation is intentional, as in this case, the benefit obtained should be the harsh measure of damages and that harsh measure is gross revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>As set out above, section 3334, subdivision (b) specifies the \u201cmild\u201d measure of damage that applies when the trespass is the result of a mistake of fact, and therefore is unintentional or inadvertent. In that situation damages are measured by the reasonable rental value of the property. (Sec \u00a7 3334, subd. (b)(2).) Therefore, the mining cases do not aid our analysis because they do not necessarily exclude net income as the measure of damages to calculate the benefit obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Bailey also relies on <em>A &amp; M Records, Inc. v. Heilman </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 554 [142 Cal.Rptr. 390], a case in which the trial court imposed a constructive trust on the gross receipts the defendants received as a result of their misappropriation and sale of pirated music recordings. In affirming both the damage award and the remedy, the Court of Appeal noted that the defendants\u2019 conduct amounted to conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s intangible personal property, and cited the rule that, \u201cOne who misappropriates the property of another is not entitled to deduct any of the costs of the transactions by which he accomplished his wrongful conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 570.) The court also noted a separate reason for not allowing the defendants to deduct expenses\u2014they had not met their burden to produce evidence of the costs they had incurred, and therefore \u201cit was impossible to verify their alleged expenses.\u201d (Ibid., fn. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">OMG did not misappropriate and sell Bailey\u2019s leasehold; it wrongfully occupied it and then enabled Lamar to wrongfully occupy it. In other words, OMG did not represent that it was the sublessor and on that basis collect rent from Lamar for its use and occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold. Until section 3334 was amended in 1992, the damages recoverable for the wrongful use of real property belonging to another were measured by the reasonable rental value of the property. By amending section 3334 to include the \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d as a measure of damages, the Legislature did not intend to punish the wrongful occupier. The legislative history, recounted above, indicates that the purpose of the amendment was to discourage the dumping of toxic waste on vacant land with little or no rental value by eliminating the financial benefit gained by that dumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Bailey\u2019s contrary view notwithstanding, a person or business entity is not likely to wrongfully occupy land and operate a business merely in order to break even at the end of the effort. Our conclusion that the profit OMG generated while wrongfully occupying Bailey\u2019s property is the benefit it obtained is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting section 3334. In other words, we cannot say that, as a matter of law, and without regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>any other circumstance, the benefit obtained is necessarily and in all instances the gross revenue generated by a trespassing business enterprise. In reaching this conclusion, we do not place the burden on Bailey to prove OMG\u2019s profit. We hold only that when, as in this case, the defendant presents credible evidence of the expenses it incurred, the trial court may offset those expenses against the gross income generated and award the profit as the benefit obtained under section 3334. Conversely, when the trespassing defendant does not present such evidence, a trial court may award damages based on gross revenue as the benefit obtained by the wrongful occupation of land for the purpose of operating a business.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">DAMAGES RECOVERABLE FROM OMG</p>\n<p id=\"Aud\">A. OMG\u2019s Net Profit on Billboard Leases</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Because we cannot say as a matter of law that \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d means gross revenue, we cannot say that the trial court erred in this case by awarding Bailey damages against OMG based on the net revenue, or profit, generated by its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold interest. Nor do we agree with Bailey\u2019s assertion that even if not correct as a matter of law, gross revenue should be the measure of the benefit obtained in this case given OMG\u2019s outrageous conduct. In other words, Bailey contends we should conclude that a punitive measure of damages is warranted under the facts of this case. As discussed above, the legislative history of section 3334 does not support an interpretation that the \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d measure of damages is intended to punish the wrongful occupier. But even if a punitive interpretation were appropriate under certain circumstances, the trial court in this case denied Bailey\u2019s request for punitive damages, and in doing so effectively resolved the factual issue underlying Bailey\u2019s argument. In another case, the facts might support a trial court\u2019s award of gross revenue as the benefit obtained as a result of the wrongful occupation of property. However, the trial court in this case found otherwise, and we must affirm that finding because it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 51 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Our conclusion that the phrase \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d as used in section 3334, subdivision (b)(1) means net revenue or profit, and OMG presented evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>to show its net profit, evidence that Bailey does not challenge on appeal, requires us to affirm this aspect of the damage award. The remaining issue is whether the proceeds of OMG\u2019s sale of the billboards to Lamar are also benefits OMG obtained as a result of its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">B. Proceeds of OMG\u2019s Sale to Lamar</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Bailey claimed in the trial court, as he does on appeal, that the proceeds from OMG\u2019s sale of the billboards to Lamar are a benefit obtained by OMG \u201cby reason of\u2019 its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold, and as such should have been included in the damages the trial court awarded to Bailey. The trial court found that the proceeds of the sale were not a benefit obtained \u201cby reason of\u2019 OMG\u2019s occupation of Bailey\u2019s land but rather as a result of OMG\u2019s fraudulent representation to Lamar that it had a valid leasehold interest in the property that it could assign to Lamar. In other words, the trial court found there was no causal connection between OMG\u2019s wrongful occupation of land and the benefit obtained. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Because the pertinent facts are undisputed, we may resolve the causation issue as a question of law. (See <em>Kurinij v. Hanna &amp; Morton </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 853, 864 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 324] [although causation generally presents a question of fact, it becomes a question of law when a facts are undisputed and \u201cthere is no room for a reasonable difference of opinion\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">There was no causal connection between OMG\u2019s wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold and Lamar\u2019s willingness to purchase OMG\u2019s billboards. Lamar\u2019s interest in purchasing the billboards was the result of OMG\u2019s representation that it had the right to keep the billboards in place on Bailey\u2019s leasehold until 2008, when the purported sublease expired. Lamar not only purchased the billboard structures but also OMG\u2019s future right to occupy Bailey\u2019s leasehold. Therefore, the purchase price OMG received from Lamar was not a benefit obtained \u201cby reason of\u2019 OMG\u2019s wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold. Rather, the purchase price was a benefit OMG obtained as a result of its wrongful representation that it had the right to occupy the leasehold in the future and therefore could assign that right to Lamar.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">OMG\u2019s misrepresentation to Lamar regarding its right to occupy Bailey\u2019s property most likely increased the value of the billboards and presumably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>affected the price Lamar paid OMG. If Lamar paid more for the billboards than they were worth because of OMG\u2019s misrepresentation, that is a matter for Lamar to resolve with OMG. Bailey is not entitled to the proceeds of OMG\u2019s sale of the billboards to Lamar because those proceeds are not a benefit OMG received by reason of its wrongful occupation of the property. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed above, we will affirm the damage award against OMG.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">DAMAGES RECOVERABLE FROM LAMAR</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The trial court found that Bailey could only recover damages against Lamar measured by the reasonable rental value of the property, as specified in section 3334, subdivision (b)(2), because Bailey was equitably estopped from applying the \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d measure of damages against Lamar, and in any event Lamar\u2019s occupancy of the property was the result of a mistake of fact, that fact being Lamar\u2019s belief that OMG had a valid sublease agreement with Bailey that OMG, in turn, had assigned to Lamar. Bailey challenges both findings on various grounds. We agree with his assertion that the trial court incorrectly found that Bailey was equitably estopped from claiming damages under the \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d measure of damages because the evidence is insufficient to support application of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">A. Equitable Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">\u201cEquitable estoppel, originally known as estoppel in pais, and also called estoppel by conduct, is simply stated. \u2018Whenever a party has, by his own statement or conduct, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief, he is not, in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct, permitted to contradict it.\u2019 [Citations.] The doctrine is defensive in nature only, and \u2018operates to prevent one [party] from taking an unfair advantage of another.\u2019 [Citation.] Whether there is an estoppel is chiefly a question of fact. [Citation.] There must be (1) a representation or concealment of material facts (2) made with knowledge, actual or virtual, of the facts, (3) to a party ignorant, actually and permissibly, of the truth, (4) with the intent, actual or virtual, that the latter act upon it, and (5) the party must have been induced to act upon it. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(San Diego Mun. Credit Union </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 919, 922-923 [222 Cal.Rptr. 467], citing, among other things, Evid. Code, \u00a7 623; 7 Wilkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Equity, \u00a7 132, pp. 5351, 5352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>The trial court found with respect to Lamar that Bailey was \u201cequitably estopped from utilizing the \u2018benefits obtained\u2019 measure of damages under Section 3334. [Bailey] sent countless letters to Lamar, returning their rent checks and pointing out that no lease existed, but never asked them to take down the advertising from the billboards, or to remove the billboards. [Bailey] testified that he wanted to negotiate a lease [with Lamar] but it was clear from the evidence that he made it impossible to negotiate by demanding various amounts at various times, and that he sometimes made demands that were well beyond any reasonable range. He often made it a condition of settlement that OMG or Jon Gunderson take steps that were not within Lamar\u2019s power to control. Based upon this conduct . . . Bailey is limited to reasonable rental value with respect to Lamar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Assuming equitable estoppel applies to prohibit application of the statutory measure of damages, the evidence in this case does not establish a basis for invoking the doctrine. As set out above, the critical circumstance that warrants application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel is that the party invoking the doctrine was induced to act upon a representation or concealment made by the other party. <em>(San Diego Mun. Credit Union </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 923.) The evidence presented in the trial court does not establish this critical aspect of equitable estoppel. In the trial court\u2019s apparent view, Bailey induced Lamar to remain on the property as evidenced by the fact that Bailey did not ask Lamar to vacate the premises or to stop selling advertising on the billboards, and also continued to engage in lease negotiations with Lamar. A trespasser remains in possession of the property at its peril. In other words, if Lamar wanted to reduce its liability to Bailey, it should have vacated the property. Lamar chose to remain in possession and continue to negotiate with Bailey, despite his apparently outrageous demands. Stated bluntly, Bailey was in the catbird seat, and given his superior position, Lamar remained in possession of the property at peril of ultimately being held liable for damages measured under section 3334 by the benefits obtained by reason of its wrongful occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">It also occurs to us that if Bailey had demanded Lamar vacate the premises and/or remove the billboards, Lamar would have invoked the judgment in <em>Bailey I </em>in which the trial court, as previously noted, refused to order ejectment. OMG and Lamar construed that ruling to mean that their presence on the property constituted a permanent trespass, which in turn required Bailey to seek damages in <em>Bailey I </em>for the duration of his leasehold or be foreclosed from recovering such damages in the future.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court in this case rejected that assertion and instead found \u201cthe trespass to be continuing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>nature. [Bailey] cannot be faulted for failing to elect his remedy; in <em>Bailey I </em>he sought ejectment as well as damages, but the court denied ejectment in order to prevent waste. Moreover, the court in <em>Bailey I </em>was in no position to award [Bailey] future damages for ongoing trespass, because no one knew at the time of that judgment whether [OMG and Lamar] would continue to occupy the premises (since not ejected), and if so, whether they would pay [Bailey] for such occupation.\u201d As the quoted ruling indicates, the trial court in this case, as well as OMG and Lamar, construed the judgment in <em>Bailey I </em>as creating a right on behalf of Lamar and OMG to occupy Bailey\u2019s leasehold interest. Given that interpretation of the <em>Bailey I </em>judgment, any demand Bailey might have made that Lamar vacate the premises would have been futile, and the trial court cannot fault Bailey for failing to make a futile demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">In summary, we conclude, assuming without actually deciding the doctrine applies, that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that Bailey is equitably estopped from seeking damages under section 3334, subdivision (b)(1) based on the benefits Lamar obtained by reason of its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold. Therefore, we next must determine whether the trial court correctly found that Lamar\u2019s occupancy of the property was the result of a mistake of fact within the meaning of section 3334, subdivision (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">B. Mistake of Fact\u2014Effect of Lis Pendens</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">At the hearing on Bailey\u2019s motion for new trial, the trial court stated that its \u201cone regret\u201d with respect to its statement of decision was that the court \u201cdidn\u2019t expressly say that there was a mistake of fact. It was a mistake of fact induced by OMG claiming that that one lease was valid and fooling Lamar. And there was a mistake of fact.\u201d That mistake of fact constituted a separate basis for measuring damages by the reasonable rental value of the property rather than by the benefits Lamar obtained from its wrongful occupancy of the property. Although quoted previously, it bears repeating that under section 3334, subdivision (b)(2), if the wrongful occupation of real property \u201cis the result of a mistake of fact of the wrongful occupier, the value of the use of the property . . . shall be the reasonable rental value of the property.\u201d (\u00a7 3334, subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Section 3334, subdivision (b)(2) does not define the phrase \u201cmistake of fact.\u201d In the trial court Bailey argued that the definition set out in section 1577 should apply. That definition, which pertains to contract formation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>defines a mistake of fact that serves to vitiate consent to a contract, states in pertinent part that a mistake of fact is a mistake \u201cnot caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1577.) Bailey argued that Lamar\u2019s mistake of fact was a result of its neglect of its legal duty to conduct a title search which would have revealed a lis pendens on the property. The trial court rejected that argument based on its view that <em>Bailey I </em>and this litigation did not involve \u201creal-estate transactions,\u201d and therefore were not the proper subjects of a lis pendens. We held in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 397 [88 Cal.Rptr. 352], that a leasehold is \u201can estate in land, an estate in real property\u201d and an action involving such an estate is properly the subject of a lis pendens. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 400.) Because <em>Bailey I </em>involved a dispute over a leasehold, it was the proper subject of a lis pendens. Accordingly, we next address the effect that lis pendens had on Lamar\u2019s claim that it occupied the leasehold as a result of a mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Lamar\u2019s representative testified at trial, in pertinent part, that Lamar does not conduct title searches on the properties it leases for its billboards, it did not conduct such a search in this case, and it did not have actual knowledge of any problem regarding the OMG billboards at issue in this case. In other words, Lamar claimed that it did not have actual knowledge of the litigation between Bailey and OMG and did not have any reason to question the validity of the sublease between OMG and Bailey that OMG purported to assign to Lamar.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Although Bailey argued in the trial court that Lamar had a legal duty to investigate the status of OMG\u2019s interest in the real property by among other things conducting a title search, that argument misconstrues the effect of a lis pendens. \u201c \u2018A lis pendens is a recorded document giving constructive notice that an action has been filed affecting title to or right to possession of the real property described in the notice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kirkeby v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 647 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 805, 93 P.3d 395].) \u201cFrom the time of recording the notice of pendency of action, a purchaser, encumbrancer, or other transferee of the real property described in the notice shall be deemed to have constructive notice of the pendency of the noticed action as it relates to the real property . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 405.24.) In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>words, whether Lamar had a duty to conduct a title search is irrelevant because according to the quoted statute, Lamar as the purported transferee of OMG\u2019s leasehold interest is deemed to know what it would have discovered had it conducted such a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Because Bailey recorded a lis pendens in <em>Bailey I, </em>Lamar is \u201cdeemed to have constructive notice\u201d of that action, and thus of the dispute between Bailey and OMG over OMG\u2019s right to possess the property that is the subject of the purported sublease. The amended judgment in <em>Bailey </em>/, which established that OMG did not have a valid lease on the property, was filed in March 2003, two months before Lamar purchased OMG\u2019s interest in the leasehold and billboards. Because Lamar had constructive notice of <em>Bailey I </em>as a result of the lis pendens, its occupancy of that leasehold could not have been the result of a mistake of fact regarding the validity of the sublease between OMG and Bailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In reaching this conclusion we reject Lamar\u2019s assertion that constructive notice is not sufficient. According to Lamar, \u201cWhether a mistake of fact has been made depends exclusively on the actual, subjective knowledge of the person.\u201d Lamar asserts that its view is based on \u201cCalifornia case law\u201d which holds that \u201cthere is a mistake of fact when a person understands the facts to be other than they are,\u201d and the exception set out in section 1577 when the mistake is the result of neglect of a legal duty does not apply to section 3334. In other words, Lamar contends that a mistake of fact exists under section 3334 even when a trespasser deliberately ignores information that would have revealed the true facts. Under Lamar\u2019s view, a trespasser who chose to not read posted signs identifying the property owner could claim a mistake of fact regarding the owner\u2019s interest in the real property and be liable only for the fair rental value of the property. Clearly that is not the law in California. More significantly, the interpretation urged by Lamar would run afoul of the purpose of the 1992 amendment to section 3334, which as previously discussed was to eliminate the financial incentive for dumping toxic material on property owned by another. The trespasser could avoid paying damages based on the benefit obtained and instead pay only the fair rental value of the property by claiming a mistaken belief regarding ownership of the real property and/or the trespasser\u2019s permission to use that property as a disposal site.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Lamar does not cite any authority to support the view that lack of actual knowledge, unencumbered by any duty to investigate, is all that is required in order to establish a mistake of fact under section 3334, subdivision (b)(2). The cases Lamar cites do not support its view. <em>Walton v. Bank of California </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 527 [32 Cal.Rptr. 856], involves an action to rescind an irrevocable inter vivos trust based on a claim of mistake by the trustor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>regarding the specific tax consequences of the transfer. In addressing the mistake, the court noted that, \u201cGenerally speaking, there is a mistake of fact when a person understands the facts to be other than they are. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 543.) <em>Reid v. Landon </em>(1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 476 [333 P.2d 432], one of the cases cited by the court in <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Bank of California </em>to support the quoted phrase, is the second case Lamar cites to support its claim and also is a rescission action, this one to rescind an option to purchase real property that the property owner signed based on her belief that the document created only a right of first refusal. Neither case supports Lamar\u2019s claim that only lack of actual knowledge is sufficient to establish a mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">C. Benefits Obtained by Lamar</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">As discussed above, Lamar is deemed to have constructive knowledge of the litigation between Bailey and OMG as a result of the lis pendens Bailey recorded in <em>Bailey I. </em>Because Lamar is deemed to have notice of that litigation, it cannot claim that its occupancy of the leasehold was the result of a mistake of fact regarding the validity of the sublease between Bailey and OMG. Therefore, we must conclude that the trial court erred in finding otherwise and applying the reasonable rental value measure of damages. Bailey is entitled to recover damages from Lamar for its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold interest measured by the benefits Lamar obtained as a result of that wrongful occupancy. As discussed above, in connection with OMG, the benefits obtained in this case are the profit Lamar made on its sale of advertising space during the period of time it wrongfully occupied Bailey\u2019s leasehold. Lamar and Bailey agree that figure is $99,580.64. Therefore, we will amend the judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We recognize, in reaching this conclusion that the trial court in <em>Bailey I </em>contributed to the confusion in this case by refusing to order ejectment because removal of the billboards would constitute waste. OMG argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling constitutes a \u201cjudicially created tenancy\u201d allowing the billboards to remain on Bailey\u2019s leasehold and also allowing OMG to continue to sell advertising space on those billboards. In other words, OMG contends that the trial court\u2019s ruling had the effect of creating a permanent trespass, not only allowing the billboard structures to remain but also allowing OMG to continue to sell advertising space on the billboards. There are several flaws in this argument. First, if the trial court in <em>Bailey I </em>had intended its ruling to create a permanent trespass of any kind then it should have awarded Bailey damages for the duration of his leasehold interest which does not terminate until 2008. <em>(Slater </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 864, 869-870 [137 P.2d 713].) Second, and perhaps most telling, if OMG viewed the <em>Bailey I </em>judgment as creating a permanent trespass in its favor, OMG would not have needed to fabricate the sublease between itself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Bailey. Third, the trial court in this case rejected the permanent trespass assertion, as previously noted, and instead found that the trespass by both OMG and Lamar was a continuing trespass. Fourth, the cases cited by OMG to support its permanent trespass claim involve trespasses committed by things, such as buildings and sewer pipe,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> not by business operations. Finally, even if OMG believed that the judgment in <em>Bailey I </em>created a permanent trespass in its favor, OMG offers no theory under which it could transfer the benefit of that trespass to Lamar.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">For each of the reasons noted, the judgment in <em>Bailey I </em>cannot be construed as establishing a permanent trespass by OMG. <em>(Slater v. Shell Oil Co, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.2d at p. 870.) The only reasonable interpretation of the trial court\u2019s denial of ejectment in <em>Bailey I </em>is that it is limited to the billboard structures\u2014the billboards could remain on the property, but not OMG.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A contrary conclusion would have the effect of permitting OMG to occupy Bailey\u2019s leasehold without his permission and for the duration of his tenancy, requiring OMG in turn to pay only the reasonable rental value of the land (the measure of damages the <em>Bailey I </em>court incorrectly applied).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In summary we conclude that the trial court incorrectly found that the reasonable rental value of the property was the measure of damages pertinent to Lamar. The trial court instead should have applied the \u201cbenefits obtained\u201d measure of damages set out in section 3334, subdivision (b)(1). Under that measure of damages, Bailey is entitled to recover the profit Lamar made by reason of its wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold interest. That benefit in this case is the profit Lamar made by selling advertising space on the billboards during the time Lamar wrongfully occupied Bailey\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The judgment is modified by amending the damages awarded against Lamar from $86,131, measured by the reasonable rental value of the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>to $99,580.64, the net revenue or profit generated by reason of Lamar\u2019s wrongful occupation of Bailey\u2019s leasehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As modified, the judgment is affirmed.
