(Threshold), from selling its skin cream, Threshold demurred to Buckland\u2019s first amended complaint, which alleged that the skin cream constituted a misbranded or mislabeled drug. The trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, and denied Buckland\u2019s request for injunctive relief on the ground that there was no operative complaint. After Buckland elected to stand on her complaint, judgments of dismissal were entered in favor of Threshold and the other respondents. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Buckland and the California Women\u2019s Law Center (Center) filed their first amended complaint in the underlying action on January 24, 2006. The complaint asserts 11 claims against Threshold and more than 30 other defendants that market skin lotions and creams, including nine claims by Buckland as an individual for fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation and violations of the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), the false advertising law (FAL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500 et seq.), and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.). Buckland sought injunctive relief, restitution, and damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The first amended complaint alleges the following facts; Buckland is the executive director of the Center, which seeks to advance the civil rights of women and girls. Threshold and the other defendants sell skin creams or lotions that contain progesterone or other chemicals regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.). Like the other defendants, Threshold has not complied with FDA regulations in marketing its skin cream, and its skin cream lacks adequate warnings about the chemicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">On March 15, 2006, Buckland filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Threshold. Her accompanying declaration states: \u201cI do not make in this litigation any personal injury claims (though in using one of the products at issue in this litigation, I did suffer a skin rash). Rather, I am acting in this matter on my own behalf and as a consumer in the public interest, in light of my own personal desire to evaluate the claims of the products at issue in this case. I believe that a woman who advocates professionally for women\u2019s rights must be <em>especially sensitive as an </em>individual woman to the claims of products that purport to address women\u2019s health. I am acting in this litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>to evaluate, as an individual consumer, these defendants\u2019 respective products, incurring the cost of purchasing each of these products in order to meet the letter of the law to have standing to make appropriate claims regarding these products where the facts and law warrant, and thereby incurring the economic damages that provide standing under the statutes by which I am proceeding in the case.\u201d The declaration further states: \u201cI am a consumer of these [products and have suffered damages in the amount of at least the purchase price of each [p]roduct. In the case of Threshold, I purchased their Source Naturals\u00ae Eternal Woman\u2122 Natural Progesterone Cream through my attorney on August 31, 2005 for $14.99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Threshold demurred to Buckland\u2019s claims in the first amended complaint, contending that Buckland lacked standing to assert claims under the UCL, FAL, and CLRA, and that she had failed to plead her common law fraud claims with specificity. In opposing Buckland\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, Threshold argued that she was unlikely to prevail at trial on the grounds raised in the demurrer; in addition, it argued that the balance of hardships weighed against injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On June 19, 2006, the trial court sustained Threshold\u2019s demurrer to Buckland\u2019s claims with leave to amend, and denied her request for a preliminary injunction without prejudice, on the ground that she lacked an operative complaint. Buckland noticed an appeal from these rulings. After Buckland elected not to amend the first amended complaint, the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal in Threshold\u2019s favor on October 10, 2006. The court also entered judgments of dismissal in favor of respondents AllVia Integrative Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Arterio, Inc.; Before and After Cosmetics LLC; Creativision, Inc.; Nature\u2019s Light, Inc.; NOW Health Group, Inc.; One Life USA, Inc.; Pure Essence Laboratories, Inc.; Sayge Biosciences, LLC; and Star Health &amp; Beauty, LLC, which joined in Threshold\u2019s demurrer or otherwise sought dismissal of Buckland\u2019s claims on the basis of the ruling on Threshold\u2019s demurrer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Buckland contends the trial court erred in denying injunctive relief and entering the judgments of dismissal after sustaining Threshold\u2019s demurrer. She argues that her claims against Threshold and the other respondents, as alleged in the first amended complaint, are legally tenable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">A. <em>Standards of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\"><em>In </em>deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court considers two related factors: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied, as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Meese </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1217, 1226 [240 Cal.Rptr. 829, 743 P.2d 889].) Here, the denial of injunctive relief and the judgment of dismissal rest solely on the trial court\u2019s ruling on Threshold\u2019s demurrer. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the trial court that Buckland\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law, and that injunctive relief is thus unavailable to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In examining the ruling on the demurrer, we \u201creview the complaint de novo to determine whether . . . [the] complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory . . . [citation] .... [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 151], fn. omitted.) If a proper ground for sustaining the demurrer exists, \u201cthis court will . . . affirm the demurrers even if the trial court relied on an improper ground, whether or not the defendants asserted the proper ground in the trial court. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 880, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\u201cWhen reviewing a demurrer on appeal, appellate courts generally assume that all facts pleaded in the complaint are true. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp., supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 877, fn. omitted.) Here, the trial court\u2019s ruling on the demurrer also relied on Buckland\u2019s statements in her declaration in support of injunctive relief. When a party opposing a demurrer admits that it does not dispute facts extrinsic to the complaint, the trial court may properly treat these facts as judicial admissions for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the complaint. <em>(Scafidi v. Western Loan &amp; Bldg. Co. </em>(1946) 72 Cal.App.2d 550, 560-562 [165 P.2d 260].) We therefore examine Buckland\u2019s complaint in light of her declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">B. <em>Fraud Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">We begin with Buckland\u2019s claims for fraud by concealment and negligent misrepresentation (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1709, 1710). Generally, \u201c 1 \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>elements of fraud ... are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or \u2018scienter\u2019); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] [However, t]he tort of negligent misrepresentation does not require scienter or intent to defraud. [Citation.] It encompasses \u2018[t]he assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true\u2019 [citation], and \u2018[t]he positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true\u2019 [citations].\u201d <em>(Small </em>v. <em>Fritz Companies, Inc. </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 173-174 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 490, 65 P.3d 1255].) Furthermore, to establish fraud through nondisclosure or concealment of facts, it is necessary to show that the defendant \u201cwas under a legal duty to disclose them.\u201d <em>(Lingsch v. Savage </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 729, 735 [29 Cal.Rptr. 201].)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Here, Buckland alleged that respondents, in packaging and marketing their products, improperly suppressed the fact that the products contained potentially unsafe chemicals regulated under the FDCA and the Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (SFDCA) (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 111330 et seq.), and otherwise portrayed the products as safe and healthful. The trial court concluded that Buckland\u2019s claims failed because she did not allege the pertinent omissions and misrepresentations with specificity, and did \u201cnot even make a gesture toward pleading justifiable reliance.\u201d We agree that Buckland has not pleaded reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The focus of our inquiry is the requirement of actual reliance, which is a component of \u201cjustifiable reliance.\u201d (See <em>Garcia v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 728, 737 [268 Cal.Rptr. 779, 789 P.2d 960]; 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 808-813, pp. 1164-1176.) A plaintiff asserting fraud by misrepresentation is obliged to plead and prove actual reliance, that is, to \u201c \u2018establish a complete causal relationship\u2019 between the alleged misrepresentations and the harm claimed to have resulted therefrom.\u201d <em>(Mirkin v. Wasserman </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1082, 1092 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 101, 858 P.2d 568], quoting <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 737.) Actual reliance is also an element of fraud claims based on omission; the plaintiff must establish that \u201chad the omitted information been disclosed, [he or she] would have been aware of it and behaved differently.\u201d <em>(Mirkin, </em>at p. 1093.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Buckland contends that she satisfied this requirement because she suspected respondents\u2019 packaging and marketing contained false and misleading advertising, and she relied on this suspicion in deciding to buy their products as potential targets for litigation. The crux of her argument is that the requisite \u201cactual reliance\u201d is established when a plaintiff (1) knows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>defendant may have made false or materially incomplete representations about its product, and (2) buys the product expecting to claim the purchase costs as damages if the representations are, in fact, false or incomplete. She is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation, actual reliance occurs only when the plaintiff reposes confidence in the <em>truth of </em>the relevant representation, and acts upon this confidence. Section 546 of the Restatement Second of Torts, which addresses \u201ccausation in fact,\u201d states: \u201cThe maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability for pecuniary loss suffered by one who justifiably relies upon the truth of the matter misrepresented, if his reliance is a substantial factor in determining the course of conduct that results in his loss.\u201d This principle is clarified in section 548 of the Restatement Second of Torts: \u201cThe maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is not liable to one who does not rely upon its truth but upon the expectation that the maker will be held liable in damages for its falsity.\u201d Comment a to this section elaborates: \u201cIn order to justify recovery, the recipient of a misrepresentation must rely upon the truth of the misrepresentation itself, and his reliance upon its truth must be a substantial factor in inducing him to act or to refrain from action. (See \u00a7 546.) It is not enough that, without belief in its truth, he proceeds to enter into the transaction in the expectation that he will be compensated in an action for damages for its falsity.\u201d (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 548, com. a, p. 106.) Our Supreme Court has impliedly embraced this principle in endorsing section 546 of the Restatement Second of Torts. (See <em>Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 976 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903].)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Claims for fraud by omission are also subject to the requirement of actual reliance, and thus fall within the scope of section 548 of the Restatement Second of Torts. Because these claims do not involve affirmative misrepresentations, we conclude that actual reliance for the purpose of fraud by omission occurs only when the plaintiff reposes confidence in the <em>material completeness </em>of the defendant\u2019s representations, and acts upon this confidence. (See <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Seaboard Finance </em>Co. (1949) 33 Cal.2d 564, 569-570 [203 P.2d 758] [claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment fail for want of actual reliance when the plaintiff ignored the defendant\u2019s statements and relied solely on his own inspection of item he bought]; <em>Ostayan v. Serrano Reconveyance Co. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1411, 1418-1419 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 577] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Here, Buckland concedes she suspected respondents\u2019 packaging and marketing was false or misleading, and she bought respondents\u2019 products solely to pursue litigation upon the vindication of her suspicions. She therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>lacked the requisite confidence in the truth and material completeness of their representations, and cannot establish actual reliance for the purpose of her fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">C. <em>CLRA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Buckland also asserts a claim under the CLRA, which targets a class of \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d enumerated in Civil Code section 1770. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770, subd. (a).) \u201cAny consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of\u2019 this unlawful conduct may bring an action for damages, restitution of property, and injunctive relief. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1780, subd. (a).) The consumer may also bring a class action on behalf of \u201cother consumers similarly situated.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1781, subd. (a).) The CLRA is interpreted liberally \u201cto promote its underlying purposes, which are to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1760.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Buckland\u2019s CLRA claim asserted that respondents\u2019 packaging and advertising, as alleged in her fraud claims, misrepresented their products as having \u201ccharacteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities\u201d they do not have, and misrepresented the products as \u201cof a particular standard, quality, or grade.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770, subd. (a)(5), (7).) In sustaining the demurrer to this claim, the trial court indicated that Buckland could not establish that Threshold\u2019s conduct caused her alleged damages. Again, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Under Civil Code section 1780, subdivision (a), CLRA actions may be bought only by a consumer \u201cwho suffers any damage <em>as a result of the use or employment\u201d </em>of a proscribed method, act, or practice. (Italics added.) \u201cThis language does not create an automatic award of statutory damages upon proof of an unlawful act. Relief under the CLRA is specifically limited to those who suffer damage, making causation a necessary element of proof.\u201d <em>(Wilens v. TD Waterhouse Group, Inc. </em>(2003) 120 Cal.App.4th 746, 754 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 271].) Accordingly, \u201cplaintiffs in a CLRA action [must] show not only that a defendant\u2019s conduct was deceptive but that the deception caused them harm.\u201d <em>(Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1292 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 190]; see also <em>Anunziato v. eMachines, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2005) 402 F.Supp.2d 1133, 1136 [recognizing the CLRA imposes reliance requirement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Because Buckland\u2019s CLRA claim sounds in fraud, the key issue is whether her lack of actual reliance for the purpose of fraud also defeats her CLRA claim. In <em>Caro v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 644 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 419] <em>(Caro), </em>a consumer initiated a class action for fraud and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>violations of the CLRA, alleging in his complaint that the defendants had misrepresented a product as \u201cfresh\u201d orange juice, that is, juice from squeezed oranges that had not been frozen or altered. (18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 651-652.) After the consumer admitted knowing when he bought the product that it did not contain fresh orange juice, the trial court ruled he could not properly represent a class whose members alleged they had been deceived into believing they were buying fresh orange juice. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 662-663.)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The court in <em>Caro </em>affirmed. <em>(Caro, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 668-669.) Reasoning that a misrepresentation is material for a plaintiff only if there is reliance\u2014that is, \u201c 1 \u201cwithout the misrepresentation, the plaintiff would not have acted as he did\u201d \u2019 \u201d\u2014the court concluded \u201cthere was no material misrepresentation to [the consumer] because he did not believe defendants\u2019 product to be \u2018fresh.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 668, quoting <em>Lacker v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1038, 1049 [281 Cal.Rptr. 640].) It thus held that the consumer\u2019s admissions precluded him from litigating the class claims alleged in the complaint, including the CLRA claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Caro, </em>at pp. 664-665.) In view of <em>Caro, </em>plaintiffs asserting CLRA claims sounding in fraud must establish that they actually relied on the relevant representations or omissions. (See also <em>Anunziato v. eMachines, Inc., supra, </em>402 F.Supp.2d at p. 1136.) Buckland\u2019s CLRA claim therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Buckland disputes that under the CLRA she is required to show respondents\u2019 packaging and advertising deceived her. Her reliance on <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660] <em>(Children\u2019s </em>Television) and its progeny is misplaced, as these cases do not address the requirement of actual reliance under the CLRA. In <em>Children\u2019s Television, </em>our Supreme Court examined the UCL, FAL, and SFDCA, as then in effect\u2014but not the CLRA\u2014and stated: \u201cTo state a cause of action under these statutes . . . , it is necessary only to show that \u2018members of the public are likely to be deceived.\u2019 [Citations.] Allegations of actual deception, reasonable reliance, and damage are unnecessary.\u201d <em>(Children\u2019s Television, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 211, quoting <em>Chern v. Bank of America </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 866, 876 [127 Cal.Rptr. 110, 544 P.2d 1310].) Subsequently, several courts have applied this standard\u2014sometimes called the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard <em>(Lavie v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 496, 508 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 486])\u2014to determine whether a defendant\u2019s representations were unlawful under Civil Code section 1770, which enumerates the practices, acts, and methods proscribed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>CLRA. <em>(Consumer Advocates </em>v. <em>Echostar Satellite Corp. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1353, 1360-1362 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 22]; <em>Colgan v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 663, 681-683 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 36]; <em>Aron </em>v. <em>U-Haul Co. of California </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 796, 806-807 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 555]; <em>Benson v. Kwikset Corp. </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1254, 1274\u20141275 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 284].) Because none of these cases addresses the separate requirement for causation imposed on CLRA claims in subdivision (a)(1) of Civil Code section 1780, they are not authority on the issue of actual reliance. <em>(Bishop v. Merging Capital, Inc. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1803, 1807 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 556].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Buckland also suggests that <em>McAdams v. Monier, Inc. </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 667 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 111] (McAdams) stands for the proposition that she need only show that Threshold\u2019s representations were likely to mislead the public in order to satisfy the causation requirement for a CLRA claim. In <em>McAdams, </em>the court held that the plaintiff properly alleged the element of reliance for a class claim under the CLRA by pleading that the defendant had made material representations about its product to the public. <em>(McAdams, </em>at pp. 674\u2014678.) The court pointed to <em>Vasquez v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 814 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964], and <em>Occidental Land, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 355, 363 [134 Cal.Rptr. 388, 556 P.2d 750], in which our Supreme Court addressed class fraud claims, and reasoned that alleging a material misrepresentation raised the inference that each class member <em>had relied </em>on the misrepresentation. <em>(McAdams, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.4th at pp. 676-677.) <em>McAdams </em>thus supports our conclusion that actual reliance is an element of a CLRA claim sounding in fraud. As explained (see pt. B., <em>ante), </em>Buckland\u2019s declaration establishes that she did not rely on the truth or completeness of respondents\u2019 representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">D. <em>UCL Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">We turn to Buckland\u2019s claims under the UCL, whose \u201cpurpose is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.\u201d <em>(Kasky v. Nike, Inc. </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 939, 949 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 45 P.3d 243].) Public officials and qualified private parties may pursue UCL claims. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204). The UCL defines \u201cunfair competition\u201d broadly to include \u201cany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by [the FAL].\u201d (Bus. &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) Although the UCL targets a wide range of misconduct, its remedies are limited because UCL actions are equitable in nature. <em>(Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1144 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937].) Damages cannot be recovered, and plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The key issue before us is whether Buckland has standing to assert claims under the UCL. Prior to the enactment of Proposition 64, the UCL was subject to abuse by attorneys who used it as the basis for legal \u201c \u2018shakedown\u2019 \u201d schemes. <em>(Angelucci v. Century Supper Club </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 160, 178-179, fn. 10 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 142, 158 P.3d 718].) The court in <em>People ex rel. Lockyer </em>v. <em>Brar </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1317 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 844], described a typical scheme: \u201cAttorneys form a front \u2018watchdog\u2019 or \u2018consumer\u2019 organization. They scour public records on the Internet for what are often ridiculously minor violations of some regulation or law by a small business, and sue that business in the name of the front organization. Since even frivolous lawsuits can have economic nuisance value, the attorneys then contact the business (often owned by immigrants for whom English is a second language), and point out that a quick settlement (usually around a few thousand dollars) would be in the business\u2019s long-term interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In November 2004, the voters of California approved Proposition 64, which amended Business and Professions Code section 17204 to provide that a private individual has standing to assert a claim under the UCL only if he or she \u201c \u2018has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Californians for Disability Rights </em>v. <em>Mervyn\u2019s, LLC </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 227 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 57, 138 P.3d 207]; see Prop. 64, \u00a7 3.) Proposition 64 also amended Business and Professions Code section 17203 to provide that, aside from public officials, a person may pursue \u201c \u2018representative claims or relief on behalf of others\u2019 \u201d only if the person meets the new standing requirement and otherwise complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 382, which governs class actions. (39 Cal.4th at p. 228; see Prop. 64, \u00a7 2.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These amendments imposed significant new requirements on claimants under the UCL, which had previously \u201cauthorized any person acting for the general public to sue for relief from unfair competition,\u201d and did not predicate standing \u201con a showing of injury or damage.\u201d <em>(Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn\u2019s, LLC, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 227-228.) In approving Proposition 64, the voters found and declared that the amendments were necessary to prevent abusive UCL actions by attorneys whose clients had not been \u201cinjured in fact\u201d or used the defendant\u2019s product or service, and to ensure \u201cthat only the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Attorney General and local public officials [are] authorized to file and prosecute actions on behalf of the general public.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Prop. 64, \u00a7 1, subds.

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Blumhorst v. Jewish Family Services of Los Angeles </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 993, 1000 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 474].) Because standing goes to the existence of a cause of action, lack of standing may be raised by demurrer or at any time in the proceeding, including at trial or in an appeal. (5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 862, p. 320; <em>Blumhorst v. Jewish Family Services of Los Angeles, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1000.) Standing requirements vary from statute to statute, and must be assessed in light of intent of the statute at issue. (5 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 862, p. 320; <em>Blumhorst, supra, </em>at p. 1000.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Here, Buckland asserted claims under the UCL, alleging that Threshold\u2019s packaging and marketing violated interests protected by the FDCA, the SFDCA, and the statutes underlying her fraud claims. The only loss of money or property she identified was her expenditure of funds to buy respondents\u2019 allegedly defective products, and she conceded that she brought the UCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>claims as an individual, rather than as a class representative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the claims failed because, in view of the admissions in her declaration, Buckland had not suffered the requisite injury in fact and loss. We agree. As we explain below, (1) Buckland\u2019s purchase of the products does not constitute an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d and (2) she has failed to establish that she \u201clost money or property as a result of . . . unfair competition\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">1. <em>Injury In Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">To interpret the term \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d we look to the language of Proposition 64 itself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In approving Proposition 64, the voters declared their intent \u201cto prohibit private attorneys from filing lawsuits for unfair competition where they have no client who has been injured in fact <em>under the standing requirements of the United States </em>Constitution.\u201d (Prop. 64, \u00a7 1, (e), italics added.) We therefore examine those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Havens Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 363, 372 [71 L.Ed.2d 214, 102 S.Ct. 1114] <em>(Havens), </em>article HI of the United States Constitution obliges plaintiffs in federal courts to show, at a minimum, an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d that is, \u201cas a result of the defendant\u2019s actions [they have] suffered \u2018a distinct and palpable injury.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 490, 501 [45 L.Ed.2d 343, 95 S.Ct. 2197].) The requisite injury is defined as \u201can invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, [citations]; and (b) \u2018actual or imminent, not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical,\u201d \u2019 [citations].\u201d <em>(Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 555, 560 [119 L.Ed.2d 351, 112 S.Ct. 2130], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The extent to which costs incurred in connection with litigation constitute an injury in fact is addressed in <em>Havens </em>and its progeny. In <em>Havens, </em>several individuals and a nonprofit organization brought an action against an apartment owner and its employee under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq.) for \u201cracial steering,\u201d\u2014the practice of directing potential renters to racially segregated housing. <em>(Havens, supra, </em>455 U.S. at pp. 366-369.) The court held the organization had alleged an injury in fact under article III of the United States Constitution in asserting that the defendants\u2019 steering practices forced it to divert resources from its mission of providing counseling and referral services to homeseekers to identifying and counteracting the defendants\u2019 racially discriminatory practices. <em>(Havens, </em>at p. 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Following <em>Havens, </em>the circuits have divided over whether the costs an organization incurs to pursue litigation are sufficient, in themselves, to establish an injury in fact. In <em>Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1990) 283 U.S. App.D.C. 216, 219 [899 F.2d 24, 27], the District of Columbia Circuit Court (Ginsburg, J.) concluded: \u201cAn organization cannot, of course, manufacture the injury necessary to maintain a suit from its expenditure of resources on that very suit. Were the rule otherwise, any litigant could create injury in fact by bringing a case, and Article HI would present no real limitation. [Citation.]\u201d It appears that a majority of the circuits that have expressly resolved this issue, including the Ninth Circuit, have followed <em>Spann. (Walker v. City of Lakewood </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 272 F.3d 1114, 1124, fn. 3; <em>Association for Retarded Citizens v. Dallas County </em>(5th Cir. 1994) 19 F.3d 241, 244; <em>Fair Housing Council </em>v. <em>Montgomery Newspapers </em>(3d Cir. 1998) 141 F.3d 71, 80; <em>Housing Opportunities </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Enquirer </em>(6th Cir. 1991) 943 F.2d 644, 646.) These circuits have nonetheless held that funds expended independently of the litigation to investigate or combat the defendant\u2019s misconduct may establish an injury in fact. <em>(Spann, supra, </em>899 F.2d at p. 27; <em>Fair Housing of Marin </em>v. <em>Combs </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 285 F.3d 899, 905; <em>Louisiana ACORN Fair Housing v. LeBlanc </em>(5th Cir. 2000) 211 F.3d 298, 305; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Riga </em>(3d Cir. 2000) 208 F.3d 419, 427, fn. 4; <em>Hooker v. Weathers </em>(6th Cir. 1993) 990 F.2d 913, 915.) Three circuits have concluded that litigation expenses constitute an injury in fact because they represent a diversion of organizational resources. <em>(Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi </em>(7th Cir. 1990) 895 F.2d 1521, 1526; <em>Ragin </em>v. <em>Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co. </em>(2d. Cir. 1993) 6 F.3d 898, 905; <em>Arkansas ACORN Fair Housing </em>v. <em>Greystone Development </em>(8th Cir. 1998) 160 F.3d 433, 434-435.) Another circuit has recognized the issue but not resolved it. <em>(Cent. Ala. Fair Housing Center </em>v. <em>Lowder Realty </em>(11th Cir. 2000) 236 F.3d 629, 641, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We follow the majority rule on this issue, which is supported by the weight of authority. Although the federal courts have applied this rule to organizations, its rationale also encompasses individuals who claim to have suffered an injury in fact solely by expending funds to pursue litigation. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Buckland purchased the product to establish standing for litigation against Threshold. Although she indicated she also bought it to investigate claims against Threshold, she has not identified any investigation expenses other than the cost of the product. Because the costs were incurred solely to facilitate her litigation, her purchase does not constitute the requisite injury in fact; to hold otherwise would gut the injury in fact requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Buckland contends that her purchase of the product amounted to an injury in fact, pointing to <em>Havens, Southern Cal. Housing v. Los Feliz Towers Homeow. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2005) 426 F.Supp.2d 1061 <em>(Housing Rights), </em>and several other cases. We are not persuaded. As we have explained, the <em>Havens </em>court held that an organization alleged an injury in fact under article III of the United States Constitution by asserting that the defendants\u2019 misconduct compelled it to divert resources from its other programs to helping homeseekers affected by the defendants. <em>(Havens, supra, </em>455 U.S. at p. 379.) In <em>Housing Rights, </em>an organization transferred resources from its other activities to investigate a claim that a disabled condominium owner had suffered discrimination in her residential complex, and then initiated a UCL action against the complex. <em>(Housing Rights, supra, </em>426 F.Supp.2d at p. 1063.) In interpreting the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d requirement under the UCL, the district court followed <em>Havens, </em>and concluded that the organization\u2019s diversion of resources toward investigating the claim prior to the litigation constituted an \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d (426 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1068-1069.) Unlike the organizations in <em>Havens </em>and <em>Housing Rights, </em>Buckland does not allege any comparable diversion of resources, and her investigation costs, if any, are inextricably tied to her litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Buckland\u2019s remaining cases involve UCL claims resting on allegations of economic injury from deceptive business practices, but in none of the cases does the court suggest the plaintiff suspected the deceptive practice prior to purchasing the defendant\u2019s product, or bought the product in order to pursue litigation. <em>(McCann </em>v. <em>Lucky Money, Inc. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1391-1400 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 437]; <em>R &amp; B Auto Center, Inc. v. Farmers Group, Inc. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 327, 333-336, 359-360 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 426]; <em>Aron v. U-Haul Co. of California, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at pp. 800-803; <em>Anunziato </em>v. <em>eMachines, Inc., supra, </em>402 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1136-1139; <em>Williams v. Gerber Products Co. </em>(S.D.Cal. 2006) 439 F.Supp.2d 1112, 1114\u20141118.) They are thus not authority on the question before us, viz., whether a plaintiff who buys a product to pursue litigation establishes standing under the UCL. <em>(Bishop v. Merging Capital, Inc., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">2. <em>Loss of Money or Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The remaining question is whether Buckland\u2019s purchase of Threshold\u2019s product satisfies the other standing requirement, which obliges plaintiffs to show that they \u201clost money or property as a result of . . . unfair competition.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204.) Following the canons of statutory interpretation, we seek a construction that avoids rendering the requirement \u201credundant and a nullity\u201d <em>(Cal Pacific Collections, Inc. v. Powers </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 135, 139 [74 Cal.Rptr. 289, 449 P.2d 225]), and harmonize it with the other provisions of the UCL <em>(Legislature </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 658, 676 [194 Cal.Rptr. 781, 669 P.2d 17]).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Because remedies for individuals under the UCL are restricted to injunctive relief and restitution, the import of the requirement is to limit standing to individuals who suffer losses of money or property that are eligible for restitution. As our Supreme Court explained prior to Proposition 64, restitution under the UCL is not the recovery of compensatory damages, but a form of equitable relief. <em>(Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 173-178 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706].) This relief is authorized by a portion of Business and Professions Code section 17203 not amended by Proposition 64.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 17203 constitutes \u201ca grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>of broad equitable power\u201d that requires \u201cconsideration of the equities on both sides of a dispute.\u201d <em>(Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">We therefore interpret the standing requirement in light of equitable principles. Section 112 of the Restatement of Restitution states; \u201cA person who without mistake, coercion or request has unconditionally conferred a benefit upon another is not entitled to restitution, except where the benefit was conferred under circumstances making such action necessary for the protection of the interests of the other or of third persons.\u201d Comment a to the section states that this rule \u201cis of the widest application\u201d because it affirms the fundamental principle that volunteers are not entitled to restitution of benefits they confer. (Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 112, com. a, p. 461.) Comment b explains the qualification in section 112 to this fundamental principle; \u201cUnder some conditions, it is desirable to encourage persons to interfere with the affairs of others. Thus where it is imperatively necessary for the protection of the interests of third persons or of the public that a duty owned by another should be performed, a stranger who performs it may be entitled to restitution . . . .\u201d (Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 112, com. b, pp. 462-463.) California courts have accepted the principles asserted in section 112. <em>(Stein v. Simpson </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 79, 86 [230 P.2d 816]; see <em>Dinosaur Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>White </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1310, 1315-1316 [265 Cal.Rptr. 525].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Here, Buckland\u2019s declaration establishes that she did not buy Threshold\u2019s product due to \u201cmistake, coercion or request\u201d (Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 112), but to establish standing for an action in the public interest. In approving Proposition 64, the voters declared their intention to ensure that \u201conly\u201d public officials are authorized to undertake UCL actions on behalf of the general public, and amended the UCL to limit actions by individuals pursuing \u201crepresentative claims or relief on behalf of others\u201d to class actions. (Prop. 64, \u00a7\u00a7 1, subd. (f), 2, italics omitted.) The voters have thus effectively determined that it is not \u201cdesirable to encourage\u201d individuals to incur expenses for UCL actions in the public interest, within the meaning of the principles stated in the Restatement of Restitution. (Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 112, com. b, p. 463). Accordingly, Buckland\u2019s purchase of Threshold\u2019s product cannot reasonably be viewed as \u201clost\u201d money or property under the standing requirement (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Pointing to the UCL\u2019s historical role in protecting consumers, Buckland argues that the Proposition 64 amendments should not be interpreted to bar actions by individuals like her, who suspect that a defendant\u2019s product labeling is misleading, and buy the product to pursue an action in the public interest. As our Supreme Court has explained in connection with statutes enacted through the initiative process, \u201c[f]or [the] purposes of interpreting these statutes, ... it matters not whether the drafters[ or] voters . . . consciously considered all the effects and interrelationships of the provisions they wrote and enacted. We must take the language . . . , as it was passed into law, and must, if possible without doing violence to the language and spirit of the law, interpret it so as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 14 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829].) Because Buckland\u2019s contention cannot be reconciled with these principles, we are obliged to reject it. In sum, she had failed to establish standing to pursue her UCL claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">E. <em>FAL Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Finally, we agree with the trial court that the deficiencies in Buckland\u2019s UCL claims are also fatal to her FAL claim, which relies on the same factual allegations. The FAL makes it unlawful for any person or corporation \u201cto induce the public to enter into any obligation relating\u201d to a service \u201cor anything of any nature whatsoever\u201d by means of advertising that is \u201cuntrue or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or misleading . . . .\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500.) Like the UCL, the FAL authorizes actions by public officials and private individuals. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17535.) Again, like the UCL, remedies for individuals under the FAL are limited to restitution and injunctive relief, and recovery of damages is not authorized. <em>(Chern </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 875; <em>Colgan </em>v. <em>Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In approving Proposition 64, the voters made identical findings regarding the UCL and FAL, and amended Business &amp; Professions Code section 17535 to impose the standing requirements and limits placed upon UCL actions. (Prop. 64, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5.) As amended, this section permits an individual to assert a claim under the FAL only if he or she \u201chas suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition\u201d (\u00a7 17535), and subjects representative actions by individuals to the requirements of class actions. Buckland\u2019s FAL claim thus fails as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The order denying injunctive relief and judgment of dismissal are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Willhite, Acting P.

Although Buckland did not file a notice of appeal from the judgments of dismissal, we conclude that she may properly challenge the judgments on appeal. Buckland noticed an appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction, which is a separately appealable order. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(6).) Because the denial of injunctive relief rests solely on the order sustaining Threshold\u2019s demurrer, our review properly encompasses the latter as an \u201cintermediate mling . . . which involves the merits or necessarily affects the . . . order appealed from.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906.) Moreover, as Buckland elected to stand on her complaint, the mling on the demurrer also effectively ended litigation on her claims against Threshold and the other respondents, as alleged in the first amended complaint. Because respondents do not suggest they have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>misled about the scope of Buckland\u2019s appeal, we construe Buckland\u2019s appeal as also taken from the judgments of dismissal. <em>(Boyer v.

[\u00b6] (g) It is the intent of California voters in enacting this act that the Attorney General, district attorneys, county counsels, and city attorneys maintain their public protection authority and capability under the unfair competition laws. [\u00b6] (h) It is the intent of California voters in enacting this act to require that civil penalty payments be used by the Attorney General, district attorneys, county counsels, and city attorneys to strengthen the enforcement of California\u2019s unfair competition and consumer protection laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> On appeal, Buckland suggests that her injury in fact includes \u201cthe personal health risk she incurred\u201d from one of the many defendants\u2019 products, an apparent allusion to her declaration statement that she used an unspecified product. To the extent this constitutes an offer to amend her complaint, it fails to cure the complaint\u2019s defects. Generally, a party seeking to amend a complaint on appeal has the burden of \u201cenumerate[ing] the facts and demonstrate[ing] how those facts establish a cause of action.\u201d <em>(Cantu </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corp., supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at p. 890.) Here, Buckland never alleges she used any specified <em>respondent\u2019s </em>product; nor does she identify the risk or explain how it constitutes an injury in fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\"> Generally, \u201c[i]n construing constitutional and statutory provisions, whether enacted by the Legislature or by initiative, the intent of the enacting body is the paramount consideration.\u201d <em>(In re Lance </em>W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 889 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].) To determine this intent, we look first to the plain language of the law, read in context. <em>(People ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 301 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042].) \u201cAbsent ambiguity, we presume that the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure ....\u2019\u2019 <em>(Lesher Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Walnut Creek </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 543 [277 Cal.Rptr. 1, 802 P.2d 317], citation omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><em> </em>In so concluding, we do not address whether Buckland\u2019s other allegations may establish an injury in fact. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d requirement under article HI of the United States Constitiution \u201cturns on the nature and source of the claim asserted,\u201d and in some cases, an injury in fact \u201cmay exist solely by virtue of \u2018statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Warth v. Seldin, supra, </em>422 U.S. at p. 510, quoting <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D. </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 614, 617, fn. 3 [35 L.Ed.2d 536, 93 S.Ct. 1146].) Thus, in <em>Havens, </em>the court concluded that an individual who had acted as a \u201ctester\u201d\u2014that is, posed as a prospective renter to determine the defendants\u2019 conduct\u2014alleged an injury in fact, even though she lacked any intent to obtain housing, because the Fair Housing Act accorded a cause of action to \u201cany person\u201d who had received false information about housing opportunities (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(d)), and the tester alleged the defendants had made false statements about available apartments. <em>(Havens, supra, </em>455 U.S. at pp. 366-369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Here, Buckland suggests she has standing under the UCL because Threshold allegedly violated interests protected by the FDCA, Health and Safety Code section 111330, and the statutes underlying her other claims against Threshold. Because we conclude Buckland has not satisfied the other UCL standing requirement\u2014namely, that she \u201clost money or property as a result of . . . unfair competition\u201d (see pt. D.2., <em>post), </em>we need not address this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> Business and Professions Code section 17203 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court may make such orders or judgments, including the appointment of a receiver, as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition, as defined in this chapter, or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\"> In so concluding, we do not hold that the standing requirement at issue incorporates a requirement of actual reliance. That issue is presently before our Supreme Court. <em>(Pfizer, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 290 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 840], review granted July 11, 2006, S145775.) Our conclusion is limited to the special facts presented here, which involve an individual who voluntarily buys defendant\u2019s product to pursue a UCL action in the public interest against defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> In light of this conclusion and our conclusions about Buckland\u2019s other claims, it is unnecessary for us to resolve other issues addressed on appeal, including whether the FDCA preempts Buckland\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
