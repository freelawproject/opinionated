J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAn\">In this case of first impression in California, we hold that when a plaintiff\u2019s deliberate and egregious misconduct makes any sanction other than dismissal inadequate to ensure a fair trial, the trial court has inherent power to impose a terminating sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In 1991, plaintiff Stephen Slesinger, Inc. (SSI), sued defendant the Walt Disney Company (Disney), alleging that Disney failed to pay certain royalties under its licensing agreement with SSI. That agreement granted Disney rights to exploit the Winnie the Pooh series of children\u2019s stories\u2014rights that SSI\u2019s founder had obtained in 1930 from Pooh\u2019s creator, A.A. Milne. In 1992 or 1993, to assist in prosecuting its lawsuit, SSI hired an investigator to surreptitiously obtain Disney documents. Other than a purported admonition to obey the law, SSI provided no direction or supervision for the investigator\u2019s activities. Working at least until 1995, the investigator took thousands of pages belonging to Disney, including documents marked privileged and confidential. He obtained the documents by breaking into an uncertain number of Disney office buildings and secure trash receptacles, and by trespassing onto the secure facility of the company with which Disney had contracted to destroy its confidential documents. The documents were passed on to SSI\u2019s attorneys and principals, who reviewed them, but kept no records of the documents they received or of those they discarded. Until 2002, SSI concealed the investigator\u2019s activities from Disney and the court. In 2004, following an evidentiary hearing on a motion by Disney for a terminating sanction, the trial court concluded that no lesser sanction could protect Disney against SSI\u2019s use of illicitly obtained information. Therefore, as an exercise of its inherent power, the court dismissed SSI\u2019s lawsuit with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">On SSI\u2019s appeal from the terminating sanction, we conclude that California trial courts have inherent power to issue a terminating sanction when a plaintiff\u2019s misconduct is deliberate, is egregious, and makes lesser sanctions inadequate to ensure a fair trial. Because substantial evidence shows that SSI\u2019s misconduct meets this standard, we also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing SSI\u2019s case as an exercise of the court\u2019s inherent power.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">1. <em>The Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">British author A.A. Milne created the Winnie the Pooh series of children\u2019s stories. In 1930, Stephen Slesinger acquired from Milne the rights to commercially exploit the works in the United States and Canada. Stephen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Slesinger formed a corporation, SSI, to which he assigned the Pooh rights. In 1961, SSI licensed certain rights of commercial exploitation to Disney. SSI and Disney modified their licensing agreement several times. In 1983, they executed a new contract, which became the focus of the instant litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">In February 1991, SSI sued Disney for breach of contract, fraud, and declaratory relief. In the operative third amended complaint, SSI alleged that Disney breached its contractual obligations to account and pay for its exploitation of the Pooh rights under the 1983 agreement, including sales of Pooh merchandise. SSI also alleged that during the negotiations leading to the 1983 agreement Disney misrepresented, among other things, the items for which it would pay royalties, and that Disney thereafter misrepresented its compliance with its contractual obligations to account for royalties. In its declaratory relief claim, SSI sought a declaration that it could terminate the contract based on Disney\u2019s breaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Lengthy, bitter litigation followed, occasioned by claims and counterclaims of misconduct. In 2001, SSI obtained evidentiary and monetary sanctions against Disney for destroying substantial portions of the files of Vincent H. Jefferds, a senior Disney vice-president who was Disney\u2019s principal representative in negotiating the 1983 licensing agreement. A key dispute in SSI\u2019s lawsuit involves representations allegedly made by Jefferds during the negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Having obtained sanctions against Disney, however, SSI fell victim to its own litigation abuses. In 2003, Disney moved for a terminating sanction against SSI, alleging that SSI had committed pervasive misconduct. In February 2004, the trial court (a different judge from the one who had sanctioned Disney) held a five-day evidentiary hearing on Disney\u2019s motion. The evidence was complex and conflicting; it included, among other things, live testimony, deposition testimony, witness declarations, correspondence between the parties, and prior discovery pleadings. What emerged was a portrait of litigation misconduct run riot, involving SSI\u2019s employment of an investigator, Terry Lee Sands, to take documents from Disney facilities and trash receptacles as well as the secure facility of the document destruction firm retained by Disney. We summarize the entire record under the applicable standard of review: in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling terminating SSI\u2019s lawsuit, drawing all inferences in support of the trial court\u2019s ruling which are reasonably supported by the evidence. (See <em>Laguna Auto Body </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487, 491 [82 Cal.Rptr. 530] <em>(Laguna).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>2. <em>SSI\u2019s Principals and Agents, and the Hiring of Terry Lee Sands</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">SSI is a family-run corporation. During the period relevant to this appeal, its sole corporate officer (President) and sole board member was Shirley Slesinger Lasswell, widow of SSI\u2019s founder Stephen Slesinger. Lasswell was responsible for managing SSL She lived in Florida, and kept SSI\u2019s Winnie the Pooh files in her office there. Lasswell died while this appeal was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">SSI\u2019s sole shareholder is Pati Slesinger, Lasswell\u2019s daughter by Stephen Slesinger. Pati Slesinger managed SSI\u2019s lawsuit against Disney from the inception, keeping in close contact with Lasswell.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">One of SSI\u2019s agents was David Bentson, Pati Slesinger\u2019s husband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bentson performed many tasks to assist SSI in its lawsuit, and worked directly with Terry Lee Sands, the investigator whose conduct lies at the heart of Disney\u2019s sanction motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Sands was never a licensed private investigator. Nonetheless, in 1992 or 1993 he was working for the Nick Harris Detective Agency when the agency was hired by SSI\u2019s then attorney, Marshall Morgan, to work on SSI\u2019s lawsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Within a month, Sands began working directly with David Bentson and Attorney Morgan. His assignment was to help SSI prosecute its lawsuit by surreptitiously obtaining Disney documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Sands\u2019s employment lasted at least until 1995, and probably longer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on the advice of SSI\u2019s counsel, Bentson admonished Sands to \u201cmake sure what you\u2019re doing is legal and that you do it by the book.\u201d Bentson, however, took no steps to ensure that Sands obeyed the admonition. As Bentson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>testified at the sanction hearing, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my job. . . . All I did was pay his bills . . . [and] receive[] documents.\u201d Bentson would pass the documents delivered by Sands on to SSI\u2019s attorneys. He also reviewed at least some of them. Those he believed might be of interest to Lasswell he faxed to her in Florida. In his sanction hearing testimony, he did not know how many documents he faxed to Lasswell; \u201cIt could have been two, it could have been five.\u201d Bentson and Pati Slesinger also reviewed some of the documents together at the offices of SSI\u2019s lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">With no supervision by SSI, Sands was free to obtain Disney documents as he saw fit. Although SSI first employed Sands in 1992 or 1993 to take Disney documents, it did not reveal that fact until March 2002. In the interim, Disney\u2019s knowledge of Sands\u2019s activities evolved by starts and spurts, beginning with two anonymous telephone calls received by Disney security in June 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">3. <em>The Anonymous June 1994 Calls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Disney security received the first anonymous call on June 1, 1994. According to the report of the call prepared by a Disney security officer, the caller said that \u201che worked for a David B. (unknown last name)\u201d and \u201cworked with a Terry Lee Sands.\u201d The caller explained that \u201che and Terry knew when Disney had their pick-up days for trash and went to their dumpster locations, broke in and took copies of documents that included contracts and royalties for the animated feature Winnie The Poo[h]. . . . [T]hey would take paperwork from locations in Northridge, Burbank, Glendale and trash cans on Flower Street. [][]... [T]here was even one incident where they were able to get [past] the security guard at the Olive Building[,] enter some of the offices and take documents (i.e., contracts) off the desks.\u201d The caller said that he was giving Disney this information because he had not been paid for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The second call occurred two weeks later, on June 14, 1994. According to the security report, the caller reiterated that \u201che and Terry Lee Sands were hired by David Ben[t]son/Brenner to go through Disney trash and take contracts, papers and other documents relating to a court case going on now involving licensees, contracts and underpayment of royalties by Disney for \u2018Winnie the Pooh\u2019 items. . . . [T]hey were able to obtain information that would be harmful to Disney if it ever came out.\u201d The caller said that he was \u201cupset\u201d because \u201cDavid and Terry\u201d had learned of his first call and \u201cwere after him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Disney security investigated the calls, but found no reports that documents were missing. Further, a \u201cpersonnel history\u201d on Terry Lee Sands produced no information. Therefore, Disney security placed the investigation \u201cin abeyance\u201d awaiting further developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Disney did not learn the identity of the anonymous caller until November 2002, when it deposed Richard Dale Holman, Sr., one of Terry Lee Sands\u2019s associates. In his deposition testimony, Holman, Sr., admitted that he had made the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">4. <em>SSI\u2019s Possession of the Restricted Items List</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">After Disney security\u2019s 1994 inquiry, the next significant development occurred in October 1997. Then, in a letter to Disney attorneys that served as a prelude to discovery litigation, SSI\u2019s counsel revealed that SSI had \u201crecently found\u201d certain documents in its file, and had \u201cno record as to the source.\u201d The documents were pages from the \u201cRestricted Items List,\u201d a 278-page document maintained by Disney\u2019s in-house counsel. The document summarized information relating to Disney\u2019s exclusive licenses with third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">As created by Disney, the cover page of the Restricted Items List declared the document to be confidential. Further, the document included a 24-page section labeled \u201cCorporate Participants.\u201d A footer at the bottom of each page of this section stated: \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u2014For Internal Use Only.\u201d The pages disclosed by SSI, however, did not include the cover page or any page bearing the confidentiality footer.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Characterizing the pages as \u201cprivileged internal documents,\u201d Disney demanded their return and an explanation for SSI\u2019s possession of them. In a series of correspondence, SSI\u2019s attorneys refused to return the documents, denied that SSI had any knowledge about how it came to possess them, and filed a motion to require Disney to turn over more such documents. SSI asserted, among other things, that nothing on the documents indicated that they were privileged or confidential, or that Disney treated them as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">On October 27, 1997, Disney deposed Shirley Lasswell.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In her deposition testimony, Lasswell testified that she had never heard of Terry Lee Sands. She denied having hired an investigator \u201cwith respect to Winnie the Pooh issues,\u201d and denied having authorized anyone in her family to do so. Asked if she knew SSI was taking documents from Disney offices and trash, she replied: \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>don\u2019t know where you got that from. I don\u2019t know anything like that. I don\u2019t recall anything like that.\u201d Confronted with a copy of the Restricted Items List recently produced by SSI, Lasswell testified that she did not recognize the documents and did not know what they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">After Lasswell\u2019s October 1997 deposition, Lasswell asked Pati Slesinger why she had been questioned about SSI\u2019s use of an investigator to take documents. Slesinger told her that an investigator had been retained to go through Disney\u2019s \u201cgarbage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Because SSI refused to return the confidential documents from the Restricted Items List, Disney moved for a protective order in March 1998. SSI\u2019s opposition to that request reiterated that it had no reason to believe the documents were confidential and insisted it did not know how it obtained them. Before the motion was heard, however, SSI agreed to return \u201call copies\u201d it had. Accepting that representation, Disney took its motion for a protective order off calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">5. <em>SSI\u2019s Possession of the Patterson Memorandum and the Kaplan Note</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In November 1999, SSI revealed to Disney that it possessed the so-called \u201cPatterson Memorandum\u201d and the \u201cKaplan Note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The Patterson Memorandum was written on Disney letterhead by Thomas Patterson, a Disney accountant, to Carrie Stone, Disney\u2019s vice-president of merchandising. The memorandum is undated. However, Carrie Stone worked for Disney only from October 1995 to May 1998. Therefore, the memorandum was written sometime during that period, at least four and a half years after SSI filed suit in February 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">In the memorandum, Patterson requested \u201ca full breakdown on all Pooh merchandising for the years \u201985 to \u201990, to complete [his] research for Corporate Legal.\u201d He then stated: \u201cThere appears to be faulty accounting at best, on the audits we discussed. There is also a tremendous amount of returned goods I can not account for. It appears most records have been stored on disk and removed from the AS-400 system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The \u201cKaplan Note\u201d is handwritten, dated October 8, on Disney letterhead. Its designation comes from the notation that a copy was sent to Larry Kaplan, a Disney attorney. The note reads: \u201cI think it would be advantageous on our part if we moved all the Slesinger files to our Southern location K-3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>When produced by SSI, neither the Patterson Memorandum nor the Kaplan Note bore a Bates stamp that would indicate that Disney had produced it in discovery. Moreover, as Disney later learned, SSI had redacted fax transmission headers showing that the Kaplan Note had been sent from Slesinger\u2019s office to SSI\u2019s counsel\u2014a fax transmission consistent with Bentson\u2019s practice of receiving documents from Sands, and faxing them to SSI\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Over the next six months, Disney repeatedly sought an explanation for SSI\u2019s possession of the two documents. SSI insisted it did not know how or why it came to have them.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In January 2000, SSI served discovery responses, verified by Lasswell, stating that both the Patterson Memorandum and the Kaplan Note had been \u201cproduced by Disney\u201d in discovery and that SSI had no other Disney documents that lacked a Bates stamp. By that time, Pati Slesinger had told Lasswell that SSI used an investigator to search Disney\u2019s \u201cgarbage.\u201d Also, of course, Pati Slesinger and David Bentson were well aware of Sands\u2019s activities. But Lasswell\u2019s verified discovery response on behalf of SSI made no mention of Sands as the source of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Not satisfied with SSI\u2019s explanation, Disney demanded clarification: \u201cPut bluntly, someone associated with SSI received these [two] documents and thus knows the \u2018means by which\u2019 SSI came into possession of them.\u201d SSI\u2019s response, again verified by Shirley Lasswell, was: \u201cSSI believes [each] document was produced by Disney. [Each] document appears to be written by Disney personnel. SSI does not recall further specific details responsive to this request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">6. <em>SSI\u2019s Disclosure of Sands\u2019s Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Not until the March 12, 2002 deposition of Pati Slesinger did SSI acknowledge that it had employed Terry Lee Sands to take Disney documents. In that deposition, Slesinger testified that a prior SSI attorney, Marshall Morgan, had hired a detective agency, Nick Harris Detectives. Slesinger had met with one of the detectives, Terry Lee Sands, whom SSI employed \u201c[j]ust to obtain information,\u201d including documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">On June 10, 2002, Disney served Sands with a notice of deposition and a request that he produce copies of all documents found in his investigation for SSL However, when Sands appeared for the deposition in September 2002, he produced no documents. He testified that when served with the subpoena on June 10, he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any documents.\u201d Later evidence revealed that SSI\u2019s then attorneys (Greenberg Glusker; see fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>were in possession of the so-called \u201cJune 7, 2002 File,\u201d consisting of 560 pages contained in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>folder labeled \u201cDocuments Received from Terry Sands on 6/7/02,\u201d a date three days before Sands was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">During his deposition, Sands admitted that he had taken Disney documents, but testified that he had done so only from publicly accessible dumpsters. He also testified that he kept no records of the documents he had given to SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">After Sands\u2019s deposition, Disney immediately wrote SSI, demanding \u201ccopies of all of the documents and other materials taken from Disney\u2019s trash receptacles or other locations or surreptitiously received from any person.\u201d Through counsel, SSI responded that \u201cthe discarded papers\u201d Sands had found \u201cwere never used in the litigation in any way. . . . [T]hey have had no impact on the proceedings at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">7. <em>SSI\u2019s Production of More Than 6,000 Pages of Disney Documents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In October 2002, pursuant to subpoenas issued by Disney, SSI began producing what turned out to be more than 6,000 pages of Disney documents taken by Sands. The documents were produced from files maintained by Pati Slesinger, Shirley Lasswell and SSI\u2019s counsel. The documents were accompanied by a multipage redaction log showing that SSI had redacted handwritten comments as being privileged on the grounds of attorney-client and work product privilege. As to those with a designated author, 48 of the redacted comments were written by Pati Slesinger and 14 by David Bentson. Also, SSI represented that it had discarded many of the Disney documents that Sands had taken, and that it had no record about which documents it discarded and when.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Among the documents SSI did produce were the following,</p>\n<p id=\"AIW\">i. <em>Two Versions of the Restricted Items List</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">We have already mentioned the Restricted Items List\u2014the 278-page document maintained by Disney\u2019s in-house counsel summarizing information relating to Disney\u2019s exclusive licenses with third parties. In October 1997, when SSI first revealed to Disney that it possessed pages of the document, SSI represented that nothing on the pages it possessed suggested they were confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">In 2002, however, SSI produced to Disney two copies of the Restricted Items List. The first copy came from the files of SSI\u2019s attorneys. It contained the cover page as created by Disney with the declaration of confidentiality. It also contained the 24-page \u201cCorporate Participants\u201d section with the footer on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>each page declaring: \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u2014For Internal Use Only.\u201d The second copy came from files maintained by Pati Slesinger. The cover page in this copy lacked the confidentiality declaration that appeared on the Disney original. This copy also lacked the 24-page confidential Corporate Participants section.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">ii. <em>Two Versions of the Interrogatory Tables</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The \u201cInterrogatory Tables\u201d are a series of documents prepared by Disney Consumer Products relating to Winnie the Pooh products for the period 1990 to 1993. As created by Disney, each page of the tables had a footer reading: \u201cAttorney Work Product. [][] Privileged and confidential. Created at the request of Counsel.\u201d No copy of the tables originating from Disney lacked this footer.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">SSI produced two sets of the Interrogatory Tables. One set, from counsel\u2019s files, contained the confidentiality footer. The other set, from Pati Slesinger\u2019s files, did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">iii. <em>The Fuller Memorandum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The \u201cFuller Memorandum\u201d was written by Kathy Fuller, a legal assistant for Disney, on \u201cOffice of Counsel\u201d stationary and dated July 21, 1993. It was directed to Edward Nowak, Disney\u2019s senior in-house litigation attorney handling SSI\u2019s lawsuit. Fuller wrote the memorandum to help prepare Disney\u2019s defense in the case. The subject line reads: \u201cSlesinger v. Disney.\u201d The following legend appears immediately above the text of the memorandum: \u201cPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL.\u201d In the memorandum, Fuller refers to Attorney Nowak\u2019s inquiry \u201cregarding how \u2018merchandise\u2019 sales differ from videocassette sales.\u201d The memorandum analyzes the definition of \u201cmerchandise\u201d and discusses one of the key issues in the lawsuit: whether Disney was contractually obligated to pay SSI royalties on the sale of Winnie the Pooh videocassettes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, the Fuller Memorandum is one of the documents from which SSI redacted notations made by Pati Slesinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>iv. <em>The Suit Overview Document</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The \u201cSuit Overview Document\u201d is an eight-page document prepared by Disney\u2019s strategic planning department in consultation with its attorneys. The document, though apparently a preliminary draft, distilled the central issues of the lawsuit and assigned a risk analysis to potential outcomes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">All draft copies of the document found in Disney\u2019s files had a cover page declaring, \u201cPrivileged &amp; Confidential\u2014Attorney Work Product.\u201d However, the copy produced by SSI lacked that cover page.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">v. <em>The June 7, 2002 File</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">We have already mentioned the June 7, 2002 File\u2014the file folder that was labeled \u201cDocuments Received From Terry Sands on 6/7/02,\u201d and that contained 560 pages of Disney documents, including an internal Disney News Summary dated June 5, 2002. In September 2003, SSI\u2019s then counsel (Jones Day) produced the file, which it had received from SSI\u2019s immediately preceding counsel (Greenberg Glusker). The file also contained, among other things, a July 1981 audit report addressed and delivered to Vincent Jefferds (the Disney senior vice-president who had negotiated the 1983 contract with SSI) and two complete files belonging to Disney executive Wendall Mohler. Mohler\u2019s files, which included memoranda written on \u201cOffice of Counsel\u201d letterhead, were in pristine condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">At the sanction hearing, SSI could provide no explanation for its counsel\u2019s possession of the contents of the file. Slesinger disclaimed any knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>the file. Sands did not recognize it. A representative of Greenberg Glusker did not know how the firm came to possess it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">8. <em>SSI\u2019s Motion Seeking Permission to Use the Patterson Memorandum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In the midst of disgorging Disney documents, SSI filed, in October 2002, a \u201cMotion Re Discarded Document.\u201d In the motion, SSI requested judicial approval to use the Patterson Memorandum at trial. Although SSI had earlier characterized the \u201cdiscarded\u201d Disney documents obtained by Sands as having \u201cno impact on the proceedings at all,\u201d SSI now characterized the Patterson Memorandum as \u201chighly relevant\u201d to its claim that Disney had defrauded SSI in accounting for Winnie the Pooh revenues. Further, although SSI had first represented that it did not know how it obtained the document, and had later represented (through Shirley Lasswell\u2019s verified discovery responses) that Disney had produced it during discovery, SSI now presented a different explanation: the document \u201cwas found in a Disney trash bin between 1992 and 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">SSI\u2019s motion was supported by declarations from Sands and David Bentson. In his declaration, Sands stated that at some point between \u201capproximately\u201d 1992 and 1995, he found the Patterson Memorandum in a publicly accessible dumpster at a Burbank Disney office, and delivered it to Bentson. In his declaration, Bentson explained that he recognized the Patterson Memorandum \u201cas one of the papers Mr. Sands brought to me from the [Disney] trash\u201d in the early to mid-1990\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">SSI\u2019s motion sought a ruling that by allegedly placing the memorandum in the trash, Disney had abandoned it and therefore waived the attorney-client privilege. SSI\u2019s motion was pending when, in February 2003, Disney moved for a terminating sanction based on SSI\u2019s \u201cpervasive misconduct and illegal activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>9. <em>The Scope of Sands\u2019s Searches</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">At the sanction hearing SSI did not dispute that it employed Sands to take Disney documents. It contended, however, that Sands took documents from trash dumpsters at only one location\u2014the Buena Vista Plaza building at 2411 West Olive in Burbank. It also contended that the dumpsters were accessible to the public, and that Sands violated no law.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In addition to the Buena Vista Plaza building, Disney conducts business at three other locations in Burbank and two in Glendale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From 1990 to 1997, Disney contracted with Golden State Fibres (Golden State) to collect and destroy confidential Disney documents from its four Burbank facilities. Golden State\u2019s document destruction facility is located in Canoga Park; it is secure, surrounded by fences and walls. Golden State handled its responsibilities as follows. Golden State supplied the main studio lot with locking, three-cubic yard metal bins in which documents slated for destruction were placed. The bins were placed inside of the gated and guarded perimeter of the studio lot, an area not open or accessible to the public. Once a week, Golden State employees came to the lot, locked the bins, loaded the bins onto a flatbed truck, secured the bins with rope, and transported them to Canoga Park. At the three other Burbank Disney locations (including the Buena Vista Plaza), Golden State provided floor bins, which were placed inside the Disney offices in areas not available or accessible to the public. Golden State employees collected the documents from the containers, placed them in plastic carts, and loaded the carts into locked trucks for transport to Canoga Park. Generally, Golden State destroyed documents the day of receipt. If not, the locked bins taken from the main studio lot were locked inside of Golden State\u2019s plant and the carts containing the documents from the other Disney facilities remained in the trucks (secured by padlocks) parked inside of the Golden State facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Sands began his activities by obtaining an internal Disney directory to help locate the offices of various individuals. In testimony specifically disbelieved by the trial court, Sands claimed to have consulted the police, who told him that \u201cthere was no law prohibiting [his] going into a dumpster located next to a public alleyway.\u201d He also claimed, again in testimony specifically disbelieved by the trial court, to have ultimately obtained documents only from publicly accessible dumpsters at the Buena Vista Plaza building, and never to have obtained documents from the Golden State facility in Canoga Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>At some point in 1994 or 1995, Pati Slesinger and David Bentson visited the Buena Vista Plaza site by stopping their car nearby and looking at it. They wanted to confirm that it was, according to Slesinger\u2019s testimony at the sanction hearing, \u201copen and public, and I guess . . . legal, too.\u201d Slesinger found the site to be \u201con a publicly accessible road,\u201d and hence she determined that Sands\u2019s seizure of documents from the site \u201cseemed, yes,\u201d legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Despite Sands\u2019s testimony that he searched only publicly accessible dumpsters at the Buena Vista Plaza building in Burbank, there was considerable evidence (credited by the trial court) that his searches were much broader, and included Golden State\u2019s secure facility in Canoga Park. Earlier statements by Sands himself contradicted the notion that he limited his searches to one location, and suggested two or more locations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, although Sands denied taking documents from Golden State, he testified that he knew Golden State destroyed Disney\u2019s documents, and that he followed Golden State\u2019s trucks from at least one Disney building to that location.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In the first of his two anonymous telephone calls to Disney security in 1994, Richard Holman, Sr., reported that he and Sands took documents from \u201clocations in Northridge, Burbank, Glendale and trash cans on Flower Street\u201d and on one occasion \u201cwere able to get [past] the security guard at the Olive Building[,] enter some of the offices and take documents (i.e., contracts) off the desks.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Holman, Sr.\u2019s son, Richard Dale Holman, Jr., provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>declaration from which it could be inferred that Sands took documents from Golden State and another facility. In the declaration, Holman, Jr., stated that he \u201cwent on a few trash searches\u201d with Sands. Bom in August 1980, Holman, Jr., would have been 12 to 15 years old in the period 1992 to 1995. According to Holman, Jr., \u201c[t]wo searches occurred at the \u2018waste management\u2019 facility in the San Femando Valley. A third search occurred farther west in the San Fernando Valley. Likely Reseda or Canoga Park. At this location, Terry and I went onto the property through a hole in the fence at the back of the property. Terry said I went along as an alibi in case a security guard came. During all three searches, I held a duffel bag while it was [filled] with legal documents. During all three searches, we removed approximately 7 or 8 inches tall of documents.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Golden State\u2019s Canoga Park facility was secure, surrounded by fences and walls. Thus, Holman, Jr.\u2019s claim to have entered a Canoga Park or Reseda facility with Sands through a hole in the fence, and to have held a duffel bag while Sands filled it with documents, suggested that Sands illegally entered Golden State\u2019s facility, and stole, from either locked trucks or the locked plant, Disney documents that were intended for destruction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Finally, the nature of some of the documents Sands passed on to SSI suggested that he could not have obtained them from the Buena Vista Plaza building. Neither the author of the Patterson Memorandum (Thomas Patterson), nor its intended recipient (Carrie Stone), ever worked at Buena Vista Plaza. The Restricted Items List was kept by Disney\u2019s in-house counsel, whose office was in The Tower building located on West Alameda in Burbank. Kathy Fuller, author of the Fuller Memorandum, and the intended recipient (Disney Attorney Edward Nowak) worked at the Team Disney building, located on the Disney Studio lot at 500 South Buena Vista. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Similarly, Disney\u2019s strategic planning department, which prepared the Suit Overview Document, was located in the Team Disney building. Finally, the June 7, 2002 File contained an audit report sent to Vincent Jefferds (the Disney senior vice-president who negotiated the 1983 contract with SSI), and two complete files in pristine form belonging to another Disney executive, Wendall Mohler. Neither Jefferds nor Mohler ever worked at Buena Vista Plaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">No evidence suggested how these various documents could have ended up in the trash at the Buena Vista Plaza building. There was, however, evidence suggesting how the documents, nonetheless, ended up in SSI\u2019s possession. Either Sands entered one or more of Disney\u2019s Burbank facilities and took the documents from the bins provided by Golden State for disposal of confidential documents or Sands trespassed onto Golden State\u2019s facility in Canoga Park and took the documents before Golden State had a chance to destroy them.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">10. <em>SSI\u2019s Alteration of Disney Documents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Disney presented circumstantial evidence that Pati Slesinger or someone else on SSI\u2019s behalf altered copies of the Restricted Items List and the Interrogatory Tables after receiving them from Sands to delete any reference to their confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">At the sanction hearing, Erich Speckin, a forensic document specialist, testified that he had examined the two copies of the Restricted Items List and of the Interrogatory Tables produced by SSI in 2002. As we have already noted, the copy of Restricted Items List from the files of SSI\u2019s attorneys contained the cover page with the declaration of confidentiality as created by Disney, and the 24-page Corporate Participants section with the footer on each page declaring: \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u2014For Internal Use Only.\u201d The copy from Pati Slesinger\u2019s files, however, contained a cover page that lacked the confidentiality declaration. Also, Slesinger\u2019s copy did not contain the 24-page confidential Corporate Participants section.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Similarly, the copy of the Interrogatory Tables from the files of SSI\u2019s attorneys contained the footer created by Disney on each page declaring: \u201cAttorney Work Product, [f] Privileged and confidential. Created at the request of Counsel.\u201d But the copy from Slesinger\u2019s files lacked the footer.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">According to Speckin, Slesinger\u2019s copies of the documents were made from the sets possessed by SSI\u2019s counsel. In other words, Slesinger or someone else had: (1) altered the cover page of the Restricted Items List to delete its confidentiality declaration in Slesinger\u2019s copy; (2) omitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>24-page confidential Corporate Participants section from Slesinger\u2019s copy; and (3) altered each page of the Interrogatory Tables to delete its confidentiality footer in Slesinger\u2019s copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Pati Slesinger denied having altered the documents or having directed anyone else to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">11. <em>The Fax Legends</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Copies of several documents produced by SSI contained facsimile (fax) legends tracing them to Slesinger and Lasswell\u2019s offices, as well as the offices of SSI\u2019s counsel. Among these documents was a copy of the Fuller Memorandum, which contained a fax header indicating that in September 1993 it was sent to SSI\u2019s attorneys from Slesinger\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Similarly, a copy of a page from the Interrogatory Tables contained a legend showing the fax numbers of Pati Slesinger\u2019s office in Beverly Hills and Shirley Lasswell\u2019s office in Florida. The legend indicated that in September 1993, the page was faxed from Slesinger\u2019s office to Lasswell\u2019s office. The page contained the footer stating the page to be confidential. A copy of the Kaplan Note produced by SSI also bore two fax legends, one indicating it had been sent from Slesinger\u2019s office and another indicating receipt by SSI\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">12. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling on Disney\u2019s Sanction Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">SSI\u2019s opposition to Disney\u2019s sanction motion raised three primary arguments: first, that Sands had taken documents only from publicly accessible dumpsters at the Buena Vista Plaza; second, that Disney had created both confidential and nonconfidential sets of the Restricted Items List and Interrogatory Tables, and SSI had not altered the copies in its possession; and third, that none of the documents taken by Sands was useful to SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The trial court issued a comprehensive statement of decision. The court found that Sands had taken documents from multiple Disney locales and the Golden State facility (committing civil trespass in the process), and that SSI had either explicitly or implicitly authorized his activities. Expressly finding Pati Slesinger not credible, the court found that she (or someone else on SSI\u2019s behalf) had altered documents to make it appear they were not confidential. With respect to Shirley Lass well, the court noted that although in her 1997 deposition testimony she denied knowing of Sands\u2019s activity, there were fax transmission headers to and from Lasswell\u2019s Florida office on some of the confidential Disney documents taken by Sands. The court found that Sands\u2019s and SSI\u2019s failure to keep records of the documents obtained by Sands and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>those discarded by SSI was not \u201caccidental,\u201d because SSI did not want the scope of Sands\u2019s activities disclosed. Further, the court reasoned that SSI could give no satisfactory assurance that it had produced all the illicitly obtained documents it possessed, leading the court to conclude that SSI likely possessed additional such documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Concerning the Disney documents SSI did produce, the court found them to \u201creveal, among other things, privileged information useful to . . . SSI.\u201d The court considered, but rejected, lesser sanctions, including an order that SSI return all Disney documents, and an order for monetary sanctions. The court reasoned that \u201cSSI\u2019s principals who read Disney\u2019s writings possess in their minds information which no Court order or sanction can purge. The Court does not believe SSI will comply fully with any future remedial order if SSI concludes, as it apparently has in the past, that compliance with a court order does not serve its private tactical objectives.\u201d The court concluded; \u201c[SSI] has tampered with the administration of justice and threatened the integrity of the judicial process. SSI\u2019s misconduct is so egregious that no remedy short of terminating sanctions can effectively remove the threat and adequately protect both the institution of justice and [Disney] from further SSI abuse. Exercising its inherent powers to preserve and protect the integrity of the judicial process, the Court dismisses SSI\u2019s action with prejudice as a terminating sanction.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">13. <em>SSI\u2019s Motion for a New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">SSI moved for a new trial, limited to the issue of the appropriate remedy for SSI\u2019s misconduct. For the first time, SSI proposed an alternative to a terminating sanction, consisting of a change in trial counsel, employment of \u201cDocument Review Counsel\u201d to isolate tainted documents from new trial counsel, and a series of prophylactic court orders.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The proposal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>supported by declarations from SSI\u2019s attorneys who had reviewed the Disney documents taken by Sands. Each concluded that the documents \u201cwould add nothing to [SSI\u2019s] case.\u201d Further, SSI argued that its proposal did \u201cnot rely on promises or assurances by [SSI] or by its principals.\u201d SSI presented no declarations from Slesinger, Lasswell, or Bentson concerning their use or retention of stolen documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The trial court denied SSI\u2019s motion for a new trial. It explained that SSI\u2019s proposed remedy could not purge the illicitly obtained information from the minds of SSI\u2019s principals, and could not ensure that they would not use the information in shaping SSI\u2019s litigation strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">A. Inherent Power to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">SSI\u2019s presents a multifaceted challenge to the trial court\u2019s reliance on its inherent power to dismiss SSI\u2019s lawsuit. According to SSI, California trial courts have no inherent power to dismiss a case as a sanction for misconduct. Relying primarily on <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Wickhorst </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 911, 915 [231 Cal.Rptr. 738, 727 P.2d 1019] <em>(Lyons), </em>and <em>Bauguess v. Paine </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 626, 634-639 [150 Cal.Rptr. 461, 586 P.2d 942] <em>(Bauguess), </em>SSI asserts that a trial court\u2019s inherent power to terminate litigation is confined to cases in which the plaintiff has unreasonably delayed in prosecuting the action, or in which the plaintiff\u2019s claim is a sham or fictitious. Further, SSI argues that the existence of an inherent power to dismiss is inconsistent with the state constitutional right to a jury trial. Finally, SSI suggests that even if the inherent power to terminate an action for misconduct exists, the power can be exercised only when the party to be sanctioned has violated a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">None of SSI\u2019s contentions is well taken. SSI misconstrues <em>Lyons </em>and <em>Bauguess, </em>and misconceives the nature and scope of inherent judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>The doctrine of inherent judicial power\u2014that is, the existence of power vested in courts by their creation, and independent of legislative grant\u2014developed early in English common law \u201calong two paths, namely, . . . punishment for contempt of court and of its process, and . . . regulating the practice of the court and preventing the abuse of its process.\u201d (Jacob, <em>The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court </em>(1970) 23 Current Legal Problems 23, 25.) American courts embraced the doctrine as part of their common law heritage. As early expressed by the United States Supreme Court, courts possess powers that \u201cnecessarily result . . . from the nature of their institution,\u201d powers that \u201ccannot be dispensed with . . . , because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.\u201d <em>(United States v. Hudson </em>(1812) 11 U.S. 32, 34 [3 L.Ed. 259]; see Meador, <em>Inherent Judicial Authority in the Conduct of Civil Litigation </em>(1995) 73 Tex. L.Rev. 1805, 1806, 1815-1816 (Meador).)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">From their creation by article VI, section 1 of the California Constitution, California courts received broad inherent power \u201cnot confined by or dependent on statute.\u201d <em>(Walker v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 267 [279 Cal.Rptr. 576, 807 P.2d 418]; see also Civ. Code \u00a7 22.2;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Ferguson v. Keays </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 649, 654-655 [94 Cal.Rptr. 398, 484 P.2d 70] (Ferguson) [California courts possess inherent powers enjoyed by English common law courts, except for those precluded by Civ. Code, \u00a7 22.2].) This inherent power includes \u201cfundamental inherent equity, supervisory, and administrative powers, as well as inherent power to control litigation.\u201d <em>(Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 941 P.2d 1203].) Although it has been held that California courts have inherent authority to impose <em>evidentiary sanctions </em>as a remedy for litigation misconduct (see <em>Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 286-291 [245 Cal.Rptr. 873] <em>(Peat)), </em>no California decision has held that a court may, when faced with pervasive litigation abuse, use its inherent judicial power to <em>dismiss the action. </em>We have no doubt, however, that California courts possess such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Past California decisions have affirmed dismissals as an exercise of inherent power in two situations. First, because delay in prosecution interferes with the orderly process of litigation and may make a fair trial unlikely, California courts have inherent power to dismiss civil cases for unreasonable, inexcusable delay in prosecution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jefferds </em>(1899) 126 Cal. 296, 300-301 [58 P. 704]; <em>Karras </em>v. <em>Western Title Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 753, 757 [76 Cal.Rptr. 141].) Second, because courts should hear only actual disputes, and should prevent harassment of defendants, California courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>possess the inherent authority to dismiss cases that are fraudulent or \u201cvexatious.\u201d <em>(Estate of King </em>(1953) 121 Cal.App.2d 765, 774-775 [264 P.2d 586]; <em>Cunha v. Anglo California Nat. Bank </em>(1939) 34 Cal.App.2d 383, 388-390 [93 P.2d 572].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In <em>Lyons, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 911, the Supreme Court observed that \u201cin the past\u201d the inherent power to terminate litigation has \u201cbeen confined to [these] two types of situations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 915.) But this observation\u2014made as dicta\u2014is not an exhaustive listing of the circumstances in which dismissal as an exercise of inherent power is authorized. To the contrary, <em>Lyons </em>implicitly <em>acknowledged </em>that a court has inherent power to dismiss an action for misconduct that violates established procedures or a court order. <em>Lyons </em>held simply that the misconduct involved in that case\u2014the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to participate in mandatory judicial arbitration\u2014was not an adequate ground to exercise that power. A close examination of <em>Lyons </em>demonstrates the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In <em>Lyons, </em>the trial court ordered the parties to participate in mandatory judicial arbitration pursuant to the then current version of Code of Civil Procedure section 1141.11. <em>(Lyons, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 914.) The plaintiff refused, resulting in a defense award. The plaintiff requested a trial de novo, but on defense motion, the trial court dismissed the action as a sanction for the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to participate in the judicial arbitration. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 914.) On appeal (as here relevant), the majority opinion analyzed the dismissal in part as an exercise of inherent judicial power. Besides noting that past exercise of the inherent power to dismiss had been confined to cases involving failure to prosecute and fictitious or sham claims, the majority looked also to lower federal court decisions construing the power to dismiss under rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.) for a violation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or failure to comply with a court order. The majority recognized that federal courts have inherent power to \u201cdismiss an action sua sponte for the same reasons.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The <em>Lyons </em>majority summarized federal case law as follows: \u201cAs demonstrated by the federal cases construing rule 41(b), there are two important inquiries to be made by trial courts when determining whether a plaintiff\u2019s actions warrant a dismissal with prejudice. First, the court must discern whether the plaintiff\u2019s pattern of conduct was so \u2018severe [and] deliberate\u2019 as to constitute extreme circumstances. [Citation.] Second, the court must look to see whether alternatives less severe than dismissal are available. The \u2018 \u201csound exercise of discretion requires the judge to consider and use lesser sanctions\u201d \u2019 unless the court\u2019s authority cannot possibly be otherwise vindicated. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lyons, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 917.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The majority used this analysis to \u201cexamine the circumstances under which [the plaintiff\u2019s] motion for a trial de novo was dismissed.\u201d <em>(Lyons, supra, </em>42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 917.) The majority held that dismissal as a sanction for refusing to participate in mandatory judicial arbitration was \u201ctoo drastic a remedy in light of the fact that arbitration was not intended to supplant traditional trial proceedings, but to expedite the resolution of small civil claims.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 919.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">A three-justice minority agreed with the majority\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat dismissal here was too drastic a penalty for appellant\u2019s refusal to present evidence at the arbitration proceedings.\u201d <em>(Lyons, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 926 (conc. opn. of Reynoso, J.).) But the minority would have left \u201copen the question whether, in a particularly egregious case, a trial court would have inherent power to dismiss the action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 927 (conc. opn. of Reynoso, J.).)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Nothing in the <em>Lyons </em>majority precludes the use of inherent power to terminate litigation as a remedy for litigation misconduct <em>other than </em>refusal to participate in mandatory judicial arbitration. To the contrary, the <em>Lyons </em>majority acknowledges the existence of inherent power to dismiss an action for misconduct violating established procedures or a court order, but limits its exercise to \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d of deliberate misconduct when no lesser sanction would be effective to cure the harm. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 252, pp. 670-671 [citing <em>Lyons, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 917, and observing that the trial court\u2019s inherent power to dismiss is limited to \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d where \u201cthe court\u2019s authority \u2018cannot possibly be otherwise vindicated\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">SSI also argues that <em>Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626, militates against finding an inherent power to dismiss for litigation misconduct. In <em>Bauguess, </em>the Supreme Court held that trial courts have no authority to award attorney fees as a sanction for misconduct unless granted by statute or specified by contract. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 634-638.) The court recognized the existence of inherent judicial power to supervise judicial proceedings, but reasoned that inherent power to award attorney fees as a sanction was unnecessary, because courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>have \u201cample power to punish the misconduct as contempt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 638.) Moreover, the court concluded that approving such power was unwise, because it \u201cmay imperil the independence of the bar and thereby undermine the adversary system\u201d <em>(ibid.); </em>and because it would be \u201ca power without procedural limits and potentially subject to abuse\u201d <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The rationale of <em>Bauguess </em>does not apply here. Far from being unnecessary, the existence of inherent power to terminate litigation for deliberate and egregious misconduct\u2014conduct that makes lesser sanctions inadequate to ensure a fair trial\u2014is essential for the court to preserve the integrity of its proceedings. Such power does not \u201cimperil the independence of the bar\u201d and \u201cundermine the adversary system.\u201d <em>(Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 638.) Rather, it restores balance to the adversary system when the misconduct of one party has destroyed it. And, as illustrated by the instant case, such power can be exercised with full procedural due process: the trial court held a noticed evidentiary hearing, and SSI makes no claim that the procedure violated its due process rights. <em>Bauguess </em>is simply inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The recognition that California courts have inherent power to terminate litigation for deliberate and egregious misconduct when no other remedy can restore fairness is consistent with the overwhelming weight of authority from federal courts and courts of other states. (See Meador, <em>supra, </em>73 Tex. L.Rev. at p. 1815 [terminating sanctions are \u201cgenerally acknowledged to be within a court\u2019s inherent power,\u201d to be imposed only when lesser sanctions are inadequate].)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although nuances of analysis exist among these decisions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>general theory supporting them is straightforward: \u201cCourts cannot lack the power to defend their integrity against unscrupulous marauders; if that were so, it would place at risk the very fundament of the judicial system.\u201d (Aoude, <em>supra, </em>892 F.2d at p. 1119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">California courts, too, retain flexibility to exercise historic inherent authority in modem circumstances, fashioning procedures and remedies as necessary to protect litigants\u2019 rights. (See <em>Board of Supervisors v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 830, 848 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 560]; <em>Cottle v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1377-1378 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 882].) When a plaintiff\u2019s deliberate and egregious misconduct in the course of the litigation renders any sanction short of dismissal inadequate to protect the fairness of the trial, California courts necessarily have the power to preserve their integrity by dismissing the action. Without such power, the court would sacrifice its essential role of determining, in accordance with the fair application of relevant law, who should prevail in the case or controversy presented. (See <em>Schultz, supra, </em>638 N.W.2d at p. 612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">There are, of course, limits on the inherent authority of California courts\u2014inherent power may only be exercised to the extent not inconsistent with the federal or state Constitutions, or California statutory law. <em>(Ferguson, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 654-655; <em>Martin v. Superior Court </em>(1917) 176 Cal. 289, 293-295 [168 P. 135]; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 22.2.) SSI makes no claim that dismissal of the instant action violated federal constitutional principles (with good reason, given the state of federal case law). (See also <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Trinity Marine Group, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1997) 117 F.3d 894, 898-899 [dismissal of action for fabrication of evidence following evidentiary hearing does not violate right to a jury trial].)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The only state constitutional impediment asserted by SSI is the right to a jury trial under article I, section 16 of the California Constitution. SSI argues that without statutory authorization, litigation misconduct cannot constitute a \u201cwaiver\u201d of the right to a jury trial. (See <em>Grafton Partners </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 967 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 5, 116 P.3d 479] [invalidating predispute contractual jury waivers on the ground that waiver of a jury trial in civil cases is permitted only as authorized by statute].) But the exercise of the inherent power to dismiss for deliberate and egregious misconduct does not rely on the fiction of an implied jury trial waiver. It relies, rather, on the power the court derives from its nature as an institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>of justice, and on the acknowledgement that the right to a jury trial presupposes a fair trial, and that requiring a jury trial when fairness cannot be assured would be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Further, the exercise of the inherent power to dismiss, like all inherent authority, derives in part from the court\u2019s historic powers in equity. (See <em>Peat, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 287; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Wayne Co, supra, </em>533 N.W.2d at p. 14; <em>Aoude, supra, </em>892 F.2d at p. 1119.) Equitable defenses are tried to the judge alone; the judge\u2019s findings may well obviate a jury trial on remaining legal issues, without abridging the right to a jury trial. (See <em>Nwosu v. Uba </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1238 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 416].) When a court grants a motion seeking dismissal on the basis of the opposing party\u2019s misconduct, the court does not violate the right to a jury trial, any more than when the court upholds other defenses in equity that defeat the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit. (See <em>Schultz, supra, </em>638 N.W.2d at p. 615 [holding evidentiary hearing, making credibility findings, and assessing need for sanctions does not violate right to a jury trial under Wisconsin Constitution].)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Just as no constitutional impediment to the existence of inherent power to dismiss for pervasive misconduct exists, no legislative impediment exists, either. The Legislature recognizes that courts possess inherent power to dismiss actions\u2014thus depriving the offending party of a jury trial\u2014in circumstances not covered by statute. Code of Civil Procedure section 581, the general dismissal statute, lists several grounds for involuntary dismissal. It also provides: \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not be deemed to be an exclusive enumeration of the court\u2019s power to dismiss an action or dismiss a complaint as to a defendant.\u201d (\u00a7 581, subd. (m).) Similarly, chapter 1.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, beginning with section 583.110, governs dismissal for delay in prosecution. Section 583.150 of that chapter states: \u201cThis chapter does not limit or affect the authority of a court to dismiss an action or impose other sanctions under a rule adopted by the court pursuant to Section 575.1 or by the Judicial Council pursuant to statute, <em>or otherwise under inherent authority of the court.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Similarly, the power to impose sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act (\u00a7 2016.010 et seq.) supplements, but does not supplant, a court\u2019s inherent power to deal with litigation abuse. <em>(Peat, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at pp. 285-286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Finally, contrary to SSI\u2019s contention, a court\u2019s exercise of inherent power to dismiss for misconduct need not be preceded by violation of a court order. The essential requirement is to calibrate the sanction to the wrong. Whether the misconduct violates a court order is relevant to the exercise of inherent power, but it does not define the boundary of the power. (See, e.g., <em>Cummings v. Wayne Co, supra, </em>533 N.W.2d at p. 14 [witness tampering]; <em>Aoude, supra, </em>892 F.2d at pp. 1118-1119 [fabrication of evidence and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>acts constituting a \u201cfraud on the court\u201d].) The decision whether to exercise the inherent power to dismiss requires consideration of all relevant circumstances, including the nature of the misconduct (which must be deliberate and egregious, but may or may not violate a prior court order), the strong preference for adjudicating claims on the merits, the integrity of the court as an institution of justice, the effect of the misconduct on a fair resolution of the case, and the availability of other sanctions to cure the harm.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Aoude, supra, </em>892 F.2d 1115; <em>Anheuser-Busch, supra, </em>69 F.3d at pp. 348-349.) We do not attempt to catalogue all the factors that must be considered in any particular case, except to emphasize that dismissal is <em>always </em>a drastic remedy to be employed <em>only </em>in the rarest of circumstances. We also do not attempt to catalogue the types of misconduct necessary to justify an exercise of the inherent power to dismiss, because \u201ccorrupt intent knows no stylistic boundaries.\u201d <em>(Aoude, supra, </em>892 F.2d at p. 1118.)  Rather, we hold only that when the plaintiff has engaged in misconduct during the course of the litigation that is deliberate, that is egregious, and that renders any remedy short of dismissal inadequate to preserve the fairness of the trial, the trial court has the inherent power to dismiss the action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Such an exercise of inherent authority is essential for every California court to remain \u201c \u2018a place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>where justice is judicially administered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Von Schmidt v. Widber </em>(1893) 99 Cal. 511, 512 [34 P. 109], quoting 3 Blackstone, Commentaries 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">B. The Trial Court\u2019s Imposition of a Terminating Sanction Was Not an Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Having concluded that California trial courts possess the inherent power to issue a terminating sanction for pervasive misconduct, we now consider whether, in the present case, the trial court properly exercised that power. Our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>(R.S. Creative, Inc. </em>v. <em>Creative Cotton, Ltd. </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 353].) We view the entire record in the light most favorable to the court\u2019s ruling, and draw all reasonable inferences in support of it. (See <em>Laguna, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 491.) We also defer to the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>(Hurtado v. Statewide Home Loan Co. </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1024 [213 Cal.Rptr. 712].) The trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only \u201cfor manifest abuse exceeding the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>(Kuhns v. State of California </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 982, 988 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">SSI levels several attacks on the trial court\u2019s ruling. None is persuasive, and we dispose of each in turn.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">1. <em>The Timeliness of Disney\u2019s Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">In the trial court, SSI argued that Disney\u2019s motion for a terminating sanction was untimely. On appeal, in its summary of the evidence, SSI implicitly resurrects the argument under the heading \u201cDisney Waited Over Eight Years to Complain About the Trash Searches.\u201d SSI asserts that Richard Holman, Sr.\u2019s two anonymous telephone calls to Disney security in June 1994 put \u201cDisney\u2019s legal team\u201d on notice as to \u201cthe same trash searches and alleged break-in\u201d that were the subject of the sanction motion in February 2003, \u201c[y]et Disney did not pursue this matter with the court or even complain to [SSI] about it for eight years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">We treat SSI\u2019s assertion as a contention requiring discussion. In granting Disney\u2019s motion, the trial court implicitly rejected SSI\u2019s contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Disney\u2019s motion was untimely. (See, e.g., <em>Sammis v. Stafford </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1935, 1942 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 589] [a reviewing court must infer that the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support its decision].) Substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s implied ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Disney security investigated the anonymous calls, but found no information on which it could act. No other information surfaced until October 1997, when SSI\u2019s counsel revealed SSI\u2019s possession of pages from the Restricted Items List. In its correspondence with Disney concerning the documents, SSI denied that it had any knowledge as to the source of the documents. Later, when Disney deposed Shirley Lasswell in October 1997, she denied any knowledge of Sands, and any knowledge whether SSI had hired someone to take Disney documents. After Disney moved for a protective order in March 1998, SSI\u2019s opposition to that motion still insisted that SSI had no idea how it obtained the Restricted Items List.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Under the evidence credited by the trial court, SSI\u2019s responses were either intentionally false, or made with deliberate indifference to the truth. Pati Slesinger and SSI\u2019s lawyers knew that Sands had surreptitiously taken documents from Disney property. SSI\u2019s agent, David Bentson, worked directly with Sands, receiving the documents and disseminating them to Slesinger, Lasswell, and SSI\u2019s attorneys. The court could reasonably infer that acting through its agents (Bentson and SSI\u2019s lawyers) and its principals (Slesinger and Lasswell) SSI either intentionally misled Disney, or deliberately made no reasonable effort to trace the Restricted Items List to Sands\u2019s activities. Nonetheless, SSI agreed to return all copies of the Restricted Items List it possessed, resulting in Disney withdrawing its motion for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In January 2000, SSI served discovery responses, verified by Lasswell, stating that both the Patterson Memorandum and the Kaplan Note had been \u201cproduced by Disney\u201d in discovery and that SSI had no other Disney documents that lacked a Bates stamp. By that time, of course, Lasswell had been informed by Pati Slesinger that SSI had employed an investigator to search Disney\u2019s \u201cgarbage,\u201d but her verified discovery response made no mention of this fact, and no mention of the thousands of pages of Disney documents SSI possessed. Lasswell had been faxed some of these documents by David Bentson as early as September 1993, when he faxed to her a page from the Interrogatory Tables containing a footer declaring the document to be confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Not until the March 2002 deposition of Pati Slesinger did SSI first reveal that it had employed Sands to obtain Disney documents. In June 2002, Disney served Sands with a notice of deposition and a request that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>produce copies of all documents found in the course of his investigation for SSI. However, when he appeared for the deposition in September 2002, he brought no documents with him, and testified that although he had taken Disney documents from publicly accessible dumpster sites, he kept no record of the documents he took, and had none of them when he was served with the deposition subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">After Sands\u2019s deposition, Disney wrote SSI, demanding copies of all documents taken from Disney. SSI responded that the papers Sands had found \u201cwere never used in the litigation in any way. . . . [T]hey have had no impact on the proceedings at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In October 2002, responding to subpoenas served by Disney, SSI began disclosing the bulk of what turned out to be more than 6,000 pages of Disney documents taken by Sands\u2014documents produced from the files of Pati Slesinger, Shirley Lasswell, and SSI\u2019s counsel. Included among the documents disclosed was the June 7, 2002 File, consisting of 560 pages contained in a file labeled \u201cDocuments Received from Terry Sands <em>on 6/7/02\u201d </em>(italics added), a date three days before Sands had been served to appear at his deposition. SSI did not reveal its possession of these documents until September 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On this record, Disney did not unreasonably delay in making its sanction motion. The time lapse from the 1994 anonymous calls to the motion in February 2003 was caused not by Disney\u2019s lack of diligence, but by SSI\u2019s concealment of Sands\u2019s employment, its false or recklessly made claims to have no knowledge concerning how it came to possess internal Disney documents, and its refusal to give any hint as to the magnitude of the misconduct until forced to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">2. <em>SSI\u2019s Unlawful Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The trial court disbelieved Sands\u2019s testimony that he had only taken documents from Disney\u2019s Buena Vista Plaza facility. The court concluded that Sands committed \u201cmultiple trespasses over an extended period of years at many targeted facilities,\u201d including the Golden State facility, which was \u201ca primary source of Disney documents procured by Sands.\u201d The court specifically credited the information contained in Richard Holman, Sr.\u2019s first anonymous telephone call, in which Holman, Sr., said that he and Sands \u201cwent to [Disney] Dumpster locations, broke in and took copies of documents . . . from locations in Northridge, Burbank, Glendale and trash cans on Flower Street\u201d and once \u201cwere able to get [past] the security guard at the Olive Building[,] enter some of the offices and take documents (i.e., contracts) off the desks.\u201d The court also found that, contrary to SSI\u2019s claims, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>dumpsters at Buena Vista Plaza were located on private (not public) property, that Disney did not abandon the documents contained in the dumpsters, and that Sands \u201chad no right to trespass\u201d to obtain the documents. Further, the trial court\u2019s statement of decision contains references to SSI\u2019s \u201cunlawfully obtained\u201d documents, and observes that \u201cSSI had no right to break laws to obtain evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">On appeal, SSI does not challenge these findings, including the finding of civil trespass. But SSI observes that the trial court made no express finding of criminal trespass, and further urges that \u201c[t]he charge of criminal conduct never was nor could be substantiated\u201d because there was no showing that Sands\u2019s conduct included all of the required elements to establish either a criminal trespass (Pen. Code, \u00a7 602) or a violation of the Burbank ordinances governing trash containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">SSI\u2019s insistence that criminal trespass was neither proved nor found is puzzling. Regardless of whether Sands committed criminal trespass, the evidence credited by the court established that he improperly entered areas of Disney properties not accessible to the public and that he trespassed onto Golden State\u2019s secure facility and, at those locations, improperly took documents that Disney had not abandoned. He thus committed the crimes of theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 484) and burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459). In any event, whether characterized as civil wrongdoing, criminal wrongdoing, or both, Sands\u2019s misconduct in the name of SSI was deliberate and egregious\u2014more than adequate to invoke the court\u2019s exercise of its inherent power to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">3. <em>SSI\u2019s Liability For Sands\u2019s Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The trial court concluded that SSI implicitly (if not expressly) sanctioned Sands\u2019s conduct. The court stated; \u201cSSI claims it instructed Sands to only obtain Disney documents by lawful means, but SSI remains fully responsible for Sands\u2019 misconduct, even if his acts, as SSI\u2019s agent, were contrary to SSI\u2019s explicit instructions. [Citation.] In light of all the circumstances, SSI had to suspect Sands was engaged in questionable conduct and that he was procuring documents from many Disney sources. Yet, SSI failed to adequately supervise Sands\u2019 activities [and] essentially closed its eyes.\u201d In another passage, the court concluded that Pati Slesinger \u201cknew all along\u201d of Sands\u2019s illicit activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">According to SSI, however, the court\u2019s reasoning \u201cwill not wash\u201d because \u201c[i]t is undisputed that [SSI\u2019s] counsel and David Bentson instructed Sands to obey the law\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no evidence that [SSI] (or its lawyers) knew that Sands was acting unlawfully.\u201d Rather, SSI \u201calways understood\u201d that Sands was searching publicly accessible dumpsters at the Buena Vista Plaza site.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>SSI\u2019s argument suffers from two primary flaws. The first is legal: a litigant is vicariously liable for its investigator\u2019s intentional misconduct committed within the course and scope of employment. (See <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 654, 659-663 [109 Cal.Rptr. 269]; see also 3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Agency and Employment, \u00a7 185, pp. 235-237.) Indeed, \u201c[i]t is immaterial that the employee acts in excess of authority or contrary to instructions.\u201d (3 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 165 at p. 208; see also <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Leatham </em>(1937) 22 Cal.App.2d 442, 445 [71 P.2d 336].) The policy rationale is clear: a contrary rule would permit an employer to reap the benefits of its employee\u2019s misconduct simply by claiming it had instructed the employee only to engage in lawful conduct. Hence, even if the trial court had accepted SSI\u2019s argument that Sands acted without authorization (an argument it rejected), Sands\u2019s unlawful conduct would still be imputed to SSI because it occurred in the course and scope of the investigation that SSI hired him to undertake. In short, Sands\u2019s deliberate misconduct is also the deliberate misconduct of SSL</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The second flaw in SSI\u2019s argument is factual: SSI relies only on the evidence that supports its position, and overlooks circumstantial evidence from which it may be inferred that SSI knew of Sands\u2019s illegal conduct, or at the very least acted with deliberate indifference to whether it was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The evidentiary basis of SSI\u2019s argument is the testimony of David Bentson that he instructed Sands not to violate the law, and the testimony of Pati Slesinger that she knew of no violation of the law by Sands. The trial court, however, disbelieved this testimony, and credited the ample circumstantial evidence that contradicted it. Sands took thousands of pages of Disney documents and passed them on to Bentson, and through him to SSI\u2019s lawyers, Pati Slesinger, and Lasswell. The trial court could reasonably infer that the sheer volume of documents would lead a reasonable person to question whether more than one repository was being searched, especially if that person were truly concerned about ensuring the legality of the document searches. Of course, the SSI agent to whom Sands reported, David Bentson, gave Sands a free hand, and did nothing to supervise his activities or ensure they were legal. Further, some of the documents taken by Sands\u2014the Restricted Items List, the Interrogatory Tables, the Fuller Memorandum, and the Suit Overview Document\u2014bore conspicuous notations stating that Disney considered them to be privileged and confidential. Common sense suggests that such documents are not the type that a litigant would simply discard in publicly accessible trash dumpsters, as opposed to disposing of them in a more secure way.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Strong circumstantial evidence suggested that Pati Slesinger knew that Sands had taken documents Disney considered confidential. SSI\u2019s copies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the Fuller Memorandum and the Interrogatory Tables bore September 1993 fax transmission legends indicating they were sent from Pati Slesinger\u2019s office. Also, SSI ultimately produced two sets of the Restricted Items List and the Interrogatory Tables: one set with the confidentiality markings as originally created by Disney, and one set without them. In testimony credited by the trial court, Disney\u2019s forensic document specialist, Erich Speckin, testified that the sets without the confidential markings, which came from Slesinger\u2019s files, were made from the set that did have those markings, which came from the files of SSI\u2019s attorneys. From this testimony, the court could reasonably infer that Pati Slesinger (or someone else on SSI\u2019s behalf) had altered one set of both the Restricted Items List and the Interrogatory Tables to omit any indicia of confidentiality. Moreover, in the years before Disney\u2019s sanction motion, SSI consistently concealed Sands\u2019s activities and its possession of Disney documents\u2014a fact the trial court could reasonably interpret as demonstrating consciousness of guilt and a desire to keep the full extent of the misconduct secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">This evidence leads to the reasonable conclusion, as found by the trial court, that SSI \u201chad to suspect Sands was engaged in questionable conduct,\u201d and \u201c[y]et. . . essentially closed its eyes.\u201d In other words, SSI, at best, acted with deliberate indifference to whether Sands\u2019s conduct was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">4. <em>SSI\u2019s Alteration of Documents With the Intent to Mislead</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">As noted in the preceding part, the trial court found that copies of the Restricted Items List and Interrogatory Tables contained in Pati Slesinger\u2019s files had been altered by her or someone on SSI\u2019s behalf to delete all notations of confidentiality. The purpose of these alterations, the court inferred, was \u201cto create the false impression\u201d that the documents were not confidential, or the false impression (as argued by SSI at the sanction hearing) that Disney had created both confidential and nonconfidential sets. Based on Slesinger\u2019s demeanor as a witness and the evidence linking her to the documents, the court disbelieved her testimony that she was not responsible for the alterations.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">On appeal, SSI does not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that copies of the Restricted Items List and Interrogatory Tables produced by Pati Slesinger were altered. SSI argues, however, that there is no evidence that the alterations were made by Slesinger or anyone else <em>with the intent to mislead. </em>However, SSI points to no other motive suggested by the evidence. Indeed, the inference of intended deception is self-evident from the act of alteration: deleting confidentiality markings from illicitly obtained documents makes the documents appear nonconfidential, makes questions about their provenance less pointed, and makes their unexplained possession appear less blameworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>SSI notes that in 2002 it first produced copies of the Restricted Items List and the Interrogatory Tables bearing the \u201cconfidential\u201d markings, and then later produced the altered versions. According to SSI, this chronology undermines the inference that SSI intended to conceal from Disney its possession of confidential documents. The argument misses the point. SSI concealed its possession of documents with confidential markings <em>until </em>2002, when it finally produced them. Its later production of the altered versions without the confidentiality markings says nothing about the purpose behind the alterations when they were made. In any event, as one federal appellate court has explained in upholding a terminating sanction for egregious misconduct, \u201c[t]he failure of a party\u2019s corrupt plan does not immunize the defrauder from the consequences of [its] misconduct.\u201d <em>(Aoude, supra, </em>892 F.2d at p. 1120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">5. <em>The Usefulness of the Documents to SSI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The trial court found that the illicitly obtained documents retained by SSI were \u201cdecidedly not useless. A number of key writings SSI retained are directly related to this litigation and reveal, among other things, privileged information useful to an opponent such as SSL\u201d SSI contends that this finding is unsupported, because \u201ceach of the categories of papers mentioned in the trial court\u2019s ruling as potentially useful to Slesinger is either not privileged, not useful, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In making its contention, SSI parses each document in isolation rather than considering the significance of the documents in totality. SSI also sanitizes its analysis by ignoring the illicit methods by which it obtained the documents and tried to keep its conduct secret. SSI claims that the conclusions in the Suit Overview Document \u201cbecame hopelessly outdated years ago,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that the Fuller Memorandum was \u201cbenign\u201d because it simply recited an analysis that Disney had already disclosed to SSL SSI also claims that its possession of the Restricted Items List and the Interrogatory Tables, even if obtained through gross misconduct, is insignificant, because they contained information that SSI was otherwise entitled to obtain through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Contrary to SSI\u2019s approach, the proper focus is on the illicitly obtained documents considered as a whole, and on SSI\u2019s misconduct in obtaining the documents, concealing its wrongdoing, and making no accurate accounting of the documents it obtained or discarded. In this context, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the fine distinctions drawn by SSI between useful and useless information carry little weight. The trial court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>reasonably infer SSI learned more than individual pieces of information; it obtained an insight into Disney\u2019s confidential approach to the litigation\u2014an insight SSI could use to its advantage in the litigation. Further, the court could also reasonably infer that SSI concealed its wrongdoing precisely because it found the theft of Disney documents useful and because it knew some documents were privileged. Indeed, the entries in SSI\u2019s redaction log suggest that Pati Slesinger, David Bentson, and SSI\u2019s attorneys made use of the stolen documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">SSI\u2019s appellate claim that none of the stolen documents is useful also contradicts the position SSI took in the trial court. For instance, in 1997, when SSI first produced the Restricted Items List, it claimed the document was \u201cclearly\u201d \u201crelevant\u201d to its claim that Disney had failed to account for all Winnie the Pooh revenues. The next year, SSI attached a copy of the Restricted Items List to one of its discovery motions. In SSI\u2019s motion to use the Patterson Memorandum, SSI argued that the document supported its claim that Disney had defrauded SSI in accounting for Winnie the Pooh generated revenues, an argument SSI reiterated in its opposition to Disney\u2019s motion for terminating sanctions. In a supplemental pleading opposing terminating sanctions, SSI characterized the stolen documents as \u201cshocking\u201d because they showed Disney\u2019s accounting could \u201cnot be trusted\u201d and that Disney had abused discovery procedures and had misled court-appointed auditors. In that pleading, SSI stated that it intended to file a sanctions motion \u201cbased on this proof.\u201d In its opening statement at the sanction hearing, SSI stated that some of the stolen documents supported its claim about Disney discovery abuses and that SSI intended to use the documents \u201cfor the purposes of conducting the discovery on the merits.\u201d Thus, in the trial court SSI consistently recognized that the information in the stolen documents was material both to the merits of the lawsuit (its claim of fraudulent accounting) and to its strategy (discovery litigation). SSI\u2019s own behavior thus demonstrates the materiality of the information it illicitly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">6. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Rejection of the Proposal for Document Review Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In its statement of decision on Disney\u2019s motion for a terminating sanction, the trial court concluded that it had no confidence that SSI would obey any prophylactic order, and that it was not convinced SSI had either produced or discarded all the illicitly obtained documents it possessed. The court also stated that SSI\u2019s principals knew information gleaned from stolen Disney documents that could not be purged. In its statement of decision on SSI\u2019s motion for new trial, in which it rejected SSI\u2019s proposal of DRC (see fn. 15, <em>ante), </em>the court reiterated the substance of these findings: \u201cNo power the Court possesses . . . can purge SSI\u2019s knowledge. The full extent of SSI\u2019s knowledge remains uncertain as does the potential impact of application of that knowledge to potential future litigation decisions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>events. No power the Court possesses short of termination can fully guard against the conscious or subconscious application of SSI\u2019s knowledge in shaping the future course of the litigation and its outcome.\u201d On this reasoning, the court rejected SSI\u2019s proposal for DRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">SSI challenges the court\u2019s reasoning as pure speculation. The court\u2019s reasoning, however, relied not on speculation, but SSI\u2019s history of misconduct\u2014a history that is reliably predictive. On the evidence credited by the court, SSI\u2019s pattern of misconduct was breathtaking. It reasonably suggested that SSI would not obey remedial orders if disobedience might be to its tactical advantage. (See <em>Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1184 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 663] [terminating sanction was not an abuse of discretion because the trial court could have reasonably concluded that given defendants\u2019 \u201cbrazen violation of a discovery order,\u201d \u201ca lesser sanction would not have been sufficient to compel compliance\u201d with any future court orders].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Similarly, the court reasonably concluded that SSI might well possess illicitly obtained documents that it had not produced or discarded. SSI never supervised Sands, never catalogued the documents he took, and never made any record of what SSI purportedly discarded. SSI and its former counsel (Greenberg Glusker) could not even account for SSI\u2019s possession of the June 7, 2002 File, and could provide no explanation why it was not produced until September 2003. (See fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>Combined with the court\u2019s dismal view of the credibility of Pati Slesinger, Lasswell, and Bentson, SSI\u2019s history of duplicity or deliberate indifference to the truth concerning the illicitly obtained Disney documents reasonably cautioned against accepting SSI\u2019s protestations that it had produced all it possessed, and that nothing of value had been learned.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As the trial court cogently noted: \u201cSSI is dishonest and shows no remorse.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Likewise, no speculation exists in the court\u2019s determination that SSI\u2019s principals had gleaned information from the documents that no court order could dissipate. Pati Slesinger and Bentson conceded reviewing documents. Notations made by them on certain documents were deleted by SSI as privileged before the documents were produced. Pati Slesinger (or someone else on SSI\u2019s behalf) altered copies of the Restricted Items List and Interrogatory Tables to remove notations of confidentiality. Bentson faxed at least some documents to Lasswell because he believed they would be of interest to her. To the extent there is any mystery as to how many documents SSI\u2019s principals reviewed, how many they discarded, how many they might still possess, and how valuable the information learned might be, the mystery is a direct result of SSI\u2019s misconduct. SSI is itself responsible for creating a record in which Disney\u2019s proof raised justifiable concerns on these points. SSI is also responsible for the dearth of credible evidence to alleviate those concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">SSI argues that the court\u2019s concern over SSI\u2019s lack of trustworthiness is not relevant in evaluating its proposal of DRC. According to SSI, whether the proposal is effective depends not on SSI\u2019s conduct, but on the conduct of new trial counsel and the DRC, who are officers of the court. However, from 1992 to 2002, SSI was represented by six different law firms (see fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>Despite the changes in representation, SSI\u2019s misconduct persisted. The one constant was the involvement of SSI\u2019s principals, Pati Slesinger and Shirley Lasswell, and SSI\u2019s agent, David Bentson. (See fn. 24, <em>ante.) </em>The court could reasonably conclude that with SSI as the client, employment of new trial counsel and DRC would be inadequate to protect against SSI\u2019s use of improperly obtained information. (See <em>Lipin v. Bender </em>(Ct.App. 1994) 84 N.Y.2d 562 [644 N.E.2d 1300, 620 N.Y.S.2d 744, 748] [the plaintiff personally stole, copied and reviewed documents protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine; dismissal of her lawsuit was not an abuse of discretion because \u201cthe wrongdoing and the knowledge were the client\u2019s own, which she would carry into any new attorney-client relationship\u201d]; <em>Perna v. Electronic Data Systems, Corp. </em>(D.N.J. 1995) 916 F.Supp. 388, 400 [the plaintiff personally took and photocopied privileged documents; ordering the plaintiff to obtain new counsel would \u201cbe ineffective as [the plaintiff] would have already tainted the entire litigation process by this intrusion\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Moreover, it is not reasonable to expect new trial counsel to fulfill, in any meaningful way, a screening or prophylactic function to preclude SSI\u2019s principals from introducing into the litigation the fruits of Sands\u2019s searches. Trial counsel would have a duty to zealously represent SSI, but would be placed in an adversarial position, having to forcefully inquire about, and perhaps investigate, the source of documents produced by SSI, or ideas and suggestions made by SSI.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Further, on the record presented the trial court could reasonably doubt that SSI would honestly cooperate with new trial counsel\u2019s efforts. (See <em>Lipin v. Bender, supra, </em>620 N.Y.S.2d at pp. 748-749 [the trial court reasonably concluded that \u201cpolicing\u201d an order requiring \u201cthe plaintiff to establish, once new counsel was in place, an independent source for any information\u201d that could otherwise have been obtained from the stolen documents was not an adequate safeguard given the nature and persistence of the plaintiff\u2019s misconduct].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Simply put, the trial court was not required to gamble its ability to provide a fair trial on SSI\u2019s turning over a new leaf. The court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting SSI\u2019s proposal of DRC,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and concluding that dismissal was the only viable sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Our conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting SSI\u2019s proposal of DRC disposes of SSI\u2019s claim that imposition of the terminating sanction was punitive. As framed by SSI, a sanction is punitive if a lesser sanction is \u201cmore than sufficient to remedy the effects of any misconduct.\u201d (Boldface and capitalization omitted.) However, because the trial court acted well within the bounds of reason in rejecting SSI\u2019s proposal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>of DRC (the only alternative sanction proposed by SSI), its finding that dismissal was the only sanction that could protect Disney cannot be deemed punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">7. <em>The Earlier Sanctions Imposed On Disney</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">SSI observes that Disney was subject to evidentiary and monetary sanctions for its destruction of certain files of Vincent Jefferds, the Disney vice-president who negotiated the 1983 licensing agreement.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although SSI concedes that \u201ctwo wrongs do not make a right,\u201d it argues that the terminating sanction entered on Disney\u2019s motion is an improper windfall to Disney. According to SSI, the terminating sanction relieves Disney \u201cof the consequences of its own wrongful destruction of evidence for which Disney had been [previously] severely sanctioned by another judge\u201d and of the duty to defend this lawsuit and, as a result, puts Disney \u201cin a better position than it would have been in had [SSI\u2019s] investigator never peered into a single garbage dumpster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The earlier sanctions against Disney, however, provide no cover for SSI\u2019s misconduct. The evidentiary sanctions against Disney (assuming they were properly entered, see fn. 27, ante) rectified the harm done <em>to </em>SSI. The terminating sanction imposed against SSI rectified the harm done <em>by </em>SSI. In obtaining a terminating sanction against SSI, Disney did not \u201cget away\u201d with its own misconduct. The demise of SSI\u2019s lawsuit has one cause only: the deliberate and egregious misconduct of SSI itself, making any sanction other than dismissal inadequate to ensure a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The judgment (order of dismissal with prejudice) is affirmed.

According to that declaration, in the mid-1990\u2019s one of Golden State\u2019s drivers reported that an unidentified man, who consistently followed him on his route from Disney to the Canoga Park facility, once offered him money for a bin of paper collected from Disney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> Holman, Sr., was unavailable to testify at the sanction hearing, but his videotaped deposition from November 2002 was introduced.

He said that he had made the calls because he had argued with Sands, but he could not recall the reason for the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"Anqf\">In a credibility finding unchallenged by SSI on appeal, the trial court found that Holman, Sr.\u2019s description of his and Sands\u2019s activities in the first anonymous call was truthful, and that Holman, Sr.\u2019s later recantation was not. Moreover, during his deposition, Holman, Sr., was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>unable to recognize photographs of the Buena Vista Plaza facility\u2014the sole Disney facility from which Sands claimed to have obtained documents. Further, Holman, Sr., drew a diagram of the Burbank location which, according to his testimony, he and Sands had searched. As the trial court noted in its findings, the diagram did <em>not </em>resemble Buena Vista Plaza; instead, it resembled other Disney locations in Burbank.

As we have discussed, <em>Bauguess </em>held that an award of attorney fees must be authorized by statute or contract. <em>(Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 638; <em>Andrews v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 779 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 426]; <em>Trans-Action Commercial Investors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Firmaterr, Inc. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 352 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 449].) Hence, absent an applicable statutory provision (e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 2023.010-2023.040) or a contractual attorney fee provision, the trial court cannot impose monetary sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> Other state and federal courts have used a variety of characterizations to describe the misconduct necessary to invoke the inherent power to dismiss, including: \u201cfraud on the court,\u201d meaning deliberate conduct that \u201cset[s] in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system\u2019s ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party\u2019s claim or defense\u201d <em>(Aoude, supra, </em>892 F.2d at p. 1118; see also <em>Rockdale Management Co. v. Shawmut Bank, N.A., supra, </em>638 N.E.2d at p. 31; <em>Cox, supra, </em>706 So.2d at p. 46); conduct \u201cdue to \u2018 \u201cwillfulness, fault, or bad faith,\u201d \u2019 \u201d and having a relationship to \u201cthe matters in controversy such that the transgression \u2018threaten[s] to interfere with the rightful decision of the case\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>(Anheuser-Busch, supra, </em>69 F.3d at p. 348); \u201cdeliberately . . . deceptive practices that undermine the integrity of judicial proceedings,\u201d including \u201c \u2018when a party has willfully deceived the court and engaged in conduct utterly inconsistent with the orderly administration of justice\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.)-, </em>\u201c \u2018egregious misconduct such as \u201cwillful or contemptuous\u201d behavior, \u201ca deliberate attempt to hinder or prevent effective presentation of defenses or counterclaims,\u201d or \u201cstalling in revealing one\u2019s own weak claim or defense\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Klupt, supra, </em>728 A.2d at p. 738).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Such characterizations may be helpful. But we prefer simply to describe the requisite misconduct as deliberate and egregious such that no sanction other than dismissal is adequate to ensure a fair trial. We trust to the experience of trial courts to identify which litigation misconduct falls within this standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\"> SSI concedes that we review the trial court\u2019s decision under the abuse of discretion standard. But in its summary of the record and its arguments, SSI observes this standard more by the breach than the adherence. SSI accords little, if any, deference to the trial court\u2019s detailed findings (though SSI professes to defer to them), and sometimes ignores them altogether. On key points, SSI focuses only on the evidence that supports its arguments, including evidence discredited by the trial court. SSI\u2019s approach suggests that it would like us to reweigh the evidence, and reevaluate the credibility of the witnesses. Of course, that is not our task. (See <em>Laguna, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 491.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b675-10\"> SSI\u2019s claim that the Suit Overview Document was not significant is at odds with the fact that when SSI finally produced the document, it attempted to conceal the confidential nature of the document by omitting its face page.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\"> Because the trial court\u2019s rejection of DRC is, in large part, based upon its finding that SSI cannot be trusted, we note additional findings that the trial court made in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">For instance, the trial court found that the Sands declaration that SSI proffered in support of its October 2002 Motion to use the Patterson Memorandum constituted an attempt to mislead the court. In that declaration, Sands claimed that he searched only dumpsters at Buena Vista Plaza and two other unspecified locations. (See fn. 9, <em>ante.) </em>The court found that the declaration \u201cwas calculated to mislead the Court into believing incorrectly that Sands\u2019 activities were very limited in scope\u201d and therefore was \u201cwillfully misleading and false and calculated to induce the Court to rely on deceptive, false testimony in deciding a motion in SSI\u2019s favor\u2014an attempted fraud on the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">In addition, the trial court found that SSI\u2019s 1998 representation that it had returned all copies of the Restricted Items List was intentionally false. The court also found that \u201c[c]ontrary to its representations to Disney and the Court, SSI knew how it had obtained the Restricted Items List and knew it bore conspicuous confidential markings when originally procured by Sands.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\"> Lasswell\u2019s death during the pendency of this appeal does not affect this conclusion. Our review is based upon the facts (including evidence of Lasswell\u2019s complicity in SSI\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>misconduct) presented to the trial court when it made the contested ruling. In any event, Lasswell\u2019s death does nothing to alter the trial court\u2019s fundamental conclusion that SSI cannot be trusted. Pati Slesinger, SSI\u2019s sole shareholder and Lasswell\u2019s daughter, managed the lawsuit against Disney and was actively involved in the misconduct, including the review of confidential Disney documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> For instance, SSI explains: \u201cThe origin of any papers provided by [SSI] would be scrutinized by new trial counsel; if there were any doubt about the papers\u2019 provenance, new counsel would have to ask where the papers came from. If [SSI] couldn\u2019t provide a satisfactory answer, new trial counsel could not accept or use the papers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\"> In its opening brief, SSI has added one more task for DRC to perform: \u201cDRC should promptly review [SSI\u2019s] files and place any [improperly obtained Disney] Papers found therein with the other Isolated Documents.\u201d We need not consider this point because it was not raised in the trial court. (See <em>Mattco Forge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 820, 847 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 780].) To do so would be unfair to Disney, which did not have the opportunity to respond to it below, and to the trial court, which was unable to evaluate it. In any event, the additional role that SSI now proposes for DRC is based upon the premise that SSI would honestly cooperate by not first removing any remaining illicitly obtained Disney documents before giving DRC access to its files. As explained above, the trial court reasonably concluded that SSI could not be trusted. That conclusion applies with equal force to SSI\u2019s new proposal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\"> In 1999, SSI discovered that three years after SSI filed suit, Disney destroyed the documents. SSI moved for sanctions. After conducting a series of hearings, the trial court (a different judge from the one who imposed the terminating sanction against SSI that is the subject of this appeal) found that \u201ca jury could conclude that Disney\u2019s destruction of Jefferds\u2019 files was done willfully or that Disney willfully suppressed evidence.\u201d In 2001, the court imposed a panoply of evidentiary sanctions against Disney relating both to the destruction of the files and to representations that Jefferds made to SSI\u2019s principals about, among other things, SSI\u2019s right to receive royalties on Winnie the Pooh videocassettes. In addition, the trial court imposed financial sanctions on Disney to reimburse SSI and its counsel for the cost of litigating the sanctions motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Disney appealed the trial court\u2019s order imposing monetary sanctions. However, after SSI and its counsel renounced entitlement to the monetary sanctions, we dismissed the appeal as moot. In our nonpublished opinion <em>(Slesinger, Inc. v. The Walt Disney Company </em>(Nov. 20, 2002, B153920)), we denied Disney\u2019s request to review the underlying evidentiary sanctions order. We observed that \u201c[questions remain as to the underlying correctness of the trial court\u2019s adjudication on sanctions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But we declined to review the adjudication \u201cunder the guise of an otherwise moot monetary sanction order.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
