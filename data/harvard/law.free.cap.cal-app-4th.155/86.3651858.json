The jury found him guilty of eight of those charges: continuous sexual abuse of a child under 14 years of age in violation of Penal Code section 288.5, subdivision (a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> six counts of committing a lewd act on a child of 14 or 15 years of age in violation of section 288, subdivision (c); and forcible rape in violation of section 261, subdivision (a)(2). Defendant was sentenced to state prison for 24 years, consisting of the midterm of 12 years for the continuous sexual abuse as base term, with six consecutive sentences of eight months (one-third of the two-year midterm sentences) on the lewd act convictions, plus a full consecutive upper term sentence of eight years on the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In his timely appeal, defendant contends (1) there was constitutionally insufficient evidence to support his convictions for continuous sexual abuse, two of the lewd act convictions (counts 2 &amp; 4 concerning acts in Sept, and Oct. 2004) and the rape conviction; (2) as to the continuous sexual abuse offense, the trial court erred in giving the pattern jury instruction indicating the prosecution need not prove the offense occurred on exactly the date alleged; (3) the trial court erroneously failed to instruct on attempted rape as a lesser included offense of rape; (4) the trial court erroneously failed to instruct on lewd conduct as a lesser included offense of continuous sexual abuse; (5) the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of uncharged sexual offenses by defendant against the victim\u2019s mother, which violated defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process; (6) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>prosecutor committed misconduct during her rebuttal argument by urging the jury to consider punishment; (7) the trial court improperly imposed a full consecutive upper term sentence for the rape conviction based on its erroneous understanding that such a term was mandatory under section 667.6, as that provision provided at the time defendant committed the relevant offenses; and (8) the imposition of an upper term sentence for the rape conviction violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531] <em>(Blakely).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">As we explain, defendant\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of evidence supporting his continuous sexual abuse conviction (count 1), as well as his lewd act conviction for conduct in September 2004 (count 2), are well taken because there was no substantial evidence that the assaults occurred within the statutory time periods. There was, however, constitutionally sufficient evidence supporting his conviction for the October 2004 lewd act and the rape. Based on our reversal of count 1, we need not reach the two separate claims of instructional error concerning that offense. We find any error in failing to instruct on attempted rape as a lesser offense to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no error or due process violation regarding the admission of uncharged sexual offenses. The claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on a comment during rebuttal argument was forfeited. Concerning the application of section 667.6 at sentencing, we accept the Attorney General\u2019s concession that remand is necessary to permit the trial court to resentence on the rape conviction under the law as it existed at the time of the offense. Finally, remand is also required on the <em>Blakely </em>issue because the trial court relied on aggravating factors that were not found by a jury to impose the upper term on the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">A. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The victim was bom on September 18, 1990, and was 15 years old at the time she testified. Defendant is her grandfather. The victim lived with her parents and brothers in Huntington Park. Defendant began sexually molesting the victim in 2004. The incidents occurred in her own home and in defendant\u2019s home in Los Angeles on weekday afternoons when defendant watched her after school. The first incident occurred at home, when the victim was in eighth grade. She was in her bedroom reading her yearbook. Defendant entered the room and asked about the yearbook. The victim said that she was looking at it because she was getting ready to graduate from middle school. When she mentioned that her knee was hurting, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>began massaging her raised knee\u2014but \u201cwent lower and started touching [her] vagina\u201d with his hand over her clothes. Before leaving, he told her \u201cnot to say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The second instance of sexual abuse occurred one or two days later, at defendant\u2019s house. The victim was in the living room, watching television and petting the dog. Defendant began petting it too, but proceeded to rub the victim\u2019s vagina over her clothes. Defendant stopped when the victim\u2019s father arrived to pick her up. From that time until January of 2005, defendant would sexually molest her in a similar fashion \u201ctwo or three days a week.\u201d The abusive incidents occurred \u201cfrom June 2004 to January 2005.\u201d When defendant tried to reach his hand \u201cinside\u201d her pants, however, the victim would try to push him away. She did not tell anyone about defendant\u2019s conduct because she felt ashamed and because he had warned her not to\u2014he told her that \u201cit really wouldn\u2019t matter\u201d if she reported it \u201c[b]ecause nobody would believe [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On an afternoon in January 2005, the victim was on her bed listening to music. She was wearing her school uniform, consisting of a white shirt and blue pants. Defendant opened her bedroom door, entered the room, closed the door behind him, and said hello. Suddenly, defendant climbed on top of the victim, pulled down her pants and underwear, and unzipped his pants. He put his knees between her legs and his penis in her vagina. She could not push him off. When he left the room, she felt dirty and took a shower. She did not tell her parents what defendant had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">On cross-examination, the victim stated that defendant molested her approximately 10 times in 2004, while she was in eighth grade. She began ninth grade \u201caround July\u201d that year. That is, \u201cbetween June and July\u201d defendant molested her 10 times. The victim testified on redirect examination that during the 12-week period from June through August defendant molested her more than three times. In September 2004, defendant molested her more than two times; he did the same in October. On recross-examination, the victim denied testifying that defendant did not molest her at all in October of 2004. Rather, he did so \u201cabout once.\u201d When defense counsel asked her to state the number of times defendant had molested her in October, the victim stated: \u201cI don\u2019t really remember much of October.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Regarding the January 2005 rape incident, the victim testified that her legs had been together, but defendant \u201cpulled them open\u201d and \u201cpushed [her] knees back,\u201d before penetrating her. The penetration was painful.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>On October 4, 2005, the victim spoke to her friend Elisa at school. When Elisa confided that she had been molested when she was little, the victim told her that she \u201chad a similar situation.\u201d After school, the victim went to Elisa\u2019s home and told her friend that defendant and her uncle had molested her. The victim explained that she was \u201ctired of her life\u201d and could not \u201ctake it any more\u201d because defendant and her uncle sexually molested her\u2014they had \u201csexual relationships with her.\u201d The victim did not want to return to her own house because defendant molested her there. Elisa advised the victim to speak up and tell people about the abuse because it would not stop until she did. The victim agreed and told Elisa\u2019s mother. Elisa\u2019s mother telephoned the victim\u2019s mother and told her what the victim had said. When the victim\u2019s mother arrived, the victim told her about the abuse. The victim\u2019s mother took her home and reported the matter to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The victim\u2019s mother testified that defendant, her father, had molested her when she was six or seven years old. Whenever her mother was out of town, defendant would enter her bedroom and touch her vagina while she was in bed. He persisted despite her telling him \u201cno.\u201d At the time, defendant told her to keep his behavior a secret or \u201che would kill [her] grandmother or hurt [her] mom.\u201d Defendant also molested her in the swimming pool while pretending to give swimming lessons and after giving her a bath. On occasion, he would penetrate her with his penis. The molestations continued until she was 12 or 13 years old. They ended when she grabbed a pair of scissors and threatened to \u201cchop his balls off\u2019 if he touched her again. She let him watch the victim because she thought he had \u201cchanged\u201d and become \u201ca different person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">B. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The defense sought to challenge the victim\u2019s credibility about the sexual abuse. Defendant\u2019s 20-year-old daughter, Martha, testified that she lived in defendant\u2019s house during her teenage years. Defendant did not sexually molest her. She had a close relationship with the victim, who would typically confide her secrets to Martha. At the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, the victim told her that defendant did not \u201ctake her virginity\u201d and \u201cnever penetrated\u201d her. Martha was not aware her father engaged in any inappropriate conduct toward the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Defendant contends there was constitutionally insufficient evidence to support his convictions for continuous sexual abuse (count 1), two of the lewd act convictions (counts 2 &amp; 4), and the rape conviction (count 9). As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the continuous sexual abuse conviction, defendant argues there was no solid, credible evidence that three acts of molestation occurred over the three-month duration period required by section 288.5, subdivision (a). As to the lewd act conviction for conduct in September 2004 (count 2), defendant argues there was no solid, credible evidence the molestation occurred after the victim\u2019s 14th birthday, as alleged. As we explain, these two claims have merit. We reject, however, defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence challenges to the lewd act conviction for conduct in October 2004 and to the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u201c Tn reviewing the sufficiency of evidence under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the question we ask is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] We apply an identical standard under the California Constitution. [Citation.] Tn determining whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellate court \u201cmust view the evidence in a light most favorable to respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] The same standard also applies in cases in which the prosecution relies primarily on circumstantial evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1175 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 112, 105 P.3d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We therefore review the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether the challenged convictions are supported by substantial evidence, meaning \u201cevidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value.\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].) In contrast, \u201cmere speculation cannot support a conviction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 35 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262].) \u201cIn deciding the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing court resolves neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts. [Citation.] Resolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive province of the trier of fact. [Citation.] Moreover, unless the testimony is physically impossible or inherently improbable, testimony of a single witness is sufficient to support a conviction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Young, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 1181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Defendant was charged and convicted of continuous sexual abuse of the victim \u201con or between June 1, 2004 and September 17, 2004.\u201d Section 288.5, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cAny person who either resides in the same home with the minor child or has recurring access to the child, who over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>period of time, <em>not less than three months in duration, </em>engages in three or more acts of substantial sexual conduct <em>with a child under the age of 14 years at the time of the commission of the offense, </em>as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1203.066, or three or more acts of lewd or lascivious conduct, as defined in Section 288, with a child under the age of 14 years at the time of the commission of the offense is guilty of the offense of continuous sexual abuse of a child . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Therefore, under the statute\u2019s plain terms, in addition to the requirement that the victim be less than 14 years old at the time of the offense, the prosecution must prove defendant committed the minimum number of proscribed acts within the specified time period. \u201cSection 288.5 relates to \u2018continuous sexual abuse\u2019 and accordingly requires at least three acts of sexual misconduct with the child victim over at least three months to qualify for prosecution of persons who are either residing with, or have \u2018recurring access\u2019 to, the child.\u201d <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 543, 550 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 348, 49 P.3d 1085]; see <em>People v. Vasquez </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1287 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 389, 59 Cal.Rptr. 389] [\u201cthe language of section 288.5 indicates the statute is violated if the defendant (1) resided with, or had recurring access to, a child under fourteen, and (2) committed three or more acts of sexual molestation of the child, and (3) three or more months passed between the first and the last act of molestation\u201d]; <em>People v. Whitham </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1298 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 571] [\u201cIn the case of a defendant charged with violating section 288.5, the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt [citation] means that each juror must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant engaged in at least three acts of sexual abuse with the child victim within the prescribed time frame.\u201d].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Our task, therefore, is to determine whether the evidence below supported a reasonable inference that at least three months elapsed between the first and third time defendant sexually abused the victim before her 14th birthday on September 18, 2004. Presuming in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence, we find no reasonable, credible, solid evidence to support a nonspeculative inference that the three-month minimum time period element was satisfied. Construing the victim\u2019s testimony in the light most favorable to the People\u2019s case, the evidence showed defendant first abused her sometime in June 2004, when she was in eighth grade. There were 10 instances of abuse by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>between June and the start of ninth grade sometime \u201caround July\u201d of that year. The victim also testified that during the 12-week period from June through August 2004, defendant molested her more than three times. In September of that year, defendant molested her at least twice. While on direct examination, the victim testified generally that defendant molested her \u201ctwo or three days a week,\u201d but she clarified that defendant did not molest her every week within that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Accordingly, the only reasonable inference permitted by the evidence was that defendant\u2019s abuse began sometime in June and continued to some date in September\u2014but the jury could only speculate that the first incident occurred early enough in June to satisfy the 90-day requirement expiring on September 17, 2004. Indeed, there was no evidence as to when defendant abused her in September, including whether the abuse occurred before and/or after her birthday. As defendant correctly argues, although there was ample evidence that at least three qualifying sexual offenses occurred during the charging period, there was no substantial evidence that at least three months elapsed between the first and third offenses committed against her as a 13 year old.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The Attorney General argues section 288.5, subdivision (a) does not include a strict three-month minimum time period as an element of the offense, but that the statute should be read as merely requiring proof that an act of sexual abuse occurred in three successive months. Alternatively, the Attorney General argues we should construe the statute\u2019s three-month requirement as a mere \u201ccharging limitation,\u201d designed to prevent the prosecution from seeking multiple convictions for separate sexual offenses occurring within the period alleged for the section 288.5, subdivision (a) offense, but permitting a conviction for such continuous sexual abuse based on a minimum of three acts of sexual abuse occurring <em>any time </em>within the time period alleged. As we explain, neither interpretation comports with the statute\u2019s plain meaning, as read in light of the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201cIn construing a statute, we look first to the statutory language.\u201d <em>(People v. Vasquez, </em>supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1284, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 285, 294 [155 Cal.Rptr. 367, 594 P.2d 484].) \u201cThe language is construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme, and we give \u2018significance to every word, phrase, sentence, and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] The intent of the law prevails over the letter of the law, and \u2018 \u201cthe letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Canty </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1266, 1276-1277 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 90 P.3d 1168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>As our colleagues in Division Three have explained: \u201cThe words and syntax of the statute set forth the following elements: the defendant (1) must have (a) resided with, <em>or </em>(b) had recurring access to, a minor less than fourteen years of age, <em>and </em>(2) must have engaged in three or more acts of substantial sexual conduct or lewd and lascivious conduct with the minor over a period of time not less than three months in duration. The requirement of a three-month period of time is grammatically attached to the requirement of three or more acts, not to the requirement of a shared residence or recurring access.\u201d <em>(People v. Vasquez, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1284 [holding \u00a7 288.5, subd. (a) does not include as a necessary element three <em>continuous </em>months of access to the child victim].) Had the Legislature intended to define the relevant time period as a minimum of three acts occurring in three successive months, it would have made little sense, logically or grammatically, to employ the phrase \u201cover a period of time, not less than three months in duration.\u201d (\u00a7 288.5, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Indeed, such an interpretation would deprive the word \u201cduration\u201d of its significance in relation to the legislative purpose. As our Supreme Court has pointed out: \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s accompanying statement of purpose declared that \u2018there is an immediate need for additional statutory protection for the most vulnerable among our children, those of tender years, some of whom are being subjected to continuing sexual abuse by those commonly referred to as \u201cresident child molesters.\u201d These molesters reside with, <em>or have recurring access to, </em>a child and repeatedly molest the child over a prolonged period of time but the child, because of age or the frequency of the molestations, or both, often is unable to distinguish one incident from another . . . , and as a consequence prosecutors are unable to . . . overcome ... constitutional due process problems ....\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Rodriguez, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 546.) It has been recognized that \u201c[t]he text of section 288.5 leaves no doubt the Legislature intended to create a course-of-conduct offense\u201d <em>(People v. Whitham, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 1296), with the course of conduct statutorily defined as \u201cat least three acts of sexual abuse with the child victim within the prescribed time frame.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1298.) An interpretation that ascribed the three-month time period to a mere \u201ccharging limitation\u201d would be entirely inconsistent with the statute\u2019s overarching legislative aim, as it would permit a conviction for recurring conduct over a \u201cprolonged period,\u201d based on three acts occurring in as short a period as a single day\u2014as long as the acts happened sometime \u201cwithin\u201d the time period alleged. Thus, in keeping with the legislative aim of punishing a course of conduct over a <em>prolonged period, </em>it follows that the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cover a period of time, not less than three months in duration\u201d in direct relation to the \u201cthree or more acts of substantial sexual conduct\u201d was meant to set the minimum temporal scope of the proscribed course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s assertion, precedent recognizing that generic testimony of abuse can suffice to support a section 288.5 conviction, does not require a more liberal reading of the statute\u2019s three-month limitation. \u201c \u2018[E]ven generic testimony (e.g., an act of intercourse \u201conce a month for three years\u201d) outlines a series of <em>specific, </em>albeit undifferentiated, incidents, <em>each </em>of which amounts to a separate offense, and <em>each </em>of which could support a separate criminal sanction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Matute </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1445 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 472], quoting <em>People v. Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].) As we have explained, the prosecution need not prove the exact dates of the predicate sexual offenses in order to satisfy the three-month element. Rather, it must adduce sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that at least three months elapsed between the first and last sexual acts. Generic testimony is certainly capable of satisfying that requirement, as the hypothetical examples listed by the Supreme Court in <em>Jones </em>illustrate. Indeed, as the <em>Jones </em>court held, despite the general acceptance of such generic testimony, \u201cthe victim must be able to describe <em>the general time period </em>in which these acts occurred (e.g., \u2018the summer before my fourth grade,\u2019 or \u2018during each Sunday morning after he came to live with us\u2019), to assure the acts were committed within the applicable limitation period.\u201d <em>(People v. Jones, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 316; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hord </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 711, 720 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 55].) That is, while generic testimony may suffice, it cannot be so vague that the trier of fact can only speculate as to whether the statutory elements have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">A similar analysis applies to defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim regarding count 2, his lewd act conviction for conduct in September 2004. It was alleged, and the jury found, defendant committed a lewd act on the victim on or between September 18 and 30, 2004, in violation of section 288, subdivision (c)(1), which requires that the victim be 14 or 15 years old at the time of the offense. As stated above, there was no evidence as to when defendant abused the victim in September\u2014before and/or after her 14th birthday. As the evidence did not support a reasonable inference that the crime occurred when the victim was 14 years old, the conviction must be reversed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>We reject, however, defendant\u2019s sufficiency challenge to count 4, one of the two lewd act convictions for conduct in October 2004. Defendant asserts the victim\u2019s testimony concerning whether he molested her more than once in that month was so self-contradictory that it cannot be deemed sufficient evidence under the federal Constitution\u2019s due process standard. Reviewing the victim\u2019s testimony in context and applying the proper deferential standard of review, we find the contradictions in her testimony merely raised a credibility issue for the jury to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Consistent with federal due process concerns, our Supreme Court has repeatedly and consistently explained: \u201c 1 \u201cAlthough an appellate court will not uphold a judgment or verdict based upon evidence inherently improbable, testimony which merely discloses unusual circumstances does not come within that category. [Citation.] To warrant the rejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by the [trier of fact], there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions. [Citations.] Conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. [Citation.]\u201d . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 306 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110], citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 754 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 685, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1]; see <em>People v. Cantrell </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 523, 538 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 188].)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The victim\u2019s testimony provided the sole evidence concerning sexual abuse in October. She testified on cross-examination that defendant molested her more than two times in that month. On recross-examination, defense counsel asserted that she had testified that defendant did not molest her at all in October of 2004. The victim denied that assertion, responding that she had said \u201cabout once.\u201d When defense counsel asked her to state the number of times defendant had molested her in October, the victim said, \u201cI don\u2019t really remember much of October.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the victim\u2019s statements on recross-examination did not amount to a clear recantation of her prior testimony. We hold a reasonable juror could have understood the victim\u2019s \u201cabout once\u201d statement mainly as a refutation of counsel\u2019s assertion that she had previously denied suffering any sexual abuse in October. Similarly, when she stated she did not \u201cremember much\u201d about that month, a reasonable juror could have understood her as merely explaining that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>could not recall the precise number of times she suffered abuse at defendant\u2019s hands during that month, which was consistent with her prior testimony that there had been at least two instances of abuse that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Accordingly, we find the contradictions in the victim\u2019s testimony did not render it impossible to believe or obviously false, but merely presented the jury with a credibility determination that is not reviewable on appeal. (See <em>People v. Barnes, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 306; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cantrell, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at p. 538.) Defendant\u2019s reliance on two intermediate federal court <em>opinions\u2014Mackett v. United States </em>(7th Cir. 1937) 90 F.2d 462 and <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Kenyon </em>(8th Cir. 2007) 481 F.3d 1054\u2014is misplaced. In the former case, the only evidence supporting an element of the underlying conviction had been provided by a witness who unambiguously admitted a lack of personal knowledge as to an essential fact. <em>(Mackett v. United States, supra, </em>90 F.2d at p. 464.) In the latter case, all of the victim\u2019s testimony concerning the sexual assault was inherently ambiguous. <em>(U.S. v. Kenyon, supra, </em>481 F.3d at p. 1068.) As we have explained, defendant\u2019s jurors had an evidentiary basis for finding the victim had personal knowledge that defendant committed two or more lewd acts upon her in October. In any event, we are not bound by the decisions of lower federal courts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avena </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 394, 431 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 916 P.2d 1000].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In defendant\u2019s final sufficiency of the evidence challenge, he contends there was no substantial evidence of the force or duress element of his rape conviction. We disagree. The record contains reasonable, credible, and solid evidence that defendant accomplished the rape with sufficient force to support a finding of nonconsensual sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">As our Supreme Court instmcts: \u201cRape is a general intent offense. [Citation.] Forcible rape is defined as \u2018an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator ...[\u00b6]... [\u00b6] (2) [w]here it is accomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\u2019 (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2).)\u201d <em>(People v. Griffin </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1015, 1022 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 891, 94 P.3d 1089] <em>(Griffin), </em>fn. omitted.) As used in the statute, \u201cforce\u201d is defined in accordance with common usage. In a forcible rape prosecution, the kind of force necessary need <em>not </em>be substantially different or greater than the physical force normally inherent in an act of consensual sexual intercourse: \u201cTo the contrary, it has long been recognized that \u2018in order to establish force within the meaning of section 261, [former] subdivision (2), the prosecution need only show the defendant used physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>force of a degree sufficient to support a finding that the act of sexual intercourse was against the will of the [victim].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1023-1024.) In fact, the <em>Griffin </em>court reaffirmed that the kind of physical force applied is immaterial, and \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018may consist in the taking of indecent liberties with a woman, or laying hold of and kissing her against her will.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">It must also be understood that in 1980, the Legislature amended the rape statute to eliminate the victim resistance requirement. \u201c[U]nder the modem rape statute, the jury no longer evaluates the element of force in terms of whether it physically prevents the victim from resisting or thwarting the attack.\u201d <em>(Griffin, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 1025.) The Legislature\u2019s amendment was premised on the recognition that the \u201c \u2018fundamental wrong\u2019 \u201d to be addressed by modem rape law is not the application of physical force that causes physical harm, but the guarding of \u201c \u2018a woman\u2019s will and the privacy of her sexuality from an act of intercourse undertaken without her consent. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, under current law, the force element plays a supporting role, designed to ensure that the act of intercourse was undertaken against a victim\u2019s will. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It follows that \u201cthe degree of force utilized is immaterial.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In sum, \u201c[t]he gravamen of the crime of forcible rape is a sexual penetration <em>accomplished against the victim\u2019s will </em>by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1027.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In this case, the evidence defendant used force to accomplish intercourse with the victim against her will was substantial and compelling. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we note that defendant was the victim\u2019s grandfather and at least 40 years older than she. Defendant was also an authority figure for her, who helped raise her\u2014and had dealt out corporal punishment to her when she was younger. He was also a large man. At all times in which he molested the victim, he was the only adult in the household. In the months leading up to the January 2005 incident, defendant had committed repeated acts of sexual abuse upon the victim, mainly involving his touching her vagina on top of her clothing. When defendant tried to reach his hand \u201cinside\u201d her pants, however, the victim would try to push him away; she consistently tried to stop him from touching her vagina underneath her clothes. Defendant warned the victim not to report the sexual abuse to anyone, telling her that \u201cit really wouldn\u2019t matter\u201d because nobody would believe her. Thus, the evidence showed at a minimum that prior to the rape incident, the victim did not welcome defendant\u2019s sexual advances and actively resisted his attempts to touch her genitalia directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>As to the incident itself, defendant opened the victim\u2019s bedroom door and entered the room without permission. He closed the door behind him and almost immediately jumped on the bed and climbed on top of the victim, pulling down her pants and underwear, and unzipping his pants. Defendant pulled the victim\u2019s legs wide apart, pushed her knees back, and painfully penetrated her vagina with his penis. She tried to push him off, but could not. Under the circumstances, those acts support a reasonable inference of violence to overcome her will. Moreover, we disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the victim remained entirely passive during the rape incident. Defendant erroneously supports his argument with a selection of the aspects of her testimony that support an inference that she offered no resistance because she was psychologically unable to move because she was \u201cin total shock,\u201d while ignoring the contrary testimony. Applying the deferential standard proper to appellate review, however, we hold the evidence as a whole supports the reasonable inference that the victim tried to push defendant away, but was unsuccessful because defendant pinned her down on the bed\u2014not merely that the victim was too frightened to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s primary argument, neither the surrounding circumstances nor the act of intercourse itself bore any reasonable indicia of consensual intercourse between two adults. (Cf. <em>Griffin, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 1027.) Indeed, defendant\u2019s analogy to consenting adults is dubious, if not absurd, in light of defendant\u2019s status as the victim\u2019s grandfather and disciplinarian, along with the great disparity in age and size between the two, not to mention the victim\u2019s consistent efforts to push defendant away when he tried to touch her genitalia directly. The manner of defendant\u2019s repeated sexual assaults on the victim, including his warning her not to report the incidents, bespeaks psychological coercion, not normal sexual relations. (See <em>People v. Cochran </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 8, 15-16 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 416].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In <em>Griffin, </em>the Supreme Court found sufficient evidence of the force element of rape in materially indistinguishable circumstances. The <em>Griffin </em>court found substantial evidence of force, despite the lack of evidence that the victim demonstrated any unwillingness to the defendant\u2019s initial sexual advances or objected to the defendant\u2019s conduct until after he had pinned her to the floor and penetrated her vagina. The reasoning in <em>Griffin </em>is dispositive here: \u201c[The victim] had never previously encountered defendant\u2019s attempt to have intercourse with her, as this was his first attempt. The jury could reasonably infer that by pinning her arms to the floor, defendant was able to achieve penetration on the occasion in question without [the victim\u2019s] consent before she was able to register her objection. The circumstance that defendant did not apply additional force to continue the intercourse after [the victim] objected does not eliminate his culpability for his initial penetration of [the victim] against her will by use of force. [\u00b6] The evidence, taken as a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and viewed in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict, is sufficient to support the conviction of forcible rape.\u201d <em>(Griffin, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 1029.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Here, as in <em>Griffin, </em>the onset of defendant\u2019s intercourse was sudden and unexpected, giving the victim little opportunity to object. Although the victim\u2014unlike the victim in Griffin\u2014did not offer direct testimony as to her lack of consent, there was ample evidence to support that reasonable inference. The victim had never welcomed or initiated any sexual contact with defendant. More significantly, she actively resisted defendant\u2019s repeated attempts to touch her genitalia under her clothes\u2014and, during the rape incident, the victim tried to push defendant away. Under these circumstances, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant overcame the victim\u2019s lack of consent by his use of force in pulling down her pants and underwear, and pushing her legs wide apart and pulling her knees up. It would strain credulity to believe that the same girl who tried repeatedly to rebuff her grandfather\u2019s attempts to put his hand inside her underwear would suddenly consent to intercourse with her abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>People v. Espinoza </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1287 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 700] to support his argument that there was insufficient evidence of duress is unavailing. Having found sufficient evidence that defendant used force to overcome the will of the victim to resist defendant\u2019s sexual attacks, we do not reach the question of whether the rape conviction was independently supportable under a duress theory. In any event, we find <em>Espinoza </em>wholly distinguishable. In <em>Espinoza, </em>there was no evidence of force in connection with any of the sexual offenses. At no time did the victim in <em>Espinoza </em>resist or object to defendant\u2019s acts of sexual molestation or attempted rape. Most significantly, during the attempted rape, the <em>Espinoza </em>defendant did not forcibly immobilize his victim to accomplish the penetration, but allowed the victim to move away to avoid being penetrated. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1293.) As a result, the only potentially viable prosecution theory in <em>Espinoza </em>was duress. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">B.-H.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The convictions on count 1 for continuous sexual abuse and on count 2 for committing a lewd act upon a child are reversed. The cause is remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the remaining counts, including discretionary sentencing under the applicable version of section 667.6, as well as section 1170, subdivision (b), as to defendant\u2019s rape conviction on count 9. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Turner, P.

On further consideration, we find such a reduction would be inappropriate as to either conviction because misdemeanor battery is subject to a one-year statute of limitations (\u00a7 802, subd. (a)). It is well established that the limitation of time applicable to an offense that is necessarily included within a greater offense is the limitation of time applicable to the lesser included offense, regardless of the limitation of time applicable to the greater offense. (\u00a7 805, subd. (b); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Statum </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 682, 699 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 50 P.3d 355].)
