Code, \u00a7 15000 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the Compact), which provides that, with respect to specified motor vehicle offenses, including the one at issue in this case, conduct leading to an out-of-state conviction may be treated as if the conduct had occurred in the driver\u2019s home state. (\u00a7\u00a7 15023, subd. (a)(2), 23626.) Application of the Compact requires sufficient evidence of conviction of a covered offense under a substantially similar statute. This appeal requires us to clarify the nature of the evidence sufficient to prove that the out-of-state conviction was based on conduct that would also violate a provision of our Vehicle Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The trial court found that evidence relied upon by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to prove an out-of-state conviction of driving under the influence of an of alcoholic beverage (DUI) was insufficient to prove that the violation from which the conviction arose would have constituted a violation of section 23152. We disagree and shall therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On June 2, 2005, respondent Brian McGill Isaac was convicted in California of driving a vehicle under the influence of an alcoholic beverage in violation of section 23152, subdivision (b), which makes it \u201cunlawful for any person who has [a] 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle.\u201d Respondent\u2019s conviction was based on a finding by the San Francisco Superior Court that his blood-alcohol level at the time was 0.19 percent. Less than a month later, after learning he had been convicted of a substantially similar offense in Ohio less than 10 years earlier, the DMV suspended his driving privileges for two years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 13352, subd. (a)(3), 23540, 23626.) As the suspension was mandatory (\u00a7 13352, subd. (a)), no hearing was required (\u00a7 14101, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">On August 16, 2006, respondent filed a petition for a writ of mandate asking the Marin County Superior Court to set aside the suspension order on the ground the DMV had failed to show that, if committed in this state, the Ohio offense would be a violation of section 23152. On November 9, 2006, the court granted the writ, finding the DMV \u201chas not presented sufficient, admissible evidence to show that the conviction in Ohio was for \u2018driving\u2019 under the influence.\u201d DMV filed a timely notice of appeal on December 12, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">As the judgment in this case is based on the trial court\u2019s application of the relevant provisions of the Vehicle Code to undisputed facts, we review the judgment de novo. <em>(Moles v. Gourley </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 555]; <em>McDonald v.

(a)(2).) \u201cFor the compact to apply, there must be sufficient evidence of conviction under a substantially similar statute. [Citation.] California thus may not give effect to out-of-state conviction reports unless \u2018(1) the law of the reporting state pertaining to conviction is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as California law pertaining to the conviction; (2) the description of the violation from which the conviction arose is sufficient; and (3) the interpretation and enforcement of the law of the reporting state are \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as the interpretation and enforcement of the California law in question.\u2019 ([Citation], quoting \u00a7 13363, subd. (b); see also \u00a7 15023, subd. (c) [where statutory language is not identical, \u2018violations of a substantially similar nature\u2019 in another state constitute reciprocal offenses].)\u201d <em>(Moles v. Gourley, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1055.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\u201c \u2018Section 23152 is the basic Vehicle Code provision prohibiting any person under the influence of alcohol or drugs from driving a motor vehicle.\u2019 <em>(Pollack </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 367, 372 [211 Cal.Rptr. 748, 696 P.2d 141], fn. omitted.) In relevant part, the statute makes it \u2018unlawful for any person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage ... to drive a vehicle.\u2019 (\u00a7 23152, subd. (a).) [\u00b6] Thus, under California\u2019s DUI law, the relevant conduct is \u2018to drive.\u2019 (\u00a7 23152, subd. (a).) The specified conveyance is \u2018a vehicle.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Moles </em>v. <em>Gourley, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1055-1056, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Respondent\u2019s central claim is that the DMV \u201cdid not tender to the trial court a single document that supported its contention that [his] Ohio conviction in 1995 involved the act of \u2018driving,\u2019 \u201d which is a necessary element of the drunk driving offense described in section 23152. <em>(Mercer v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 753 [280 Cal.Rptr. 745, 809 P.2d 404] <em>(Mercer).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\n<em>The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The fact of respondent\u2019s California DUI offense in 2005 is undisputed. The documentary evidence relating to the charges and conviction in Ohio, and the pertinent provisions of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) and Traffic Code of the City of Columbus, Ohio (Traffic Code), were, without objection, judicially noticed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Appellant was, on March 12, 1995, charged in Ohio with the simultaneous commission of four offenses: <em>First, </em>that he did \u201coperate\u201d a vehicle while \u201cunder the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them\u201d in violation of ORC section 4511.19, subdivision (A)(1)(a); <em>second, </em>that he did \u201coperate\u201d a vehicle while having \u201ca concentration of at least two-hundredths of one gram but less than eight-hundredths of one gram by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of [his] breath,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in violation of ORC section 4511.19, subdivision (B)(3); <em>third, </em>that he did \u201coperate a motor vehicle . . . without being in reasonable control of the vehicle\u201d in violation of ORC section 4511.202; and <em>fourth, </em>that he did \u201coperate a motor vehicle\u201d in Ohio during a period in which his driver\u2019s license had been suspended or revoked in violation of ORC section 4507.02, subdivision (B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">All four of the charges filed against respondent in the Franklin County, Ohio Municipal Court, which were in the form of sequentially numbered traffic citations, alleged in identical language that he committed all of the foregoing offenses at 3:15 a.m. on March 12, 1995, while traveling southbound on the Olentangy Freeway \u201cbetween W. Wilson Bridge and Bethel Rd.\u201d A certified copy of the court docket shows that the charge of violation of ORC section 4511.19, subdivision (A)(1)(a), was \u201camended\u201d to allege a violation of Traffic Code section 2133.01, and on October 26, 1995, respondent entered a plea of guilty to that offense and was convicted on that basis. Traffic Code section 2133.01 provides that \u201c[n]o person shall operate any vehicle within [Columbus, Ohio] if, at the time of the operation, ...[][] (1) The person is under the influence of alcohol, a dmg of abuse, or a combination of them [or] [\u00b6] (2) The person has a concentration of eight-hundredths (0.08) of one (1) percent or more but less than seventeen-hundredths (0.17) of one (1) percent by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person\u2019s whole blood.\u201d This offense is by its own terms \u201c[e]quivalent\u201d to \u201c[a] violation of division (A) or (B) of Section 4511.19 of the [ORC].\u201d (Traffic Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2133.01, subd. (E)(1), 2133.011, subd. (A)(1).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of his conviction of Traffic Code section 2133.01, respondent was fined $500 and his license was suspended for one year, commencing on March 12, 1995, the date of the conduct upon which the four ORC violations were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>The citation charging appellant with a violation of ORC section 4511.19, subdivision (A)(1)(a), states on its face that respondent \u201c[d]id operate [his] motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs of abuse or the combined influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse.\u201d The citation charging him with simultaneously violating former subdivision (A)(3) of the same Ohio statute states that he \u201c[d]id have a concentration of ten hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\u201d The citation charging a violation of ORC section 4511.202, failure to be in reasonable control of a vehicle, states that respondent was operating his vehicle in a \u201cweaving course outside of marked lanes.\u201d Finally, the citation charging respondent with violation of ORC section 4507.02, subdivision (B)(1), operating a vehicle with a license that has been suspended or revoked, states that respondent was \u201cdriving under suspension, to wit: suspension from 04-05-94 to 04-05-97, case #9406276.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The trial court found that the foregoing evidence failed \u201cto show that [respondent\u2019s] conviction in Ohio was for \u2018driving\u2019 under the influence.\u201d Respondent\u2019s contention that this finding was correct and justified the granting of the writ, is based on the analysis adopted in <em>Draeger, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th 1511, which the trial court explicitly relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\n<em>Draeger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In <em>Draeger, </em>the DMV suspended an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license following two drunk driving convictions, one in California and the other in Florida. The trial court granted a petition for writ of mandate against the director of the DMV and ordered her to eliminate the Florida drunk driving conviction from the driver\u2019s record and set aside the order suspending his license. The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding there was insufficient evidence to show that the conviction under the Florida statute was actually for drunk driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\"><em>Draeger </em>commences with analyses of the Compact and other pertinent provisions of the Vehicle Code. \u201c \u2018Basically, the Compact provides that a driver\u2019s entire record\u2014including out-of-state convictions\u2014will be known to his home state. For the four specified offenses\u2014(1) manslaughter or negligent homicide; (2) driving while under the influence of liquor or drugs; (3) a felony in which a motor vehicle is used; and (4) hit-run driving which results in injury or death\u2014the compact provides that the conduct leading to an out-of-state conviction will be treated as if the conduct had occurred in the driver\u2019s home state.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>\u201cAccordingly, under section 15022, \u2018[t]he licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code, or ordinance violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered, or the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security; and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith.\u2019 For purposes of suspending, revoking, or limiting the license to operate a motor vehicle, the licensing authority of the home state \u2018shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Section 15022 of this compact, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state, in the case of a conviction for: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (2) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor ....\u2019(\u00a7 15023, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u201cUnder section 13352, subdivision (a), the DMV \u2018shall immediately suspend or revoke, or record the court-administered suspension or revocation of, the privilege of any person to operate a motor vehicle upon receipt of a <em>duly certified abstract of the record of any court </em>showing that the person has been convicted of a violation of Section 23152 . . . .\u2019 (Italics added [by <em>Draeger].) </em>It must suspend the license for eighteen months if the driver is convicted of two violations of section 23152 within a seven-year period. (\u00a7\u00a7 13352, subd. (a)(3), 23165.) Under section 13352, subdivision (d), and consistent with the Driver License Compact, \u2018[a] conviction of an offense in any state,. .. which, if committed in this state, would be a violation of Section 23152, is a conviction of Section 23152 for purposes of this section, . . . The department shall suspend or revoke the privilege to operate a motor vehicle pursuant to this section upon receiving notice of that conviction.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\u201cSection 13363 provides additional direction concerning out-of-state convictions. Subdivision (a) states that DMV \u2018may, in its discretion, . . . suspend or revoke the privilege of any resident or nonresident to drive a motor vehicle in this State upon receiving notice of the conviction of the person in a state, ... of the United States, ... of an offense therein which, if committed in this State, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the privilege to operate a motor vehicle.\u2019 <em>Moomjian v. Zolin </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1606, 1613-1614 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 335], holds the specific, mandatory provisions of section 13352, subdivision (a)(3) control over the discretionary provisions of section 13363, subdivision (a). Subdivision (b) of section 13363 states that DMV \u2018shall not give effect to [a report of an out-of-state conviction] pursuant to . . . Section 15023 unless the department is satisfied that the law of such other place pertaining to the conviction is substantially the same as the law of this State pertaining to such conviction and that the description of the violation from which the conviction arose, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>sufficient and that the interpretation and enforcement of such law are substantially the same in such other place as they are in this State.\u2019 <em>Moomjian </em>does not expressly limit the application of the mandatory provisions of section 13363, subdivision (b).\u201d <em>(Draeger, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1516-1517.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The \u201cpivotal question\u201d in <em>Draeger </em>was <em>\u201cwhat </em>DMV is required to compare to determine whether Draeger\u2019s Florida conviction would be a drunk driving conviction under section 23152. Does California, the home state of the licensee, look to the facts underlying the conviction in Florida, a reporting party state; or does California simply match the elements of its own cognate offense to see if they are congruent?\u201d <em>(Draeger, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 1519.) Acknowledging that the Compact \u201cis ambiguous as to which test the Legislature intended California to apply to determine whether an out-of-state drunk driving conviction would be a drunk driving conviction under section 23152\u201d <em>{Draeger, </em>at p. 1520), and that there were competing considerations, the court resolved the issue on the basis of section 13363. As earlier noted, section 23152, subdivision (b) \u201cprovides that California will not give effect to such reports unless DMV is satisfied that: (1) the law of the reporting state pertaining to conviction is \u2018substantially the same\u2019 as California law pertaining to the conviction; (2) the description of the violation from which the conviction arose is sufficient; and (3) the interpretation and enforcement of the law of the reporting state are \u2018substantially the same\u2019 as the interpretation and enforcement of the California law in question.\u201d <em>(Draeger, </em>at p. 1521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The <em>Draeger </em>court affirmed the ruling against DMV for two related reasons. First, the Florida statute was not in all respects \u201csubstantially\u201d similar to section 23152 on its face. Although the first prong of the Florida statute, which prohibits driving under the influence of alcohol, is substantially the same as section 23152, the Florida statute also applies to a person who is under the influence of alcoholic beverages while \u201cin actual physical control of a vehicle,\u201d (Fla. Stat., \u00a7 316.193), which does not necessarily include <em>driving </em>the vehicle, and may represent the sort of conduct that in California is generally prosecuted as public drunkenness under Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f). <em>(Draeger, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 1522.) Second, while DMV could have cured the problem by providing \u201csufficient admissible evidence that Draeger was convicted of drunk <em>driving </em>in Florida\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>it had failed to do so. The documents that formed the basis for the DMV action were the police report and the traffic citation. The Compact barred consideration of the police report because it was not an abstract of judgment and did not ordinarily form part of the record of conviction. <em>(Draeger, </em>at p. 1523.) The traffic citation was, however, a part of the record of conviction because, as here, it served as the charging document. Furthermore, the traffic citation\u2014 which indicated Draeger \u201cwas stopped after the officer observed his vehicle running a stop sign and crossing the center line\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 1518)\u2014sufficiently showed Draeger was \u201cdriving\u201d a vehicle at the time of the offense. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>problem in <em>Draeger </em>was that the traffic citation was \u201cinsufficient, standing alone, to establish Draeger was <em>convicted\u2019 </em>of the offense. <em>(Id </em>at p. 1523.) Though the district attorney possessed a certified copy of the docket of the Florida court showing Draeger had been convicted of the offense described on the traffic citation, he inexplicably failed to make it a part of the court record. <em>(Id </em>at p. 1523.) Due to this \u201cmissing piece of the puzzle,\u201d the court felt compelled to affirm the judgment in Draeger\u2019s favor, leaving it to the Director of the DMV \u201cto determine whether DMV can or should pursue suspension of Draeger\u2019s driving privilege under section 13352 based on a more complete record of conviction.\u201d <em>(Draeger, </em>at p. 1523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">DMV agrees that under <em>Mercer, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 753, \u201coperating\u201d a vehicle is not \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as \u201cdriving\u201d a vehicle. As pointed out in <em>Mercer, </em>\u201c[i]n everyday usage the phrase, \u2018to drive a vehicle,\u2019 is understood as requiring evidence of volitional movement of a vehicle. Numerous dictionary definitions\u2014including Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1981), . . . support a definition of \u2018drive\u2019 that includes movement. [Citation.] We believe these definitions are consistent with the usual and ordinary understanding of that term, and suggest the sense in which the word was intended by the Legislature in the present context.\u201d <em>(Mercer, </em>at p. 763, fn. omitted.) <em>Mercer </em>explains that California is among the minority of states that prohibit simply \u201cdriving\u201d a vehicle while intoxicated; most states prohibit \u201c \u2018driving or operating\u2019 or simply \u2018operating\u2019 a vehicle . . . , or \u2018driving or being in [or \u201chaving\u201d] actual physical control\u2019 of a vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id </em>at p. 766.) The overwhelming majority of those statutes have been interpreted as ascribing to the words \u201cbeing in actual physical control of\u2019 or \u201coperating\u201d a vehicle \u201ca broad scope not limited to or dependent on volitional movement of a vehicle. In fact, most cases uphold a finding of \u2018operation\u2019 or \u2018being in actual physical control\u2019 even when ... the arrestee was found asleep, slumped over the steering wheel of an operable car with its [motor] running.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 767, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">DMV also agrees with respondent that, because \u201coperating\u201d a motor vehicle is not \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as \u201cdriving\u201d such a vehicle, it could not suspend his driver\u2019s license except upon sufficient admissible evidence that his Ohio conviction involved drunk <em>driving. </em>The only disagreement between the parties is whether DMV has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Respondent does not respond to DMV\u2019s claim that the statements on two of the traffic citations\u2014that at the time of all of the ORC offenses with which he was charged respondent was \u201cweaving course outside of marked lanes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>and \u201cdriving\u201d with a suspended license\u2014support but one reasonable inference: that he was then \u201cdriving.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Implicitly conceding the point, respondent claims the evidence he was \u201cweaving course\u201d and \u201cdriving\u201d at the time of the offense is \u201cinadmissible\u201d and was therefore improperly considered. This is so, respondent maintains, because the statements on the two traffic citations DMV relies upon do not charge the offense to which he pled guilty, he was not convicted of any of the offenses charged by those citations, and, in any event, the statements on the two citations indicating he was \u201cdriving\u201d do not establish that the declarant actually \u201cobserved\u201d his vehicle \u201cweaving course outside of marked lanes\u201d or had personal knowledge he was \u201cdriving\u201d with a suspended license, and the statements therefore \u201cmay have been based on mere hearsay or speculation, and may have even later been found false.\u201d <em>Draeger, </em>the sole case respondent relies upon, does not support his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Respondent\u2019s argument is apparently based upon the statement in <em>Draeger </em>that the DMV had in that case \u201cfailed to provide sufficient <em>admissible </em>evidence that Draeger was convicted of drunk <em>driving </em>in Florida.\u201d <em>(Draeger, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 1522, first italics added.) Respondent assumes the admissibility to which this statement refers is that measured by the conventional rules of evidence applicable at trial in civil and criminal proceedings, such as the hearsay rule. This is clearly not the case. The context makes it obvious that the standard of admissibility the court had in mind was simply whether the documents that formed the basis of DMV\u2019s administrative determination that Draeger\u2019s out-of-state DUI conviction involved \u201cdriving\u201d were \u201cpart of the record of conviction\u201d in Florida, which is all that was necessary to render them administratively admissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The police report was inadmissible, the court explained, because it was neither an abstract of judgment nor part of the record of conviction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1523.) The traffic citation <em>was </em>admissible, however, because it served as the charging document and was therefore \u201cproperly included in the record of conviction.\u201d As nearly as can be discerned from the opinion, Draeger was not convicted (or even charged) in Florida with \u201crunning a stop sign and crossing the center line,\u201d as stated on the citation, but only of \u201cdriving or [being] in actual physical control of a vehicle . . . [while] under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1518, italics omitted.) Nothing in <em>Draeger </em>indicates that the statement indicating Draeger was \u201cdriving\u201d at the time of that offense would have been inadmissible if it did not appear on the citation charging him with DUI but, as here, on other citations charging him with contemporaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>offenses that necessarily involved \u201cdriving\u201d and were dismissed in consideration of his plea to the DUI charge. Thus, <em>Draeger </em>does not support respondent\u2019s contention that the traffic citations DMV relied upon to suspend his license are inadmissible to show that his Ohio DUI conviction involved \u201cdriving.\u201d Finally, unlike <em>Draeger, </em>the traffic citations do not \u201cstand alone.\u201d The certified court docket missing in <em>Draeger </em>is not missing here, and it establishes that respondent was <em>convicted </em>of an offense which, if committed in this state, would be a violation of section 23152.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Respondent\u2019s claim, which the trial court apparently accepted, that the evidence showing that the out-of-state conviction arose from conduct that involved driving was \u201cmere hearsay,\u201d ignores an exception to the hearsay rule applicable in administrative DMV proceedings to suspend a person\u2019s driving privilege. In <em>Hildebrand v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1562 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 234], the DMV offered an officer\u2019s sworn statement and an unsworn arrest report to prove Hildebrand was driving when he was arrested, at which time his vehicle was stuck on railroad tracks. Rejecting Hildebrand\u2019s claim that the observations in these documents were inadmissible to prove he was driving, the court stated as follows: \u201cIn meeting its burden at the administrative level, the DMV may present \u2018[a]ny relevant evidence ... if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of the evidence over objection in civil actions.\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (c).)\u201d <em>(Hildebrand, </em>at p. 1569.) The court acknowledged that \u201chearsay evidence is not \u2018. . . sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid., </em>citing Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (d) and <em>Gananian v. Zolin </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 634 at p. 638 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 384]), but pointed out that under Evidence Code section 1280 the officer\u2019s sworn statement and unsworn report each qualified as an admissible public employee record in an administrative proceeding, even to the extent that each relied upon the personal observations of another public employee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Hildebrand, </em>at p. 1570.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Entirely apart from the applicable exception to the hearsay rule, we must keep in mind the vast difference between the protections afforded a driver whose license may be suspended as the result of an administrative determination by DMV, which may properly be made on the basis of the record of a foreign conviction, and the protections afforded a criminal defendant, who has a due process right to be tried only upon competent evidence properly offered and admitted at trial which meets the People\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (see <em>People v. Crane </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 425, 434 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 334]), and to be sentenced in accordance with a highly protective regime. Thus, as explained in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at pages 688-689, the test to determine whether an out-of-state DUI conviction arose out of conduct which, if committed in California, would violate section 23152, is justifiably far less demanding of the state than the test to determine whether a foreign conviction can be considered a qualifying prior conviction under the three strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Finally, in determining the proper test for determining whether an out-of-state drunk driving conviction would be a drunk driving conviction under section 23152, as to which the Compact is ambiguous, we must be mindful of the legislative directive that the Compact and implementing provisions of the Vehicle Code are to be liberally construed (\u00a7 15028) so as to accomplish the Compact\u2019s important remedial purposes. (See <em>McDonald v. Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 687.) The strict test respondent urges us to apply would render the Compact and implementing provisions of our Vehicle Code nugatory insofar as they apply to drunk driving convictions in those states party to the Compact that make it unlawful to \u201coperate\u201d or \u201cphysically control\u201d rather than \u201cdrive\u201d a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, particularly when, as here, the conviction is based on a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. (See <em>Draeger, supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the traffic citations issued to respondent on March 12, 1995, which describe conduct that all occurred at the same time and place\u2014and specifically the two citations indicating that respondent was then \u201cweaving course outside of marked lanes\u201d and \u201cdriving\u201d with a suspended license\u2014are admissible and sufficient to show that his out-of-state conviction for \u201coperating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs\u201d involved \u201cdriving.\u201d DMV therefore provided sufficient evidence that respondent\u2019s Ohio conviction was based on conduct that, if committed in this state, would violate section 23152.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The judgment is reversed.
