(SkyWest), on their class action for alleged violations of California labor law regarding minimum wages, overtime, and meal/rest breaks. Appellants are suing individually and on behalf of former and current SkyWest flight attendants (FA\u2019s) working for SkyWest in California. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of SkyWest, ruling inter alia that the action was preempted by the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>SkyWest and Its Flight Attendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">SkyWest is a regional air carrier with headquarters in Utah. It operates as United Express in 91 cities and provides 1,500 daily flights to 120 cities in 32 states and Canada. SkyWest also provides air carrier services for Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">SkyWest FA\u2019s receive flight pay (also referred to as \u201cblock to block time\u201d) from the time the aircraft blocks are removed at takeoff until the aircraft reaches its destination. In 2001, flight pay ranged from $17.50 per hour to $31.20 an hour depending on seniority and the work schedule. Top-end flight pay for FA\u2019s is currently $37.07 an hour. FA\u2019s also receive a per diem wage of $1.60 an hour for block time while the aircraft is readied for flight, while passengers board and disembark, and for flight standbys and stay overs. On any given workday, the ratio of block time to flight time is about two to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\n<em>The Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">California Industrial Welfare Commission Order No. 9-2001 (IWC Order No. 9-2001) requires that certain persons employed in the transportation industry be paid not less than the minimum wage and receive meal/rest breaks and overtime. The complaint alleges that SkyWest FA\u2019s are not provided uninterrupted rest periods or meal breaks. Nor do FA\u2019s receive overtime or state minimum wage for block time. The complaint seeks damages for unpaid minimum wages (first cause of action; Lab. Code, \u00a7 1194), unpaid meal and rest breaks (second cause of action), overtime (third cause of action), waiting time penalties (fourth cause of action; Lab. Code, \u00a7 203), and relief under the unfair business practices act (fifth cause of action; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>The Summary Judgment Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The moving papers establish that FA compensation is based on the SkyWest Airlines Crewmember Policy Manual, which has all the attributes of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) and was negotiated by the SkyWest In-Flight Association (SIA) and SkyWest. SIA is an employee association and the exclusive bargaining representative for SkyWest FA\u2019s. It has 1,100 members and has negotiated compensation and workplace rules for the past 10 years. About every two years, a new SIA/SkyWest compensation agreement is negotiated, voted on by FA\u2019s, and if approved, incorporated into the SkyWest Crewmember Policy Manual (herein referred to as CBA).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Pursuant to the CBA, FA\u2019s bid each month for their work schedules and receive flight pay, per diem block pay, vacation and holiday pay, and compensation for flight cancellations and overnight stayovers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The compensation methodology is standard in the airline industry. SkyWest FA\u2019s are guaranteed 3.75 hours\u2019 flight pay each workday. The CBA provides that FA\u2019s may not eat meals during critical phases of flight and that FAA regulations prohibit FA\u2019s from working more than 14 hours at a stretch.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">As indicated, the trial court ruled that the action was preempted by the federal Railway Labor Act (RLA; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.) and that application of IWC Order No. 9-2001 would violate the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1)). We review the order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>(Department of Industrial Relations v. Nielsen Construction Co. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1016, 1024 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>IWC Order No. 9-2001 and </em>Armenta</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The California Industrial Welfare Commission \u201cis the state agency empowered to formulate regulations (known as wage orders) governing employment in the State of California. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Tidewater Marine Western, Inc. v. Bradshaw </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 557, 561 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 927 P.2d 296].) IWC Order No. 9-2001 applies to the transportation industry (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11090) and provides: \u201cEvery employer shall pay to each employee, on the established payday for the period involved, not less than the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked in the payroll period, whether the remuneration is measured by time, piece, commission, or otherwise.\u201d (IWC Order No. 9-2001, subd. 4(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The complaint alleges that block time pay ($1.60 per hour) violates California minimum wage law. SkyWest asserts that FA compensation averages $23.13 an hour (flight time plus block time, averaged over a month), a pay rate that is substantially greater than the state minimum wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Citing <em>Armenta </em>v. <em>Osmose, Inc. </em>(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 314 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 460] <em>(Armenta), </em>appellants argue that wage averaging does not trump state minimum wage law. In <em>Armenta, </em>a company that serviced utility poles did not pay its employees for travel time and time spent loading equipment and supplies. We held that California\u2019s labor statutes reflect a strong public policy in favor of full payment of wages for all hours worked. \u201c[T]he FLSA [Fair Labor Standards Act] model of averaging all hours worked \u2018in any work week\u2019 to compute an employer\u2019s minimum wage obligation under California law is inappropriate. The minimum wage standard applies to each hour worked by respondents for which they were not paid.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\"><em>Armenta </em>is distinguishable on several grounds: it did not involve an interstate air carrier, it did not involve the RLA or a CBA sanctioned under the RLA, and it did not involve a state wage order that contained an RLA exemption. In <em>Armenta, </em>the employer violated its own CBA and written employment policies which required that employees be paid for time spent driving company vehicles to and from job sites. <em>(Armenta, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 319.) The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement issued an opinion letter stating that the employees were entitled to compensation for all hours worked. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 319-320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>We concluded that the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement opinion letter did not have the force of law but the reasoning expressed in the letter was persuasive. <em>(Armenta, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 324.) The opinion letter noted that Labor Code sections 221, 222, and 223 prohibit an employer from \u201cwithholding from the employee, or secretly paying to the employee, some amount less than the employee\u2019s <em>actual, agreed wages </em>for work performed by the employee.\u201d (135 Cal.App.4th at p. 320, italics added.) We held that the state \u201cminimum wage standard applies to each hour worked by [employees] for which they were not paid.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 324.) An employer may not invoke a federal wage averaging formula to defend against a minimum wage claim where the employer, in violation of its own wage agreement, pays no wage for an hour worked. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s labor statutes reflect a strong public policy in favor of full payment of wages for all hours worked.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Unlike <em>Armenia, </em>here there is no evidence that SkyWest pays FA\u2019s less than what was collectively bargained for. As discussed in <em>Armenia, </em>Labor Code \u201c[s]ections 221, 222, and 223 articulate the principle] that all hours must be paid at the statutory or <em>agreed rate </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Armenta, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 323, italics added.) Here the agreed rate is set forth in the SkyWest CBA which was voted on and approved by SkyWest FA\u2019s. Under appellants\u2019 construction of the law, IWC Order No. 9-2001 sets a minimum wage standard for every interstate airline carrier regardless of how much it burdens interstate commerce, an argument that was properly rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The RLA provides that state law rights and obligations that do not exist independently of a collective bargaining agreement may be waived or altered by the collective bargaining agreement. (See, e.g., <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. </em>v. <em>Lueck </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 202, 213 [85 L.Ed.2d 206, 216, 105 S.Ct. 1904]; <em>Adames </em>v. <em>Executive Airlines, Inc. </em>(1st Cir. 2001) 258 F.3d 7, 12.) The purpose of the RLA is to bring about stable relations between labor and management in the national transportation industry. <em>(Thibodeaux v. Executive Jet Intern., Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 2003) 328 F.3d 742, 754.) \u201cCongress has long concerned itself with minimizing interruptions in the Nation\u2019s transportation services by strikes and labor disputes and has made successive attempts to establish effective machinery to resolve disputes not only as to wages, hours, and working conditions, the so-called major disputes connected with a negotiation of contracts or alterations in them, but also as to the interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>and application of existing contracts . . . .\u201d <em>(Machinists v. Central Airlines </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 682, 687 [10 L.Ed.2d 67, 72, 83 S.Ct. 956], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\n<em>Railway Labor Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The RLA regulates labor relations between common interstate air carriers and their employees. (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181; <em>DeTomaso v. Pan American World Airways, Inc. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 517, 525 [235 Cal.Rptr. 292, 733 P.2d 614].) It requires that carriers \u201cexert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, and to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.\u201d (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152.) This is the \u201cheart\u201d of the RLA. <em>(Railroad Trainmen v. Terminal Co. </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 369, 377-378 [22 L.Ed.2d 344, 354, 89 S.Ct. 1109].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>United Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>(1963) 211 Cal.App.2d 729 [28 Cal.Rptr. 238] (disapproved on another point in <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 690, 728, fn. 15 [166 Cal.Rptr. 331, 613 P.2d 579]) illustrates the conflict that can arise between a state wage order and the RLA. There, the Court of Appeal held that an IWC order requiring employers to pay for flight attendant uniforms did not apply to an interstate airline because the collective bargaining agreement provided that the cost of uniforms was to be paid in part by the employee. The court concluded that the IWC order was preempted by the RLA and that enforcement of the IWC order would burden interstate commerce: \u201cA stewardess based in California gets a free uniform even though most, or perhaps all of her work is on interstate planes. A stewardess based outside of California who works on planes coming into California does not. Likewise, on interstate flights there might very well be two stewardesses working side by side, one with a free uniform, the other with a uniform a part only of the cost of which United paid. Again, if a stewardess based in another state and having under the collective bargaining agreement paid a portion of the cost of her uniform, is temporarily based in California, would her money have to be repaid to her? Such discrimination is bound to cause personnel troubles and to that extent, at least, a burden on interstate commerce. The situations above mentioned point out strongly the interference of the regulation with interstate commerce and the necessity for a uniform rule throughout the carrier\u2019s system.\u201d (211 Cal.App.2d at pp. 748-749.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>Overtime Wages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">IWC Order No. 9-2001, subdivision 1(E) contains an RLA exemption and provides that overtime wages do not have to be paid to \u201cemployees who have entered into a collective bargaining agreement under and in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>with the [RLA], 45 U.S.C. Sections 151 et seq.\u201d Appellants assert there is no CBA because SkyWest is a nonunion employer. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Under the RLA, airline employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152.) The RLA provides that \u201cthe term \u2018representative\u2019 means any person or persons, labor union, organization, or corporation <em>designated either by a carrier or group of carriers or by its or their employees, </em>to act for it or them.\u201d (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, italics added.) \u201cThere are no qualifiers attached to the [RLA\u2019s] simple definition of \u2018representative.\u2019 The \u2018representative\u2019 of a craft of employees is, simply, a person or union [or an association] designated to act on their behalf, to accomplish what they seek to accomplish, and is not necessarily a man [or woman] for all seasons.\u201d <em>(Russell v. National Mediation Bd. </em>(5th Cir. 1983) 714 F.2d 1332, 1341.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">California law is consistent with the RLA and provides that employees have the right to organize and collectively bargain through a representative. (See <em>Safeway Stores v. Retail Clerks etc. Assn. </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 567, 576-577 [261 P.2d 721]; <em>Gelini v. Tishgart </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 219, 226 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 447].) Labor Code section 923 declares that it is \u201cthe public policy of this State\u201d \u201cthat the individual work[er] have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his [or her] own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his [or her] employment, and that he [or she] shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Here the CBA was negotiated by SIA, an employee organization recognized by SkyWest and SkyWest FA\u2019s. For more than 10 years, SIA has negotiated wage and benefit plans that have been approved by SkyWest FA\u2019s and made a part of the SkyWest Crewmember Policy Manual. Appellants cite no authority that the RLA exemption for overtime wages in IWC Order No. 9-2001 does not apply to CBA\u2019s negotiated by an employee organization such as SIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\n<em>State Minimum Wage and Meal/Rest Breaks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Although the RLA contains no specific language with respect to state minimum wage law and meals/rest breaks, our courts have interpreted the RLA to preempt state law causes of action that depend upon interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of a CBA. <em>(Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 246, 253-254 [129 L.Ed.2d 203, 211-212, 114 S.Ct. 2239]; <em>Soldinger v. Northwest Airlines, Inc. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 345, 360 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 747].) Under the RLA, interpretation of a CBA lies in the exclusive jurisdiction of arbitrational bodies created by the RLA. (See <em>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, supra, </em>512 U.S. at pp. 254-256 [129 L.Ed.2d at pp. 212-213]; <em>Espinal v. Northwest Airlines </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 90 F.3d 1452, 1455-1456.) \u201cThe key [to RLA preemption] is whether the CBA must be interpreted or applied. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Soldinger v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>DeTomaso </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at page 529, our state Supreme Court held that RLA preemption extends to \u201cany claim premised on facts inextricably intertwined with matters subject to the grievance procedures of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Federal courts use a similar test. In <em>Adames v. Executive Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>258 F.3d 7, a federal court held that an action under Puerto Rico law for wages, overtime pay, and meal breaks was preempted by the RLA. Citing United States Supreme Court cases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court concluded that if state law claims are \u201c \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with the meaning of terms in the CBA,\u201d the state law claims are preempted by the RLA. (258 F.3d at p. 12.) \u201cIn such instances, state law \u2018must yield to the developing federal common law, lest common terms in bargaining agreements be given different and potentially inconsistent interpretations in different jurisdictions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Citing <em>Valles v. Ivy Hill Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 410 F.3d 1071 and <em>Bonilla v. Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts </em>(C.D.Cal. 2005) 407 F.Supp.2d 1107, appellants argue that the statutory right to meal breaks and rest periods is \u201cnonnegotiable\u201d and may not be subject to a collective bargaining agreement opt-out provision. Those cases are inapposite and do not involve the RLA or an interstate air carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">SkyWest FA\u2019s collectively bargained for a compensation system that guarantees 3.75 hours\u2019 flight pay each work shift. The CBA provides for a bundle of benefits that include flight pay, block time, overtime, flight standbys and layovers, vacation, and meal/rest breaks. Rest periods and meal breaks are referenced in the SIA/SkyWest CBA which incorporates FAA regulations that FA\u2019s may not eat meals \u201cduring critical phases of flight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Assuming, arguendo, that the trial court found meal and rest break violations, it would have to determine whether the FA was receiving flight pay or block time pay when the violation occurred. IWC Order No. 9-2001, subdivisions 11(D), 12(B), states that the damages are \u201cone (1) hour of pay at the employee\u2019s <em>regular rate of compensation . </em>. . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.) The trial court, however, could not determine the regular rate of compensation without interpreting the CBA. (See, e.g., <em>Adames v. Executive Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>258 F.3d at p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">A similar preemption problem arose in <em>Burgos v. Executive Air, Inc. </em>(D.P.R. 1996) 914 F.Supp. 792. There, a flight attendant sued for minimum wage and overtime pay under Puerto Rico law. The federal court held that the action was preempted by the RLA because flight attendant compensation was based on a CBA that took into account flight time, on-duty time, and a flight time guarantee. \u201c[Plaintiff\u2019s status under Puerto Rico law depends upon the interaction of three separate articles of the CBA. Whether she \u2018worked\u2019\u2014 broadly defined as hours \u2018on duty\u2019\u2014more than the statutorily prescribed m\u00e1ximums is not dispositive of her claim since her pay was not tied to hours worked, but rather to her guarantee. Determining whether she was under-paid would require ascertaining her \u2018flight time\u2019 both for that week and for the month, as well as her on-duty time. After calculating these figures, the CBA would need to be consulted to determine both base and overtime pay. Then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>her total pay, separating her guarantee from overtime pay, would need to be compared to on-duty time in order to calculate her effective hourly salaries (base and overtime). Only at this point could Burgos\u2019 status under the law be determined.\u201d (914 F.Supp. at pp. 796-797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<em>Waiting Time Penalties and Unfair Business Practices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Appellants\u2019 claims for state minimum wages (first cause of action) and meal/break time damages (second cause of action) are preempted by the RLA. With respect to overtime wages (third cause of action), IWC Order No. 9-2001 exempts SkyWest because the claim is subject to a CBA that was negotiated and approved by SkyWest FA\u2019s. Because the first, second, and third causes of action are preempted by the RLA, the trial court properly ruled that the fourth cause of action for waiting time penalties (Lab. Code, \u00a7 203) and fifth cause of action for violation of the Unfair Business Practices Act were barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\n<em>Interstate Commerce Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The trial court also correctly ruled that application of IWC Order No. 9-2001 would substantially burden interstate commerce. The purpose of the RLA is to bring about stable relations between labor and management in the national transportation industry. <em>(Thibodeaux v. Executive Jet Intern., Inc., supra, </em>328 F.3d at p. 754.) \u201cCongress has long concerned itself with minimizing interruptions in the Nation\u2019s transportation services by strikes and labor disputes and has made successive attempts to establish effective machinery to resolve disputes not only as to wages, hours, and working conditions, the so-called major disputes connected with a negotiation of contracts or alterations in them, but also as to the interpretation and application of existing contracts . . . .\u201d <em>(Machinists v. Central Airlines, supra, </em>372 U.S. at p. 687 [10 L.Ed.2d 67, 72], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\n<em>Airline Deregulation Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Alternatively, the trial court ruled that the complaint was barred by the ADA. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1).) The ADA provides that a state \u201cmay not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service\u201d of an air carrier. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1); see <em>Vinnick v. Delta Airlines, Inc. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 859, 864 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 471].) In two cases the United States Supreme Court has held that claims under a state unfair business practices statute are preempted by the ADA because the state claims would impose economic regulation on airlines. <em>(Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 374, 388-389 [119 L.Ed.2d. 157, 170-171, 112 S.Ct. 2031] [class action based on frequent flier program]; <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens </em>(1995) 513 U.S. 219, 228 [130 L.Ed.2d 715, 725, 115 S.Ct. 817] [same]; see also <em>In re JetBlue Airways Corp. Privacy Litigation </em>(E.D.N.Y. 2005) 379 F.Supp.2d 299, 315-316 [action brought under California Unfair Business Practices Act preempted by ADA].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Based on these federal cases, we conclude that the ADA bars the fifth cause of action for relief under the California Unfair Business Practices Act. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) SkyWest, however, cites no authority that the ADA preempts actions to enforce state minimum wage laws or state laws governing meal/rest breaks. Although the ADA has been broadly interpreted as preempting state \u201cenforcement actions having a connection with, or reference to, airline \u2018rates, routes, or services,\u2019 \u201d it has its limits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Morales v.

If the rule was otherwise, \u201cany string of contingencies is sufficient to establish a connection with price, route or service, [and] there will be no end to ADA preemption.

Northwest Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at pages 358-359, our colleagues in Division Two described the rationale for RLA preemption: \u201c \u2018Congress\u2019 purpose in passing the RLA was to promote stability in labor-management relations by providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norris, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 252 [129 L.Ed.2d at p. 211, 114 S.Ct. at p. 2243].) Congress wanted to avoid having the states apply their own state law principles to interpret a federal labor law collective bargaining agreement, leading to inconsistent results. \u2018To realize this goal, the RLA establishes a mandatory arbitral mechanism for \u201cthe prompt and orderly settlement\u201d of two classes of disputes. [Citation.] The first class, those concerning \u201crates of pay, rules or working conditions,\u201d [citation], are deemed \u201cmajor\u201d disputes. Major disputes relate to \u201c \u2018the formation of collective [bargaining] agreements or efforts to secure them.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] The second class of disputes, known as \u201cminor\u201d disputes, \u201cgro[w] out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a. Minor disputes involve \u201ccontroversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement [CBA] in a particular fact situation.\u201d [Citation.] Thus, \u201cmajor disputes seek to create contractual rights, minor disputes to enforce them.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norris, supra, </em>512 U.S. at pp. 252-253 [129 L.Ed.2d at p. 211, 114 S.Ct. at pp. 2243-2244].)

A state or local law is \u201c \u2018 \u201crelated to\u201d \u2019 \u201d a price route or service if it has \u201c \u2018a connection with, or reference to\u2019 \u201d a price, route, or service. <em>(American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, supra, </em>513 U.S. at p. 223 [130 L.Ed.2d at pp. 722-723].) \u201cAirlines\u2019 \u2018rates\u2019 and \u2018routes\u2019 generally refer to the point-to-point transport of passengers. \u2018Rates\u2019 indicates price; \u2018routes\u2019 refers to courses of travel. It therefore follows that \u2018service,\u2019 when juxtaposed to \u2018rates\u2019 and \u2018routes,\u2019 refers to such things as the frequency and scheduling of transportation, and to the selection of markets to or from which transportation is provided (as in, \u2018This airline provides service from Tucson to New York twice a day.\u2019) To interpret \u2018service\u2019 more broadly is to ignore the context of its use; and, it effectively would result in the preemption of virtually everything an airline does. It seems clear to us that that is not what Congress intended.\u201d <em>(Charas v.
