The four tenants sought $413,306 in attorney fees under a contractual attorney fee provision in their respective leases. The landlord claims the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees related to matters beyond the contract cause of action for return of the tenants\u2019 security deposits. The landlord also claims the amount awarded so far exceeded the fees suggested for contested contract cases in the Superior Court of Los Angeles, Local Rules, rule 3.2 (Los Angeles Superior Court rule 3.2), it amounted to an abuse of discretion requiring reversal. The landlord further challenges the fee award as including attorney fees incurred on behalf of tenants who did not have a contractual right to attorney fees, even though the fees sought were for legal work performed on legal issues common to all tenants. We find no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">Thirty-two tenants sued their former landlord, appellant Shawn Ayromloo. The tenants prevailed on multiple causes of action stemming from appellant\u2019s wrongful refusal to allow the tenants to return to their apartments after the City of Los Angeles evacuated them because the building was unsafe. All of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>the tenants prevailed on their claims for forcible detainer, wrongful eviction, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court found appellant had not legally evicted the tenants. The court further found, because other low-income tenants had in the meantime moved into the building, the tenants could no longer move back into the units. For this reason, the court concluded monetary damages constituted the tenants\u2019 only remedy. The court calculated appellant\u2019s additional profit due to rerenting the units at higher rates to the new tenants at $240,000. Based on appellant\u2019s additional profits because of the wrongful evictions, the court awarded damages in the amount of $29,819 per unit. The court also awarded individual damages, as applicable to each tenant, for lost security deposits, emotional distress, and loss of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Four of the 32 tenants who prevailed against appellant on their breach of contract and other claims had written leases and are the respondents in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These written leases included a contractual provision which allowed for the recovery of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any civil action \u201cin connection with\u201d the lease. Respondents made a motion for attorney fees pursuant to their leases with appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The amount of fees sought was $413,306. Respondents had already excluded attorney fees for all work which applied exclusively to other families or units. For example, respondents excluded time spent on interrogatory responses for other families and time spent preparing for trial and for trial time regarding these other families\u2019 issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">Appellant conceded respondents were entitled to attorney fees under Civil Code section 1717 but only for fees incurred litigating the contract causes of action. Appellant challenged the reasonableness of the requested fees, noting the amount sought was 131 times the superior court\u2019s guidelines for fee awards in contract cases. Moreover, appellant argued respondents could not recover fees counsel incurred in representing the other tenants, who did not have written leases containing the attorney fee clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">The trial court awarded $123,992.80 in attorney fees to respondents. In evaluating the reasonableness of the fees, the trial court reduced the requested fees to half because the trial court thought \u201ccounsel knew this was a mildly pro bono type of work\u201d and because of the relatively small amount at stake. The court noted the legal work had been performed by the law firm of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>O\u2019Melveny &amp; Myers in conjunction with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. The court then reduced this amount by another 25 percent to account for noncontract issues, which resulted in a figure of $154,991 in fees. The court further reduced this figure by another 20 percent to account for legal fees incurred for work done specifically for the other tenants, netting an award of $123,992.80.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, the court noted \u201cissues relating to the Rent Stabilization Act and the general issues were the same as to all building tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Appellant appeals to challenge the trial court\u2019s award of $123,992.80 in attorney fees to respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">I. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW OF AN AWARD OF ATTORNEY FEES.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\"><em>A </em>trial court order awarding attorney fees is \u201creviewed using the abuse of discretion standard. [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIn reviewing an award of attorney fees, the amount awarded by the trial court will not be set aside absent an affirmative showing of abuse of discretion in that the award is \u2018manifestly excessive in the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An \u201corder of a lower court is presumed to be correct on appeal, and all intendments and presumptions are indulged in favor of its correctness. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">We review the attorney fee award at issue in this case with these standards in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>II. <em>THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN THE AMOUNT OF ATTORNEY FEES IT AWARDED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">\n<em>A. The Trial Court Did Not Err in Granting Fees Which Were Several Times Higher Than the Schedule of Suggested Fees for Contested Contract Cases in Superior Court Rule 3.2 and Higher Than the Total Damages Awarded to Respondents.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Appellant relies on Los Angeles Superior Court rule 3.2 in challenging the reasonableness of the awarded fees, noting the amount awarded was 39 times the superior court\u2019s guidelines for fee awards in contract cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Los Angeles Superior Court rule 3.2 provides its fee guidelines apply when a contract provides for reasonable attorney fees \u201cunless otherwise determined by the court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[Ljudges are free to depart from its provisions whenever the interests of justice require .... [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[t]o the extent a local rule conflicts with a state statute, the rule is invalid. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[T]he determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The trial court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding higher fees than allowed for in the guidelines for contested contract cases in Los Angeles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>Superior Court rule 3.2. As noted, the rule allows the trial court to exercise its discretion to depart from the rule to award a higher fee award. The \u201cunless otherwise determined by the court\u201d clause gives the trial court leeway to depart from the guidelines and to award a \u201creasonable\u201d fee award when warranted in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Here, the trial court permissibly departed from the guidelines and based its fee award on the \u201clodestar\u201d method of calculating attorney fees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Civil Code section 1717 authorizes the trial court to award reasonable attorney fees \u201c[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides\u201d for attorney fees, \u201cwhich are incurred to enforce that contract.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Also, Civil Code section 1717 mandates reasonable attorney fees to be \u201cfixed by the court.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Here, the trial court awarded fees consistent with Civil Code section 1717. Civil Code section 1717 permitted the trial court to award \u201creasonable\u201d attorney fees incurred \u201cin connection with\u201d the lease at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s contention the trial court abused its discretion because the fee award was higher than the overall damages awarded to respondents is without merit. It is not uncommon to award attorney fees in an amount higher than the total damages awarded to a plaintiff or plaintiffs in a particular case. Appellant cites no authority for the proposition an award of attorney fees must always be less than the award of damages in a given case, and we are aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">B. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Basing Its Attorney Fee Award on More Than Solely the Breach of Contract Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Appellant contends respondents are only entitled to attorney fees incurred in litigating the contract cause of action for return of their security deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">\u201cThe attorney\u2019s fees clause in a contract may be broad enough to cover tort as well as contract causes of action. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018If a contractual attorney fee provision is phrased broadly enough, ... it may support an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action alleging both contract and tort claims . . . .\u2019 <em>(Santisas </em>[v. <em>Goodin </em>(1998)] 17 Cal.4th [599,] 608 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399].)\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Here, the broad language of the attorney fee clause in the lease agreement covered all fee in any civil action stemming from the lease. The attorney fees clause in the lease provided, \u201cIf civil action is instituted <em>in connection with </em>this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover court costs and any reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The underlying civil action encompassed both breach of contract and tort causes of action arising from the tenants\u2019 leases with appellant. Therefore, the trial court did not have to base its award solely on breach of contract damages because the lease contemplated recovery of attorney fees for all claims in any civil action <em>in connection with </em>the lease. Apportionment of fees for the breach of contract and tort causes of action was thus unnecessary because the broad language of the attorney fee clause in the contract permitted recovery of attorney fees for breach of contract or any other claim asserted <em>in connection with </em>the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">C. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Not Apportioning the Fee Award Because Respondents Sought Fees for Legal Work Performed on Their Behalf, Even Though the Other Tenants Were Incidental Beneficiaries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Appellant contends respondents could not recover fees counsel incurred in representing the other tenants who did not have written leases containing the attorney fee clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">Allocation of fees incurred in representing multiple parties is not required when the liability of the parties is \u201cso factually interrelated that it would have been impossible to separate the activities . . . into compensable and noncompensable time units. . . . [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the present case, the trial court reasonably found the tenants\u2019 various claims were \u201c 1 \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d \u2019 [citation], making it \u2018impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the multitude of conjoined activities into compensable or noncompensable time units\u2019 [citation].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">In any event, respondents sought fees for legal work performed solely on their behalf and the fees were awarded only to them and not to the other tenants. Respondents and the other tenants all lived in the same building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>were evacuated from the building, and were not allowed to return to the building by appellant. All tenants asserted the same causes of action. The attorneys conducted legal research pertaining to the overarching legal issues common to all tenants, including the Rent Stabilization Ordinance of the City of Los Angeles<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the claims for forcible detainer, wrongful eviction, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The attorneys had to do the same legal research and analysis in preparing their case on behalf of respondents, irrespective of the number of potential tenants benefiting from the legal work performed. Respondents claimed they took careful measure not to seek attorney fees for any legal work done for the exclusive benefit of the tenants who did not have a right to recover attorney fees. Nevertheless, the court still reduced the fees sought to account for legal fees incurred for work done specifically for the tenants who did not have a contractual right to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">The other 28 tenants without contracts containing the attorney fee clause may have been third party beneficiaries of the legal services rendered to respondents who had attorney fees provisions in their respective leases. However, the fact other tenants incidentally benefited from the legal work performed on behalf of respondents does not diminish respondents\u2019 contractual right to recover attorney fees litigating issues common to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Finally, we find it important to emphasize something we are <em>not </em>deciding in this case. Respondents elected not to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling the fee award should be reduced in part because respondents\u2019 counsel had agreed to provide representation on a \u201cpro bono\u201d basis. This court\u2019s affirmance of the judgment should not be construed as signifying our approval of this particular element of that judgment. We do not find it self-evident a law firm\u2019s commendable willingness to provide its services on a pro bono basis to low-income clients should necessarily justify a diminishment in the fee award when that pro bono representation proves successful. Because respondents did not directly challenge the court\u2019s decision to reduce the fee award based on the pro bono nature of the litigation, we had no reason to invite the parties to brief the issue. Our research indicates courts reduce a fee award to adjust, for example, for duplicative work, for lack of success on certain issues, or the like.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, our research uncovered no case in which a trial court reduced a fee award simply because of the \u201cpro bono type of work\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>involved.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, in the analogous situation of contingent fee and legal aid lawyers\u2014where again the clients are not responsible for paying legal fees out of their own pockets\u2014the majority of courts have approved awards at a full level of \u201creasonable\u201d fees.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The order awarding attorney fees is affirmed.
