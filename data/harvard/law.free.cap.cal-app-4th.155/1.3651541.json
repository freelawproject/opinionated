(Evid. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(3).) (All further statutory references are to the Evidence Code except as otherwise noted.) We conclude that the statements were not made at or near the time of the injury and that the statements to the officer were not made under circumstances indicating their trustworthiness and thus none of the statements qualified for admission pursuant to section 1370. We reverse the judgment on this basis without reaching (1) the alternative issue of whether the admission of the declarant\u2019s statements to the police officer also violated defendant\u2019s confrontation rights as described in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford), </em>(2) the related issue of whether defendant is precluded from asserting his confrontation rights pursuant to the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Giles </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 833, 840-854 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 133, 152 P.3d 433]), and (3) defendant\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s imposition of an upper term sentence violated his constitutional rights to a jury trial under <em>Cunningham v. California </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856].</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In early 2002, defendant, Michael Pedro Quitiquit, and his wife of 15 years, Martina Villanueva, were separated, although Quitiquit periodically stayed with Villanueva in her mobilehome in Indio. (All further designated dates are in 2002 except as otherwise noted.) Villanueva\u2019s son, Anthony Jara (then age 31), and three of the couple\u2019s children, Martin (age 22), Lorraine Julie (age 17; referred to by the parties, and herein, as Julie), and Tina (age 16), lived with Villanueva at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Late in the evening of March 6, while Villanueva and Quitiquit were in her bedroom, they got into an argument. A week later, Villanueva went to the doctor, complaining of various symptoms, including numbness in her right cheek, ear pain, and weakness and numbness on the left side of her body, which she said she had been experiencing for one to two weeks; she was ultimately diagnosed with, and prescribed antibiotics for, an ear infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Villanueva experienced increasing numbness, as well as additional symptoms, over the next week and again consulted with her doctor. Villanueva told the attending nurse practitioner that she had \u201cno known injury to [her] neck,\u201d although an X-ray of her cervical (upper) spine taken the next day revealed that she had a degenerative condition in the back of her neck that could have been caused by \u201cprior injuries ... or arthritis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Because of increasing physical difficulties, Villanueva stopped working as a shoe department manager at the end of March and went back to see her doctor again in early April. During a visit on April 6, Villanueva indicated that she had been experiencing physical problems for three to four weeks. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of Villanueva\u2019s head and cervical spine showed that she had degenerative disk disease, a small disk herniation that could have been caused by an injury and swelling in her upper spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">On April 14, after an argument between Quitiquit and Julie relating to Villanueva\u2019s deteriorating condition, Julie and two of her sisters took Villanueva to the hospital. Villanueva was treated in the emergency room and then admitted to the hospital by internist Richard Kyaw. An MRI and X-ray of her spine showed \u201cextensive signal alteration\u201d of her cervical and thoracic spine, possibly as a result of traumatic injury, although she reported that she had no \u201cprior history of . . . trauma.\u201d She was prescribed high-dose steroids to reduce the inflammation of her spinal cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>On April 24, after having been at the hospital for approximately nine days, Villanueva reported for the first time that Quitiquit had twisted her neck. Hospital staff promptly notified the police of Villanueva\u2019s accusations and the next day, Indio Police Officer Jeremy Hellawell telephoned Villanueva to investigate her statements. During the call, Villanueva told him that during an argument on March 6, her husband approached her as she was lying on her bed, grabbed her head with both hands (one under her chin and the other behind her head) and pulled her off of the bed while twisting her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Based on the nature of Villanueva\u2019s statements, Indio Police Officer Hellawell went with a second officer to the hospital to interview Villanueva in person. Although Villanueva was sleepy and \u201ca little bit out of it,\u201d she reiterated what she had told Officer Hallowell on the phone and described the symptoms she had experienced since the incident. Villanueva made clear, however, that she was not interested in pressing charges against Quitiquit for the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The officers also interviewed Julie, who was at the hospital visiting Villanueva. She appeared to be very angry after hearing Villanueva\u2019s statements and told Officer Hellawell that although she had not seen anything on the night of the incident, she had heard her mom yell out her father\u2019s name during the argument. After completing the interview with Julie, Officer Hellawell issued an all-points report calling for Quitiquit\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Villanueva was discharged from the hospital on April 25 (the same day that Officer Hellawell interviewed her) despite the fact that there had been no improvement in her condition. The hospital doctors were unable to reach a consensus as to the cause of Villanueva\u2019s problems and no official specific diagnosis was made, although the general diagnosis was that she had symptoms from an acute cervical spine injury or condition, accompanied by an infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Villanueva\u2019s physical problems continued to worsen and by July 2, she had permanent partial paralysis of her arms and legs. Although Villanueva had some range of movement, she could not walk on her own; in addition, she had lost the ability to control her bladder and bowels and was suffering from neuropathic pain, all as a result of an incomplete spinal cord injury in her cervical (upper) spine. Villanueva underwent neck surgery in September to permit a biopsy of her spinal cord and had \u201csignificant recovery\u201d of her left arm strength and regained some mobility as a result of rehabilitation efforts, although her partial paralysis, loss of control of her bladder and bowels, and pain remained; she was also receiving treatment for depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The police arrested Quitiquit on a charge of inflicting violence on Villanueva. However, after being rehospitalized, Villanueva died in late December. Forensic pathologist, Mark Scott McCormick, performed an autopsy of her body; his review revealed that Villanueva had numerous complications as a result of quadriplegia, including chronic inflammation of her abdomen, pneumonia, a sacral decubitus ulcer (a breakdown of the skin at the tailbone), swelling of her brain and a blood infection, as well as an area of degeneration in her spinal cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The prosecution filed a new felony complaint against Quitiquit for murder as well as spousal abuse. Prior to trial on the charges, Quitiquit moved in limine to exclude evidence of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Dr. Kyaw and Officer Hellawell on the basis that the statements were hearsay and that their admission would violate his Sixth Amendment confrontation clause rights under <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36. The prosecutor countered that all the statements were admissible under the section 1370 exception to the hearsay rule and that the admission of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell would not violate Quitiquit\u2019s confrontation clause rights because those statements were made at a preinvestigation stage and were thus not testimonial in accordance with <em>Crawford. </em>After extensive argument, the trial court agreed that the statements were admissible and denied Quitiquit\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">At trial, the prosecution\u2019s theory was that Quitiquit caused Villanueva\u2019s death by violently twisting her neck during the March 6 argument. In support of this theory, the prosecutor introduced the evidence of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Dr. Kyaw and Officer Hellawell, as well as testimony by Anthony and Julie about the March 6 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Anthony testified that as he was falling asleep, he heard Quitiquit getting angry and his mother respond by saying something like \u201cGo ahead. Do it.\u201d He then heard Quitiquit \u201cgrunting\u201d and Villanueva \u201cgasp\u201d for air and say \u201cstop\u201d in a frightened tone of voice. Anthony called out to Villanueva to see if she was all right and Villanueva responded in a normal tone of voice that she was \u201cfine.\u201d Anthony heard his stepfather leave shortly thereafter. Although Anthony did not see his mother the next morning, when he returned to the house a few days later, he saw Villanueva rubbing her neck as if she was in pain. Villanueva explained away the pain by telling him that she had \u201cslept wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Julie testified that, although her father was not home when she went to bed on March 6, she later awoke when she heard her mother crying and yelling out his name. Despite her earlier statements to Officer Hellawell that she did not see anything that happened during the argument that night, Julie testified that she went to check on Villanueva and saw Quitiquit standing over her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>mother, who was lying on her bed. She testified that Quitiquit angrily told her to go back to bed and she complied and that she heard her father leave the home 10 to 15 minutes later. Julie testified that the next morning, she noticed Villanueva putting warm rags on her neck and walking with a limp.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The prosecution called Dr. McCormick to testify as to the results of the autopsy and his conclusion that Villanueva died from complications of quadriplegia (most particularly sepsis) resulting from direct trauma to her neck, vascular trauma in that area or both. Prosecution expert Dr. Lome Label testified as to his understanding that Villanueva\u2019s head was \u201cpulled, hyperextended back and twisted, and then [she was] thrown to the ground ... in a very violent manner\u201d and that Villanueva\u2019s reported symptoms and the autopsy results were consistent with such an injury. He opined that those forces, rather than other causes, resulted in injury to Villanueva\u2019s cervical spinal cord and that that injury caused her ultimate quadriplegia and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Quitiquit\u2019s defense had two components. First, the defense focused on discrediting Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell, as well as the testimony of Anthony and Julie. Second, the defense challenged the prosecution\u2019s evidence of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">In this regard, Quitiquit elicited evidence that Villanueva had been in two auto accidents, one in 1997 and another in April 1999, that caused her back pain and neck pain, respectively. Quitiquit also introduced evidence that Villanueva experienced physical problems, including problems with her neck, and sought medical treatment for blood in her urine, side pains while breathing, constipation and hemorrhoids, in 2001. Quitiquit\u2019s daughter Corma testified that Villanueva told her in late June or July of 2002 that the doctors believed a tumor was the cause of her problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. McCormick, the forensic pathologist admitted that the syrinx (a fluid-filled hole) he found on Villanueva\u2019s spine could have resulted from a whiplash injury (such as from a car accident) but not manifested any symptoms until a long time afterward. Defense counsel also cross-examined Dr. McCormick regarding the fact that Villanueva\u2019s body had mistakenly been embalmed before the autopsy was performed, thus limiting the nature of the review that could be conducted, and questioned him about some conditions with which Villanueva had previously been diagnosed, but that Dr. McCormick had not noted during his examination of her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Finally, the defense introduced expert testimony from neuroradiologist Brian Herman, who opined that the likelihood of a trauma causing Villanueva\u2019s quadriplegia was \u201cvery, very low\u201d and that her symptoms more likely resulted from a tumor or an infectious process. Dr. Herman testified that a twisting of Villanueva\u2019s neck in the manner described by Officer Hellawell would have resulted in damage to the bones, muscles and ligaments surrounding her spinal cord, which Villanueva did not exhibit, and would have resulted in immediate quadriplegia, rather than the progressive type that she experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The jury acquitted Quitiquit of second degree murder, but convicted him of voluntary manslaughter and inflicting great bodily injury on a spouse. The trial court imposed the upper term of 11 years on the voluntary manslaughter count and the upper term of four years, concurrent, on the spousal abuse count, but stayed the latter term pursuant to Penal Code section 654. Quitiquit filed a notice of appeal from the resulting judgment in the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division Two; after the filing of Quitiquit\u2019s opening brief, the matter was transferred to this court by order dated February 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">1. <em>Admission of Villanueva\u2019s Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Section 1370, subdivision (a), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">\u201cEvidence of a statement by a declarant is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if all of the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">\u201c(1) The statement purports to narrate, describe, or explain the infliction or threat of physical injury upon the declarant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">\u201c(2) The declarant is unavailable as a witness pursuant to Section 240.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">\u201c(3) The statement was made at or near the time of the infliction or threat of physical injury.

(\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(3), (4).) We review the trial court\u2019s determination that the foundational requirements for admissibility have been met under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 120, 126 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563].)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">A. <em>The \u201cAt or Near\u201d Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Although no reported California decision has addressed the scope of section 1370\u2019s \u201cat or near\u201d requirement, our role in interpreting the statutory language is clear; we must determine the legislative intent by focusing on the statutory terms, giving the words \u201ctheir usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>(Daun </em>v. <em>USAA Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 599, 605 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 44].) Where statutory language is unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary or appropriate. <em>(Wilcox </em>v. <em>Birtwhistle </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 977-978 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, 987 P.2d 727]; <em>Daun, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th at p. 605 [\u201c \u2018it is our role to ascertain the meaning of the words used, not to insert what has been omitted or otherwise rewrite the law to conform to an intention that has not been expressed\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The Attorney General contends that the scope of the \u201cat or near\u201d requirement of section 1370, subdivision (a)(3), is defined by reference to the second sentence of that provision, which specifies that \u201c[e]vidence of statements made more than five years before the filing of the current action or proceeding <em>shall be inadmissible </em>under this section.\u201d (Italics added.) He contends that the latter sentence evidences a legislative intent to take statements made within five years of the filing of the action outside of the hearsay rule. However, this argument is belied by the statutory language itself, which relates to the amount of time from the time the statements are made and the time an action arising out of the injuries is filed. (\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(3).) It has no bearing on the scope of the \u201cat or near\u201d requirement, which relates to the amount of time between the threat or infliction of the injury and the declarant\u2019s statements to the testifying witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The plain meaning of the phrase \u201cat or near\u201d denotes a time close to the infliction of the injury\u2014which in most circumstances will be within hours or days, rather than weeks or months. (See <em>Glatman </em>v. <em>Valverde </em>(2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 700, 704 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 319] [forensic report of a driver\u2019s blood-alcohol level, prepared a week after his blood was tested, was not made \u201cat or near\u201d the time of the blood test as required for the admissibility of a public record under \u00a7 1280].) By imposing this requirement in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>to requiring that there be other indicia of the statements\u2019 trustworthiness (\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(3), (4)), the Legislature evinced its intent to limit the section 1370 hearsay exception to those statements made close in time to the infliction of the injury, to provide some assurance that the statements would relate to facts fresh in the declarant\u2019s mind and reduce the risk that the statements resulted from the declarant\u2019s prevarication or coaching by third parties. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rons </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 514, 522-523 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 520]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Such an interpretation is supported by legislative history materials underlying section 1370. Earlier versions of the proposed legislation did not include the \u201cat or near\u201d requirement, but instead provided that the infliction or threat of harm could not be \u201cremote,\u201d under the circumstances, from when the statement was made. (Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 2068 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) June 24, 1996, \u00a7 1.) However, after the litigation section of the California State Bar objected that the proposed bill\u2019s failure to require a \u201ctemporal connection\u201d between the unavailable witness\u2019s statement and the event to which it related (i.e., the infliction of the threat or injury) might facilitate the fabrication of statements to support a particular litigant\u2019s position (for example, in divorce cases) (Barry Rosenbaum, State Bar Litigation Section, Legislative Com., mem. to Larry Doyle, Director, Office of Governmental Affairs re Assem. Bill No. 2068 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) May 28, 1996, p. 3), the bill was amended to include the \u201cat or near\u201d language, as proposed by the litigation section so that there would be \u201ca short time frame\u201d between the making of the statement and the event to which it related. (Sen. Amend. to Assem. Bill No. 2068 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) June 24, 1996, \u00a7 1; see also Sen. Com. on Criminal Procedure, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2068 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 17, 1996.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Although a trial court retains broad discretion to determine whether a particular statement was \u201cat or near\u201d the infliction of the injury for the purposes of section 1370, subdivision (a)(3), we conclude that absent special circumstances, a statement about a physical injury made almost two months after its infliction does not satisfy the statutory time limit. Here, Villanueva started seeing doctors within a week after her purported injury and had numerous opportunities, as well as a motivation, to give her medical providers accurate information about circumstances that may have caused her injuries. Villanueva specifically denied that she had suffered any trauma to her neck until almost two months after the incident, a time period during which she would have had an opportunity to contrive a story or be coached by her children, at least one of whom was quite angry at Quitiquit, to do so. Under these circumstances, we conclude that section 1370\u2019s requirement that the statement be made \u201cat or near\u201d the time of the event is not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>B. <em>The Trustworthiness Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">With respect to Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell, we also agree with Quitiquit\u2019s contention that the prosecution failed to provide a sufficient foundation to show the statements were made under circumstances showing they were trustworthy. (\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u201c[Circumstances relevant to the issue of trustworthiness include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201c(1) Whether the statement was made in contemplation of pending or anticipated litigation in which the declarant was interested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201c(2) Whether the declarant has a bias or motive for fabricating the statement, and the extent of any bias or motive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">\u201c(3) Whether the statement is corroborated by evidence other than statements that are admissible only pursuant to this section.\u201d (\u00a7 1370, subd. (b).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The Attorney General contends that Villanueva\u2019s initial refusal to prosecute Quitiquit establishes that her statements were not made in contemplation of litigation, but instead for the purpose of making a paper trail so that she could get a protective order against him, and that she did not have any bias or motive for fabricating the statements. However, there are several problems with this argument. First, there is no evidence in the record to establish that Villanueva\u2019s motivation for the disclosure was to obtain a protective order. Second, such a motivation would in any event establish that the statements <em>were </em>made in contemplation of litigation in which Villanueva would have been the applicant seeking relief. Finally, there is no basis for believing that her statements were accurate or that she had no motive to lie. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pantoja </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1, 13 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 492] [a person seeking a restraining order has an interest in the outcome and thus has a \u201cpotential bias . . . and a motive to stretch the truth\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">Further, Villanueva\u2019s specific statements to Officer Hellawell were not substantiated by other admissible evidence. Other than Villanueva\u2019s general statement to Dr. Kyaw that her husband had twisted her neck, there was no corroboration for the version of the events she described to Officer Hellawell, a violent, deliberate and intentional act in which Quitiquit grabbed her under her chin, twisted her neck and threw her from her bed onto the floor. Julie testified that she heard her parents arguing and then saw her father standing over her mother. Anthony testified that during the argument, he heard Quitiquit grunt and Villanueva gasp for air. Neither witness testified to hearing or seeing anything that would corroborate that Quitiquit violently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>threw Villanueva to the floor by grabbing and twisting her neck, despite the uncontroverted evidence that the mobilehome had thin doors through which sound easily traveled.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Additionally, Villanueva spent substantial time with her children while in the hospital, providing an opportunity for them to contrive a story to explain Villanueva\u2019s medical condition. This opportunity to reflect and deliberate on the events rendered the accuracy of Villanueva\u2019s belatedly disclosed description of events to be inherently suspect (see <em>People v. Kons, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 524 [noting the fact that the victim was \u201cvisiting with friends [at the hospital], who may or may not have been able to coach him about his statement\u201d was a factor in establishing the victim\u2019s statement to police officers was not trustworthy]), particularly in light of her earlier denials that she had suffered any trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">An equally significant factor relating to the trustworthiness of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell was the uncontroverted evidence that she was partially \u201cincoherent\u201d and was in a \u201csleep state\u201d at the time she made the statements. Although Officer Hellawell said he believed Villanueva understood what she was saying, there is substantial question whether a person who is making statements in a \u201csleep state\u201d is able to accurately recall events from seven weeks earlier or is accurately able to communicate her recollection of those events. Given her medicated condition and the fact that she had suffered substantial pain for the previous six weeks, there is a risk that Villanueva\u2019s recollection of the events was influenced by the serious symptoms she was suffering at the time she made the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The evidence at trial thus did not establish that Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell were trustworthy so as to permit admission of the statements under section 1370. Absent the opportunity for cross-examination to test the veracity of Villanueva\u2019s statements, the jury was presented with a graphic description of Quitiquit\u2019s conduct that he could not fairly challenge at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">C. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The prosecution failed to show that Villanueva\u2019s statements to Dr. Kyaw and Officer Hellawell were made \u201cat or near\u201d the infliction of the injury to which the statements related or that the statements to Officer Hellawell were made under circumstances showing the statements were trustworthy. Thus, the court erred in admitting the statements under section 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">2. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">The admission of hearsay statements erroneously admitted under section 1370 constitutes reversible error \u201cif it is \u2018reasonably probable that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Pantoja, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at p. 13, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) In his opening brief, Quitiquit argued that the admission of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell and to Dr. Kyaw were prejudicial, a claim that the Attorney General has made no attempt to dispute despite having been granted an opportunity to file a supplemental response relating to that issue. On our review of the entire record, we agree the error was prejudicial under the <em>Watson </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The centerpiece of the prosecution\u2019s theory in the case was that Quitiquit was guilty of murder and/or manslaughter because of the violent manner in which he committed the crime, a theory that was almost entirely dependent on the admission of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell concerning Quitiquit\u2019s conduct on March 6. At the outset of her closing argument, the prosecutor stated that Quitiquit had \u201csealed [Villanueva\u2019s] fate by pulling her off the bed, twisting her neck in a jerking motion, and [throwing] her down to the floor.\u201d The prosecutor quoted or paraphrased Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell at least eight more times during the remainder of her argument, emphasizing that those statements established Quitiquit\u2019s malice (a necessary element of the murder charge) or conscious disregard of the danger to Villanueva\u2019s life (an element of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Further, the record establishes that the evidence of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell were important to the jury\u2019s decisionmaking. Shortly after deliberations began, the jury asked to see Officer Hellawell\u2019s written report of his interview with Villanueva. After the court denied the request because the report was \u201cnot in evidence,\u201d the jury asked to have Officer Hellawell\u2019s testimony reread, strongly suggesting that the inadmissible evidence was a factor in their decision to convict Quitiquit. (See <em>Scott v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 125, 152 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 643] [jury\u2019s requested rereading of erroneous jury instruction is a relevant factor in assessing prejudice].)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Because the error in admitting Villanueva\u2019s hearsay statements to Officer Hellawell and Dr. Kyaw went to the heart of the prosecutor\u2019s case against Quitiquit, it was prejudicial as to both counts of which he was convicted. Accordingly, we must reverse the judgment of conviction on the basis of that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">O\u2019Rourke, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b38-6\">HALLER, Acting P. J,, Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">The majority concludes Villanueva\u2019s statements to Dr. Kyaw and Officer Hellawell were inadmissible hearsay. For the reasons explained below, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis on this issue. However, I concur in the result because the admission of Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell constituted prejudicial error on another ground. As the Attorney General admits, Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell were testimonial. (See <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 813, 821-824 [165 L.Ed.2d 224, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 2273-2274]; <em>People v. Cage </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 965, 975-984 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 789, 155 P.3d 205].) Thus, the admission of the statements violated Quitiquit\u2019s constitutional confrontation clause rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36, 42-69 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354].) The error was prejudicial because Villanueva\u2019s statements to Officer Hellawell were the linchpin of the prosecutor\u2019s theory against Quitiquit.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">My disagreement with the majority\u2019s hearsay analysis rests on my view that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding Villanueva\u2019s statements satisfied the \u201cat or near\u201d requirement of Evidence Code section 1370, subdivision (a)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this subdivision, the court must find \u201c[t]he statement was made at or near the time of the infliction or threat of physical injury.\u201d (\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(3).) The dictionary defines the word \u201cnear\u201d to mean \u201cclose\u201d or \u201cnot far distant in time, place, or degree.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 11th Collegiate Dict. (2006) p. 828.) This definition reflects what would be the common understanding of the word \u201cnear.\u201d But it is unhelpful because the determination of what is \u201cnear,\u201d \u201cclose,\u201d or \u201cnot far distant\u201d is necessarily relative. (See <em>Sublett v. City of Tulsa </em>(1965) 1965 OK 78 [405 P.2d 185, 202] [the word \u201cnear\u201d is \u201ca term of relative signification without positive or precise meaning and locates nothing with any degree of precision\u201d],) Whether an event is \u201cnear\u201d to another event necessarily depends on the perspective of the observer and the reason or purpose for measuring the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>This concept of \u201cnear\u201d as a flexible measurement of time is reflected in the California Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the similarly worded \u201cat or near\u201d requirement in the public records exception to the hearsay rule. (\u00a7 1280, subd. (b);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> see <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 126-128 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563].) In Martinez, the trial court relied on this exception to admit a computer generated printout of the defendant\u2019s criminal history (known as a CLETS document) for purposes of proving the criminal history, despite that there may have been a 30- to 90-day delay in recording the relevant information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>at pp. 126-127; <em>id. </em>at pp. 140-141 (dis. opn. of Werdegar, J.).) The California Supreme Court held the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in determining this evidence satisfied the statutory \u201cat or near\u201d element. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 126.) In so concluding, the <em>Martinez </em>court emphasized that the \u201cat or near\u201d statutory phrase \u201c \u2018is not to be judged ... by arbitrary or artificial time limits, measured by hours or days or even weeks.\u2019 [Citation.] Rather, \u2018account must be taken of practical considerations,\u2019 including \u2018the nature of the information recorded\u2019 and \u2018the immutable reliability of the sources from which [the information was] drawn.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Whether an entry made subsequent to the transaction has been made within a sufficient time to render it within the [hearsay] exception depends upon whether the time span between the transaction and the entry was so great as to suggest a danger of inaccuracy by lapse of memory.\u2019 (2 McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992) \u00a7 289, p. 273, fn. omitted.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 128; see also <em>Glatman </em>v. <em>Valverde </em>(2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 700, 703-706 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 319] [applying a \u201c \u2018lapse of memory\u2019 \u201d test to section 1280\u2019s \u201cat or near\u201d requirement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">After reviewing section 1370\u2019s statutory language and framework and its legislative history, I am satisfied the Legislature intended to provide the same broad discretion to a trial court in determining whether a statement was made at or near the time of the infliction of the injury, and that a lapse-of-memory test is the appropriate guide to applying the statutory requirement. In enacting section 1370, the Legislature sought to broaden the circumstances under which hearsay may be admitted at a criminal trial to ensure a jury will hear the truth about past physical abuse when the victim is no longer available to testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Concurrence in Sen. Amends., Assem. Bill No. 2068 (1995-1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 8, 1996, p. 2.) Although the Legislature imposed limits on the admissibility of this evidence to protect criminal defendants against false accusations, the Legislature sought to provide the trial court with substantial discretion to admit hearsay statements if the court is assured the statements are trustworthy and reliable. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Given this legislative intent and the use of the relative term \u201cnear,\u201d the Legislature did not impose strict artificial time limits on the admissibility of a hearsay statement under section 1370, subdivision (a)(3). Rather, the Legislature intended to provide a trial court discretion to admit a statement if it was made when the incident was fresh in the victim\u2019s mind and not so long after the incident to put into question the statement\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability. This approach is consistent with the view of a leading commentator on California evidence law. (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 1998) \u00a7 18.57, p. 280 [stating that under \u00a7 1370 a statement \u201cmade within 3 months of the injury . . . should qualify as being made near the time of injury\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Under these principles, there was a substantial evidentiary basis for the trial court to find Villanueva\u2019s statements were made sufficiently \u201cnear\u201d the time of the event to satisfy the statutory requirement. First, the facts supported that the event was still fresh in Villanueva\u2019s mind. Although the claimed injury occurred seven weeks earlier, the statement was about a violent traumatic event (rather than a collateral detail) that was not likely to be forgotten by the injured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">These circumstances distinguish this case from <em>Glatman v. Valverde, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th 700, upon which the majority relies. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 9-10.) In <em>Glatman, </em>forensic analysts recorded the suspect\u2019s blood-alcohol level one week <em>after the </em>blood sample was drawn and analyzed. In concluding the recording was not \u201cat or near\u201d the event, the <em>Glatman </em>court applied <em>Martinez\u2019s </em>lapse-of-memory test and determined there was no reasonable basis to conclude that the laboratory employees could accurately memorize and then recall the specific numerical test result one week later. <em>(Glatman, supra, </em>at pp. 704\u2014705.) This case is materially different. Villanueva was relating a violent injury that was inflicted on her and for which she remained hospitalized. The trial court had ample basis to conclude that\u2014unlike a laboratory worker who could not reasonably \u201cretain all the test results in his or her <em>head\u201d\u2014there was </em>no danger <em>that </em>Villanueva could not accurately recall this specific incident of violent conduct by her husband. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Further, it has long been recognized that a patient\u2019s statement to his or her doctor about the patient\u2019s injuries is inherently likely to be true. Although Villanueva\u2019s prior denials are relevant in determining the reliability of her later statements, the trial court had a reasonable basis to conclude that under the circumstances the prior denials did not preclude a finding that the statements were timely made. The prosecution presented evidence that Quitiquit did not want Villanueva to disclose his abusive acts, and presented evidence from which it could be inferred that Villanueva was afraid of her husband. The trial court had a reasonable basis to find this fear adequately explained why Villanueva initially refused to disclose the assault to medical personnel or the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Additionally, the fact that Villanueva waited to disclose Quitiquit\u2019s conduct until the day before her hospital discharge is consistent with the surrounding circumstances. If Villanueva believed her physical condition would improve while in the hospital, she could have believed there was no reason to disclose the neck trauma. However, on the day before the hospital intended to discharge her, she had not improved and had continuing debilitating symptoms. At that point, it was reasonable for her to finally understand that it was necessary to tell the truth to her doctor to obtain proper medical treatment and to document the issue with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">With respect to the majority\u2019s concern that Villanueva had time to deliberate on her statements, the Legislature did not require that a statement under section 1370 be made \u201cspontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement\u201d of the event. (\u00a7 1240.) Thus, unlike statements admitted under the spontaneous statement hearsay exception of section 1240, the Legislature necessarily intended that the section 1370 exception would apply even if the declarant had some time to reflect on his or her statement. Although the extent of the opportunity for deliberation and reflection is an important factor in the trustworthiness analysis (\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(4)), it does not in and of itself render the hearsay exception inapplicable under the statutory timeliness requirement (\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">As with other hearsay exceptions, \u201c[a] trial court has broad discretion in determining whether a party has established [the statutory] foundational requirements. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 120.) The determination of what is \u201c \u2018 \u201cat or near\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018is a matter of degree and calls for the exercise of reasonable judgment <em>on the part of the trial judge' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 128, fn. 7, citing 1 Jefferson, Cal.
