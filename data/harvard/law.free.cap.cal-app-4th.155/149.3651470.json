J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">Appellant Matthew Murray was sentenced to six years in prison following the revocation of his probation. He now contends that, pursuant to Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 1203.2a, the Fresno County Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to impose the previously suspended prison term. Respondent concedes the want of jurisdiction, albeit under a somewhat different analysis. As we shall explain, we conclude the superior court lacked jurisdiction to order execution of sentence following appellant\u2019s violation of the terms of his probation. We publish to clarify that, regardless of whether the superior court lacks any <em>further </em>jurisdiction in the case (a claim the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>have not addressed and which, accordingly, we do not reach), the error has the effect of reinstating the original sentence (grant of probation with execution of sentence suspended), because the execution of sentence is void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On December 31, 2003, an information was filed in Fresno County Superior Court, charging appellant with possession of methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a); count 1) and driving with a suspended or revoked license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601.1, subd. (a); count 2, a misdemeanor). It was further alleged appellant had suffered a prior conviction under the three strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and had served four prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">On March 15, 2004, at the start of trial, appellant pled guilty to count 2 and admitted the special allegations. On March 23, following the declaration of a mistrial after the jury deadlocked on count 1, appellant pled no contest to count 1 on the understanding that the trial court would dismiss the strike allegation and place him on probation. On November 29, 2004, following a delay occasioned by appellant\u2019s parole status,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court sentenced appellant to prison for three years on count 1 plus an additional year for each prior prison term, for a total term of seven years, but stayed execution of sentence and placed appellant on five years\u2019 probation on various terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">On December 6, 2004, appellant entered a drug treatment program. He was terminated from the program on December 12. On February 17, 2005, he failed to appear for a scheduled appointment with his probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">On April 22, 2005, appellant was convicted in Los Angeles County Superior Court of possessing methamphetamine, and was sentenced to 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>months in prison. On April 26, the supervising deputy probation officer confirmed that appellant was incarcerated in the Los Angeles County jail, pending a parole violation. On June 21, 2005, appellant was committed to prison. He was released on November 18, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In a special report dated January 26, 2006, the probation officer advised the Fresno County Superior Court of appellant\u2019s failure to complete the court-ordered drug treatment program and new prison commitment. The probation officer recommended revocation of probation and issuance of a no-bail bench warrant. The report was filed with the court, and the court followed the recommendation, on February 6. Appellant was arrested on the bench warrant on April 25, and arraigned the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">A contested violation-of-probation hearing was held on September 26, 2006. Citing section 1203.2a, appellant, who was representing himself, questioned the court\u2019s jurisdiction. He noted that his incarceration had been confirmed by the supervising deputy probation officer on April 26, 2005, and represented that he had sent a letter to his probation officer, informing him that he was in custody and asking to be sentenced in absentia or brought back to Fresno. After the prosecutor presented evidence of appellant\u2019s failure to obey all laws, as required as a condition of his probation, appellant again objected on section 1203.2a grounds. The court found him to be in violation of the terms of his probation by virtue of his April 2005 Los Angeles County conviction, and continued the matter for further consideration of the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">At the continued hearing on October 23, the probation officer asserted that the probation department had never received a document complying with the requirements of section 1203.2a. Appellant reiterated that the supervising deputy probation officer had confirmed his incarceration, and that appellant had sent a notice to the district attorney. Although the prosecutor represented he had not received any letter written by appellant, he stated that the probation department had provided him with a letter from the Department of Corrections.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letter advised that appellant had been committed to the California Department of Corrections on June 21, 2005; showed the arrest date, offense, length of sentence; gave the case number for which appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>was on probation in Fresno County; and stated, \u201c[W]e are advising you of this inmate\u2019s incarceration pursuant to 1203.2a . . . .\u201d The letter was written under the name of a correctional case manager and was signed by a correctional case records analyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The court clarified that the letter was written on September 14 and received by the probation department, and that it was that department\u2019s position the letter did not comply with section 1203.2a\u2019s requirements. The prosecutor took the same position, arguing that the letter did not contain appellant\u2019s signature or a statement that he was waiving his right to a formal revocation hearing and counsel. The prosecutor distinguished <em>In re Hoddinott </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 992 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 911 P.2d 1381] <em>(Hoddinott), </em>which was cited by appellant along with <em>People v. Holt </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 962 [277 Cal.Rptr. 323] <em>(Holt), </em>on the ground that Hoddinott\u2019s attorney requested imposition of sentence. When the court asked why the Department of Corrections sent notice referencing section 1203.2a, the probation officer explained it was done so the probation department could choose to violate an offender and send a bench warrant, which would preclude that person\u2019s release on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Following further discussion, the court found that appellant failed to comply with the requirements of section 1203.2a, and that the Department of Corrections letter was simply a notice received on every probationer, advising the probation department that the person was in prison. The court then denied reinstatement of probation, lifted the stay of what it determined was a six-year, not seven-year, term, and remanded appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. Although he may not have needed it, he also obtained a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">As has been recognized, section 1203.2a, which is set out in full in the margin, is not a model of clarity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See <em>Holt, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>p. 965.) The statutory requirements differ, to some extent, depending on the procedural posture of the case, i.e., whether imposition of sentence was suspended (sentence has not previously been imposed) or, as here, sentence was imposed but execution thereof was suspended (sentence has previously been imposed). As the California Supreme Court has summarized, \u201csection 1203.2a provides for 3 distinct jurisdictional clocks: (1) the probation officer has 30 days from the receipt of written notice of defendant\u2019s subsequent commitment within which to notify the probation-granting court (2d par.);[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] (2) the court has 30 days from the receipt of a valid, formal request from defendant within which to impose sentence, if sentence has not previously been imposed (3d par., 4th sentence); and (3) the court has 60 days from the receipt of notice of the confinement to order execution of sentence (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>make other final order) if sentence has previously been imposed (3d par., 3d sentence). Failure to comply <em>with any one of these </em>three time limits divests the court of any remaining jurisdiction. (5th par.)\u201d <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 999, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Insofar as is pertinent to appellant\u2019s case, section 1203.2a required the probation officer to report appellant\u2019s Los Angeles County prison commitment to the Fresno County Superior Court within 30 days after being notified by a prison representative. (\u00a7 1203.2a, 2d par.) Although the letter from the Department of Corrections was not made part of the record, it appears to have been written and sent on or about September 14, 2005. At the very least, it was sent during appellant\u2019s commitment to state prison, which lasted from June 21 to November 18, 2005. There is no suggestion the probation officer did not receive it shortly after it was sent. Accordingly, the 30-day \u201cjurisdictional clock\u201d started to run no later than on or about November 18, 2005, and expired no later than on or about December 18 of that year. The petition to revoke probation is dated January 26, 2006, and was filed with the court on February 6. January 26, 2006, is well beyond the 30-day period of notification permitted by the second paragraph of section 1203.2a. As respondent concedes, the record demonstrates no reason to toll that period, even assuming such a tolling would be possible upon a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">A probation officer\u2019s failure to report a defendant\u2019s new commitment to the court within 30 days of notification by a prison representative deprives the court \u201cof all jurisdiction it may have retained in the granting of probation in [the] case.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.2a, 5th par.; see <em>Holt, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 967; <em>Pompi </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 139 Cal.App.3d 503, 507 [189 Cal.Rptr. 52].) Because loss of jurisdiction is such a severe sanction, however, courts have been unwilling to impose it \u201cunless the sentencing court\u2019s jurisdiction has been ousted by strict compliance with the statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Como </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 604, 609 [123 Cal.Rptr. 86].)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In the present case, the court, prosecutor, and probation officer erroneously focused on the fact the letter from the Department of Corrections did not contain appellant\u2019s signature or statement that he was waiving his rights to a formal revocation hearing and counsel. \u201c[T]he requirement for a properly attested request, and any necessary waiver, applicable to unsentenced defendants under the first paragraph of section 1203.2a did not apply to [appellant] upon whom sentence had been <em>previously imposed </em>with execution stayed in conjunction with the grant of probation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pompi v. Superior Court, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at pp. 507-508.) As portrayed by the prosecutor, the letter here contained all of the pertinent information and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>signed by a correctional case records analyst.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, there has been strict compliance with the statutory requirements. (Cf. <em>People v. Hall </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 972, 983-984 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 826] [notice merely stating defendant pled guilty to new violation, or that defendant had been transferred to prison, insufficient; notice must inform court that defendant committed to prison for another offense]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Como, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d at p. 609 [notice reporting sentence, but not commitment or confinement, insufficient].) Accordingly, the probation officer\u2019s failure to report the Los Angeles County commitment to the court, in accordance with the requirements of the second paragraph of section 1203.2a, divested the Fresno County Superior Court of jurisdiction. (See <em>Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1005.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The purpose of section 1203.2a is \u201cto provide a mechanism by which the probationary court [can] consider imposing a concurrent sentence, and to \u2018preclude[] inadvertent imposition of consecutive sentences by depriving the court of further jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019 when the statutory time limits are not observed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 999.) The lack of timely notice here deprived appellant of any chance of obtaining concurrent sentences, as he was released from the prison commitment resulting from his Los Angeles County conviction before sentence was ordered executed in his Fresno County matter. No showing of specific prejudice to appellant is necessary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1106 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 214].) As our state\u2019s high court has observed, \u201cThis case thus illustrates the prejudice that can occur when the probation officer does not timely report a confinement. That such prejudice does not occur in every case, or that the statute might be more carefiilly written so that its jurisdictional requirements would apply only where prejudice would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>otherwise occur, does not affect our conclusion. It is enough that the statute\u2019s plain language clearly imposes a jurisdictional reporting requirement on the probation officer . . . .\u201d (Hoddinott, at p. 1005; see <em>Smith v. Hooey </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 374, 378 [21 L.Ed.2d 607, 89 S.Ct. 575]; <em>Barker v. Municipal Court </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 806, 813 [51 Cal.Rptr. 921, 415 P.2d 809].) If indeed the Fresno County Probation Department has been treating the prison commitment notices as having little or no consequence, as suggested by the record on appeal, we strongly recommend it reexamine its practice in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We turn now to the appropriate remedy. Although the California Supreme Court has held that a probation officer\u2019s failure timely to notify the probationary court of the defendant\u2019s new commitment results in that court\u2019s loss of jurisdiction \u201cto impose sentence on the original offense\u201d <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 998), it has done so in the context of a case in which imposition of sentence originally was suspended <em>(id. </em>at p. 995). Here, by contrast, sentence originally was imposed, with only execution thereof suspended. When it imposed sentence but suspended execution and placed appellant on probation, the superior court possessed the requisite jurisdiction. It follows that its subsequent divestiture of jurisdiction, pursuant to section 1203.2a, rendered its order directing execution of the previously suspended six-year prison term void, but did not affect the original sentence. That sentence is, in effect, reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Because the execution of the previously imposed but suspended sentence is void, the six-year term appellant is presently serving as a result of the revocation of his probation must be vacated. (See <em>Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 994; <em>People v. Walsh, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1106; <em>Holt, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 964, 968; <em>People v. Carr </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 441, 446 [117 Cal.Rptr. 714].) Since the parties have not addressed the issue, we decline to determine, at this juncture, what, if any, jurisdiction the superior court retains over appellant with respect to the original terms of the reinstated sentence. <em>(See In re Walters </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1560 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 279], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1005; <em>Pompi v. Superior Court, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 508.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Based on the superior court\u2019s loss of jurisdiction in the matter, the order of October 23, 2006, lifting the previously imposed stay of execution on, and executing, appellant\u2019s sentence of November 29, 2004, is reversed. The six-year prison term appellant is currently serving as a result of the order of October 23, 2006, is vacated, and the original sentence (suspended execution of sentence and grant of probation) is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Vartabedian, J., and Gomes, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 4, 2007, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 12, 2007, S157488.

It appears from the record, however, that appellant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown for most, if not all, of that period, despite the fact he was on both probation and parole, and appellant does not claim otherwise. Appellant was arraigned on the probation violation in a timely manner following his arrest, and delays after that were accompanied by time waivers. Were we to consider only the period of time following February 6, 2006, we would be loathe to divest the superior court of jurisdiction, as the delay was attributable to appellant. (See <em>People v. Perez </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 302, 308 [279 Cal.Rptr. 915].)
