J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFP\">A jury convicted defendant Vincent Montero of possession of methamphetamine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378). The trial court also determined that defendant had previously been convicted of a serious felony (first degree burglary) and had served two prison terms. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, 667.5, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court sentenced defendant to a state prison term totaling six years: the doubled two-year middle term plus one year for each of the two prior prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Defendant appeals, alleging the following grounds for reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">(1) The use of Judicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instructions (2006-2007) CALCRIM No. 2302, regarding possession for sale, omitted essential elements of that crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">(2) The court erred in failing to give additional instructions in response to the jury\u2019s request for clarification on the elements of possession for sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>(3) The court erred in refusing defendant\u2019s proposed pinpoint instructions on constructive possession;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-5\">(4) The cumulative effect of instructional errors denied defendant a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-6\">(5) Insufficient evidence supported defendant\u2019s conviction of possessing methamphetamine for sale; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-7\">(6) Insufficient evidence supported the determination that defendant\u2019s prior burglary conviction qualified as a serious felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">We disagree with each of defendant\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Sacramento County sheriff\u2019s deputies conducted a parole search of a residence and a detached garage on the property. The residence did not belong to defendant. The door to the garage was slightly opened, and officers could see a large male behind the door. They opened the door and saw two other males in the garage, one of whom was defendant standing toward the rear of the building. The officers directed the men to come out of the garage and get on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Detective Stephen Buccellato took control of defendant. Buccellato determined defendant was on parole, and he performed a parole search on him. The detective found a small Ziploc bag, about one-inch square, containing .99 grams of crystal methamphetamine in defendant\u2019s pocket. He found other identically sized empty Ziploc bags on defendant. Buccellato also found $483 in cash on defendant, consisting of one $100 bill, fifteen $20 bills, three $10 bills, eight $5 bills and thirteen $1 bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">Inside defendant\u2019s wallet, Buccellato found a \u201cpay/owe sheet,\u201d one and one-half inches square, with the writing, \u201cAugust 22nd of 005 $40 Jr,\u201d \u201cAugust 23rd,\u201d followed by illegible writing, and a dollar sign with no other notation. He found 11 similarly sized blank sheets of paper on defendant. He also found an ATM card and a bank slip bearing defendant\u2019s name and showing a $2,800 disbursement. Buccellato read defendant his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>Inside the garage, deputies found drugs and drug paraphernalia. Searching in the rear of the garage where defendant was first seen, deputies located a cigarette pack containing three baggies of methamphetamine weighing 1.16, 1.28 and .13 grams, packaged in the same type of small Ziploc bags found on defendant. The cigarette pack and its contents were found near a cellular telephone defendant said was his. In the same area as the cigarette pack and the phone, deputies found a baggie containing two small Ziploc bags of methamphetamine, weighing .14 grams each, and a piece of yellow lined paper with the notation \u201c$20\u201d followed by some writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Also near the cigarette pack, deputies found another small Ziploc bag containing a price tag and residue of apparent methamphetamine. They also found a larger green package of methamphetamine weighing 3.14 grams, a methamphetamine smoking pipe, an electronic scale, and a second, nondigital scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">In other locations in the garage, deputies found a small bag of methamphetamine weighing .11 grams, and two packages of methamphetamine weighing 3.10 grams and 2.92 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Detective Sean Berry again informed defendant of his rights. Defendant told Berry that the drugs in his pockets belonged to him but the drugs in the garage did not. He said he used drugs but he did not sell them. Defendant said he had used methamphetamine that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The prosecution\u2019s expert witness testified that in his opinion, based on the totality of the evidence, the methamphetamine found in defendant\u2019s pocket was possessed for the purpose of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">We will provide additional facts as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">\n<em>CALCRIM No. 2302</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Defendant claims CALCRIM No. 2302 erroneously omits the elements of \u201cdominion and control\u201d and the \u201cknowing exercise of control\u201d from its definition of possessing methamphetamine for sale. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>Witkin summarizes the common elements of all drug possession offenses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-5\">\u201c(a) A specified controlled substance, in a sufficient quantity . . . and in a usable form ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-6\">\u201c(b) Possession, which may be physical or constructive, exclusive or joint....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">\u201c(c) Knowledge of the fact of possession and of the illegal character of the substance . . . .\u201d (2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Crimes Against Public Peace and Welfare, \u00a7 82, p. 592, citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The crime of possession for sale contains the additional element of proof of a specific intent to sell the substance .... (2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, <em>supra, </em>Crimes Against Public Peace and Welfare, \u00a7 82, p. 592.) (See <em>In re Christopher B. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 455, 466 [268 Cal.Rptr. 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">CALCRIM No. 2302 adequately captures and conveys each of these elements to the jury. As given by the trial court, the instruction reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-10\">\u201cThe defendant is charged with possession for sale of methamphetamine, a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-11\">\u201cTo prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-12\">\u201c1. The defendant possessed a controlled substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-13\">\u201c2. The defendant knew of its presence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-14\">\u201c3. The defendant knew of the substance\u2019s nature as a controlled substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-15\">\u201c4. When the defendant possessed the controlled substance, he intended to sell it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>\u201c5. The controlled substance was methamphetamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-4\">\u201cAND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-5\">\u201c6. The controlled substance was in a usable amount. [\u00b6]... [\u00b6]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-6\">\u201cA person does not have to actually hold or touch something, to possess it. It is enough if the person has control over it or the right to control it, either personally or through another person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Defendant faults the instruction for not requiring the jury to find that the defendant knowingly exercised control and for not using the phrase \u201cdominion and control\u201d as part of the possession element. Both points are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">The instruction correctly expresses the knowledge requirement. Two kinds of knowledge are required: \u201cknowledge of the fact of possession,\u201d and \u201cknowledge of the character of the thing possessed.\u201d (2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, supra, Crimes Against Public Peace and Welfare, \u00a7 90, p. 602.) Repeating these elements, the instruction requires the jury to find that the defendant knew of the substance\u2019s presence, and that he also knew the substance was a controlled substance. No knowledge of additional possession or control was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">The instruction also correctly restates the possession requirement. Many courts have long stated this requirement as a showing that a defendant exercised dominion and control over the controlled substance. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Palaschak </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1236, 1242 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 722, 893 P.2d 717] [\u201cessential elements of possession of a controlled substance are \u2018dominion and control of the substance in a quantity usable for consumption or sale, with knowledge of its presence and of its restricted dangerous drug character.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People v. Parra </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 222, 225-226 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 541] [\u201cprosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant exercised dominion and control over the controlled substance . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">This phrase is merely a different way of saying the defendant possessed the substance physically or constructively. Our Supreme Court has approved this summary of the elements of simple possession, a formula that does not contain the phrase \u201cdominion and control\u201d: \u201c \u2018The defendant exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>control over the narcotics, he or she knew of its nature and presence, and possessed a usable amount. (CALJIC No. 12.00.)\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Martin </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1180, 1191 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 599, 25 P.3d 1081], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Spry </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1345, 1369 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 691].) CALJIC No. 12.00, the predecessor to CALCRIM No. 2302, also does not contain the phrase \u201cdominion and control,\u201d but the Supreme Court nonetheless declared the instruction \u201caccurately restated the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 34, 47-48 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 18 P.3d 11].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The phrase itself is redundant and archaic. The word \u201cdominion\u201d is defined as \u201cControl; possession\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (8th ed. 2004) p. 525); or \u201crule; control; domination.\u201d (Random House Dict, of the English Language (2d ed. 1987) p. 582.) To \u201cdominate\u201d is \u201cto rule over; govern; control.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The authors of CALCRIM No. 2302 were instructed to develop instructions that were legally accurate, understandable to the average juror, and written in plain English. (Preface to Judicial Council of Cal. Crim. Jury Instns. (2006-2007) p. ix.) They wisely decided not to perpetuate the redundancy. They did so by omitting the phrase in the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">CALCRIM No. 2302 captures all of the elements of the crime of possession for sale. It correctly states the elements of possession and knowledge in a manner reasonable jurors are able to understand. The trial court committed no error in giving the instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">\n<em>Refusal to Give Clarifying Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Defendant claims the court erred by not providing a response to a jury question as to the meaning and application of the element of control other than to direct the jury to reread CALCRIM No. 2302. We conclude the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">A. <em>Additional background information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">During deliberations, the jury forwarded the following request to the trial court: \u201cClarification on possession: [\u00b6] We have read the last two paragraphs of [CALCRIM No. 2302] and still need clarification:</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">\u201cHow do we evaluate the idea of \u2018control\u2019? Is it enough that [defendant] was in the same room as excessive amounts of drugs, scales ect <em>[sic] </em>that are in plain precence [\u00edz'c] or tucked-away; is it enough to say that he was indeed in \u2018control\u2019 and in possession of these items?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">The court responded: \u201cIn response to your question, \u2018How do we evaluate the idea of \u201ccontrol?\u201d \u2019: It is for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">\u201cIn response to your question, \u2018Is it enough that [defendant] was in the same room as excessive amounts of drugs, scales ect <em>[sic] </em>that are in plain precence [sz'c] or tucked-away; is it enough to say that he was indeed in \u201ccontrol\u201d and in possession of these items?\u2019: It is also for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">\u201cPlease reread instruction # 2302 [CALCRIM No. 2302] in this regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">After deliberating further, the jury informed the court it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the possession for sale count. However, it had unanimously reached a verdict on the lesser included offense of simple possession. The jury asked if it could convict on the lesser charge yet remain deadlocked on the possession for sale count. The court told the jury it could not, and it instructed the jury to reread CALCRIM No. 3518 on the process for convicting on a lesser included offense. The jury later convicted defendant of possession for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">After the trial\u2019s conclusion, the court set forth on the record its reasons for responding to the jury\u2019s request for clarification as it did. The court explained that upon receiving the request, it consulted with counsel and interpreted the two questions as seeking \u201chow to go about evaluating the idea of control as to the first question and, secondly, a sufficiency of the evidence question on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>the second one. So the Court was\u2014did not read this request for clarification as a request to clarify a jury instruction, but rather, a request as to how they should deliberate or how they should go about their deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The court believed that with these questions, \u201cthe jury was disclosing their internal deliberations, which they shouldn\u2019t do anyway, but especially the second part of that where they gave a fact pattern and asked if that was enough. So it appeared to me that this question was inappropriately asking the Court to assist them in their substantive deliberations and, again, was not a request for a clarification of the instruction on possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">The jury\u2019s request for further clarification triggered section 1138. The statute provides in part: \u201cAfter the jury have retired for deliberation, ... if they desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the case, they must require the officer to conduct them into court. Upon being brought into court, the information required must be given . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1138.) \u201cThis means the trial \u2018court has a primary duty to help the jury understand the legal principles it is asked to apply. [Citation.] This does not mean the court must always elaborate on the standard instructions. Where the original instructions are themselves full and complete, the court has discretion under section 1138 to determine what additional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the jury\u2019s request for information. [Citation.] Indeed, comments diverging from the standard are often risky. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beardslee </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 68, 97 [279 Cal.Rptr. 276, 806 P.2d 1311].) However, \u2018[a] definition of a commonly used term may nevertheless be required if the jury exhibits confusion over the term\u2019s meaning. [Citation.]\u2019 (5 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Criminal Trial, \u00a7 633, p. 906.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Solis </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1002, 1015 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 464].)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Here, the court did not abuse its discretion in directing the jury to reread CALCRIM No. 2302 as to the meaning of the element of control and how to apply it. The instruction explains to the jury the concept of control. It states the jury must determine that the defendant possessed a controlled substance. It also explains that the defendant did not have to actually hold or touch something (actual possession) to possess it: \u201cIt is enough if the person has control over it or the right to control it, either personally or through another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Defendant complains the instruction did not inform the jury of the concept of constmctive possession as CALJIC No. 12.00 did. We disagree. CALCRIM No. 2302 states a person need not be in physical possession of the substance, and he can be found guilty if he has control or the right of control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>over it. Thus, without using the phrase \u201cconstructive possession,\u201d the instruction adequately explained the concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Defendant faults the instruction for not elaborating on the issue of proximity to the substance. The instruction did not have to offer more than it already did. The instruction requires the defendant to have control over the substance. Under this language, the jury could not find defendant guilty simply due to his proximity to the substance. No reasonable juror would have believed that proximity alone equaled control.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Defendant asserts the jury\u2019s subsequent deadlock on the possession for sale count and its request to convict on simple possession demonstrates the court\u2019s response failed to aid the jury in determining possession or control. To the contrary, the jury\u2019s determination to convict defendant on simple possession demonstrates the jury had resolved the element of control and remained deadlocked only on the element of intent to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">We agree with the trial court that any detailed response to the question would have thrust the court into the jury\u2019s role of deliberating whether defendant had controlled the substances. \u201cWhen a question shows the jury has focused on a particular issue, or is leaning in a certain direction, the court must not appear to be an advocate, either endorsing or redirecting the jury\u2019s inclination.\u201d <em>(People v. Moore </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1331 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].) The court\u2019s direction to reread CALCRIM No. 2302 as well as CALCRIM No. 3518 kept the court out of the jury\u2019s deliberating role, while at the same time provided the jury with the complete information it needed to convict on the crimes of possession for sale or, alternatively, simple possession. The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to provide additional instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">III-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Morrison, J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 16, 2008, S157948.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-13\"> Hereafter, undesignated section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-7\"> CALJIC No. 12.00 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-8\">\u201c[Defendant is accused in [Count[s]_] of having committed the crime of illegal possession of a controlled substance, a violation of \u00a7__ of the Health and Safety Code.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-10\">\u201cEvery person who possesses [(controlled substance)], a controlled substance, is guilty of a violation of Health and Safety Code \u00a7__, a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">\u201cThere are two kinds of possession: actual possession and constructive possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-12\">\u201c \u2018Actual possession\u2019 requires that a person knowingly exercise direct physical control over a thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">\u201c \u2018Constructive possession\u2019 does not require actual possession but does require that a person knowingly exercise control over or the right to control a thing, either directly or through another person or persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-14\">\u201c[One person may have possession alone, or two or more persons together may share actual or constructive possession.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-15\">\u201cIn order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-16\">\u201c1.
