The denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977). Nonetheless, during the pendency of this interlocutory appeal, Fleming has been convicted of all counts. The district court was not divested of jurisdiction during the pendency of this appeal because it found that the motion to dismiss was frivolous. <em>See United States v. Dunbar, </em>611 F.2d 985, 988 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-21\">Contending that the pre-indictment revocation of her supervised release and subsequent resentencing was based on the same conduct, Fleming argues that the instant prosecution violates the Double Jeopardy Clause and principles of collateral estoppel. The district court\u2019s denial of Fleming\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-22\">The revocation sentence was not punishment for the charged offenses, but for the offense for which supervised release had been imposed. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>559 F.3d 368, 371 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, Fleming is not being punished twice for the same offense. <em>See United States v. Carlton, </em>534 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 613, 172 L.Ed.2d 468 (2008); <em>United States v. Wyatt, </em>102 F.3d 241, 245 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-25\">Because revocation proceedings are not \u201cessentially criminal,\u201d the instant prosecution does not constitute a second prosecution for the same offense. <em>See Stringer v. Williams, </em>161 F.3d 259, 262 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Whitney, </em>649 F.2d 296, 298 (5th Cir.1981). Accordingly, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable. <em>See Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 445, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970); <em>Showery v. Samaniego, </em>814 F.2d 200, 203 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Fleming\u2019s motion for oral argument is DENIED. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(C). Fleming\u2019s emergency motion for a stay of trial proceeding, related letter, and motion for bail pending appeal in which she asserts that the district court lacks jurisdiction are DENIED. <em>See Dunbar, </em>611 F.2d at 989.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
