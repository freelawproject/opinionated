Rowe does not appeal his 60-month sentence for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), which runs consecutive to his drug conviction. Rowe\u2019s 84-month sentence was based on his possession of both crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-21\">On appeal, Rowe argues that the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct at sentencing because, although he recited the United States Department of Justice\u2019s (\u201cDOJ\u2019s\u201d) policy supporting the elimination of the crack/powder cocaine disparity in the Sentencing Guidelines, he undermined the DOJ\u2019s policy by arguing for a sentence towards the middle of his guideline range. He contends that, as a result, the district court refused to vary below the low-end of his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">Normally, we review \u201cclaims of prosecu-torial conduct <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1306 (11th Cir.2008). However, because Rowe failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements before the district court, we review \u201cfor plain error that is so obvious that failure to correct it would jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306-07 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo establish prose-cutorial misconduct, (1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Because the prosecutor complied with the DOJ\u2019s policy, which required him to inform the district court that the DOJ and the Obama Administration supported the elimination of the crack/powder cocaine disparity in the Sentencing Guidelines, he did not commit prosecutorial misconduct, plainly or otherwise, by arguing for a within-guideline sentence. Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Rowe\u2019s 84-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
