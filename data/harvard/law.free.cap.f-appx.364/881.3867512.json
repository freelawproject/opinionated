After considering the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusions and held 1) that Mann\u2019s due process claim was time barred and 2) that Mann\u2019s claim based on breach of his plea bargain was barred by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court then dismissed Mann\u2019s due process claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and dismissed his claims based on breach of the plea bargain with prejudice pending satisfaction of the <em>Heck </em>conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Mann\u2019s appeal is primarily based on the district court\u2019s dismissal of his due process claims. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915A. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">First, as the district court properly recognized, a state actor\u2019s negligent or intentional deprivation of a plaintiffs property does not result in a due process violation if there exists an adequate state post-deprivation remedy. <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535-55, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981). Texas law provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy for the taking of any property. <em>See Holloway v. Walker, </em>784 F.2d 1287, 1292 (5th Cir.1986). Because no specified federal statute of limitations exists for \u00a7 1983 claims, federal courts borrow the forum state\u2019s general or residual tort limitations period. <em>Rodriguez v. Holmes, </em>963 F.2d 799, 803 (5th Cir.1992). In Texas, the applicable period is two years. Although state law controls the limitations period for \u00a7 1983 claims, federal law determines when a cause of action accrues. <em>Brummett v. Camble, </em>946 F.2d 1178, 1184 (5th Cir.1991). Accrual begins \u201cwhen the plaintiff knows or has reason to know the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Burrell v. Newsome, </em>883 F.2d 416, 418 (5th Cir.1989). Mann brought this suit in 2008, more than five years after the alleged deprivation and five years after he signed his plea agreement in which he allegedly extracted an agreement from the state to return his property; therefore, the district court did not err when it concluded that Mann\u2019s due process claim is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Second, the district court did not err when it concluded that Mann\u2019s claim, based on the violation of the terms of the plea bargain, is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who seeks damages under \u00a7 1983 for actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid must first prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed, expunged, invalidated, or otherwise called into question. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364. This court has held that <em>Heck </em>also applies where a plaintiff seeks injunc-tive or declaratory relief which, if granted, would necessarily imply that a conviction is invalid. <em>Kutzner v. Montgomery County, </em>303 F.3d 339, 340-41 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Shaw v. Harris, </em>116 Fed.Appx. 499 (5th Cir.2004). In this case, a successful outcome for Mann\u2019s claims alleging breach of his plea bargain could imply the invalidity of his plea and therefore his conviction. As such, his claims were properly dismissed with prejudice until the <em>Heck </em>conditions were met. <em>See Johnson v. McElveen, </em>101 F.3d 423 (5th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b904-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-10\">. We only consider Mann's appeal of the dismissal of his own suit. Mann has no right to appeal on behalf of a multitude of allegedly similarly situated and aggrieved parties. <em>See Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1021 (5th Cir.1998) (\"In federal court a party can represent himself or be represented by an attorney, but cannot be represented by a non-lawyer.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\">. Mann raises a number of additional merit-less issues, including that both the district judge and the magistrate judge should have recused themselves and that material was improperly excluded from the record. We have considered these arguments and rejected them. Further, while this matter was on appeal, Mann moved this court to enter an injunction ordering his transfer to another prison unit. We have no authority to consider this motion in the first instance and therefore this motion is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
