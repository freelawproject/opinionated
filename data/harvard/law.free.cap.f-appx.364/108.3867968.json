California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Peeler has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-24\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. The judgment reflects that Peeler was assessed a $200 f\u00edne. However, the district court actually ordered Peeler to pay $200 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-25\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Fed.R. CrimP. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b130-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Ciu. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
