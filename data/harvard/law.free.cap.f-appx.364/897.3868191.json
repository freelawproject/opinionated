The district court sentenced him to a term of sixty-three months. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be vacated because the Government failed to prove that he had actual knowledge that the gun and ammunition he possessed had crossed state lines. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Peters acknowledged that this court has rejected his argument. <em>See United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77 (5th Cir.1988). He seeks our second look at the issue, though, contending that a recent Supreme Court decision changed the law and effectively overruled <em>Dancy. See Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). This court has already taken another look, as we will discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The felon-in-possession statute forbids a person \u201cwho has been convicted in any court, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d as relevant here, \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). This statute makes no reference to knowledge. <em>Id. </em>However, the penalty provision provides that a certain sentence shall be imposed if the offender \u201cknowingly violates,\u201d as relevant here, Section 922(g). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Peters argues that the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in this statute is analogous to its use in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), an identity-theft statute. The Supreme Court held that \u201cknowingly\u201d in that statute applied to each element of the offense that follows it, giving the Government the burden to prove that a defendant had knowledge of each element of the offense. <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1890-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">Peters argues that similarly, the Government must prove that he had knowledge relating to each element of his offense, including that the firearm affected interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">The Government moved for summary affirmance, arguing that <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>did not overrule <em>Dancy </em>and thus that the rule in <em>Dancy </em>remains good law and forecloses Peters\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">We denied the Government\u2019s motion, and the briefing continued. Since then, though, we have rejected the argument that <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>overruled <em>Dancy. See United States v. Rose, </em>587 F.3d 695, 703 n. 6, 705-06 (5th Cir.2009). In his reply brief, Peters argues that <em>Rose </em>is not controlling because the relevant language is dictum. That is not true. The determination that the \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement in Section 924(a)(2) did not extend to Section 922(g)(1) was an alternate holding, not dictum, and thus is binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Bueno, </em>585 F.3d 847, 850 n. 3 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">Peters also argues that by proving only that the gun he possessed had crossed state lines, the Government did not meet its burden to prove that the gun was in or affected interstate commerce. He contends that the Government must prove a more substantial effect on interstate commerce than mere movement from one state to another at an undeterminable time in the past, relying on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). He also argues that this court\u2019s decisions to the contrary have been undermined by Supreme Court authority. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000). Here too, as Peters concedes, his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth'in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
