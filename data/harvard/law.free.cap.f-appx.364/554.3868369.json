On appeal, Reid argues that he was entitled to an Amendment 599 reduction for his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) convictions in Counts 2, 4, and 6. After thorough review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">We review a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>de novo. United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines and determine the new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court decides whether, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it will \u201celect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">On November 1, 2000, Amendment 599, which was made retroactive, amended the commentary language for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 599; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Section 2K2.4 applies to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) imposes a term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>for \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Amendment 599 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">4. Weapon Enhancement. \u2014 If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsA\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">As an initial matter, contrary to Reid\u2019s claims, the district court did not err by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as to Counts 2, 4 and 6 because Amendment 599 does not eliminate Reid\u2019s sentences for those counts. However, the government concedes that Amendment 599 does provide Reid some relief on his other counts, and liberally construes his <em>pro se </em>motion to provide for that relief. <em>See Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d); <em>United States v. Dabdoub-Diaz, </em>599 F.2d 96, 98 (5th Cir.1979) (construing a <em>pro se </em>defendant\u2019s motion liberally).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We agree with the government that Reid is entitled to a sentence reduction for his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) convictions in Counts 1, 3, and 5 \u2014 the underlying offenses to his \u00a7 924(c) convictions \u2014 because the district court had issued specific offense characteristics to those counts for brandishing a firearm. Pursuant to Amendment 599, those specific offense characteristics should be eliminated, signifying that Reid\u2019s guideline range for Counts 1, 3, and 5 is now lowered to 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment based on an amended total offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of IV. Because Reid\u2019s amended guideline range is lowered by Amendment 599 and the government willingly construes Reid\u2019s motion to include this relief, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">.
