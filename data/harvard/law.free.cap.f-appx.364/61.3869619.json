Gowdy argues that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict regarding his knowing possession of the ammunition because the arresting officer\u2019s testimony was unreliable. A reasonable trier of fact could have concluded from the evidence that Gowd/s knowing possession of the ammunition was established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Floyd, </em>343 F.3d 363, 370 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-22\">Gowdy also contends that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court unduly limited its discretion at sentencing and imposed a within-guidelines sentence that it believed was excessive. Examination of the record does not support that claim. Gowdy has failed to establish that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-23\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b83-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
