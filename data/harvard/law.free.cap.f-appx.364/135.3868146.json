He contends: the district court failed to provide sufficient reasons supporting the within-guidelines sentence in the light of his request for a downward departure for cultural assimilation; and, his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">Although post-Booker; the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-23\">As noted, pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If, as in this case, there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, as noted above, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable\u201d. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-24\">In district court, Hernandez did not object to the reasons provided for denying a downward departure; therefore, our review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Reversible plain error exists where a clear or obvious error affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even then, we retain discretion whether to correct such an error and, generally, will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Even \u201cbrief\u2019 reasons for imposing a sentence, such as the district court provided, are legally sufficient. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that Hernandez\u2019 sentence would have been different had the court provided greater explanation of its selected sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 364-65. Therefore, Hernandez fails to show the district court\u2019s explanation of its reasons for supporting his sentence constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Regarding his substantive-unreasonableness claim, Hernandez fails to overcome the presumption that a \u201cdiscretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range\u201d is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Whether reviewed for abuse of discretion or plain error, the district court\u2019s consideration of the advisory guidelines range, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the information in the presentence report, and the parties\u2019 contentions, along with its finding that the guidelines range adequately reflected the relevant sentencing factors, shows Hernandez\u2019 sentence was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
