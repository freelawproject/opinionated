He contends: a Supreme Court decision handed down after entry of his identity-theft guilty plea shows the plea was not supported by a factual basis, <em>see Flores-Figueroa v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009); and, his 120-month non-guidelines sentence for mail fraud was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\"><em>Flores-Figueroa </em>held the Government must prove the defendant knew that the stolen identification belonged to another person. 129 S.Ct. at 1889, 1894; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a) (setting out elements of aggravated identity theft). The Government concedes the record does <em>not </em>establish Ogbemudia knew such documents belonged to actual people. Ogbemudia contends, and the Government concedes, remand is appropriate because the record does not contain a sufficient factual basis to establish this essential element. Fed. R.CrimP. 11(b)(3) (requiring district court, before entering judgment on a guilty plea, to determine it is supported by a factual basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Because Ogbemudia did not raise this issue in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Reversible plain error exists where a clear or obvious error affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009); <em>see also Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429. Even then, we retain discretion whether to correct such an error and, generally, will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">As noted, error existed because there was an insufficient factual basis to support Ogbemudia\u2019s conviction. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CRIm.P. 11(b)(3); <em>United States v. Adams, </em>961 F.2d 505, 508 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe factual basis cannot be implied from the fact that the defendant entered a plea, but must appear on the face of the record and \u2018must be precise enough and sufficiently specific\u2019 to demonstrate that the accused committed the charged criminal offense.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>546 F.2d 1225, 1226 (5th Cir.1977))).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">The error was clear or obvious. Although the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>when Ogbemudia pleaded guilty, it is sufficient that the error be clear at the time of appeal. <em>See United States v. Avants, </em>278 F.3d 510, 521 (5th Cir.2002). Further, this error affected Ogbemudia\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 80-83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). And, in the light of the Government\u2019s request for a remand, it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct this error. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429. Accordingly, Ogbemudia\u2019s conviction for aggravated identity theft is vacated, and this matter is remanded for entry of a new plea for his identity-theft convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tion. <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>110 F.3d 1155, 1162 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">For Ogbemudia\u2019s mail-fraud sentence, the district court: concluded that the advisory guideline range of 38 to 41 months was not sufficient to achieve the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and imposed a non-guidelines sentence of 120 months. Ogbemudia challenges the reasonableness of this upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">As noted, pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If, as in this case, there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, as noted above, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53. \u201c[A] sentence within a propei\u2019ly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable\u201d. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Contrary to Ogbemudia\u2019s assertions, the district court weighed numerous factors under \u00a7 3553(a) and provided detailed and substantial justification for concluding that the range of 33 to 41 months was insufficient to satisfy those objectives. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming upward variance based on \u00a7 3553(a) factors); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 810-11 (5th Cir.2008) (same). The court noted that Ogbemudia\u2019s offense constituted a wide-ranging scheme involving: the use of counterfeit identifications and documents containing false information; the rental of 20 postal boxes in 12 locations; and the establishment of more than 70 fraudulent accounts at 15 different financial institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The court also concluded that Ogbemu-dia\u2019s criminal history category of VI did not accurately reflect Ogbemudia\u2019s actual history and characteristics, and that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was thus insufficient to reflect his history and characteristics, promote respect for the law, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public from future crimes by Ogbemudia. The record supports these findings: Ogbemudia has a 20-year history of crimes involving fraud, some of which were not included in his criminal history score; Ogbemudia had been deported three times, only to reenter the United States illegally each time; the convictions included in the criminal history score earned him 18 points, five more than needed for Category VI; despite repeated convictions and incarceration, Ogbemudia continued to commit crimes, including fraud-based offenses; and he has employed numerous aliases and false or fraudulently obtained social security numbers. These were proper considerations that support the district court\u2019s reasonable conclusion that Ogbemudia\u2019s criminal history score did not fully reflect his criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531 (5th Cir.2008) (noting that \u201cdefendant\u2019s criminal history is one of the factors that a court may consider in imposing a non-Guidelines sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">In sum, the district court\u2019s determination that a sentence substantially above the guidelines range was needed to achieve the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a) did not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 350. Similarly, there is no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the extent of the deviation, which was justified by the district court\u2019s careful analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id.-, see also United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 441-42 (5th Cir.2006) (affirming 120-month sentence where guidelines range was 46 to 57 months). Because there is no basis for reversal under the ordinary abuse-of-discretion standard of review, we need not reach the Government\u2019s contention that Ogbemudia\u2019s sentencing challenge should be reviewed only for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Ogbemudia\u2019s mail-fraud sentence is AFFIRMED; his aggravated-identity-theft conviction is VACATED; and this matter is REMANDED for entry of a new plea on the identity-theft count.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b95-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under tlie limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
