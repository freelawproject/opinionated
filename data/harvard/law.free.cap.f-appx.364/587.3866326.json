This petition is Hill\u2019s third attempt to collaterally attack the validity of his underlying conviction for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h). A provision of \u00a7 2255, however, permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-15\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him x-elief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) (emphasis added). Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his deten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>See id. </em>A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating the applicability of the savings clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Hill filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion in 2003, which the trial court denied on procedural and substantive grounds. In 2006, Hill filed an application with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion based on \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence that a federal agent who investigated his crime and testified at trial had a secret relationship with a \u201ckey witness\u201d in the case. The Seventh Circuit denied the application on two alternative grounds. First, even assuming there was constitutional error, the evidence was \u201cinsufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense,\u201d as is required to file a successive petition under \u00a7 2255. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h)(1). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). The Seventh Circuit concluded that the evidence adduced against Hill at his two-month trial was \u201coverwhelming and included the testimony of many witnesses against whom there [was] no suggestion of taint.\u201d Second, Hill\u2019s application was time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations governing successive applications. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In 2008, Hill filed this petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Middle District of Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court dismissed the petition. Hill appeals that dismissal, arguing that the district court erred when it found that \u00a7 2255 barred his \u00a7 2241 petition, and, under the standard set forth in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999), \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause did not apply. Specifically, he asserts that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention because the government suppressed the evidence about the investigator-witness relationship until after the denial of his first \u00a7 2255 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). The burden is on the movant to establish the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hill has not satisfied this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">Although, if true, the personal relationship between a prosecutorial investigator and a key government witness is troubling, Hill cannot show that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to permit his \u00a7 2241 petition. We have held that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause only applies when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>All three criteria must be satisfied, and Hill can satisfy none.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Hill\u2019s claims rest on new evidence discovered after the denial of his first \u00a7 2255 petition, not \u201ca retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturning prior circuit precedent.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1245. Hill had a procedural opportunity to raise this new evidence in a successive \u00a7 2255 petition but could not satisfy the AEDPA\u2019s strict procedural hurdles for doing so. Moreover, we have expressly held that the AEDPA\u2019s restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1245. Consequently, a petitioner like Hill who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, and been denied, may not circumvent the restriction on successive motions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Therefore, because Hill\u2019s application for a successive habeas petition under \u00a7 2255 was denied by the Seventh Circuit and he cannot satisfy any of the three <em>Wofford </em>requirements, we hold that Hill failed to show that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applied to open a portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3, 1245. As a result, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Hill\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\">. Hill is now an inmate at a correctional facility in Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\">. Hill also filed a motion to strike the government\u2019s response brief due to citation to the record from the district court that considering his initial \u00a7 2255 motion and an order from our circuit denying his appointment of counsel in this appeal. The government did not err in citing to these documents that are part of die public record and procedural background of Hill's case. Therefore, Hill's motion to strike the government's response brief is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-14\">.The Eleventh Circuit, in an en banc decision, <em>Bonner v.
