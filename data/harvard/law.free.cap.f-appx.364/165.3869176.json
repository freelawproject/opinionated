Jiles argues that the district court committed reversible error by adjusting his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). He argues that the facts of his case are substantially the same as those in <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>272 Fed.Appx. 412 (5th Cir.2008), in which this court found that the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) adjustment was not applicable. The facts of the instant case are virtually indistinguishable from those in <em>McKinley, </em>272 Fed.Appx. at 414. It is thus arguable that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">\u201cNot all errors in determining a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence require reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 904, 173 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Where a district court considers the sentencing ranges that might apply to defendant with and without a disputed enhancement and otherwise explains its sentence in terms of \u00a7 3553, the resulting sentence does not result from an incorrect application of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Ruiz-Arriaga, </em>565 F.3d 280, 282 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 227, 175 L.Ed.2d 157 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2008) (an incorrect application of the Guidelines is reversible error only if the non-Guideline sentence \u201cresulted\u201d from the error).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-25\">The district court determined that without the reckless endangerment adjustment, Jiles\u2019s advisory sentencing range would have been 15 to 21 months of imprisonment. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201c[i]n the event that the court is wrong as far as the application of the reckless endangerment, nonetheless the court believes that a sentence of something more than what the guideline range would be ... without the reckless endangerment, just so that we\u2019re clear here, without the reckless endangerment we would be looking at ... fifteen to 21 months. And the court does not think that under the circumstances both of offense and the manner in which it was committed and of the history that I have here as to your own prior criminal history that a sentence in that range would be appropriate. The court believes that a sentence of 35 months is an appropriate and reasonable sentence in this case, and the court would impose that sentence, even if it were wrong about the reckless endangerment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Jiles also argues (as he did below, 3 R. 149) that his non-guideline sentence is substantively unreasonable. We review the substantive reasonableness of the non-Guideline sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>568 F.3d 564, 566 (5th Cir.2009). We are unable to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the 35 month sentence imposed was reasonable. The district court gave extensive consideration to Giles\u2019 argument but determined that the record counseled in favor of a sentence at the low end of the enhanced range. The trial court considered the premeditated nature of the conduct, the fact that the defendant did not know who he was transporting into the United States, the defendant\u2019s previous criminal conduct, and the manner in which the crime was committed. In fact, the district court made a finding of fact that the defendant transported these aliens in an inhumane fashion. Contrary to Giles\u2019 argument otherwise, the district court\u2019s statements on the record were adequate to establish that the alternative non-Guideline sentence was substantively reasonable and that the court properly considered and applied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
