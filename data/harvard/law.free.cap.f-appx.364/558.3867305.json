Flores-Pacheco argues that his sentence is both proeedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The United States has removed Flores-Pacheco more than once. In August 2008, Flores-Pacheco pleaded guilty to aggravated battery in Miami-Dade County and received a sentence of one year of probation. In September 2008, the United States ordered him removed. In October 2008, Flores-Pacheco was convicted in the Southern District of Texas of illegally reentering the United States and removed a second time. Undeterred, he returned again. In March 2009, agents of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Flores-Pacheco in Miami-Dade County while conducting an investigation into the employment of illegal immigrants. In May 2009, Flores-Pacheco again pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">In July 2009, the district court held a sentencing hearing to address Flores-Pacheco\u2019s most recent conviction. The pre-sentence investigation report provided a guidelines range of 46 to 57 months of imprisonment. This range included a 16-level enhancement because of Flores-Pacheco\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated battery, a felony crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Flores-Pacheco did not contest the fact of his prior conviction, but he asked the district court to disregard the enhancement and \u201cuse [its] discretion in fashioning a sentence that is appropriate for deterrence.\u201d He agreed that \u201csome increase should be allowed\u201d for his aggravated battery conviction, but he argued that the enhancement prescribed by the guidelines was \u201cunreasonable\u201d because it did not consider the nature of his prior violent felony. Flores-Pacheco stated that his prior conviction was not for \u201ca gun [ ] or heroin importation or some ... intense offense.\u201d He argued that he had \u201cplead[ed] guilty to a charge that he got into a fight with somebody else.\u201d He urged the district court to impose a sentence of 12 to 18 months because \u201cthat\u2019s enough deterrence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">The district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range. It explained that \u201cI understand the defendant\u2019s argument, but I\u2019m not persuaded by it.\u201d The district court was \u201cparticularly not persuaded in the case of this defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>who has ... been deported and he has come back and he was not simply deported, he was deported following an illegal reentry, the very same crime he\u2019s here today addressing.\u201d The district court \u201cbeg[an] with the premise that the Guidelines range is appropriate\u201d and invited Flores-Pacheco to \u201caddress any 3553 factors that ... warrant a sentence outside the advisory Guidelines range.\u201d The district court heard further argument from both parties and \u201c[a]fter careful consideration of the presentence report, the advisory Guidelines and the statutory factors under 3553\u201d imposed a sentence of 46 months of imprisonment to be followed by 36 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence through a two-step process using a deferential abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cFirst, we look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines range as mandatory, or failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[0]rdinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.... [T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.... \u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Flores-Pacheco challenges his sentence on two grounds. He argues that it is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not address his argument that he should receive a downward variance because section 2L 1.2(b)(1) (A) (ii) \u201cdoes not differentiate between different types of crimes of violence.\u201d Flores-Pacheco argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because he \u201creceived the same sentence as defendants guilty of illegal re-entry previously convicted of ... sexually assaulting a 14-year-old [] and gang-related drive-by shootings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">We reject both arguments. The district court adequately explained why it disagreed with Flores-Pacheco\u2019s argument about the guidelines enhancement. Flores-Pacheco\u2019s sentence is also not substantively unreasonable because there is no \u201cunwarranted similarit[y],\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 55, 128 S.Ct. 586, 600, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), between his sentence and the sentences that he cites as similar. Even if Flores-Pacheco is correct that aggravated battery is \u201csubstantively different\u201d from the violent felonies to which he compares it, no case that he cites involves a defendant who, like him, had been convicted of illegal reentry more than once. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Huerta, </em>576 F.3d 365 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Castro-Guevarra, </em>575 F.3d 550 (5th Cir.2009). Flores-Pacheco has not met his \u201cburden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Flores-Pacheco\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
