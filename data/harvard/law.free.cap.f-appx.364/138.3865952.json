Jackson was removed from his position as an electronics mechanic by the Air Force. Jackson appealed his removal through administrative procedures and alleged that the Air Force discriminated against him on the basis of race, reprisal, and for being a whistle-blower. The Merits Systems Protection Board reversed his removal and ordered reinstatement, but found no discrimination on the grounds alleged by Jackson. Jackson then filed two suits in the United States district court, one for the enforcement of his job reinstatement and another on discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The two suits were consolidated and the district court heard two separate motions to dismiss. The Air Force moved to dismiss the enforcement claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Air Force fried a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, motion for summary judgement (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion\u201d) as to the discrimination claims. The district court issued an order dismissing the enforcement claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and granted summary judgement as to all but two of Jackson\u2019s discrimination claims. The order stated that these rulings had been made \u201cfor reasons that will follow by separate Memorandum Opinion.\u201d However, before a memorandum opinion was issued, the case was reassigned to a second judge. The second judge reconsidered all aspects of the defendant\u2019s motions, vacated portions of the previous judge\u2019s order, and granted the Defendant\u2019s Motion in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Jackson now appeals the final order, alleging 1) the district court erred in granting the Defendant\u2019s Motion \u201csua sponte\u201d and contrary to the previous judge\u2019s order and 2) the newly assigned judge should have recused himself from the case because he had once been an employee of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office that is currently handling this case. We affirm</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">Fed. R. Civ. 54(b) states: \u201cany order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities.\u201d The order by the first judge was not a final judgment and thus, could be revised by the second judge. In addition, the denial of a motion for summary judgment is an interlocutory order, which the trial court may reconsider and reverse for any reason it deems sufficient, even in the absence of new evidence or an intervening change in or clarification of the substantive law. <em>Lavespere v. Niagara Mach. &amp; Tool Works, Inc., </em>910 F.2d 167, 185 (5th Cir.1990). It was within the newly assigned judge\u2019s power to consider the Defendant\u2019s Motion <em>sua sponte </em>and vacate the first judge\u2019s order. The court did not abuse its discretion. <em>Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 858, 862 (5th Cir.1970); <em>see also Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir.1993) (citation omitted)(\u201cThe revisitation by the court of [an] earlier order ... was not error because ... a court may correct its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>errors. The fact that [the judge] was not correcting his own error, but that of another judge who initially had been in charge of the case, is no moment.\u201d). Because Jackson had raised no contention concerning the merits of the judgment, any such argument is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Jackson\u2019s recusal claim is raised for the first time on appeal. Appellant argues that because of the \u201cnew trial judge\u2019s virtually immediate and preemptory ruling dismissing the case,\u201d he had \u201cno warning\u201d that such a motion to recuse was called for. Appellant argues that the judge demonstrated a \u201cclear appearance of impropriety\u201d because the judge \u201csummarily dismissed the case\u201d and is a former employee of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office that handled Jackson\u2019s case. Jackson had ample time to raise the recusal issue to the district court. His case was assigned to the new judge over a month before the judge entered a final order. In addition, Jackson filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the district court\u2019s final order as well as an amended motion. These motions were not denied until seven months later. Jackson failed to seek recusal at any point during this time. On appeal, he offers no explanation for his failure to seek recusal earlier, and he has not alleged exceptional circumstances why this court should consider the recusal issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Clay v. Allen, </em>242 F.3d 679, 681 (5th Cir.2001). For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
