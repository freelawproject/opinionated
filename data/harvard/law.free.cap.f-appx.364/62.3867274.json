Franklin was convicted of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-21\">Franklin contends that the district court erroneously found that his 20-year sentence was the minimum mandatory sentence for his offense because, he argues, the murders committed by the conspiracy were found not reasonably foreseeable to him when he was sentenced. The Government contends that Franklin waived any entitlement to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because the Federal Public Defender appointed to represent Franklin sat on the committee that determined Franklin was ineligible for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-22\">The Government\u2019s waiver argument is unavailing. Moreover, the district court\u2019s finding that Franklin previously had incurred a felony drug conviction raised his mandatory minimum sentence to 20 years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). Because Franklin was sentenced to the minimum mandatory 20-year term, he was ineligible for an adjustment pursuant to the crack cocaine guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
