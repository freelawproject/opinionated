He requested that his sentence be reduced to the bottom of his revised Guidelines sentence range of 92 to 155 months\u2019 imprisonment. The Government agreed that the motion should be granted, but urged the court to select a sentence in the middle of that range, i.e., 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court granted his motion and reduced the term of his Count 1 sentence to 108 months. The court also reduced appellant\u2019s sentences on Counts 3 and 5 to 108 months, to run concurrently with the Count 1 sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Appellant appealed the district court\u2019s decision. We vacated his new sentences and remanded the case for further proceedings because the court had not explained its reasons for imposing them. <em>United States v. Strachan, </em>319 Fed.Appx. 774 (11th Cir.2009). On remand, citing a statement Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer had submitted to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs \u2014 that the Department of Justice\u2019s position was that sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine should be equivalent \u2014 appellant asked the court, in resentencing him, to treat the Count 1 offense as if it had involved cocaine powder instead of crack. After holding a new sentencing hearing, the court reimposed the Count 1 sentence, and the Counts 3 and 5 sentences as well. Appellant now appeals those sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In his brief on appeal, appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant him an additional sentence reduction on Count 1, based on a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, and because of \u201cthe intervening view of the Department of Justice that crack cocaine offenses should be sentenced on par with powder cocaine offenses.\u201d He contends that, if he had been sentenced based upon 442 grams of powder cocaine, instead of 12.2 grams of crack cocaine and 429.8 grams of powder cocaine, his total offense level would have been 21. Thus, he would have had a Guidelines sentence range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment, instead of 110 to 137 months. He notes that the district court could not re-sentence him below his amended sentence range, so he says that he should have received a sentence of 92 months, which was the low end of his amended sentence range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, he complains that the court erred in failing to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the ease of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentence range which the Sentencing Commission has subsequently lowered. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence does not provide the basis for a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">\u201c[A] district court must engage in a two-part analysis\u201d when determining whether, and to what extent, to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(l). The court must first determine the amended Guidelines sentence range and, secondly, it must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 780-81; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). Section 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)) of the Guidelines provides, in pertinent part that, a \u201ccourt may consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the original term of imprisonment in determining\u201d the extent of the sentence reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">In this case, we vacated and remanded the district court\u2019s first sentence reduction, imposed after granting appellant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. We found that the district court properly calculated appellant\u2019s amended sentence range, but failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>to discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or its rationale for sentencing appellant to the middle of the amended sentence range. On remand, the district court explained that it had re-sentenced appellant to the middle of the amended sentence range because his original sentences had been in the middle of his original sentence range. The court also stated that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in particular that appellant\u2019s \u201csignificant criminal history at a very young age,\u201d part of his history and characteristics, did not warrant a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Appellant provides no evidence in support of his argument that the district court failed to consider his post-sentence rehabilitation. The record reveals that he submitted certificates from classes that he completed while imprisoned, and that he specifically informed the court about his rehabilitation during his re-sentencing proceedings. Thus, the court was aware of his rehabilitation argument, but nonetheless, chose to impose the Count 1 sentence in the middle of the Guidelines sentence range because of appellant\u2019s \u201csignificant criminal history,\u201d and because he originally was sentenced at the middle of the Guidelines sentence range. In addition, even if the court did not consider this rehabilitation, it was not required to do so. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)) (stating that the court <em>may </em>consider post-sentencing conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As for appellant\u2019s reliance on Assistant Attorney General Breuer\u2019s statement\u2014 that crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses should be sentenced equally \u2014 we note that it is merely a policy opinion and as such statement is not controlling authority. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In conclusion, we find no error in the district court\u2019s resentencing decision on Count 1 (the count that was subject to appellant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). Since the Government has acquiesced in the court\u2019s reduction of the sentences on Counts 3 and 5, which were not subject to reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we leave the court\u2019s resentencing decisions on those counts undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\">. These offenses were alleged in Counts I, 3, and 5 of a five-count indictment. Appellant pled guilty to these counts pursuant to a plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-11\">. The record does not indicate the statutory authority pursuant to which it reduced appellant\u2019s sentences on Counts 3 and 5. The Government appears to have consented to the reductions. Whether the court had the authority to reduce those sentences is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\">. These arguments are not, and cannot be, addressed to the sentences on Counts 3 and 5 because Amendment 715 and the Department of Justice position regarding crack cocaine does not apply to the offenses alleged in those two counts. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
