Because the BIA did not abuse its considerable discretion in this matter, we deny Liu\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">Liu entered the United States illegally in 2003. In January 2004, Liu filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the implementing regulations of the United States\u2019 adoption of the Convention Against Torture. The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) commenced removal proceedings against Liu in April 2004. An Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) considered Liu\u2019s application and DHS\u2019s removal proceeding at trial. The IJ denied Liu\u2019s requested relief, found that he was not eligible for voluntary departure, and ordered that he should be removed to China. The BIA dismissed Liu\u2019s administrative appeal of the IJ\u2019s order on April 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-19\">Liu did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal. Rather, on June 16, 2008, Liu filed a motion to reopen his original application for asylum with the BIA, claiming asylum under a new theory. Liu alleged that, while in DHS custody, he was baptized as a Christian. He subsequently sent religious materials, including a copy of his baptism certificate, to relatives in China. Liu also submitted papers purporting to show that local Chinese officials learned of Liu\u2019s mailings and informed his mother that he must report to Chinese authorities for questioning or be subject to arrest. Liu claimed these new developments established a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-20\">In an August 20, 2008 order (\u201cAugust 20th Order\u201d), the BIA rejected Liu\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. The BIA found that Liu\u2019s motion to reopen did not fall within the exception for changed country conditions because Liu\u2019s conversion amounted to a change in personal circumstances. Liu\u2019s supporting documents did not persuade the BIA, which noted errors of authentication and questions concerning originality.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-21\">Liu responded to the August 20th Order with two motions: a petition for review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>filed with this Court on September 29, 2008, and a motion to reconsider, filed with the BIA on September 18, 2009. We rejected Liu\u2019s petition for review as untimely in a December 22, 2008 order. The BIA denied Liu\u2019s motion to reconsider in its November 4th Order, finding that Liu offered no new or previously unavailable evidence, and that Liu had failed to demonstrate an error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s August 20th Order. Liu petitions us for review of that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In his petition, Liu asks us to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen as well as its denial of his motion to reconsider. The Government contends that Liu improperly seeks collateral review of the BIA\u2019s August 20th Order. We agree that a party may not collaterally attack a BIA ruling in a petition for review of a motion to reconsider. <em>See Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that DHS\u2019s motion to reconsider was a collateral attack on a BIA order). We also agree that Liu wrongly asks us to review the BIA\u2019s August 20th Order denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We previously held that Liu\u2019s motion to reopen the August 20th Order was untimely. Despite this ruling, Liu focuses his arguments on alleged errors in the BIA\u2019s August 20th Order, arguing that the BIA improperly rejected Liu\u2019s offered evidence as unauthenticated and unoriginal. Liu\u2019s attempt to solicit our review of the August 20th Order clearly falls outside of the thirty-day statutory limitation provided by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider Liu\u2019s arguments against the BIA\u2019s August 20th Order. <em>Cf. Guirguis v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 508, 509 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that the \u201ctime limit for filing a petition for review of a final order of deportation\u201d is jurisdictional). We therefore constrain our consideration of Liu\u2019s petition to his arguments against the BIA\u2019s November 4th Order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Liu\u2019s motion to reconsider under a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the Board....\u201d); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir.2005) (reviewing a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion). \u201c[W]e will not disturb the BIA\u2019s discretion so long as it \u2018is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Liu fails to specify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s August 20th Order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (requiring that a motion to reconsider to \u201cspecify the errors of law or fact in the previous order\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (same). Rather, Liu offers explanations for his failure to submit authenticated or original evidence in his original motion to reopen. Liu\u2019s proffered explanations do not establish that the BIA abused its considerable discretion when it denied his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Liu\u2019s petition to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
