Scott challenged two convictions for unauthorized entry of an inhabited building, one for aggravated burglary, and one for sexual battery. The district court found Scott\u2019s petition untimely to the extent that it challenged the unauthorized entries and the aggravated burglary. The district court found Scott\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims challenging the sexual battery conviction unexhausted and procedurally barred from federal habeas review. Scott \u2014 now represented by counsel \u2014 seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">Scott has not shown that reasonable jurists would find debatable or incorrect the district court\u2019s untimeliness ruling regarding his unauthorized entry convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Scott\u2019s motion for a COA is denied with respect to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">On the other hand, Scott argues that- \u2014 due to a resentencing \u2014 his federal petition was timely regarding his conviction for aggravated burglary. We hold that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s timeliness determination here to be debatable or incorrect. The debate would focus on whether the district court erred in calculating the date on which the aggravated burglary judgment \u201cbecame fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>nal\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).'</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[f]inal judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record indicates that Scott\u2019s sentence for the aggravated burglary did not become final until May 2005, but the district court found that the limitations period began to run in March 2004 \u2014 when the conviction became final. Scott thus raises a debatable procedural question. Because he also raises several substantive constitutional issues (including involuntariness of guilty plea) underlying his aggravated burglary conviction and sentence, he has made the necessary showing to obtain a COA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Scott further argues that the district court erred in finding his ineffective assistance of counsel claims procedurally defaulted in his sexual battery case. The district court ruled that Scott had not raised the claims in state court. Here again reasonable jurists might debate or disagree, insofar as Scott\u2019s ineffective assistance claim relates to the all-white composition of his jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">\u201cTo exhaust available state court remedies, a habeas petitioner must fairly present all the claims in his habeas corpus petition to the highest available state court, alerting the court to the federal nature of his claim. A prisoner fairly presents a claim to the state court when he ... alleges a pattern of facts that is well within the mainstream of constitutional litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Scott may have done so here, handwriting in his application for state post-conviction relief \u2014 under the heading \u201cIneffective Assistance of Counsel\u201d \u2014 \u201cOn February 12, 2003, my rights to a jury trial of my peers was violated. And I was wrongfully convicted due to same prior ineffective assistance of counsel Sherman Ruth that was ill prepared for my jury trial and inexperienced. And due to an all white jury selection.\u201d Reasonable jurists could debate whether Scott fairly presented in state court an argument that a failure to object to the jury composition on Batson<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> grounds contributed to his lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">To sum up, we GRANT Scott a COA on two issues: (1) whether Scott timely filed his federal petition regarding his aggravated burglary judgment; and (2) whether in his sexual battery case Scott procedurally defaulted his ineffective assistance claim relating to <em>Batson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">COA GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
