Efteland and Achor also appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their FTCA malicious prosecution claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Adrian appeals the dismissal of his malicious prosecution claim as time barred. Finding no reversible error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">Appellants were the owners of several companies holding a federal government contract. In November 1997, the United States sued the companies and Appellant Adrian for, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the Buy American Act, the False Claims Act, and the Truth in Negotiations Act in connection with the contract. Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Robert Selbe swore an affidavit on November 19, 1997, in support of a warrant for the search of Appellants\u2019 companies and the seizure of documents. On November 22, 1997, Selbe also swore a declaration in support of the United States\u2019s application for a writ of pre-judgment garnishment of the companies\u2019 bank accounts. On January 9, 1998, the complaint against the companies was dismissed pursuant to a consent decree and the complaint against Adrian was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Subsequently, in 1998 and 1999, Adrian and the companies filed lawsuits against various defendants \u2014 none named here\u2014 alleging that the defendants had conspired to bring about a false and malicious lawsuit by the United States against the companies, a \u201craid\u201d of the companies\u2019 facilities, and the termination of the government contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">Then, in October 2003, the Appellants filed administrative tort claims for abuse of process and malicious prosecution with the FBI, as required by the FTCA, alleging that Special Agent Selbe knowingly made false statements in the affidavit and declaration supporting the search warrant and garnishment. Finally, in October 2004, the Appellants brought the instant suit asserting (1) an FTCA claim for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>process due to Selbe\u2019s knowingly false declaration, (2) an FTCA claim for malicious prosecution due to Selbe\u2019s knowingly false affidavit and declaration, and (3) a <em>Bivens </em>claim alleging that Selbe violated the Appellants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights because his knowingly false affidavit lacked probable cause for the search of Appellants\u2019 companies, the search was over-broad, and Efteland and Achor were unconstitutionally seized during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The district court granted the Appellees\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Appellants\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>claim as time barred under the one-year statute of limitations, finding that the claim accrued in August 2003 and that Appellants\u2019 October 2004 suit, filed more than one year after the accrual date, was untimely. The court also dismissed Efte-land and Achor\u2019s malicious prosecution claims because they were not named defendants in the government\u2019s November 1997 lawsuit against Adrian and the companies, nor did the prior suit result in a favorable termination. Thus, Efteland and Achor could not satisfy the elements of malicious prosecution as a matter of law. As for Appellants\u2019 abuse of process claims and Adrian\u2019s malicious prosecution claim, the court granted Appellees\u2019 Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss or, alternatively, Rule 56 motion for summary judgment, because these claims accrued in 1999 at the latest. Appellants\u2019 October 2003 administrative filing with the FBI occurred well beyond the two-year statute of limitations imposed by the FTCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) (motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), Rule 12(b)(6) (motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) and Rule 56 (motion for summary judgment) dispositions, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>LeClerc v. Webb, </em>419 F.3d 405, 413 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">\n<em>A. Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABM\">1. <em>Bivens </em>Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">The district court found that Appellants\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>claims were barred by the statute of limitations because the claims accrued in August 2003 \u2014 more than one year prior to the filing of suit in October 2004' \u2014 -when Appellants received via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request a document alerting them that Selbe knowingly falsified his affidavit. However, Appellants argue that the <em>Bivens </em>claims did not accrue until February 2004, when Selbe\u2019s affidavit was unsealed and the Appellants became certain that Selbe lied to obtain a search warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">The statute of limitations for a <em>Bivens </em>action is borrowed from state law, <em>Alford v. United States, </em>693 F.2d 498, 499 (5th Cir.1982), and Louisiana tort law provides a one-year prescriptive period. <em>Gaspard v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1097, 1102 n. 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>(5th Cir.1983). Federal law, however, determines when a <em>Bivens </em>cause of action accrues. <em>United Klans of America v. McGovern, </em>621 F.2d 152, 153 n. 1 (5th Cir.1980). <em>\u201cA </em>cause of action accrues, under federal law, \u2018when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action;\u2019 \u201d such knowledge encompasses both \u201c(1) the existence of the injury; and (2) the connection between the injury and the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Brown v. Nationsbank Corp., </em>188 F.3d 579, 589-90 (5th Cir.1999). Actual knowledge is not necessary, though, for the limitations period to commence \u201cif the circumstances would lead a reasonable person to investigate further.\u201d <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">By their own admission, Appellants had actual knowledge in August 2003 that Sel-be allegedly lied in his affidavit. Paragraph 17 of Appellants\u2019 initial complaint states that the \u201csmoking-gun document [the term Appellants use to describe the August 2003 FOIA document] showed that Defendant Selbe knew, when he swore to the Affidavit in support of the search warrant and in the Declaration in support of the application for a prejudgment writ of garnishment, that his statements were false and deceptive.... \u201d Thus, Appellants\u2019 contention on appeal \u2014 that it was only in February 2004 that Appellants knew Selbe intentionally falsified his affidavit \u2014 rings hollow. Nonetheless, Appellants further insist that even knowledge of Selbe\u2019s intentional falsehoods was insufficient to trigger knowledge of a <em>Bivens </em>injury, for only upon reading the affidavit in February 2004 could the Appellants see that, with \u201cfalsities\u201d redacted, the affidavit still lacked probable cause. This argument is also fruitless, for their actual knowledge of Selbe\u2019s falsification \u2014 which Appellants admitted arose in August 2003 \u2014 would have reasonably led Appellants to investigate whether the affidavit entirely lacked probable cause. Consequently, the FOIA receipt in August 2003 triggered the limitations period and Appellants\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>claims were properly dismissed as time barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">2. Abuse of Process and Adrian\u2019s Malicious Prosecution Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">The district court also dismissed Appellants\u2019 abuse of process claims and Adrian\u2019s malicious prosecution claim as time barred, finding that these claims accrued in 1999 at the latest because Appellants had a copy of Selbe\u2019s declaration (which formed the basis of the abuse of process claim) as early as November 1997 and filed prior lawsuits in 1998 and 1999 alleging that the government\u2019s November 1997 suit against Adrian and the companies was falsely and maliciously instigated. The district court refused to exercise subject matter jurisdiction because Appellants did not present them administrative claims to the FBI until October 2003, long after the FTCA\u2019s 2-year bar. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) (that \u201ca tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues\u201d). Appellants maintain that the prior lawsuits had nothing to do with Selbe\u2019s alleged falsification of the affidavit and declaration and that Appellants\u2019 currently alleged claims were unknown until they could determine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Selbe had intentionally lied. For purposes of <em>these </em>claims, Appellants concede in their brief that the \u201cmoment\u201d of actual knowledge occurred in August 2003 with receipt of the FOIA document, rendering the October 2003 administrative filing timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Notwithstanding the factual inconsistencies in Appellants\u2019 arguments, these claims are likewise barred by the statute of limitations. Contrary to Appellants\u2019 suggestion, the law does not require a plaintiff to know with certainty that the elements of a cause of action are legally satisfied before a cause of action accrues. <em>See Piotrowski, </em>51 F.3d at 516 (\u201cA plaintiff need not realize that a legal cause of action exists....\u201d). Rather, a limitations period commences when a plaintiff has knowledge of facts that would prompt a reasonable person to investigate a claim. In 1997, Appellants had possession of Selbe\u2019s declaration and, as admitted in their complaint, they then knew it contained false information. By 1999, Appellants had filed lawsuits detailing facts which, in their view, supported a claim that the government\u2019s November 1997 suit was false and malicious. Appellants clearly \u201chad knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person (a) to conclude that there was a causal connection [between the injury and Selbe\u2019s declaration and affidavit] or (b) to seek professional advice, and then, with that advice, to conclude that there was a causal connection .... \u201d <em>Piotrowski, </em>51 F.3d at 516 (quoting <em>Harrison v. United States, </em>708 F.2d 1023, 1027 (5th Cir.1983)). Because Appellants had enough information in 1999 to warrant inquiry into whether Selbe <em>knowingly </em>falsified his affidavit and declaration, the district court correctly found that the October 2003 administrative filing was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">\n<em>B. Efteland\u2019s and Achor\u2019s Malicious Prosecution Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Noting the six elements of a malicious prosecution claim under Louisiana law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as recognized by this court in <em>Piazza v. Mayne, </em>217 F.3d 239, 245 (5th Cir.2000), the district court dismissed Efteland\u2019s and Aehor\u2019s malicious prosecution claims for failure to state a claim because neither one was a defendant in the government\u2019s original proceeding against Adrian and the companies. And the extent them malicious prosecution claims derived from ownership interests in the companies named as defendants, the court held that the consent decree settling the government\u2019s lawsuit was not the \u201cfavorable termination\u201d required to state a cause of action for malicious prosecution. Citing no legal authority, Appellants maintain that the suit against the companies was \u201cbasically the same thing\u201d as a suit against Efteland and Achor due to the financial harm they suffered as owners of the now-defunct defendant-companies and as signatories on garnished bank accounts. They explain away the \u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement by noting that the consent decree \u201cgarnered really nothing for the government\u201d and was necessary to free up Appellants\u2019 frozen financial assets. Creative arguments all, but completely unsupported by law. As Efteland and Achor cannot state a malicious prosecution claim that is \u201cplausible on its face,\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), we affirm the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b957-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-16\">. See <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b958-5\">. \"It is well-settled that these limitations periods [under the FTCA] are jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Flory v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 157, 159 (5th Cir.1998). Thus, a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-6\">. Appellants argue that <em>all </em>of the bases for their <em>Bivens </em>claims, including their allegations that the search of their companies' facilities was overbroad and that Efteland and Achor were unconstitutionally detained during the search, rest on Selbe\u2019s falsification of the affidavit in support of the search warrant. However dubious that proposition, we will assume <em>arguendo </em>that the statute of limitations for all of the <em>Bivens </em>claims did not commence running until the date the Appellants knew that Selbe intentionally lied in the affidavit, as this does not alter our result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b959-6\">. Appellants' argument that it was only in February 2004 that Appellants could have pled a <em>Bivens </em>claim immune from Rule 11 sanctions also fails. Appellants' admission in their complaint shows that, as of August 2003, they had \"evidentiary support\u201d for the <em>Bivens </em>claim. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b)(3). Additionally, because Appellants did not need access to the affidavit, unsealed in February 2004, for the limitations period to commence, Appellants' equitable tolling and equitable estoppel arguments \u2014 which turn on the sealing of the affidavit \u2014 are inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">. <em>\u201cThose elements </em>are: (1) the commencement or continuance of an original criminal proceeding; (2) its legal causation by the present defendant against plaintiff who was defendant in the original proceeding; (3) its bona fide termination in favor of the present plaintiff; (4) the absence of probable cause for such proceeding; (5) the presence of malice therein; (6) damage conforming to legal standards resulting to plaintiff.\u201d <em>Piazza, </em>217 F.3d at 245.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
