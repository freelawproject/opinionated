Citing \u201call relevant factors, including the nature of the offense, defendant\u2019s prior history, and defendant\u2019s post-conviction conduct\u201d and \u201cparticularly note[ing]\u201d Smith\u2019s post-conviction conduct, the district court reduced Smith\u2019s 188-month sentence to a 160-month term of imprisonment. Smith argues on appeal that his new sentence is an abuse of discretion because it is nine months greater than the amended advisory sentencing guidelines range, while his original sentence was at the top of the applicable sentencing guidelines range. He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it places undue reliance on the negative aspects of his prison record and fails to recognize his significant accomplishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence for abuse of discretion and review de novo its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">A sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a full sentencing proceeding; therefore, the reasonableness review standard derived from <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237. The district court properly considered Smith\u2019s post-conviction conduct in determining the extent of the sentence reduction. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. Because the court was under no obligation to reduce Smith\u2019s sentence at all, it had no obligation to reduce it to the recalculated range. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
