Green appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-21\">The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582 are thus governed by the policy statements of the Guidelines. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-23\">Green\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status. The district court was thus correct in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Green\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00a7 3582 in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a Guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The district coui\u2019t thus did not err in denying Green\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
