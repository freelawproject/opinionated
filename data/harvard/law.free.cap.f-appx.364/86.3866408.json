Barraza was sentenced to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment and a consecutive 18-month term of imprisonment for violating the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-24\">Barraza contends that his 41-month sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Barraza argues that the non-violent nature of the illegal reentry offense and his motive for reentering mitigate the seriousness of the offense. Barraza also argues that \u00a7 2L1.2 double-counts criminal history without an empirical basis. Barraza\u2019s appellate arguments fail to establish that his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>was unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Barraza contends that the 18-month revocation sentence was unreasonable because it constituted an additional punishment for his new offense, instead of a penalty for his breach of trust for violating the terms of his supervised release. Bar-raza also argues that the sentence was unreasonable because it was imposed consecutively to the sentence for illegal reentry. Barraza\u2019s appellate arguments fail to establish that his sentence was unreasonable or plainly unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b108-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
