He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by denying credit for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Although following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing guidelines are advisory only, and we review an ultimate sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court still must properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Generally, we review the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, 404 </em>F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We accord \u201ceven greater deference\u201d than under clear error review to the refusal to grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>485 F.3d 274, 287 (5th Cir.2007). We will not reverse a denial under \u00a7 3E1.1 unless the decision is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2452, 171 L.Ed.2d 248 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Lohmann contends that the district court erred by denying credit for acceptance of responsibility based on his objection to the drug quantity determination set forth in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). In the district court, Lohmann objected to being held accountable for 23 ounces of methamphetamine on the strength of statements made by co-defendant Cory Mitchell, who indicated that he had obtained methamphetamine from Lohmann\u2019s mother and that he had then distributed that methamphetamine to Lohmann. The PSR also reported that Lohmann had made a statement denying that his mother had been involved in methamphetamine distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">As Lohmann notes, there was testimony at sentencing from a law enforcement officer to the effect that it was not feasible for drug transactions between Mitchell and Lohmann\u2019s mother to have occurred. The district court, however, in overruling Loh-mann\u2019s objection to drug quantity, implicitly determined that Mitchell\u2019s account was accurate. The court\u2019s view of the evidence regarding drug quantity is plausible in light of the record, which includes Mitchell\u2019s statements as reported in the PSR and other evidence that Lohmann\u2019s mother trafficked in methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 859 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 291 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006). The denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>See Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED. Lohmann\u2019s motion for substitute counsel, which was filed after the completion of briefing, is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
