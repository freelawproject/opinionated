Murphy), of one count of forgery of fictitious name upon his plea of guilty (Penal Code of Cal, \u00a7 470), a felony. This court has determined that the crime, if committed in the State of New York would constitute a felony. Accordingly, by virtue of subdivision 4 of section 90 of the Judiciary Law, said Reed John Murphy has ceased to be an attorney and counselor at law or competent to practice law as such. On this court\u2019s own motion, an order will be entered directing that his name be forthwith struck from the roll of attorneys and counselors at law. Gulotta, P. J., Hopkins, Martuscello and Latham, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
