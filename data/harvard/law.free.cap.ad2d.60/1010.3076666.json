Respondent was admitted to practice by this court on October 20, 1954 under the name John Edward Paggioli. The petition charges respondent with professional misconduct as follows: (1) converting escrow funds to his own use from five different clients totaling more than $62,000 and issuing checks totaling more than $68,000, which checks were returned for insufficient funds; (2) neglecting legal matters entrusted to him, failing to respond to the inquiries of his clients and misrepresenting facts to his clients and others in order to conceal his neglect; and (3) failing to co-operate with the petitioner herein in its investigation of complaints against him. The respondent states in his affidavit that his resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered; that he is not being subjected to coercion or duress; that he is fully aware of the implications of submitting his resignation; and he acknowledges that he could not successfully defend himself on the merits against the charges which are comprehended by the petition in this proceeding. Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>circumstances herein, respondent\u2019s resignation as a member of the Bar is accepted and directed to be filed; and it is ordered that respondent\u2019s name be struck from the roll of attorneys and counselors at law, effective forthwith.
