Order modified by deleting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>from the decretal paragraph thereof the word \"physical\u201d, and substituting therefor the word \"oral\u201d. As so modified, order affirmed, without costs or disbursements. The examination shall proceed at a time and place to be fixed in a written notice of not less than 10 days, to be given by defendant, or at such time and place as the parties may agree. Defendant\u2019s time to serve the notice is extended until 10 days after entry of the order to be made hereon. Under the circumstances of this case, defendant-appellant should have been granted leave to conduct an oral examination of plaintiff-respondent (see 22 NYCRR 675.7). Margett, J. P., Damiani, Shapiro and Titone, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
