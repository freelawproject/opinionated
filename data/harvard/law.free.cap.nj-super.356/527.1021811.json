Before trial, defendant moved for recusal of the trial judge on the ground that he had demonstrated bias against \u201cSpanish people,\u201d a group to which defendant belonged. The judge denied the motion without findings of fact or conclusions of law. Following trial, the judge found defendant guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and sentenced him. Subsequently, the judge found defendant not guilty of the last charge. Defendant appealed to the Law Division, requesting a full testimonial trial on the ground that the municipal court judge\u2019s behavior evidenced bias against \u201cSpanish people.\u201d The Law Division judge refused the request, conducted a trial <em>de novo </em>on the remaining charges, and found defendant guilty. On appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">POINT ONE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">DEFENDANT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED OF THE CHARGE OF FAILING TO KEEP TO THE RIGHT BECAUSE NO PROOF WAS OFFERED REGARDING THE STATUTORY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ROADWAY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">POINT TWO</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">DEFENDANT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED OF THE CHARGE OF DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED BECAUSE THE STATE DID NOT PROVE THE ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENSE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">POINT THREE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">A NEW TRIAL SHOULD BE CONDUCTED WHERE THE ORIGINAL TRIAL WAS TAINTED BY THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S APPEARANCE OF BIAS AGAINST THE DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">After carefully considering the record and briefs, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s first two points are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion, <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2), and we turn to the third point, which requires reversal of the convictions and remand for a plenary trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">In light of our disposition of the first two points, we will not set forth the facts bearing on those convictions other than to note that the State\u2019s case was opposed by testimony from defendant and others called on his behalf. In short, resolution of this case turned on the credibility of witnesses, and the Law Division judge accorded the usual deference to the municipal court judge\u2019s findings in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On August 23, 2000, the case was called for trial in the municipal court, and the following remarks were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My client says he wants an interpreter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">THE COURT: For what language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">MR. PEREZ: Spanish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">THE COURT: How do you know what I just said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">(No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">THE COURT: You speak English.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He \u2014 he understands English. It\u2019s not his first language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">THE COURT: When are we going to stop this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m just telling you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-15\">THE COURT: Can I go into court and say, I want a Celtic interpreter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABn\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m just telling you what he told me, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\">THE COURT: Hey, I\u2019m Irish. I want somebody who speaks Irish. That\u2019s it. The fact that I speak English, too, too bad. I want somebody who speaks Irish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATJ\">These Spanish people coming in here and saying, I want an interpreter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-17\">Well, you speak English.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-18\">So what? I want an interpreter. Somewhere, this has got to stop. So, somebody racks up $200.00 an hom- for interpreting and the guy speaks perfect English, proved by the fact that he understood exactly what you and I just said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afu-dedup-0\">Why don\u2019t you speak English, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-19\">(No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-20\">THE COURT: Why do you want an interpreter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-21\">(No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-22\">THE COURT: You did learn in a hurry, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-23\">(Laughter)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-24\">THE COURT: You\u2019ve got to give them credit. They just \u2014 he picked up on that quick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-25\">Well, I guess I better do it. I\u2019d have the ACLU and the people marching outside with signs and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-26\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I know you have an interpreter coming tonight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-27\">THE COURT: Won\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t help.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-28\">All right. We\u2019ll have an interpreter here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-29\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. You can just wait back there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-30\">COURT OFFICER: He has the $200.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-31\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s waiting for the $200.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-32\">(The Court attends to other business.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>THE COURT: All right, counselor. The case is adjourned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">THE COURT: We\u2019ll have to get an interpreter. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">COURT OFFICER: Which case is this, Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">THE COURT: This is \u2014 uh\u2014Perez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Perez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Perez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">THE COURT: Perez \u2014 Gerardo\u2014Gerardo Perez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">Thereafter, defendant moved in writing for the judge to recuse himself for showing bias against defendant. At the beginning of the trial, which occurred on December 27, 2000, defendant\u2019s counsel noted that the judge had denied the motion, apparently by a written order. No reasons were placed on the record for the denial. At the conclusion of the municipal court trial, this exchange occurred during sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-15\">MR. PEREZ (through Interpreter): I pay you $500.00 today and then what? And then 15 days later I have to pay you $150.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to punch this guy out before I get out of here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">When the case was heard in the Law Division, the judge made these comments with respect to defendant\u2019s recusal argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-18\">Very frankly, after reading several appeals from that Court I can understand how one could feel that the Judge was biased. However, from the transcripts it appears that the Judge\u2019s usual demeanor was mistakenly taken for bias, being bias against the defendant. This is not true. I would suggest that you don\u2019t confuse a Judge with a very sarcastic demeanor with one who is biased. I think he gave your client a fair trial, but that\u2019s the way he is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b561-20\">Under our rules, a judge \u201cshall be disqualified if, among other things, there is \u201cany ... reason which might preclude a fair and unbiased hearing and judgment, or which might reasonably lead counsel or the parties to believe so. <em>R. </em>1:12\u20141(f). In <em>State v. Marshall, 148 N.J. </em>89, 279, 690 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>850, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>140, 139 L.Ed.2d 88 (1997), the Court put it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-21\">We ... acknowledge that it is not necessary to prove actual prejudice on the part of the court, and that the mere appearance of bias may require disqualification. <em>R. </em>1:12-1(f). However, before the court may be disqualified on the ground of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>appearance of bias, the belief that the proceedings were unfair must be objectively reasonable. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In <em>State v. Roberts, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>286, 220 A.2d 416 (1966), the Court was called on to review a murder conviction which was fully supported by the evidence on a record which contained \u201cnot a trace of prejudice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 290, 220 A.2d 416, with one possible exception, the possibility that on one occasion, during voir dire of a juror who did not sit on the case, the trial judge uttered the word \u201cNigger,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 288, 220 A.2d 416. In a post-trial submission, defendant claimed that \u201che was so cut by the word that he despaired of a fair trial and lost his capacity to testify with conviction and effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 220 A.2d 416. The stenographer attested to the accuracy of the record, and the trial judge certified that he was \u201cmorally certain that [he] did not utter the offensive word contained in the quoted portion of the stenographer\u2019s transcript.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 220 A.2d 416. Without resolving whether the word had actually even been used, the Court reversed and remanded for a new trial for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">[W]e are in an area of great current sensitivity, and no matter how the courts deal with the issue, there may remain a doubt that the issue was handled objectively. For this reason, and although we are satisfied justice was done, we conclude, with much reluctance, that the image of justice would be better served by a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">[Id. at 291, 220 A.2d 416.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">There was substantial evidence in this case that defendant understood and spoke English, even though it was not his first language. Nonetheless, the judge decided that defendant was entitled to an interpreter. The problem is that he did so in a manner that a reasonable person would take as reflecting bias. We note in particular these statements cited above: \u201cWhen are we going to stop this.\u201d \u201cThese Spanish people coming in here and saying, I want an interpreter.\u201d \u201cSomewhere this has got to stop.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give them credit. They just \u2014 \u201d \u2018Well, I guess I better do it. I\u2019d have the ACLU and the people marching outside with signs and so forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Those comments were not addressed alone to whether defendant was himself misleading the court; rather, they lumped him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>together with an identifiable minority against whom the judge was expressing anger, and they suggested that the judge\u2019s lack of belief in the validity of defendant\u2019s request was based, at least in part, on the supposed improper conduct of the minority group to which he belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Our State Constitution provides, \u201cNo person shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil ... right, nor be discriminated against in the exercise of any civil ... right, ... because of ... race, color, ancestry or national origin.\u201d <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. 1, \u00b6 5. Moreover, group libel, which includes defamation of a class of persons based on those constitutional categories, mars civil discourse, and certainly is reprehensible in the halls of justice. <em>Cf. State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 524-32, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986). The circumstances of this case are analogous to those described in <em>Roberts, supra, </em>where there was doubt as to what the judge actually said. Here, we know precisely what the judge said, and as in <em>Roberts, </em>his remarks constituted an expression of bias toward a constitutionally protected minority group. We need not accept the Law Division judge\u2019s contrary finding because it is unsupported by the evidence. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 470-71, 724 A.2d 234 (1999). A trial <em>due novo </em>on the record, based on acceptance of the credibility determinations of a judge who ought to have recused himself, is inconsistent \"with due process. Therefore, we believe that the Law Division judge erred in denying defendant\u2019s request for a plenary trial. On remand, the case should either be tried anew in the Law Division or remanded for trial before another municipal court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
