Plaintiff argues that the orders must be \u201cvacated\u201d because the principle of <em>res ipsa loqui-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>tur </em>and the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d doctrine excuse the need for an affidavit, and because no affidavit \u201cis needed in cases where the issues are intentional torts such as outrage, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation and lack of informed consent.\u201d We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The facts on which plaintiff relies includes the following. On October 12,1998, plaintiff\u2019s wife, Dolores Risko (hereinafter \u201cdecedent\u201d) was admitted to the defendant Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital with a diagnosis of right carotid stenosis, an abnormal narrowing of the carotid artery. She was sixty-four years old and had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. On October 16, 1998, defendant Dr. Rocco Ciocca performed a right carotid endarterectomy with assistance from defendants Doctors Dominick Boli and Todd Stefan. Decedent was discharged on October 19,1998. The discharge summary, dictated by Boli, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">The patient is being discharged to home today on 10/19/98 with instructions to followup with Dr. Ciocca in one week, and with Dr. Weinberg as well, as an outpatient. Stool guaiacs were done which revealed no evidence of blood in the stool.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Defendant Frederick Weinberg was decedent\u2019s outpatient cardiologist who referred her for the surgery, but he did not participate in performing the endarterectomy. It is alleged that Weinberg was \u201cthe attending physician for the [decedent] in the hospitalization from 10/12/98-10/19/98 where she was allowed to be discharged with a leaking endarterectomy.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that the \u201cleaking endarterectomy\u201d' was the cause of decedent\u2019s \u201cstroke and subsequent history\u201d resulting in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Within hours of her discharge on October 19, 1998, decedent called for an ambulance when her neck began to swell, and on the way to the hospital she went into cardiac arrest. At the hospital defendant Dr. J. Gerard Crowley reopened the site of the endar-terectomy and evacuated an \u201cexpanding hematoma,\u201d which, according to the operative report, was not present at the time of her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>After the procedure was completed, decedent was taken to the \u201csurgical intensive care unit where she remained for the next month.\u201d At some time during the stay she suffered a \u201cright hemispheric stroke.\u201d She gradually improved and was discharged \u201cto rehab\u201d on December 4, 1998. While she was readmitted on October 19 for \u201chematoma status post carotid endarterectomy,\u201d her diagnosis at the time of discharge was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Hematoma, status post carotid endarterectomy. Leaking carotid endarterectomy. Right neck hematoma. Respiratory failure. Subendocardial infarction. Central nervous system complications. Right parieto-occipital cerebrovascular accident. Congestive heart failure. Hypertension. Temporary tracheostomy. Continuous mechanical ventilation. Percutaneous gastrostomy. Reoperation for carotid en-darterectomy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Although the complaint alleged that defendants\u2019 negligence caused decedent\u2019s death, plaintiff offered no proofs about the date or circumstances of her death. In his brief on this appeal, he advises that she died on September 25,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-29 provides that the failure to file an affidavit of merit \u201cshall be deemed a failure to state a cause of action.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-29. In <em>Hubbard v. Reed, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>387, 774 A.2d 495 (2001), the Supreme Court held that no affidavit of merit was required in a case in which a jury could use \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d to decide whether the defendant was negligent. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96, 774 A.2d 495. The Court reasoned that the affidavit mandate was adopted to insure that a plaintiff would be able to produce expert testimony that the defendant breached a duty of care before compelling the doctor to defend. <em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 774 A.2d 495. But when the duty of care is obvious to a layperson, there is no need for expert testimony and hence no need for an affidavit of merit. <em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 774 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">In <em>Hubbard </em>the alleged malpractice was a dentist\u2019s pulling the wrong tooth. The Court observed that \u201c[i]t has long been settled that pulling the wrong tooth is negligent as a matter of common knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 774 A.2d 495. Thus, because the plaintiffs would not have to present expert evidence at trial to establish the defendant\u2019s negligence, the Court held that plaintiffs \u201care not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>required to obtain an expert\u2019s affidavit prior to trial to demonstrate that their claim has threshold merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-97, 774 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Writing for the Court, the Chief Justice cautioned, however, that the common-knowledge exception should be narrowly construed \u201cto avoid non-compliance with the statute\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">Indeed, the wise course of action in all malpractice cases would be for plaintiffs to provide affidavits even when they do not intend to rely on expert testimony at trial. In most such cases, expert testimony will be required to establish both a standard of care and breach of that standard by the defendant, and a plaintiff who fails to present testimony could be subject to involuntary dismissal pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">[Id. at 397, 774 A.2d 495.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\"><em>Accord, Palanque v. Lambert-Woolley, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>398, 407, 774 A.2d 501 (2001), in which no affidavit of merit was required because of the admitted \u201cmistaken reading of [a] laboratory report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The UMDNJ defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was granted on May 25, 2001. On June 21, 2001, the Court decided <em>Hubbard </em>and <em>Palanque. </em>Dr. Weinberg\u2019s motion was granted on June 22, 2001. Thereafter, plaintiff moved for reconsideration, arguing that no affidavit was required under the common-knowledge exception as well as the theory of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>The motion judge denied the application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">As I said, I\u2019ve indicated the hemotomin [sic] complexities involved and its development is not a subject of a lay jury\u2019s [sic] common knowledge. It\u2019s evidenced that the explanation of the cause or the development of the hemotomin [sic] is not a suitable matter for a layman to opine from without the guidance of expert testimony. And it was not within the common knowledge of a jury as plaintiff asserts. The facts of this case are different from a simple mistake of pulling the wrong teeth and the mistake of misreading the results of a pregnancy test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">The issue in this case had to deal with the cause and the complexities involved in the operative procedures performed on the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff can isolate the alleged medical neg \u2014 negligence of the defendants herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">It is obvious that an expert is necessary to discuss the causes and the complexities involved in the plaintiff\u2019s medical case. A medical malpractice complaint of plaintiff alleges that the defendant\u2019s [sic] herein were negligent in applying the medical knowledge in the operative procedure which has nothing to do with common knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>This case is clearly distinguishable from the HUBBARD and PALANQUE ... cases where the negligent acts were a simple misreading of the test results and an extraction of the wrong tooth. Both of those events clearly fall within the jury\u2019s common knowledge and outside the need for expert testimony. [Some phonetic spelling corrected.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We agree and affirm the judgment substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Douglas T. Hague in his oral opinion of August 3, 2001, as supplemented herein. Expert testimony was needed to show defendant-doctors breached a duty of care and proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Plaintiff also argues that no affidavit of merit is required in a case like this in which negligence may be presumed under the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>He reasons that a hospital\u2019s discharge of a patient who is bleeding bespeaks negligence, that some one or more of the defendants must be responsible for the consequences, and that no expert testimony would be required to prove a breach of a standard of care because the burden would be upon defendants to show lack of culpability. However, in <em>Hubbard, </em>the Court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">Because we hold today that a plaintiff in a common knowledge case is not required to file an affidavit of merit, we find it unnecessary to resolve whether a separate exception exists in respect of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine. We note, however, that in a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>action, the jury is allowed to infer a defendant\u2019s negligence <em>\u201c </em>\u2018where (a) the occurrence itself ordinarily bespeaks negligence; (b) the instrumentality was within the defendant\u2019s exclusive control; and (c) there is no indication in the circumstances that the injury was the result of the plaintiffs own voluntary act or neglect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 525, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981) (quoting <em>Bornstein v. Metropolitan Bottling Co., </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>263, 269, 139 A.2d 404 (1958)). It may be necessary for a plaintiff in such actions to present \u201cexpert testimony to the effect that the medical community recognizes that an event does not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 527, 435 A.2d 1150,, in order to meet the first prong of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>test. An affidavit of merit would be required in those eases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\"><em>[Hubbard, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 391 n. 1, 774 A.2d 495.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Given this recent statement of the Court, albeit by <em>dictum </em>in a footnote, we are satisfied that an affidavit of merit is required in a <em>res ipsa </em>case, unless the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d doctrine is also applicable. <em>Cf. Estate of Sinclair v. Roth, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>4, 15 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>3, 811 A.2d 460 (App.Div.2002) (duty of an intermediate appellate court of \u201censuring fidelity to existing law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Finally, plaintiff maintains that no affidavit of merit is required in a case asserting intentional torts, and he further claims that his pleadings below raised genuine issues of material fact as to several \u201cintentional torts such as outrage, fraud, deceit [and] misrepresentation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, as Justice Zazzali has recently stated for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[W]hen presented with a tort or contract claim asserted against a professional specified in the statute, rather than focusing on whether the claim is denominated as tort or contract, attorneys and courts should determine if the claim\u2019s underlying factual allegations require proof of a deviation from the professional standard of care applicable to that specific profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\"><em>[Couri v. Gardner, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>328, 340, 801 A.2d 1134 (2002).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Similarly, the label of the type of tort should not control. If \u201cproof of a deviation from the professional standard of care for [the] specific profession ... is required, an affidavit of merit shall be mandatory for that claim, unless either the statutory, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-28, or common knowledge exceptions apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 801 A.2d 1134. As no exception is applicable in this case, which essentially deals with a claimed deviation in the standard of care, an affidavit of merit was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> Plaintiff includes \"lack of informed consent\u201d in the list, although we have held an affidavit of merit is required as a prerequisite to an action on that theory. <em>See Darwin v. Gooberman, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 480-81, 772 A.2d 399 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>609, 782 A.2d 426 (2001), abrogated in part by <em>Couri v. Gardner, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>328, 801 A.2d 1134 (2002). <em>See also Howard v. University of Medicine &amp; Dentistry, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>537, 800 A.2d 73 (2002), misrepresentation may give rise to lack of informed consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
