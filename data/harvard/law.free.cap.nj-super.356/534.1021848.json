Custody of children. A person, including a parent, guardian or other lawful custodian, is guilty of interference with custody if he: ... (3) After being served with process or having actual knowledge of an action affecting the protective services needs of a child pursuant to Title 9 of the Revised Statutes in an action affecting custody, but prior to the issuance of a temporary or final order determining custody rights of a minor child, takes, detains, entices or conceals the child within or outside the State for the purpose of evading the jurisdiction of the courts of this State____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The facts were disputed at trial, but for present purposes we need only summarize the State\u2019s proofs. The Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) had become aware that defendant had recently given birth to a boy on January 6 or <em>1, </em>2000. Defendant had given birth out-of-state and then returned to New Jersey. Based upon the agency\u2019s prior dealings with defendant, some information that the infant had experienced a small weight loss, and the agency\u2019s belief that defendant was a flight risk, DYFS decided it would exercise its authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.29 and take the infant from defendant without a court order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The problem from the agency\u2019s point of view was that DYFS did not know where to find the infant. DYFS, therefore, devised a plan to confront defendant and obtain information about the infant, who was then approximately six weeks old. At least a week in advance, DYFS knew that defendant planned a birthday lunch at a local restaurant on Friday, February 25, 2000, for one of her other children, a daughter. That child was already in DYFS custody and was accompanied to the lunch by a DYFS employee assigned to the Adoption Resource Clinic. During the course of this birthday lunch, two DYFS employees and several local police officers confronted defendant and sought the whereabouts of the infant boy. Defendant denied having a newborn child. At some point defendant was handed a two-page form entitled \u201cNOTICE OF EMERGENCY REMOVAL PURSUANT TO N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.29 and 9:6-8.30 WITHOUT COURT ORDER.\u201d This notice set forth defendant\u2019s name and address and went on to state that \u201cofficial notice\u201d was being given that DYFS \u201chas removed A D [the name of the child was spelled out] from your home and placed him in protective custody in foster care.\u201d The notice went on to state that defendant should appear at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cJuvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Monmouth County\u201d at 2:30 p.m. on February 28, 2000, \u201cat which time a hearing will take place.\u201d The second page of the notice told defendant she had a right to legal representation. The final paragraph read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">The Division of Youth and Family Services is required by law to conduct an investigation of the circumstances leading to and resulting in the child\u2019s injury or condition and on the basis of that investigation will determine' whether further action is warranted to ensure the child\u2019s safety. We would greatly appreciate your cooperation with this agency during the course of the investigation and assure you that we will take every measure possible to protect you and the child in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The notice closed \u201cVery truly yours\u201d and was signed by a DYFS caseworker. Throughout the trial this notice was referred to as a \u201cDOD letter.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">After receiving this notice in the restaurant, defendant continued to deny the existence of her infant son. In addition to the notice, defendant was told verbally by the police and DYFS workers that she was obligated to reveal the whereabouts of the child. Defendant refused to provide the requested information, was arrested and taken to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In fact, the infant was being cared for at the time by defendant\u2019s neighbor, Sharon Chisolm, a certified \u201cFamily Child Care Provider.\u201d Chisolm testified that the infant was a \u201cbeautiful little boy that was well, very well cared for.\u201d When, however, defendant did not return to pick up her son, because defendant was in police custody, Chisolm could find no other person to retrieve the child and eventually called the police. The police, in turn, notified DYFS which then took custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Defendant raises several issues on appeal. We find three of them meritorious. Throughout the litigation there was a running dialogue about whether the DOD letter handed to defendant constituted \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-4a(3). The trial judge ultimately concluded as a matter of law that the letter was process within the meaning of the statute. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>that the issue was a question of law, not a question of fact, but we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The term \u201cprocess\u201d is undefined in the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice. We are guided initially by the canon of statutory construction that cautions us to strictly construe a criminal statute. If there is an ambiguity in the statute, or if more than one reasonable interpretation may be made, then construction is drawn against the State. <em>State v. Valentin, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>14, 17-18, 519 A.2d 322 (1987); <em>State v. Marchiani, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 545, 765 A.2d 765 (App.Div.2001); <em>see State v. Austin, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 489, 762 A.2d 1052 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The criminal statute speaks of \u201cbeing served with process or having actual knowledge of an action affecting the protective services needs of a child pursuant to Title 9....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-4a(3). Obviously, the criminal statute is referencing civil actions. Process in that context has a well understood, if not perfectly defined, meaning. It is typically that which compels a party to appear in court. Usually process will issue from a court or through counsel with the authority of the court. Most commonly, process consists of a summons, an order to show cause, a court order, a subpoena, a warrant, or even a writ. <em>Williams v. Bd. of Educ., </em>124 <em>N.J.L. </em>380, 12 A.2d 127 (Sup.Ct.1940); <em>In re Martin, </em>86 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>265, 273-274, 98 A. 510 (Ch.1916); <em>R. </em>5:4-1; <em>R. </em>4:52-1(b); <em>R. </em>4:67-1. While some cases speak of \u201cnotice\u201d as constituting process, in no case have we found a notice akin to the DOD letter that fits within any definition of process. <em>See Stevens v. Associated Mortgage Co. of N.J., </em>107 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>297, 152 A. 461 (Ch.1930); <em>Gondas v. Gondas, </em>99 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>473, 134 A. 615 (Ch. 1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The notice drafted by DYFS was apparently in response to the language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.30, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">The division when informed that there has been an emergency removal of a child from his home without court order shall make every reasonable effort to communicate immediately with the child\u2019s parent or guardian that such emergency removal has been made and the location of the facility to which the child has been taken, and advise the parent or guardian to appear in the appropriate Superior Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Chancery Division, Family Part on the next court day. The division shall also advise the party making the removal to appear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">This , statute requires no particular form of notice and can be complied with verbally or in writing. By regulation the Department of Human Services requires that written notice be given. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129A-2.7(d). We do not believe this notice falls within the definition of process as intended by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-4. First, under the Title 9 statutes proper use of the DOD letter occurs only after a child is removed from his home and is in the custody of DYFS, the police, a physician, or probation officer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.29 and 8.30. A court appearance is anticipated for the next court day. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.30. These are hardly circumstances where,, in the words of the criminal statute, a parent is likely to \u201ctake, detain, entice or conceal\u201d a child to evade jurisdiction of the court. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:13-4a(3). When a DOD letter is properly used the child is no longer within the parent\u2019s physical control.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The criminal statute apparently contemplates a situation where the parent has physical custody of the child and then, after being served with process or learning of a pending action, attempts to thwart the court proceeding by preventing access to the child. The criminal statute is not intended to encompass a self-styled agency form which, when properly used, does not even reach the parent until after the child is in custody. The criminal statute certainly does not encompass the misuse of such a form as in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Here, defendant\u2019s child had not been taken into protective custody when the DOD letter was presented to defendant. DYFS was using the letter not to advise of action taken in compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.29, but rather, to put itself in the position to act under that statute if and when the child was located. Had the babysitter not called the police the child might not have been found, and the direction in the letter that defendant should appear in court on February 28, 2000 would then have been without factual or legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-4a(3) provides for an alternative mode of violation. If a person has \u201cactual knowledge of an action affecting the protective services needs of a child pursuant to Title 9 ... in an action affecting custody\u201d and then commits the prohibited acts, the offense is committed regardless of whether process has been served. We need not determine whether the facts presented to the jury in this case would have supported a conviction on this alternative ground. Once the court incorrectly instructed that the DOD letter was process as a matter of law, the reversible error is not cured by a contention that the jury actually used the alternative basis in finding guilt. Although the jury was instructed that the State had to prove that defendant \u201cacted after being served with process or having actual knowledge of an action affecting the protective services ... needs of a child\u201d the verdict sheet was worded only in terms of service of process. That said, it is highly unlikely that the statute when referring to \u201cactual knowledge of an action\u201d intends to include potential, future actions as well as present pending actions. Again, we note that it was only fortuitous that DYFS located the infant and was able to go forward with an action at all. Had the child not been located we doubt defendant\u2019s knowledge of DYFS\u2019s future intent would constitute \u201cknowledge of an action\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-4a(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The State having failed to prove the essential elements of the crime charged, defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed and a judgment of acquittal entered. We nevertheless address two additional issues which also constitute reversible error. Defendant argues that evidence of her prior bad acts was admitted into evidence in violation of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). The evidence in question consisted of references to DYFS\u2019s dealings with defendant in relation to defendant\u2019s other children. The trial judge had initially ruled, quite properly, that \u201cthe prosecutor can\u2019t go into any real past history of this defendant with the Division on his direct case. He can give a background for entry of this DOD letter ... but her past experience with the Division is probably not relevant and it\u2019s certainly highly prejudicial.\u201d The court then acknowledged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>such evidence might constitute proper rebuttal, but stating \u201cI have to see exactly where the defense goes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Following this ruling, the attorneys opened to the jury. Defense counsel gave a very brief and, in our view, unremarkable opening statement which the prosecutor interpreted as \u201copening the door for me to educate the jury as to why DYFS acted in the manner that it <em>did\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., the history of the relationship between defendant and DYFS. The trial court agreed and gave the prosecutor permission over defense counsel\u2019s objection to go into the history of defendant and DYFS in a \u201ctempered\u201d manner because \u201cit\u2019s so prejudicial.\u201d Based on this ruling, evidence was presented to the jury that would otherwise have been prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">No reported decision in New Jersey has spoken to the question of whether opening remarks of counsel can \u201copen the door\u201d to rebuttal evidence by the opposing party. The State here urges adoption of a rule allowing such rebuttal testimony. It cites us to numerous out-of-state cases which, in varying factual contexts, have concluded that counsel\u2019s opening statement may very well allow an evidential response from the other side. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chavez, </em>229 F.3d 946, 952 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>98 F.3d 347, 350 (8th Cir.1996); <em>Cole v. Alaska, </em>754 P.2d 752, 756 (Alaska Ct.App.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Defendant, on the other hand, cites us to those out-of-state decisions which hold that the opening statements of counsel are not evidential and do not call for or justify an evidential response. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tomaiolo, </em>249 F.2d 683, 689 (2d Cir.1957); <em>West Virginia v. Richards, </em>190 <em>W.Va. </em>299, 438 S.E.2d 331, 335 (1993); <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>31 <em>Va.App. </em>643, 525 <em>S.E.2d </em>72, 75 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">We believe the better approach is that espoused by defendant, particularly in the context of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). Our courts have consistently emphasized and attempted to guard against the prejudice that so readily flows from the misuse of \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts.\u201d <em>Ibid.; State v. Hernandez, </em>170 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>N.J. </em>106, 119, 784 A.2d 1225 (2001); <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 338, 605 A.2d 230 (1992); <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 265-266, 524 A.2d 188 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>947, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2433, <em>124 L.Ed.2d </em>653 (1993); <em>State v. Engel, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 373, 592 A.2d 572 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>393, 614 A.2d 616 (1991). Opening statements are not evidential and should not be responded to by \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence. If improper remarks are made by counsel, the remedy lies in a curative instruction to the jury or, if absolutely necessary, a mistrial. <em>State v. Hawk, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 281, 743 A.2d 325 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Perez, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 486-487, 528 A.2d 56 (App.Div.1987). In our view, an improper or erroneous statement made on opening is not properly corrected by allowing the introduction of prejudicial evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Finally, we address as plain error part-of the instructions given to the jury. The statute defendant was charged with violating refers at one point to an \u201caction affecting the protective services needs of a child pursuant to Title 9____\u201d Although a detailed explanation of \u201cprotective services needs\u201d was not necessary on the facts as presented, the trial judge instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">Protective services needs means when the parents of any minor child or the parent or other person having the actual care and custody of any minor child are grossly immoral or unfit to be entrusted with the care and education of the child or shall neglect to provide the child with proper protection, maintenance and education or they are of such vicious, careless, or dissolute habits as to endanger the welfare of a child or to make the child a public charge or likely to be a public charge, it shall be lawful for any person interested in the welfare of such child to institute an action in Superior Court Chancery Division family part in the county where such minor child is residing for the purpose of having the child brought before the Court and for the further relief provided by this chapter the Court may proceed in an action in summary manner or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">This portion of the charge was not discussed during the court\u2019s charge conference with counsel. The trial judge never said where he found this definition of \u201cprotective services needs.\u2019-\u2019 It is a term that is undefined in the Code of Criminal Justice and undefined in Title 9. The language used by the trial judge appears almost verbatim in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-9, but not as a definition per se of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201cprotective services needs.\u201d The Chapter 2 language describes certain parental character or conduct which allows initiation of court action by \u201cany person interested\u201d in the child\u2019s welfare. It is not the language used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.28 or 8.29, although the terminology in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-9 may certainly describe a form of \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d or \u201cimminent danger\u201d as those terms appear in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.28 and 8.29. In the present case, however, there was no evidence of defendant\u2019s deficiencies as a parent other than the infant\u2019s \u201csmall\u201d weight loss which was completely unexplained, and the improper references to DYFS\u2019s prior contacts with defendant. As the trial judge himself said during colloquy with counsel at the end of trial, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the danger is in this case.\u201d Neither did the jury. We do not understand why the court felt it necessary to define \u201cprotective services needs\u201d in such dramatic and emotive terms. The instruction could only have served to imply that defendant was a parent who was \u201cgrossly immoral\u201d or of \u201cvicious, careless or dissolute habits,\u201d none of which was shown by the evidence. This provocative language was factually unwarranted and legally unnecessary. It was also prejudicial. This language, when combined with the improper admission of evidence about defendant\u2019s past dealings with DYFS, took on a synergy that neither error possessed individually. The instruction constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In our view the phrase \u201cprotective services needs\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-4 is a general reference to a variety of possible circumstances within the ambit of Title 9 and, if the phrase needs to be defined for the jury, then the definition should be tailored to the particular facts of the case as those facts mesh with the appropriate section of Title 9. We note that regulations promulgated by the Department of Human Services refer to child protective services in a variety of contexts including: investigations or actions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11 and 12, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, <em>et seq. See N.J.A.C. </em>10:129A-2.1, 2.7 and 3.3(a)3; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:133C-2.5(d). The term is also used in the context of child care services, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:15-5.4 and medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>services, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129A-2.4. In <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:15-1.2 \u201cchild protective services\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">[SJerviees on behalf of any child, under age 19, considered at risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitations; or found to be abused, neglected, exploited or abandoned, as identified by the DYFS. The term, unless otherwise specified, includes services provided to children in out-of-home placements under the supervision of the DYFS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">These regulatory references illustrate the generic nature of the phrase \u201cprotective services.\u201d Absent a more specific definition in the Criminal Code, we assume the Legislature used the phrase to encompass any of the numerous Title 9 circumstances that permit third-party intervention into the parenVchild relationship for the safety and welfare of the child. When a defendant is charged with a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-4a(3), the trial court in fashioning its jury instructions must first decide if the definition of \u201cprotective services needs\u201d is in issue. If it is not, then a general reference to actions allowed by statute for the protection, safety or welfare of the child may be all that is necessary. If a more detailed explanation is required, it should be tailored to the specific facts of the case and to the specific statutory authority underpinning \u201cthe action affecting the protective services needs.\u201d That was obviously not done in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of conviction is reversed. Because it appears from the record that the State produced all available significant evidence at trial and we find no suggestion that the State has more, we remand for entry of a judgment of acquittal. <em>State v. Baker, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 143, 549 A.2d 62 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.29 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACn\">Emergency removal without court order</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>a.
