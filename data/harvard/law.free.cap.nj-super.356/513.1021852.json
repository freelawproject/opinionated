After a trial on the issues, Judge of Compensation Boyan held that the respondents were dual employers obliged to share responsibility for the award made to petitioner, and that the policy issued by Hartford Underwriters Insurance Company (Hartford) to respondent Mora was effective. Hartford appeals, arguing that the finding of dual employment was erroneous and that it cannot be held to have provided coverage to its putative insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The factual findings undergirding the dual employment determination are well supported by substantial evidence in the record and are, therefore, binding on appeal. <em>See Earl v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>155, 161, 728 A.2d 820 (1999); <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 598-99, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). The agency\u2019s expertise in applying dual employment criteria to the facts as found cannot be gainsaid. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In deciding that the Hartford policy provided coverage to Mora, Judge Boyan held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">... Hartford contend[s] that they did not have coverage on the date of the accident. Their motion papers acknowledge that a policy with number 77WZNB6977 was issued, insuring Mr. Mora with an effective date of August 5, 1995 to August 5,1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">They contend that they canceled that policy, and their records \u2014 or the computer printout \u2014 show they attempted cancellation on October 13,1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">* * * I believe that the respondent, Hartford, did not use certified mail to effectuate the cancellation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">Petitioner\u2019s side has called my attention to the case of <em>[Miney v. Baum, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 406 A.2d 234 (Law Div.1979),] dealing with coverage of an auto policy, and holding that the statutory provisions for cancellation of a policy had to be followed, even where the only thing issued was a binder and where the full procedure of certified mail had not been resorted to. Judge Yanoff ruled that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>under the circumstances, the coverage remained in effect despite the fact that there was no payment of initial premium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Here, we have a similar situation except we don\u2019t have a binder. We have an actual policy. And there was a failure of the initial premium payment, the one issued Mr. Mora. He tendered a check for $500, but it was dishonored by his bank, so Hartford never collected a penny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">However, I feel that the <em>Miney </em>case is good authority and I should follow it and hold that the policy remains in effect unless and until canceled according to the statutory procedure, by certified mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">Granted, it\u2019s a different policy, it\u2019s an auto policy in the <em>Miney </em>case, where we have a Workers\u2019 Compensation policy. But in both cases, we have insurance required to be maintained by statute, and the requirement of the statute is for the benefit of the injured party. So I think public policy considerations demanding compliance with the strict requirements for cancellation are the same, and that\u2019s another reason I think the <em>Miney </em>case should be followed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">And while there may be a harsh result from the standpoint of Hartford, to wind up with an obligation of tens of thousands of dollars in a case where they didn\u2019t get penny number one in premiums, still, I think that\u2019s what the statute calls for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">We are in substantial agreement with the logic of this rationale, and we defer to the Division\u2019s expertise in determining that the principle of <em>Miney </em>should apply to workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">The New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance Plan <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (the Plan), as presented to us, creates a program paralleling the assigned risk plan for auto insurance with which the court in <em>Miney </em>was concerned. When Hartford was designated by the Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau as Mora\u2019s carrier pursuant to the Plan, that carrier was required, upon receipt of the application and a cheek representing the premium, to issue a policy to Mora effective at 12:01 a.m. on the day following. Once that policy was issued, Hartford was obliged to comply with the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-31 in order to effect cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>In the absence of any argument that the Plan has no provenance as binding authority, we likewise respect the Division\u2019s expertise in applying it to insurance carriers by requiring compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81. A court \u201cplaces great weight on the interpretation of legislation by the administrative agency to whom its enforcement is entrusted,\u201d <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 69-70, 389 A.2d 465 (1978), unless it \u201cfinds that the rule is inconsistent with the statute it purports to interpret.\u201d <em>Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 26, 527 A.2d 843 (1987). <em>See also Mayflower Securities Co. v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973); <em>In re Union County Prosecutors, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 561, 694 A.2d 289 (App. Div.1997); <em>Lally v. Public Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>270, 273, 587 A.2d 303 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>332, 598 A.2d 890 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We are bound by Judge Boyan\u2019s findings, based upon the facts developed before him, that the required steps to effect a cancellation were not taken. <em>See Earl, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 161, 728 A.2d 820; <em>Close, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 598-99, 210 A.2d 753. We regard as unavailing Hartford\u2019s only argument on the policy-effectiveness issue that it \u201cwas not required to provide the statutory notice requirements to cancel an insurance policy because the policy was void from inception.\u201d Application of the <em>Miney </em>principle to workers\u2019 compensation negates any argument that the policy, in the circumstances found, was void from inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-11\"> The nature of the Plan as a source of legally binding authority is unclear, as was the New Jersey Workers' Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance Manual (Manual) in <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Trans American Trucking Serv., Inc., </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 618 A.2d 906 (App.Div.1993), but appellant raises no question concerning its authenticity or the binding qualities of its provisions on participants in the workers' compensation insurance industry. As with the Manual, the Plan does not appear in the New Jersey Administrative Code as a promulgated rule or regulation. <em>See id. </em>at 319-20 n. 3, 618 A.2d 906.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
