It is contended by the defendant that this avoids the policy as a matter of law. We think not. This under the evidence was a question of fact for the jury, and it was not error for the trial court not to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant!</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The policy of insurance states \u201cthe amount of insurance twenty-eight hundred dollars ($3,800).\u201d The trial judge treated this as a valued policy and. directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of $3,800. There was no evidence as to the value of the stolen car. This we think was error. <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Camden Mutual Insurance Co., </em>25 <em>N. J. L. </em>506; <em>Savarere </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Insurance Co. (New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals), </em>March 3d, 1934 (No. 56). As the only question with reapect to which the judgment is found to be wrong is the measure of damages, the new trial will be limited thereto. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Society, &amp;c., 91 L. </em>310. The judgment is reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded, but limited to the question of damages only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
