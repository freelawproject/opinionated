It appears that it has been the invariable practice of the board to grant the permits. Since the 1st day of January, 1924, more than thirty permits of the character applied fox by the relator have been granted by the board. The relator having complied with all the requirements pertaining to a proper application for a permit, and no sound legal reason having been furnished by the respondents why such permit should bq denied to the relator, we have.concluded that a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>should issue against-the respondents for the issuance of a permit to the relator for the erection of a motor vehicle, gasoline and oil station on its propertjr, according to the plans and specifications submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
