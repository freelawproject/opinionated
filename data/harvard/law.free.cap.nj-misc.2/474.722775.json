As to most of them, it is.clear that they constitute no violation of any statute or ordinance, and, as to those which conceivably do-, there is nothing to show what statute or ordinance has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">It is therefore certain that the conviction cannot stand. It will be set aside, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
