Tt is sufficient to say that we are not satisfied that the relator is a stockholder, the evidence upon that topic being in serious conflict. Moreover, wo are not satisfied from the evidence that the application is made in good faith and for a proper purpose. In such posture of the proofs we are not justified m granting a writ of <em>mandamus. Bruning </em>v. <em>Hoboken Printing and Publishing Co., </em>67 <em>N. J. L. </em>119.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">'Fhe writ will be denied, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
