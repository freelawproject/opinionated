The plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Carlo Rossi, had been employed as a track laborer there for some time. He was killed by a draft of three freight cars, which came down a gravity incline. The. trial resulted in a verdigt for the plaintiff of $5,000. The defendant obtained a rule and writes down eight reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>a new trial. It is argued that the evidence did not justify the submission of defendant\u2019s liability to tbe jury. This, we think, is not so. Questions of fact were involved, hence we cannot disturb the verdict on that ground. Next, it is urged the verdict is excessive and not justified by the evidence. Our reading of the testimony leads us to. the same conclusion. The deceased had a wife and daughter living in Italy. He made remittances to his wife at various times of small amounts. We think the verdict should be reduced to three tlious. - \u2019 dollars ($3,000), and if the plaintiff will remit the excess the judgment <em>may </em>stand for three thousand dollars. ($3,000), otherwise the rude will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
