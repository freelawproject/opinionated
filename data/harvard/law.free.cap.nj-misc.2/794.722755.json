The defendant\u2019s testimony was- to the effect that he was sent by Patsy Rampino to get the money from the plaintiff for him, Rampino, and that he assumed no personal responsibility for the repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">As there was testimony which would support a finding that the defendant borrowed the money and agreed to repay the sum so borrowed to the plaintiff, we cannot properly disturb the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
