The trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for $2,500. Thereupon a rule to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside was granted by the trial judge, reserving excejitions. The defendant wrote down nine reasons for a new trial, and upon the defendant\u2019s counter-claim two reasons. When discharging the rule, the record shows, at page 260, that Judge Newman, the trial judge, in a memorandum filed by him, considered all these reasons, and .reduced the verdict to $1,500. On the appeal the defendant filed eighteen grounds of appeal, which are argued in the brief under two heads, point one and point two-. These were considered with the reasons and acted upon by Judge Newman on the rirle to show cause. This disposes of the case on appeal under the case of <em>Faragasso </em>v. <em>Introcasso, </em>121 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>773, which holds the Supreme Court cannot hear and determine the validity of exceptions reserved to a verdict, after they have been considered and determined by the trial court on the rule to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside. So, too, <em>Goeckel </em>v. <em>Erie H. R. Co., No. </em>18, <em>November Term Supreme Court, </em>1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
