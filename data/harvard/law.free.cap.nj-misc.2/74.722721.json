M. S. HOLDING CORPORATION, RELATOR, v. FRANK HAGUE, JOHN SAUL, A. HARRY MOORE, MICHAEL I. FAGEN AND WILLIAM B.

The property seems to be zoned for business purposes and is covered by section 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>and its provisions do not exclude the building in question. Paragraph 8 o\u00ed section 3 does not apply to the relator because the garage is not within one hundred and fifty feet of any institution enumerated, nor are any of the institutions enumerated within the intersecting streets on which relator\u2019s property exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The demurrer will be overruled and judgment given for the relator, with costs, and peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
