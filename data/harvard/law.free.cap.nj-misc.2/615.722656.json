It is incumbent upon the plaintiff to make out this case by a preponderance of the evidence, and that is as outlined before. And if you don\u2019t find by a preponderance of the evidence as above outlined your verdict shall be for the defendant. If you find for the plaintiff you shall assess his damages at forty per cent, of $840, which is $311.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Mathematically this is incorrect, but as $25 had been credited on account, the amount stated was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">It is to be observed that an exception was taken to the latter part of the court\u2019s charge, arid to consider such detached portion of the charge, without heeding to what was said in its natural connection immediately preceding, would be not only contrary to all well-established legal precedents, but eminently unfair and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">It is therefore quite obvious that under the instruction given by the court the dispute as to the sale of plaintiff\u2019s compensation was left to the jury for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">A plain reading of the testimony demonstrates the accuracy of what the court said on the subject. The plaintiff and two witnesses testified that the contract between the defendant and the salesman was that if a salesman brought in either tenant or landlord he would be entitled to forty per cent, of the commission that the defendant received. The defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that only ten per cent, would go to ilie salesman in that event. Because the court did not charge that if the jury believed the defendant and its witnesses as to the scale of compensation, the plaintiff\u2019s damages should he assessed at ten per cent, instead of forty per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>cent.; that, therefore, the jury was deprived of passing upon a proposition essential to defendant\u2019s defense. The complete answer to this contention is that the defendant\u2019s counsel made no request to this court so to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">It is no longer a debatable question in this state that, unless there is a request to charge upon a particular point, error is not assignable, because the trial judge may have omitted to charge on that point. The omission to state any legal proinciple which my be pertinent or applicable to the case affords in itself no ground for reversal. <em>Leiferant </em>v. <em>Progressive Agency, Inc., </em>120 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>26.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The second and only other reason urged for a reversal is based on the refusal of the trial judge to charge: \u201cThere was no consideration for the promise made by either Leslie or Edward Blau [if any such promises was made] to pay commissions that might accrue in the future on deals in which Bubin had worked. Hence, no recovery for the plaintiff can be based on that promise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We think this request was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">It appears from the testimony that at the request of the defendant corporation the plaintiff having entered into an agreement for forty per cent, commission, turned in the leads and acquainted the defendant with the negotiations for the leasing of the property in question to the Cornell cafeteria. It may very well be that he could have turned over this matter to some other real estate company if he had chosen to do so, but that fact does not detract from the transaction the element of consideration to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">We have reached the conclusion that there was proof of ample consideration to support the agreement for the payment of commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
