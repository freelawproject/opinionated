He appeared at the hearing without process and voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the recorder, and made a statement at the hearing. He cannot now contend that he was not legally summoned to attend. <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Stephany, </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>171.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">He contests the legality of the record in certain formal particulars, which he contends are not a compliance with the act. It is to be observed, however, that at the hearing his answer to the charge was a simple denial \u201cstating that his car was in the garage all night.\u201d He, therefore, did not contest the correctness in fact or in law of the complaint, but submitted himself to the jurisdiction upon the mere .question of identity. Against this <em>alibi </em>was presented the oath of the officer with the number of the car as well as the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that such car was the defendant\u2019s property. The defendant now insists he was not driving or using the car at the time. This situation involves an inquiry into whether he was heard upon that question. To relieve the situation of all doubt upon that subject, I shall open the conviction for the purpose of giving the defendant an opportunity to present his defense. The record will be remitted to the recorder for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
