L. </em>1921.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ6\">Relator contends that under the provisions of chapter 161 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1923) he is entitled to the license applied for without submitting to an examination or furnishing proof of good moral character.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Chapter 136 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1921) is a supplement to an act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery, to license physicians and surgeons, and to punish persons violating the provisions thereof,\u201d and section eleven (11) thereof repeals an act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the practice of chiropractic,\u201d approved March 3d, 1920. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1920, <em>ch. </em>4.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">Chapter 161 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1923) is an amendment of chapter 136 <em>(Pamph.
