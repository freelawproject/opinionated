The trial resulted in a verdict for the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The plaintiff obtained a rule to show cause and writes down twelve reasons for a new trial. The case is one wholly of-fact. It seems to turn upon two' <em>points </em>\u2014 first, had William Garrow Fisher, chairman of the board of directors of the defendant company, power to act, and if not, <em>second, </em>did the company ratify his acts, and this point grows out of a meeting between a Mr. Horowitz representing the plaintiff and a Mr. Gillette representing the defendant. These two questions were submitted to the jury by the trial judge as questions of fact. We see no reason why the findings of the jury should be disturbed. Eeasons eight to twelve, inclusive, are criticisms of the action of the trial court. While they are the subject of just criticism and cannot be approved, we cannot say, however, they prejudiced the plaintiff's case before the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The rule to show cause is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
