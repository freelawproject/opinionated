On November 30tb, 1923, an action was commenced by the said John Mendlovitz against the makers of the note, the present defendants-appellees, in the Perth Amboy District Court, to recover the moneys due on the note due July 10th, 1923, which action is ease No. 16999 in tiie Perth Amboy District Court files. Said note was duly protested, has not been paid, and is the second of the notes above referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201cThat the defendant\u2019s attorney moved that a judgment be rendered for the defendant on the ground that the notes mentioned were given in payment of one sale or transaction, and that the action on the note in question was barred because it become due on July 10th, 1923, which was at a time prior to the commencement of the action on the note due June 11, 1923, upon which action was instituted on July 24th, 1923. and on which judgment was recovered on November 26th. 1923. That the judge held that as the two notes were due before July 24th. 1923, and were given in payment (together with one other note) of one bill of goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>or transaction, that the plaintiff in suing on each note separately was splitting the original cause of action and was barfed from bringing suit on the second note, since \u201call claims or causes of action arising out of the same transaction or contract must be included in one suit, or all that are not so included will be deemed to be waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The trial judge fell into error. He applied a familiar legal rule to a state of facts which did come within the scope of the rule. We are not concerned with the proposition whether or not the vendors of the goods were entitled to sue the vendee on each separate note given in the transaction of the sale, even though all of the notes were due at the time the first note was sued upon, because no such case is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">On what sound legal theory an \u201cinnocent <em>bona fide </em>holder for value,\u201d as was the plaintiff, who purchased the three notes before maturity, can properly have impressed upon him a legal obligation which primarily rested upon the original holders of the notes arising out of the single sale of goods by them to the vendee, who executed the three notes in question, has not been demonstrated. Whatever majr have been the legal situation as existing between the original holders of the notes, we are of the opinion that the three notes constituted three separate and distinct obligations so far as the plaintiff, the purchaser of the notes, was concerned, and upon which he could properly maintain separate actions, even though all of the notes were due at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Judgment is reversed and a <em>vemre de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
