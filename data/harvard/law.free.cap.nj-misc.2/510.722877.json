We are not, however, upon this application, concerned with the question of the validity of the entire ordinance. The question presented substantially is reduced. to the inquiry whether the ordinance is invalid so far as it prohibits the relator from erecting on this property sixteen separate garages, to be erected under two roofs. Such is the proposal as stated in the brief of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The statute under which the zoning ordinance was passed authorizes the municipalities to pass such ordinances as may be reasonably required for the protection of the health, safety or general welfare of the public. The presumption is in favor of the conclusion that the purpose of the governing body was that indicated in the statute, and, so far as the ordinance affects the rights of the owner of a given piece of property, the burden rests upon him to show that the ordinance is not justified on any such theory, so far as his property is concerned. If it should appear from the ordinance, plus the admitted facts in a given case, that the ordinance lias no such effect, its passage cannot be justified under the statute. <em>Ninth Street Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Ocean City, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>107: <em>affirmed, </em>91 <em>Id. </em>703. In that case the Supreme Court, in the last paragraph of its opinion, says: \u201cIn our judgment, the erection and management of a. garage, with all its incidental dangers and inconvenience to adjoining property and public travel, are manifestly matters properly cognizable by the municipal governing body, as a subject for regulation in the public interest, under the police power expressly conferred, as, in this instance, or reasonably implied <em>ex necessitate </em>in aid of the general welfare against dangers recognized and obvious to persons and property.\u201d The subject is also- dealt with in the recent adjudication of the Court of Errors and Appeals to the same effect, involving an ordinance of the town of Yutley. <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Nutley, 2 N. J. Adv. R. </em>832. It is entirely settled that an ordinance will not be held void as unreasonable, unless, shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>to be unreasonable <em>in toto. Roetjgen </em>v. <em>Paterson, </em>90 N. <em>J. L. </em>698.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Therefore, if the provision attacked be valid, it is quite immaterial for the purpose of the instant ease whether the remaining sections of the ordinance be legally sustainable or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The city is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
