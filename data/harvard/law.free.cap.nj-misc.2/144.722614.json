The case grows out of a collision at a railroad grade crossing. The trial resulted in verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendant, the Erie Railroad Company, obtained a rule to show cause why a new trial should not be granted, reserving three exceptions taken at the trial. A new trial was refused, the rule \"was discharged. The defendant then applied for a reargument of the rule, which was also denied, hence this appeal. The three exceptions reserved were, first, reading to the jury section 36b of the Railroad act; second, charging the plaintiff's second request, and <em>third, </em>the charge of the court in answer to the written communication from the jury, \u201cmust the bell at the crossing be ringing,\u201d &amp;c. These are all covered in the reasons filed for a new trial under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>rule to show cause (Nos. 10, 13 and 24, Record, p. 266). This disposes of the case on appeal under the case of <em>Faragasso </em>v. <em>Introcaso, </em>1 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1034, which holds the Supreme Court cannot hear and determine the validity of exceptions reserved to a verdict, after they have been considered and determined by the trial court on- the rule to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
