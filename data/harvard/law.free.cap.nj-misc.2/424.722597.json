The indictment charged the offense as having been committed on the 1st'day of June, 1922. The complaining witness fixed the time, by saying that.it was in' the month of June, because it was \"summertime.\u201d This is the reason urged why the conviction should be set aside, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Sing Lee, </em>110 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>113. We think the point is answered and the case controlled by what we said in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Calabrese, 2 N. J. Adv. R. </em>588.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
