The bone of plaintiff\u2019s nose was broken, as was one of his cheek bones; he suffered a-fracture of the ribs, and was injured as well on the other side of his body; one of his teeth was knocked out; another tooth was broken off, and others were loosened; his legs were severely bruised, and he was incapacitated for work for about four months. His loss of wages amounted, approximately, to $350. His medical expenses were $118. His-total loss and expenses was therefore $468, leaving the-amount of the compensation for these conceded injuries only $669, which, under the circumstances, seem to us eutirely inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Me think the weight of the evidence, which was in nowise-contradicted, warranted a substantial allowance to the plaintiff, as compensation for his injuries, pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">This verdict cannot be reconciled with the nncontradicted' testimony, except upon the theory that the jury must have-misconceived its import.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The rule will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
