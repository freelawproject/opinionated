This suit was brought to recover the balance of the installments unpaid amounting to $1,687.64, with interest from April 13th, 1922. The defendant sets up by way of defense that, by the terms of the said agreement, the plaintiff agreed to repair the instrument for a period of one year from installation such repairs as were necessary, which it did not do. The plaintiff has not installed and set up said musical instrument and has not rendered such repair service as was necessary. Filing counter-claim of $5,000 damages. The trial resulted in a verdict for,the defendant for $4,022.07 The plaintiff obtained a rule to show caus\u00e9 why a new trial should not be granted, and writes down eight reasons for a new trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>trial judge charged the jury thus: \u201cIf this instrument installed was not installed in a reasonably fit condition for the purpose for which it was to be used and for which it was sold. If that has been made out then the defendant is entitled to a judgment for the sum of $4,022.07. If that has not been made out then the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict for $1,687.64.\u201d This was injurious error, because it was not in harmony and in accordance with the provisions of the \u201cSale of Goods act.\u201d 4 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>4663, \u00a7\u00a7 66, 69; <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>Verschur, </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>277; <em>Wurlitzer Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>United, &amp;c., Co., </em>87 <em>Id. </em>656. The suit was commenced April 20th, 1922. The defendant had the use of the musical instrument for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The rule to show cause must, therefore, be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
