As indicated, our rule (6a) provides that \u201cno person * * * shall be recommended for license to practice as a counseior-at-law in this state unless he shall first submit himself to examination. and give satisfactory evidence of his knowledge of the principles and doctrines of the law, and his abilities as a pleader; nor shall any be admitted to such examination until he shall have practiced in this court as an attorney for the space of three years at least; * * We consider that the reason urged furnishes no ground for tlie relaxation of the rule in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">The application is denied accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
