BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b222-4\">Submitted December 3, 1923</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AbJ\">Decided March 12, 1924.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b222-7\">Before Justices Trenchard, Parker and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-8\">Eor the prosecutor, <em>Joseph Thompson </em>and <em>John J.

It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment, having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The decision of the respondent shows it to be the product of great care and consideration and we do not find that it arrived at the value of $1,600,000 unwarrantedly, nor by the application of any erroneous or illegal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The second reason for reversal is that in fixing rates the respondent not only look into consideration the revenue to be derived from its present business, based upon actual connections with its sewerage system at the time of the closing of the hearing, but also took into consideration revenue that would probably be derived from additional connections that it was estimated would be made for a year thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In this respect we can find no error. The finding was made upon tangible and competent data and evidence and the fixing of rates was not for the immediate present only, but at least for a reasonable time in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The order of the respondent' is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
