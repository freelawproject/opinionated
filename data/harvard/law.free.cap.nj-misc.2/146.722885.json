Hall, and for consequential damages to Eaymond S. Hall, as the father of Elizabeth Hall. Elizabeth Hall was a passenger in a jitney bus, which collided with an automobile driven by Louis Eerriero^ one of the defendants. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment of $5,000 in favor of the infant and $2,500 in favor of the father against all the defendants. A rule to show cause was allowed limited to the question of damages, and also to the question of newlv-discovered evidence as related to the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Our examination of the record leads us to the conclusion that the verdicts should not be disturbed, except in one particular. We think, under the evidence, the verdict of $2,500, in favor of the father, Eaymond'S. Hall, is excessive, and should be reduced to $1,500. If he will remit the excess the verdict will stand for $1,500, and the rule to show cause in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>each ease will be discharged, but without costs. Otherwise, the rule will be made absolute as to the plaintiff Raymond S. Hall and discharged as to Elizabeth Hall.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
