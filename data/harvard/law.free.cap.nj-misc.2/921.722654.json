The defendants (husband and wife) insisted at the trial that the contract of letting did not include payment for any coal, and this was the meritorious question to which the testimony was directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">At the trial both defendants testified that the oral contract was made upon their part by one of the defendants (the wife) alone, and that the husband, the other defendant, was not present at the time, the husband testifying that he had no knowledge \u201cwhat the agreement was, except what my wife told me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">In this situation the trial judge in his charge called attention to the testimony of the plaintiffs, to the effect that the contract provided for the payment for the coal. He then further charged that \u201cthe defendants meet that testimony by a denial of the alleged agreement. * * * The defendants themselves both say there was no mention made about it (the coal bill) at the time they leased the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">This instruction was, in effect, that both defendants had sworn that the contract did not include payment for the coal, when, in fact, only one defendant had so&gt; testified. It was therefore a misstatement of the evidence on a material fact. It was probably misleading <em>to </em>the jury and was prejudicial to the plaintiffs. It was definitely excepted to and was not thereafter corrected, and hence was an error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">We reach this conclusion without hesitation,.for the reason that our examination of the charge leads us to the conclusion that it contained other inadvertent but material misstatements of the evidence prejudicial to the plaintiffs, which it would serve no useful purpose to dwell upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">The judgment will be reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
