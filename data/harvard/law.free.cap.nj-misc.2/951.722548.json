He reversed the findings of the deputy compensation commissioner. This is a workman\u2019s compensation \u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>case. The basis of Judge Delaney\u2019s decision is, the petitioner was injured on March 24th, 1922, in the course and scope of his employment, by being struck by the handle of a wheelbarrow, but there is no proof of a traumatic hernia. The proof failed to indicate anjr puncturing or tearing oi the abdomen wall or any prostration, both of which facts are required to be present under the statute. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1919, <em>p. </em>204, \u00b6 11 (x). This statute was re-enacted in 1923. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1923, <em>p. </em>104, \u00b6 11 (x). We think the findings of Judge Delaney are correct. There is a failure of proof to bring the case within the terms of the statute. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is therefore dismissed, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Passaic county affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
