The ordinance of the city under which the license is sought was passed in pursuance of the authority granted in <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>p. </em>145, <em>ch. </em>78. It is conceded there is a discretion rested in the governing body on this subject, but it is argued there has been a palpable abuse of such discretion in refusing a permit to the relator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>It would serve no useful purpose to pursue the subject at length in view ,of the exhaustive arguments made;, both orally and in the briefs of the respective counsel. It is sufficient to say that we think the case is controlled by that of <em>Zellers </em>v. <em>City Council of the City of </em>Bridgeton, 2 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>42 (at <em>p. </em>958). The granting and issuing of licenses or permits for such purposes are not purely ministerial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">The writ is denied and the rule to show cause is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
