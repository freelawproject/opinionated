The justice that allowed the writs did so without stay, and at the argument we were asked to overrule this course and order a stay, in order to avoid alleged useless expense, and for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">We think that in the status of the matter as it came to us a stay would do more harm than good, and would in practical effect amount to setting aside the whole election for the time being; so that we feel constrained to deny it, subject to any action that may app'ear proper after the briefs are in and the case fully examined.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
