The defendants had sold to the plaintiffs the. premises for $24,000 under a written contract dated October 26th, 1922, which contained this clause over which the dispute arose, viz.: \u201cEront and back bar fixtures\u201d and all other fixtures in buildings to remain except piano \"and pictures on the wall.\u201d The trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs for' $2,500. The defense was the property in question was not fixtures, but chattels, and not within the terms of the contract, and which were-not agreed to be sold. If this is not so, then it so argued, the value of the goods taken away by the defendant Siegel was not $2,500. We think the case was fairly tried and the jury was justified in finding the verdict that was reached. The rule to show cause is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
