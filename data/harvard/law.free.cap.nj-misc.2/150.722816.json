Rep. </em>729.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>On behalf of the board of commissioners it is urged that the appropriation of the money rests in their discretion; that the board of education exceeded its statutory power, and that such board of education and board of estimate failed in the performance of certain conditions precedent. But an examination of the cases cited will disclose that these various contentions have all been determined adversely to the claim of the board of commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Since the essential facts are not in dispute, the rule to show cause will be made absolute, and a writ of peremtory <em>mandamus </em>awarded in accordance with it, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
