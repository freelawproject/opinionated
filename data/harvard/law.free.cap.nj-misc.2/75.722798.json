It applied for a building permit to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>its property, so that stores may be erected therein, which application was refused, for the reason that the city ordinance zoned this property as a residential zone from which stores were excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">It appears that the ordinance in question is founded upon chapter 229 of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We think that the decision of this ease, so far as this court is concerned, is controlled by <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley (Supreme Court), </em>1 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1023, and under the authority thereof a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The demurrer will be overruled and judgment given for the relator, with costs, and a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
