This practice is warranted by rule 147 .of the rules of the Supreme Court, which makes applic\u00e1ble_ to appeals in which a <em>venire de novo </em>is directed, rules 131 and 132. Eule 131 provides that \u201cin case a new trial is granted it shall only be a new trial of the question or questions with respect to which the verdict or decision is found to be wrong, if separable.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The former opinion will be modified ^o as to limit the new trial solely-to the question of damages of the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
