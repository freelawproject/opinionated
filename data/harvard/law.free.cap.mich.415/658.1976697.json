We are obliged by a decision of the United States Supreme Court to hold that it may not, and we therefore affirm the Court of Appeals in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Alphonsa Blount was arrested by Detroit police in September, 1974, and charged with being a fugitive from justice from the State of Alabama. Blount had been convicted of armed robbery and, according to his own testimony, sentenced to 45 years in prison. He escaped from Atmore State Prison while accompanying a prison band on a field trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">On November 19, 1974, a Michigan governor\u2019s warrant for Blount\u2019s arrest and extradition was issued pursuant to the request of the Governor of Alabama. Blount was arraigned on the warrant before a Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, who adjourned the proceedings to permit Blount\u2019s attorney to seek a governor\u2019s hearing and to prepare a complaint for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">After his request for a governor\u2019s hearing was denied, Blount petitioned the Recorder\u2019s Court for a writ of habeas corpus, contending <em>inter alia </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>his right under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment would be violated if he were extradited to Alabama. The court denied his application and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The Recorder\u2019s Court Judge stayed extradition while Blount appealed to this Court, which on July 24, 1975, remanded the matter to the trial court \"for a hearing on appellant\u2019s claim that returning him to the Alabama prison would subject him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of his Eighth Amendment right.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Witnesses at the hearing on remand included a former inmate of Alabama\u2019s Atmore Prison, a Roman Catholic sister who had been active in efforts to promote prison reform in Alabama, the Associate Commissioner of the Alabama Board of Corrections (who had served as warden of all of Alabama\u2019s major prisons in the course of his career), and Blount himself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Introduced as exhibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>were opinions and orders entered by federal courts in Alabama in cases involving prison conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In a January <em>21, </em>1976, opinion which relied heavily on an opinion issued by an Alabama federal court one week earlier (see part II, below), the judge found that if Blount were returned to Alabama he would be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The judge stayed the extradition warrant and adjourned the matter for one year to see whether the Alabama prison system would improve to a point where Blount\u2019s extradition \"would no longer be prohibited by Eighth Amendment considerations.\u201d Blount was placed on personal bond with special conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">One year later, when the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office sought to submit a progress report as required by the judge\u2019s order, the Alabama authorities did not cooperate in furnishing information regarding improvements in prison conditions. On March 18, 1977, the judge issued a final order quashing the extradition warrant and granting the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The prosecutor sought an order of superintending control in the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals attempted to certify to this Court the question whether the constitutional issues raised by Blount should have been litigated in the courts of Michigan. We denied the request for certification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">In April, 1978, the Court of Appeals set aside the order granting the. writ, stating: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>mandated by federal court orders and have been implemented in the Alabama penal system since the trial court conducted its hearing. The factual basis for the trial court\u2019s findings has therefore altered substantially. We find no impediment to the present return of the fugitive to Alabama for determination in a forum of the demanding state of the present sufficiency or insufficiency of the Alabama prison system.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\"We take judicial notice that changes have been</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Charles Brown was convicted of armed robbery in Alabama in January, 1974, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was incarcerated at Atmore Prison and escaped from Atmore in June, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Brown was arrested in Michigan on a fugitive warrant in November, 1977. Alabama requested his return and the Governor of Michigan signed a warrant for his extradition on December 16, 1977. Brown then sought a writ of habeas corpus in Recorder\u2019s Court, alleging that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment while imprisoned in Alabama and would again be subjected to unconstitutional treatment if returned to that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Brown alleges that while in prison he fractured his ankle in three places, but the prison authorities refused to provide him with immediate medical treatment and required him to perform his normal work assignment for two days before treating his injury. He filed an action in an Alabama federal court against the prison and two officers and was informed by a prison guard that if he prevailed, he would not live to collect the money damages. The inmate who helped him prepare his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>pleadings was severely beaten, allegedly in connection with his having helped Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The Recorder\u2019s Court denied Brown\u2019s petition on the basis of the Court of Appeals decision in Blount\u2019s case, and the Court of Appeals dismissed an original complaint in that Court for a writ of habeas corpus. We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Eight days before the trial court issued its opinion in <em>Blount, </em>a United States district court in Alabama decided two consolidated class actions filed on behalf of inmates incarcerated in Alabama prisons. <em>Pugh v Locke, </em>406 F Supp 318 (MD Ala, 1976). The judge\u2019s opinion graphically described the severe inadequacies of Alabama\u2019s prisons:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\"There can be no question that the present conditions of confinement in the Alabama penal system violate any current judicial definition of cruel and unusual punishment, a situation evidenced by the defendants\u2019 admission that serious Eighth Amendment violations exist. In these circumstances, it is the very confinement itself which impermissibly contravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the plaintiff classes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">\"The conditions in which Alabama prisoners must live, as established by the evidence in these cases, bear no reasonable relationship to legitimate institutional goals. As a whole they create an atmosphere in which inmates are compelled to live in constant fear of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>lence, in imminent danger to their physical well-being, and without opportunity to seek a more promising future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">\"The living conditions in Alabama prisons constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Specifically, lack of sanitation throughout the institutions \u2014 in living areas, infirmaries, and food service \u2014 presents an imminent danger to the health of each and every inmate. Prisoners suffer from further physical deterioration because there are no opportunities for exercise and recreation. Treatment for prisoners with physical or emotional problems is totally inadequate. This court has previously ordered that the penal system provide reasonable medical care for inmates in these institutions * * *. <em>Newman v Alabama, </em>349 F Supp 278, 285-286 (MD Ala, 1972). The evidence in these cases leads to the inescapable conclusion that the gross inadequacies in medical care found in that case have not been remedied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\"Prison officials are under a duty to provide inmates reasonable protection from constant threat of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\"The evidence establishes that inmates are housed in virtually unguarded, overcrowded dormitories, with no realistic attempt by officials to separate violent, aggressive inmates from those who are passive or weak. The tension generated by idleness and deplorable living conditions contributes further to the ever-present threat of violence from which inmates have no refuge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\"The response of the defendants to the matters set forth in this opinion consistently has been that they cannot alleviate the conditions because of inadequate funding by the state legislature. However, a state is not at liberty to afford its citizens only those constitutional rights which fit comfortably within its budget. The Alabama Legislature has had ample opportunity to make provision for the state to meet its constitutional responsibilities in this area, and it has failed to do so.\u201d 406 F Supp 329-330.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The United States district court established specific \"minimum constitutional standards\u201d relating to overcrowding, segregation and isolation units, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>classification of inmates, mental health care, protection of inmates from violence, general living conditions, food service, physical plants, prison staff, inmates\u2019 correspondence and visitation, and opportunities for education, vocational training, work and recreation. The Alabama prison system was ordered not to accept new prisoners until the inmate population had been reduced to the design capacity for each facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In September, 1978, the district court held hearings to determine the degree of compliance with its orders. On February 2, 1979, the judge issued an opinion which surveyed Alabama\u2019s efforts at compliance and concluded that there had been a disturbing lack of progress.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">\"The very fact of confinement in Alabama\u2019s penal system continues to contravene the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\"Time does not stand still, but the Board of Corrections and the Alabama prison system have for six years. Their time has now run out. The court can no longer brook non-compliance with the clear command of the Constitution, represented by the orders of the court in this case. Plaintiffs are entitled to prompt and effective relief. Living conditions that constitute an imminent danger to health; inadequate medical care that poses a threat to life; and insufficient security that sanctions the law of the jungle \u2014 these facts describe a state of emergency demanding decisive action. It is clear that the Board of Corrections is incapable of effective leadership. Difficult as the board\u2019s position was made by the lack of adequate funding, the court finds that the board could have ameliorated the conditions confronting it, but instead contributed to the gravity of the situation by its indifference and incompetence. The lack of any significant progress since the original hearings in this case strongly suggests that the appointment of monitors offers little, if any, hope of swift compliance. The ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>traordinary circumstances of this case dictate that the only alternative to non-compliance with the court\u2019s orders is the appointment of a receiver for the Alabama prisons.\u201d <em>Newman v Alabama, </em>466 F Supp 628, 630, 635 (MD Ala, 1979).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Newly elected Alabama Governor Fob James was appointed receiver. Despite the good intentions expressed in his petition for appointment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in quarterly compliance reports submitted under his supervision since his appointment, it appears that upgrading of the Alabama prison system has been a slow and uneven process. While considerable progress has been made in some administrative areas, little progress has been made toward the basic goal of providing adequate and habitable housing for all inmates. On July 15, 1981, the judge\u2019s successor<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> issued an unpublished injunctive order directing the release of a number of inmates to help alleviate continued overcrowding:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\"It is agreed by all parties that the Alabama Department of Corrections is still out of compliance with the standards established by this court in <em>Newman v Alabama, supra, </em>and in <em>Pugh v Locke, supra. </em>It is further stipulated by all parties that most of the terms of the said orders should have been met long before now and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>that full compliance must ultimately be achieved. * * * [T]his court has attempted to provide every possible opportunity for the defendants to achieve compliance with both state law and the orders of this court within the last nine years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\"During this time, the State Department of Corrections has been continuously in direct violation of the orders of this court, and present plans for expansion are insufficient to relieve the condition. On October 9, 1980, this court ordered that by March 1, 1981, there would be no more than 960 state inmates incarcerated in city or county jails in Alabama. On May 18, 1981, there were 1,606 state prisoners confined in city and county jails in Alabama. At present, there are over 2,100 state inmates in city and county facilities. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">\"Therefore, because of the failure of those empowered to fund needed construction, this court has a duty to fashion relief to protect constitutional rights of citizens. <em>Hutto v Finney, </em>437 US 678, 687; 98 S Ct 2565; 57 L Ed 2d 522 (1978). * * * This court is of the opinion that the constitutional rights of the plaintiff class are in jeopardy and that any substantial continuation of the incarceration of state inmates in city and county facilities under conditions and circumstances now current would probably violate their constitutional immunity to cruel and unusual punishment. To avoid this result, this court is of the opinion that the only valid substantial relief available to 'insure against the risk of inadequate compliance\u2019 (see <em>Hutto v Finney, supra, </em>at 687) is the release of a substantial number of inmates to help relieve the overcrowded conditions of the Alabama prison system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The court ordered that 400 prisoners, later reduced to 277, be released. On July 25, Alabama released them outright.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The plaintiffs, however, continued to be dissatisfied with the overcrowding and requested the release of more prisoners. On December 14, 1981, the court through an injunction ordered the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>lease of 352 prisoners on parole. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stayed this order pending appeal. On appeal, the Court of Appeals considered both the July and December injunctions, but dismissed the appeal of the July order as moot.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court vacated the December order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">\"In summary, the district court erred in entering the December 14 injunction since the plaintiffs possessed an adequate legal remedy in the form of the October 9, 1980, consent order which was enforceable through the court\u2019s contempt power. Even if the issuance of an injunction had been warranted on December 14, the district court abused its discretion by framing relief which was impermissibly intrusive on the State\u2019s prerogative to administer its prison and parole systems.\u201d 683 F2d 1321.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The plaintiffs have since applied to have Alabama\u2019s governor, in his capacity as receiver of the prison system, attorney general, and commissioner of the Board of Corrections fined or imprisoned for contempt because of their failure to adhere to the consent decree. A hearing on that application is scheduled for January, 1983.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>It appears that conditions in the Alabama penal system even now fail to comport with the Eighth Amendment; at least there is no reason to suppose that such progress has been made that it can no longer be properly said, as the district court declared on February 2, 1979:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">\"The very fact of confinement in Alabama\u2019s penal system continues to contravene the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The United States Constitution provides: \"A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.\u201d US Const, art IV, \u00a7 2, cl 2. The courts of an asylum state are bound by this federal constitutional provision, by the implementing federal statute, 18 USC 3182, and, where adopted, by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Michigan v Doran, </em>439 US 282, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>288-289; 99 S Ct 530; 58 L Ed 2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">After these cases were argued and submitted, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Pacileo v Walker, </em>449 US 86; 101 S Ct 308; 66 L Ed 2d 304 (1980), <em>reh den </em>450 US 960; 101 S Ct 1421; 67 L Ed 2d 385 (1981). In <em>Pacileo, </em>James Dean Walker, an escapee from the prisons of Arkansas, was apprehended in California. The Governor of Arkansas requested Walker\u2019s extradition, and the Governor of California honored the request and issued a warrant of arrest and rendition which was served upon Pacileo, the California sheriff in whose custody Walker was lodged.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Walker petitioned for habeas corpus relief in both state and federal courts in California, but was unsuccessful until he reached the Supreme Court of California. On April 9, 1980, that court issued a writ of habeas corpus directing a California trial court to \" 'conduct hearings to determine if the penitentiary in which Arkansas seeks to confine petitioner is presently operated in conformance with the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and thereafter to decide the petition on its merits\u2019 \u201d. 449 US 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">On December 8, 1980, the United States Supreme Court, without setting the case for argument, reversed in a per curiam opinion, the substantive portion of which is herewith quoted in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\"><em>\"Petitioner Sheriff contends that Art IV, \u00a7 2, cl 2, and its implementing statute, 18 USC 3182, do not give the courts of the 'asylum\u2019 or 'sending\u2019 State authority to inquire into the prison conditions of the 'demanding\u2019 state. We agree. </em>In <em>Michigan v Doran, </em>439 US 282; 99 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Ct 530; 58 L Ed 2d 521 (1978), our most recent pronouncement on the subject, we stated that '[interstate extradition was intended to be a summary and mandatory executive proceeding derived from the language of Article IV, \u00a7 2, cl 2 of the Constitution.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>288. We further stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">\" 'A governor\u2019s grant of extradition is prima facie evidence that the constitutional and statutory requirements have been met * * *. Once the governor has granted extradition, a court considering release on habeas corpus can do no more than decide (a) whether the extradition documents on their face are in order; (b) whether the petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding state; (c) whether the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition; and (d) whether the petitioner is a fugitive. These are historic facts readily verifiable.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>289.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\"In <em>Sweeney v Woodall, </em>344 US 86; 73 S Ct 139; 97 L Ed 114 (1952), this Court held that a fugitive from Alabama could not raise in the federal courts of Ohio, the asylum State, the constitutionality of his confinement in Alabama. We stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\" 'Considerations fundamental to our federal system require that the prisoner test the claimed unconstitutionality of his treatment by Alabama in the courts of that State.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Justice Marshall alone dissented, stating that he would set the case for plenary review because he did not believe that <em>Doran </em>and <em>Sweeney </em>controlled the question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Our <em>pre-Doran </em>order remanding <em>Blount </em>to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing plainly contemplated that a habeas corpus court in the asylum state could engage in more than formalistic review and could, indeed, quash a governor\u2019s extradition warrant on the ground that returning the fugitive to the demanding state would result in a deprivation of his constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. We might not have felt compelled to abandon that view by the dictum of <em>Doran, </em>since the issue there was whether the courts of the asylum state could, despite an executive grant of extradition, re-evaluate a determination of probable cause made by a judicial officer in the demanding state. Unlike Doran, Brown and Blount do not ask an asylum state court to re-examine a pre-trial inquiry already carried out in the demanding state.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\"><em>Sweeney v Woodall, supra, </em>bears a greater resemblance to the present case but could also be distinguished. Woodall, an escapee from an Alabama prison, resisted extradition on the ground that he had been brutally mistreated during his confinement in Alabama and that the similar or worse treatment to which he would be subjected if returned would amount to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of his constitutional rights. After the Ohio state courts refused to entertain his claim, Woodall sought habeas corpus in the federal courts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit directed the district court, which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>dismissed the petition, to conduct a hearing on the merits of the constitutional claim. The Supreme Court reversed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\"In the present case, as in [other cases cited by the Court], a fugitive from justice has asked the federal court in his asylum to pass upon the constitutionality of his incarceration in the demanding state, although the demanding state is not a party before the federal court and although he has made no attempt to raise such a question in the demanding state. The question is whether, <em>under these circumstances, </em>the district court should entertain the fugitive\u2019s application on its merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\"><em>\"Respondent makes no showing that relief is unavailable to him in the courts of Alabama. </em>Had he never eluded the custody of his former jailers he certainly would be entitled to no privilege permitting him to attack Alabama\u2019s penal process by an action brought outside the territorial confines of Alabama in a forum where there would be no one to appear and answer for that State. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\"By resort to a form of 'self help\u2019, respondent has changed his status from that of a prisoner of Alabama to that of a fugitive from Alabama. But this should not affect the authority of the Alabama courts to determine the validity of his imprisonment in Alabama. The scheme of interstate rendition as set forth in both the Constitution and the statutes which Congress has enacted to implement the Constitution, contemplates the prompt return of a fugitive from justice as soon as the state from which he fled demands him; these provisions do not contemplate an appearance by Alabama in respondent\u2019s asylum to defend against the claimed abuses of its prison system.\u201d 344 US 88-90. (Emphasis supplied; footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Three concerns are apparent in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sweeney: </em>(1) principles of federalism and comity demand that the courts of the state which has allegedly subjected a prisoner to unconstitutional conditions of confinement be given an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>tunity to pass upon his claim; (2) requiring a state to defend its prison system in the courts of a sister state would be burdensome to the state required to defend; (3) a prisoner should gain no greater access to legal remedies through escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The first two concerns are inapposite where, as here, a United States district court in the demanding state has ruled that conditions in its prisons violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Extensive hearings in the courts of the asylum state would not be necessary to determine whether returning the fugitive to the demanding state would subject him to a violation of his constitutional rights, for a court in the demanding state has already determined the question in a proceeding in which the state authorities have had every opportunity to defend themselves in a convenient forum. In <em>Blount, </em>for example, the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the writ of habeas corpus rested not upon the record made at the evidentiary hearing, which became almost superfluous, but almost entirely upon the determinations made by the United States district court on a substantial record which included Alabama\u2019s admission that conditions in its prisons violated constitutional guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The argument that a fugitive should not be able to improve his position through escape is not easily answered. To be sure, Brown and Blount have placed themselves in a favored position in relation to other prisoners who remain incarcerated under unconstitutional conditions. But this Court is not responsible for the Eighth Amendment violations existing in the Alabama prisons. We are, however, responsible for the future treatment of Blount and Brown. We are asked in effect to prevent an act, extradition, which is necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Alabama to subject them to cruel and unusual punishment. The only question before us is whether we will act to facilitate that mistreatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">This Court thus rests squarely on the horns of a moral dilemma. Are we compelled by our role as a part of the federal system to adhere to a rule which we perceive to have been articulated without exception by the federal courts, although the concerns underlying that rule apply with less force in this case and its application will almost certainly result in deprivations of constitutional rights?

The United States Supreme Court appears resolved to construe the Extradition Clause in accordance with the principles sketched in <em>Doran, supra, </em>439 US 287-288:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\"The purpose of the Clause was to preclude any state from becoming a sanctuary for fugitives from justice of another state and thus 'balkanize\u2019 the administration of criminal justice among the several states.

In late 1978, after the Supreme Court opinion, the parties entered into a consent decree resolving the issues in the lawsuit. <em>Finney v Mabry, </em>458 F Supp 720 (ED Ark, 1978). It does not appear that findings of unconstitutional conditions were entered in the cause subsequent to the 1976 district court opinion, nor have there been any published opinions concerning efforts to enforce the 1978 consent decree, although the plaintiffs are apparently still monitoring the state\u2019s adherence to the decree and raising new claims. See <em>Chambers v Kaplan, </em>648 F2d 1193 (CA 8, 1981) (per curiam); <em>Finney v Mabry, </em>528 F Supp 567 (ED Ark, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"ARy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>In the instant case, there is a district court order of December, 1981, releasing prisoners due to unconstitutional conditions in the Alabama prison system and a pending contempt proceeding concerning the state\u2019s failure to correct those constitutional violations.

As he has noted, the United States Supreme Court has found that a state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>in the asylum state may not inquire into the constitutional defects of the prison system of the demanding state once a claim of extradition has properly been made upon the asylum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">However, I dissent from the inherent criticism of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pacileo </em>that it failed to recognize an exception to the clear mandate of article IV, \u00a7 2, cl 2 of the Constitution of the United States requiring a state to deliver a fugitive from justice to the state from which he fled upon demand. The <em>Pacileo </em>Court considered both the language of the Extradition Clause and the policies behind it clearly determining uniformity in application to be appropriate. Even assuming the principles of federalism and comity and the interest in allowing a state to defend its prison system in its own courts, where it would be least burdensome to it, are minimal, the prevention of the \"balkanization\u201d of the administration of criminal justice is the manifest purpose of the Extradition Clause. See <em>Michigan v Doran, </em>439 US 282; 99 S Ct 530; 58 L Ed 2d 521 (1978). We cannot say that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights will not be vindicated, particularly in this case where the federal court has taken an active role in ensuring constitutional compliance. See <em>Pugh v Locke, </em>406 F Supp 318, 322 (MD Ala, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Second, I dissent from the gratuitous stay my colleagues allow. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on point, its denial of a rehearing, and the fact that <em>Pacileo </em>was based on what the Court considered to be clear precedent as much as thirty years old, <em>Sweeney v Woodall, </em>344 US 86; 73 S Ct 139; 97 L Ed 114 (1952), a stay in order that the appellants might remain in this state until they can challenge <em>Pacileo </em>is totally unwarranted. It amounts to an affront to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Supreme Court. It has not been requested by the appellants and does not rest, in my judgment, upon any reasonable belief that \"we may have incorrectly interpreted\u201d <em>Pacileo.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b749-4\">Coleman, J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b749-5\">Riley, J., took no part in the decision of these cases.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
