We find the award to be excessive and remand for entry of a judgment of $132,900.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">On September 30, 1972, a DSR bus struck Robert Precopio\u2019s automobile. The accident occurred before the adoption of the no-fault automobile liability act. Precopio commenced an action against the City of Detroit, seeking \"a judgment that is fair and just in accordance with the facts produced in court, but in no case to exceed the sum of two hundred thousand ($200,000.00) dollars\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">After mediation failed to produce an acceptable settlement, the case was tried without a jury before a circuit judge. The witnesses were Precopio, the bus driver, a passenger, Precopio\u2019s physician, and a physician who examined Precopio for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Three witnesses offered conflicting testimony on the issue of liability. Precopio testified that he had stopped at a red light when the bus struck the rear of his automobile. The bus driver and the passenger testified that Precopio had abruptly changed lanes, without signaling or first determining the safety of his maneuver, before he made a sudden stop in front of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">On the damage issue, Precopio testified that he did not undergo hospitalization either immediately following the accident or at any time before the trial. On the day following the accident, he began to experience pain in the back of his neck and, when he bent down to complete a task during his work as a spot sander, he found that he could hardly straighten up. He then consulted his family physician who prescribed heat treatments, injections, and medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Precopio testified that he continued to consult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>his physician once a week and sometimes twice a week during his first eight-month absence from work after the accident. Although he could not pinpoint the dates, Precopio said that he also missed work for eight months during 1975, that he missed two months in 1976, and that up to the time of trial he continued to miss approximately ten days a year as a result of pain from his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The judge took the case under advisement and, a number of months later, issued an opinion finding the city liable and assessing Precopio\u2019s damages at $436,085. The judge permitted Precopio to amend the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of his complaint to conform with the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. The dissenting judge would have reversed and remanded for a new trial, stating that the amount of damages awarded shocked the judicial conscience and that the damages were unsupported by the proofs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We affirm the judge\u2019s finding on liability and agree that he properly permitted Precopio to amend the <em>ad damnum </em>clause to conform to the award. We reverse the Court of Appeals on certain elements of the damage award, for a review of the record persuades us that excessive amounts were awarded for past and future pain and suffering, humiliation, and \"loss of power in his hand\u201d and for \"future medications\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The city contends that the evidence clearly preponderates against the judge\u2019s finding of liability. In the city\u2019s view, the judge erred in disregarding the corroborating accounts of the bus driver and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the passenger, whose testimony conflicted in certain irrelevant particulars, and in fully crediting Precopio\u2019s account of the accident although the city had impeached Precopio\u2019s truthfulness in answering similarly peripheral questions. The city also argues that it produced credible evidence to rebut the statutory presumption of negligence in a rear-end collision,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon which the judge relied, and that, absent the presumption, Precopio failed to carry his burden of proof on negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The court rule provides: \"Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. In the application of this principle, regard shall be given to the special opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of those witnesses who appeared before it.\u201d GCR 1963, 517.1. This Court has said: \"A finding is 'clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court acknowledged the superior vantage point of the trial judge in evaluating credibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On examination of this record we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that the judge erred in finding that the city was causally negligent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The city contends that the judge erred in allowing Precopio to amend the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of his complaint to conform with the amount of damages ultimately awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In <em>Gibeault v Highland </em>Park, 391 Mich 814; 217 NW2d 99 (1974), this Court adopted the analysis of the Court of Appeals in <em>Gibeault v Highland Park, </em>49 Mich App 736, 738-741; 212 NW2d 818 (1973), and disavowed contrary dictum in <em>Phillips v Rolston, </em>376 Mich 264, 268-269; 137 NW2d 158 (1965), which had ignored the pertinent language of GCR 1963, 518.3: \"Except as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The city asserts that permitting amendment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the <em>ad damnum </em>clause in this case applies <em>Gibeault </em>retroactively to a complaint filed before the <em>Gibeault </em>decision. The language of the court rule spoke clearly to the issue and was recognized as authoritative in <em>Piatkowski v Mok, </em>29 Mich App 426; 185 NW2d 413 (1971). As this Court\u2019s order in <em>Gibeault </em>noted, only dictum in <em>Phillips v Rolston </em>provided an apparently conflicting construction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The city contends that the damage award was clearly excessive. The following items of damage comprise the award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Property Damage $ 650</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Past Medical 535</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">Past Wage Loss 31,400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">Future Wage Loss 20,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">Future Medications 8,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">$ 61,085</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">Past and Future Pain and Suffering $375,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">Total Award $436,085</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">The city raises no objection to the portions of the award for property damage and for past medical expenditures, but contends that the remainder of the award clearly exceeds the range reasonably supported by the proofs, and asks that we either order a new trial or reduce the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">As both parties acknowledge, decisions of this Court state that awards for personal injury should rest within the sound judgment of the trier of fact, particularly awards for pain and suffering, and recognize that there is no absolute standard by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>which to measure such awards.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such deference in part reflects recognition that the trier of fact observes live testimony, while an appellate court reviews a printed record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a case tried to a jury, such deference may further reflect a reliance on the communal judgment of the members of the jury in awarding monetary compensation for such imponderables as pain and suffering.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In reviewing damage awards in cases tried to juries, this Court has asked whether the award shocks the judicial conscience, appears unsupported by the proofs, or seems to be the product of improper methods, passion, caprice, or prejudice; if the amount awarded falls reasonably within the range of the evidence and within the limits of what reasonable minds would deem just compensation for the injury sustained, the verdict has not been disturbed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The instant action was tried before a judge sitting without a jury. We again note that Rule 517.1 governs appellate review of bench trials.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>Tuttle v Dep\u2019t of State </em>Highways, 397 Mich 44; 243 NW2d 244 (1976), this Court noted that Rule 517.1 tracks the language of the \"clearly erroneous\u201d rule embodied in Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and declared that a reviewing court must substitute its own appraisal of the record when, even though some evidence supports a finding of fact,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a review of the whole record leaves the appellate court with a definite and firm conviction that the judge made a mistake.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>in a non-jury case, the scope of appellate review is broader than in a jury case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The United States Courts of Appeals have determined that the clearly erroneous standard, applicable to findings of fact in general, also applies to a finding of the amount of damages, which, if excessive, may be set aside upon appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">On a review of the record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the judge awarded Precopio excessive damages for pain and suffering, humiliation, and loss of power in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Precopio testified that, during the first eight-month period, when he missed work after the accident, he experienced much pain, despite prescribed heat treatments and medication, especially pain radiating from the back of his neck down his right arm. He also noticed a loss of strength in his right arm, an intermittent numbness in his right arm and right hand, and a weakened grip in his right hand. Precopio conceded that he did not experience as much pain in his right hand at the time of trial. Nevertheless, he still experienced pain through his shoulder, the back of his neck, and down his right arm, in addition to headaches and occasional numbness in his right arm. As a result, Precopio testified that he left his job as a spot sander whenever he could not use both hands, that he had discontinued carpentry around his home, that he no longer played as actively with his children, that his injury had adversely affected his sexual relationship with his wife, and that he experienced depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Precopio\u2019s personal physician diagnosed the injury as cervical-dorsal sprain. Eventually, because Precopio returned several times with the same complaints, the physician diagnosed fibromyositis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>although he could not state from objective signs that Precopio had scar formation, found Precopio\u2019s reflexes normal, and observed no narrowing of disc spaces in an initial x-ray. The physician also felt that Precopio had \"healed very nicely\u201d and that any damage to his musculature would heal in time.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Asked whether he thought that Precopio\u2019s pain resulted from residuals from the injury, the physician responded, \"Could be\u201d. Asked whether he thought that the residuals from the injury would become permanent, he responded, \"perhaps\u201d. On two occasions, the physician pronounced Precopio fit to return to work, but Precopio did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">A physician who examined Precopio for the city some 3-1/2 months after the collision found that Precopio demonstrated a satisfactory range of motion in his shoulder girdle, experienced no present tenderness in his neck and shoulders during palpation, and had developed no scars in the cervical area, although an x-ray revealed a narrowing disc space. This physician conceded that persons suffering cervical spine injuries often experience exacerbations and remissions, but testified that the changes in disc space could have resulted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>earlier trauma.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On the basis of his examination, this physician also concluded that Precopio could resume work, as well as normal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In short, on this record of less than forceful medical testimony, a record which prompted the judge to remark that there was a dearth of clear and convincing evidence of permanency, the judge could nevertheless properly conclude that Precopio had experienced and might continue to experience some pain and suffering from a cervical-dorsal sprain, as well as intermittent numbness in the arm and hand and a weakened grip. The proofs nonetheless do not justify a past and future pain and suffering award of $375,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In reappraising damage awards, this Court has followed a rule of just compensation based upon the evidence. To sustain his burden of proof, a plaintiff must establish injury and the appropriate compensation therefor with reasonable certainty.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Surveying cases involving excessive non-jury awards in this and other jurisdictions, we find that appellate courts rarely explain why they believe an award excessive, how they have decided upon the amounts by which they diminish awards through <em>remittitur </em>or reduction, or by what amount an award exceeds a reasonable award when they remand. Yet, since no trier of fact can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>value pain and suffering with mathematical certainty, a reviewing court must offer \"something more tangible than a difference of opinion as to amount\u201d before it sets aside a non-jury award as clearly erroneous. <em>Fishleigh v Detroit United Railway, </em>205 Mich 145, 167-168; 171 NW 549, 556 (1919). In <em>Fishleigh, </em>this Court looked to comparable awards in similar personal injury cases to evaluate whether a particular award exceeds the range demonstrated by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We appreciate that no two cases precisely resemble one another, especially where unliquidated damages are involved. No two persons sustain the same injury or experience the same suffering. An appellate court should not attempt to reconcile widely varied past awards for analogous injuries \"which in the abbreviated appellate discussion of them seem somewhat similar\u201d. <em>Gaspard v LeMaire, </em>245 La 239, 270; 158 So 2d 149, 160 (1963). However, if research uncovers a sufficient sample of reviewed awards, comparisons with analogous cases may prove of some value.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">This Court has cited comparable cases \"not to show any fixed rule employed\u201d, but to demonstrate a method for purging an excessive award of its improper elements.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such comparison nevertheless plumbs a collective sense of the relative worth of a life diminished by the burden of restricted movement or chronic pain, the loss of organ or limb, or the humiliation of disfigurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Analogous cases cannot serve as the dispositive or controlling criterion for evaluating an award for pain and suffering, but rather as one factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>which may provide some sense of a reasonable range of awards. An appellate court reviewing a personal-injury award should decide each case by its own facts, <em>Fishleigh, supra, </em>p 161.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> When the Court looks to comparable awards, we do not attempt to set a schedule for recovery in personal injury cases, for we recognize that one person\u2019s experience of pain differs from another\u2019s,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and we recognize that the proofs in particular cases may reasonably justify an award beyond the high side of the range of awards reported in appellate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Counsel in a non-jury case may not introduce evidence of analogous cases before the judge makes his findings of fact.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Not every damage award so surprises in its generosity as to justify a post-trial motion to set it aside as excessive. Litigants should not be burdened with compiling evidence in every case of the range of comparable awards. Only in the post-trial posture, where the judge reviews the propriety of his findings of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>may counsel introduce comparable awards. With a developed record, the judge can expressly incorporate those factors which he finds persuasive among his reasons for concluding, if he so concludes, that he did not err in finding damages, whether his findings fall within, above, or below the demonstrated range of damage awards in analogous cases.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Our examination of analogous awards which appellate courts have reviewed and our reappraisal of the proofs convinces us that the judge committed clear error when he awarded Precopio $375,000 on this record for pain and suffering, humiliation, and residual injury to his right arm resulting from a cervical sprain sustained in a rear-end collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We decline to evaluate the award by comparison to the unaccepted mediation award, as the city urges us to do. Not only would such comparison frustrate the public policy that encourages settlements, a policy which underlies the exclusion of offers to settle or to compromise from consideration by the factfinder on the issue of liability,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but, also, such comparison offers little of probative value to the factfinder since mediators sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>set a figure in order to facilitate settlement rather than to assess damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Analogous non-jury cases reviewed by Michigan appellate courts demonstrate a range of considerably lower total awards<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> than the award for pain and suffering in this case, adjusted for the effects of inflation. The low side of the range hovers near $2,000-$3,000 in 1978 dollars;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the high side, near $15,000.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>A survey of other jurisdictions for analogous pain and suffering and personal injury awards reinforces our conviction that the judge awarded pain and suffering damages far in excess of the highest reasonable amount on these proofs.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On the one hand, the low side of the range in analogous non-jury cases hovers near what would amount to $5,000-$10,000 in 1978 dollars.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>other hand, the high side of the range in non-jury cases involving cervical sprain occasioned in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>collision plus chronic pain hovers near what would amount to $15,000-$25,000 in 1978 dollars.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Only where cervical sprain and chronic pain combines with other injuries resulting from an automobile collision or with other pre-existing conditions aggravated by the collision have trial courts exceeded the above-described high side of the range.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We are mindful that the judge sought to compensate a plaintiff with a 3Sbyear life expectancy for humiliation and for residual injury to his right arm, so that we may extend the high side of the range to include cases which compensate for cervical sprain plus additional lingering injuries. Even so, the award amounts to almost eight times the highest awards in analogous non-jury cases affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Where the amount awarded outruns the reasonable range demonstrated by the proofs, a reviewing court has several options. As one option, a reviewing court may remand for a new trial. In remanding, courts have sometimes expressed the fear that an appellate court usurps the province of the factfinder if it substitutes another figure for the trial court\u2019s award, yet with rare exception, as where a plaintiff has failed to enter any proofs on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>damages or where the proofs offered do not support any finding of damages, an appellate court consciously or unconsciously refers to a range of awards reasonable on the facts and circumstances presented when it perceives an award to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This Court can more readily avoid acting as a superfactfinder if it does more than declare that there was error and, with little or no guidance, remand to the trial court, for on remand the trial court lacking guidance may again award damages that exceed the range sensed by the appellate court. Since, at the very least, an appellate court which remands feels that the award exceeds the highest amount reasonably demonstrated by the proofs, to remand without direction burdens litigants unnecessarily and forces a plaintiff who has fortuitously tried his case before a generous fact-finder, as our system permits, to re-try the issue of damages before another factfinder, perhaps less generous or perhaps more generous than the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">As other options, to avert the expense and protraction of further litigation in a case where the appellate court approves the finding on liability, the reviewing court may reduce damages, or it may condition affirmance of the judgment upon plaintiffs acceding to a remittitur.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Whether a reviewing court orders remand, reduction, or <em>remittitur, </em>the court either determines the amount by which the finding of damages exceeds the reasonable range of awards supported by the proofs or, at the very least, determines the highest award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>reasonable on the proofs in order to adjudge as excessive the amount awarded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We are persuaded that the highest award within a reasonable range based upon our review of the proofs and reinforced by our survey of analogous cases in this and other jurisdictions which can be justified for past and future pain and suffering and for \"humiliation [and] loss of power in [Precopio\u2019s] hand\u201d is $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">While the judge apparently failed to award Precopio damages to reimburse the costs of past medication at some ten dollars per week in the 4-1/2 years from the date of the accident to the time of trial, he did award $8,500 for \"future medications\u201d. As the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals remarked, if Precopio continued to purchase medications in the future at the same rate that he had prior to trial, this amount would sustain him for the next 85 years although the record shows a life expectancy of 33 years. Even if the judge intended the award for \"future <em>medications\u201d </em>to encompass the cost of future medical <em>treatments, </em>the amount of the award still exceeds Precopio\u2019s life expectancy. We reduce the \"future medications\u201d award to $6,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The city also complains that, since the injury and residuals which Precopio sustained in the 1972 collision did not impair his earning capacity, the judge awarded excessive damages of $31,400 for past wage loss and $20,000 for future wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>We cannot say that the judge clearly erred in his computations of past and future wage loss. The judge found that the evidence supported the $31,-400 computation for past wage loss on the basis of testimony by a personnel representative from Precopio\u2019s employer regarding Precopio\u2019s hourly rates and on the basis of Precopio\u2019s testimony regarding the number of hours that he worked each week, including overtime hours. Rather than using any of the measures suggested by Precopio\u2019s counsel in closing argument for future wage loss, the judge apparently concluded that $20,000 would compensate Precopio for the approximately ten work days a year that he would continue to miss due to pain from his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In conclusion the judge clearly erred when he awarded damages which outpaced the proofs. We reduce Precopio\u2019s award to $132,900 and remand for entry of such a judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-7\">Fitzgerald, C.J., and Kavanagh, Williams, Coleman, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b548-8\">Riley, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\"> <em>Precopio v Detroit, </em>94 Mich App 506; 289 NW2d 34 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> See MCL 257.402(a); MSA 9.2102(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\"> <em>Tuttle v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>397 Mich 44, 46; 243 NW2d 244 (1976), quoting <em>United States v United States Gypsum Co, </em>333 US 364, 395; 68 S Ct 525, 542; 92 L Ed 746, 766 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"><em> Tuttle, </em>fn 3 <em>supra, </em>pp 46-47, fn 3; <em>Columbus Pipe &amp; Equipment Co v Sefansky, </em>352 Mich 539, 543; 90 NW2d 492 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> Precopio testified that he had stopped for a red light in the left lane of eastbound Vernor at the intersection of Clark when the bus suddenly struck his automobile in the rear.

Another passenger had just disembarked, and the bus had begun to increase its speed when Precopio\u2019s car passed the bus rapidly and began to fishtail. Precopio\u2019s brake lights went on, and the bus driver \"jam[med] on the brakes\u201d and \"slightly, skidded into the back of the car\u201d. The passenger also testified that he remembered neither an intersection nor a traffic light near the scene of the accident. He subsequently testified that the accident occurred on the other side of the Vernor-Clark intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\">Both sides thus presented testimony not without its weaknesses. The judge evaluated the credibility of the witnesses and did not clearly err in choosing between conflicting accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b530-17\"> See 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), annotations to Rule 518 in cumulative supplement under heading Relief as related to demand for judgment \u2014 amount demanded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> See <em>Weil v Longyear, </em>263 Mich 22, 26; 248 NW. 536 (1933); <em>Watrous v Conor, </em>266 Mich 397, 401; 254 NW 143 (1934); <em>Cleven v Griffin, </em>298 Mich 139, 141; 298 NW 482 (1941); <em>Day v Troyer, </em>341 Mich 189, 201; 67 NW2d 74 (1954); <em>O\u2019Grady v Rydman, </em>347 Mich 606, 612; 81 NW2d 383 (1957); <em>Stevens v Edward C Levy Co, </em>376 Mich 1, 5; 135 NW2d 414 (1965); <em>Stowers v Wolodzko, </em>386 Mich 119, 141-142; 191 NW2d 355 (1971); <em>Moore v Spangler, </em>401 Mich 360, 372; 258 NW2d 34 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> GCR 517.1 acknowledges the \"special opportunity\u201d of the trial judge in assessing the credibility of witnesses.
