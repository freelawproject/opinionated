Except as otherwise provided herein, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed heretofore, which immunity is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">For purposes of this litigation, the principal operative words in the statute, of course, are \"governmental function\u201d. What did the Legislature intend the expression \"governmental function\u201d to mean when it conferred immunity from tort liability upon \"all governmental agencies\u201d for injury resulting from the agencies\u2019 engagement in \"the exercise or discharge\u201d of such functions? The answer to that question has divided this Court for six years. Three tests have emerged from our decisions for determining whether a particular activity is a governmental function within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The first of the tests has come to be known as \"the common good of all\u201d test, and both of the other two, for reasons explained below, have come to be known as the \"essence of governing\u201d tests. Neither expression is found in the governmental immunity statute. They are the result of judicial efforts to distill from the Legislature\u2019s somewhat cryptic statutory language an understandable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>easily applied standard for identifying activities undertaken by agencies of government which the Legislature intends to be immune from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The expression \"common good of all\u201d has been used for more than a half century in cases discussing the doctrine of governmental immunity. Originally, it was intended to distinguish between governmental activity which has an exclusively public purpose as opposed to that which is \"of special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit\u201d. See <em>Bolster v City of Lawrence, </em>225 Mass 387; 114 NE 722 (1917). The expression was first employed in our state\u2019s jurisprudence in cases concerning the immunity or liability of municipal corporations to distinguish between \"governmental\u201d and \"proprietary\u201d municipal functions. <em>Gunther v Cheboygan County Road Comm\u2019rs, </em>225 Mich 619, 621; 196 NW 386 (1923). See also <em>Martinson v Alpena, </em>328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950), and cases cited therein. More recently the expression has been used in governmental immunity cases interpreting MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) to describe the standard by which an activity of a governmental agency is judged to be a governmental function and therefore immune from tort liability at the common law. For example, in <em>Perry v Kalamazoo State Hospital, </em>404 Mich 205, 211-212; 273 NW2d 421 (1978), discussing the immunity or liability of a public hospital, the lead opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\"Furthermore, the operation of a public hospital comes clearly within the frequently cited 'common good of all\u2019 definition of governmental function.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>If the briefs of the parties and amici curiae in this case are any indication, the expression \"common good of all test\u201d is now generally understood by the profession to describe the standard adopted by presently seated Justices Coleman, Williams, and Ryan to describe an activity which is statutorily immune from tort liability because it was immune from such liability at the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The idiom \"essence of governing test\u201d has emerged from our decisions as a shorthand expression to describe another standard to determine whether a specific activity being performed by an agency of government, or at its direction, is the kind of \"governmental function\u201d over which the Legislature has conferred the protection of immunity from tort liability. There is a potential for confusion in the use of that expression because, while the expression is used by Chief Justice Fitzgerald and Justices Kavanagh and Levin to define an immune governmental function, it means something different to them than it did to the late Justice Moody.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The original version of the expression first appeared in our reports in the dissenting opinion of Justices Kavanagh and Fitzgerald, also signed by Justice Levin, in <em>Thomas v State Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>398 Mich 1, 21; 247 NW2d 530 (1976). After first declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\"We conclude that a function is not 'governmental\u2019 in this context unless the particular activity, that this function entails is uniquely associated with the activities having 'no common analogy\" in the private sector\u2019 \u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">the dissenters observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">\"Thus, 'governmental function\u2019 is not delineated by questions of the broad scope of an activity undertaken or by financial or insurance considerations which may be indicative of a governmental undertaking, but rather by viewing the precise action allegedly giving rise to liability, and determining whether such action is <em>sui generis governmental </em>\u2014 of <em>essence to governing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The expression next appeared in Justice Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion in <em>Parker v Highland Park, </em>404 Mich 183, 193; 273 NW2d 413 (1978), again signed only by himself, Justice Kavanagh, and Justice Levin. There it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\"We would limit the term 'governmental function\u2019 to those activities <em>sui generis </em>governmental \u2014 of essence to governing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">\"In adopting the 'of essence to government\u2019 <em>[sic] </em>test for defining the term 'governmental function\u2019, we reject the 'common good of all\u2019 test applied in <em>Martinson v Alpena </em>[328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Since the decision in <em>Thomas, </em>Justice Lindemer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>who subscribed to the \"common good of all\u201d test and voted with the majority in that case, departed the Court and was succeeded by the late Justice Moody. Being unpersuaded by the rationale of the Fitzgerald-Kavanagh-Levin opinion in <em>Parker </em>limiting governmental immunity to activities that have \"no common analogy in the private sector\u201d, and equally unpersuaded by the reasoning and result of the Ryan opinion, also signed by Justice Coleman and Justice Williams, for reaffirmation of the common-law \"common good of all\u201d definition of governmental immunity, Justice Moody wrote separately, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\"To delineate a complete and balanced definition of governmental function within a simplistic format would be presumptuous. However, as a basic guideline, the crux of the governmental essence test should be founded upon the inquiry whether the purpose, planning and carrying out of the activity, due to its unique character or governmental mandate, can be effectively accomplished only by the government. Unless liability would be an unacceptable interference with government\u2019s ability to govern, activities that fall outside this perimeter, although performed by a government agency, are not governmental functions and therefore not immune.\u201d <em>Parker, supra, </em>404 Mich 200.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Having thus narrowed, at least for himself, the \"of essence to governing\u201d or \"essence to government\u201d or \"governmental essence\u201d, or \"essence of governing\u201d test, Justice Moody established still a third view of the meaning of \"governmental function\u201d and a second meaning of the \"essence of governing\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">That three-three-one division of this Court as to the meaning of the legislative expression \"governmental function\u201d recurred in <em>Perry v Kalamazoo State Hospital, supra, </em>which was released with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Parker </em>case. The result in that case was a finding of immunity because Justice Moody, although applying his new definition of \"essence of governing\u201d, found on the facts of the case that the defendant hospital was engaged in a governmental function and thus was immune from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In the wake of our multihued definition of \"governmental function\u201d in Thomas, <em>Parker, </em>and <em>Perry, </em>the \"essence of governing\u201d expression has virtually taken on a life of its own. The Court of Appeals has employed the expression in at least 29 published opinions as the last pronouncement of a majority of this Court as to what is meant by the legislative term \"governmental function\u201d. Until such time as a majority of this Court can agree upon a single meaning for the \"essence to governing\u201d or \"essence of governing\u201d expression, it will have no usefulness in defining the term \"governmental function\u201d as used in the statute and will continue to contribute to the confusion and obfuscation which for six years now have attended the law of governmental immunity in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">This case has been under consideration for some time. All of the members of the Court have attempted to identify a single, workable rule for reasonably easy application which would enable litigants, advocates, judges, students, insurers, legislators, and taxpayers, and all we serve, to predict with reasonable accuracy which governmental activities are immune from tort liability and which are not. Despite special attention during opinion conference to that goal and the best good-faith effort of each member of the Court, it has not been possible to develop majority adherence to such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>It must be left to another day and to either a newly constituted Court or a change of mind among presently seated members, in just the right combination, to enable us to enunciate the definitive rule which we all would welcome.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In the wake of our inability to announce a definitive test for determining whether a specific governmental activity is a governmental function, immune from tort liability, a number of Court of Appeals panels have struggled to formulate a precedentially binding test. Inevitably, of course, there has been disagreement in that Court just as in our own, and no single test has emerged. As an innovative and logical alternative, several panels of the Court of Appeals have treated Justice Moody\u2019s version of the \"essence of governing\u201d test as though it were the rule, not because any other member of this Court has subscribed to it \u2014 none has \u2014 but because, as a practical matter, on the facts of a particular case, Justice Moody, employing his own test, was probably the tie-breaker for determining whether an activity is a \"governmental function\u201d. That is what occurred in the decisions of <em>Perry </em>and <em>Parker, supra. </em>In this litigation, therefore, after reviewing the differences between the Fitzgerald-Kavanagh-Levin version of the \"essence of governing\u201d test, and Justice Moody\u2019s version, the Court of Appeals panel below stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">\"Justice Moody\u2019s analysis becomes critical at this particular stage in the development of the immunity doctrine because he has emerged as the \u2019swing vote\u2019 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>questions of the application of governmental immunity. If a given fact situation would satisfy his definition of 'governmental function\u2019, then it would most likely satisfy Justices Fitzgerald, Kavanagh, and Levin as well. In <em>Parker, </em>application of his analysis led him to agree with Justices Fitzgerald, Kavanagh, and Levin that the day-to-day operations of a municipal general hospital were not unique to government nor pursuant to a governmental mandate, and as a result, not shielded from liability. In <em>Perry, </em>on the other hand, Justice Moody\u2019s approach led him to reach the same result as Justices Coleman, Ryan, and Williams, upholding the immunity of a state mental hospital.\u201d 93 Mich App 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\"Anyone who has witnessed our attempts in this state to formulate a rule for easy application can attest to the frustrations and divisions in opinion that result. The doctrine continues in flux, and we cannot be certain that the analysis we apply today will remain applicable tomorrow. Yet it is significant that a majority of our Supreme Court now recognizes that the proper application of the immunity doctrine requires it to be limited to those activities of essence to government.\u201d 93 Mich App 699-700.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">It is evident, therefore, that in terms of attempting to assemble from our fragmented plurality a workable rule of law for decision in this case and guidance to the bar and trial judiciary, it cannot be said in the technical sense that the Court of Appeals \"erred in applying the 'essence of governing\u2019 test\u201d since it was an idiom adopted by a majority of four members of this Court, albeit for different reasons. We would hold that it erred, however, not in the test applied, but in the <em>manner </em>in which the test was applied and consequently in the result reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We are compelled to express first of all our fundamental disagreement with either version of the \"essence of governing\u201d test, and we reassert our conviction that the \"common good of all\u201d standard correctly measures whether a particular activity is a governmental function. Moreover, even assuming for the sake of argument that the Court of Appeals did not err in selecting Justice Moody\u2019s \"essence of governing\u201d test from the choices available, we are of the view that the panel misapplied the test with the result that it erred in concluding that the activity in which the drainage district was engaged when Ross was injured was not a \"governmental function\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Our view of the correct test for determining the question before us was announced in <em>Perry </em>and <em>Parker. </em>It is, to reiterate, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\"At common law, the expression 'governmental function\u2019 was the term of art which both described the nature and defined the limits of state and municipal immunity from tort liability. By employing that same term of art in creating statutory immunity, the Legislature appears to have directed the courts to look to the common law for guidance in determining whether, in a given case, a governmental agency is exercising or discharging a 'governmental function\u2019 \u201d. 404 Mich 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">\"A review of the case law of governmental immunity that existed prior to the legislative affirmation of the state\u2019s immunity provides guidance to this Court in two respects. First, the factual questions resolved in those decisions provide concrete examples of the specific activities contemplated by the Legislature when employing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the term 'governmental function\u2019. Second, that case law provides a definition of the term 'governmental function\u2019.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 404 Mich 211.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\"Furthermore, the operation of a public hospital comes clearly within the frequently cited 'common good of all\u2019 definition of governmental function.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">We turn then to ascertain whether, at the common law, the construction of a drain by a governmental agency<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was a \"governmental function\u201d immune from tort liability in the sense that it was an activity for the \"common good of all\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">There is no Michigan case which deals directly with the immunity or liability of a drainage district for tortious acts committed in the process of drain construction. There is early, indeed ancient, Michigan authority standing for the proposition that a municipality did not enjoy immunity from liability for injuries suffered when a citizen fell into an unprotected sewer under construction. <em>Detroit v Corey, </em>9 Mich 165, 184 (1861). The essence of the Court\u2019s reasoning was that the power granted to the city to build sewers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\"was not a power given to the city for governmental purposes, or a public municipal duty imposed on the city, as to keep its streets in repair, or the like, but a special legislative grant to the city for private purposes. The sewers of the city, like its works for supplying the city with water, are the private property of the city\u2014 they belong to the city. The corporation and its corpora-tors, the citizens, are alone interested in them \u2014 the outside public or people of the state at large have no interest in them, as they have in the streets of the city, which are public highways.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">With similar reasoning, the Court in <em>Ostrander v Lansing, 111 </em>Mich 693; 70 NW 332 (1897), held the City of Lansing liable to one of its workers for injuries resulting from a cave-in during the excavation phase of the construction of a sewer. The <em>Ostrander </em>Court rejected the contention that \"the construction of the sewer was the exercise of a governmental function\u201d and cited the above-quoted language from <em>Corey </em>for the proposition that the sewer construction was \"a private municipal enterprise\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\"><em>Corey </em>and <em>Ostrander, </em>and cases like them, seem, therefore, at first glance to stand as precedent for the proposition that construction of a sewer, and by analogy a drain, is not a governmental function as that expression has been employed historically in the law of governmental immunity. However, closer examination of those cases and of the fitful and arcane development of the law of governmental immunity, particularly municipal immunity, reveals that no such conclusion may properly be drawn. <em>Corey </em>and <em>Ostrander </em>are products of a time when the immunity of municipalities for misfeasance was in certain respects the exception rather than the rule. At the time, there was the widely held notion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\"that the special grant of governmental powers to a municipal corporation, normally made at the request of the incorporators, constituted consideration for an implied obligation on the corporation\u2019s part to perform its duties in a proper way and that this implied obligation was for the benefit of individuals injured by [misfeasance], as well as for the benefit of the public at large.\u201d Cooperrider, <em>The Court, the Legislature, and Governmental Tort Liability in Michigan, </em>72 Mich L Rev 187, 197 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Thus, the liability of municipalities turned in part on whether the activity in question was for the benefit of only the local community (liability) or was instead for the benefit of the state (immunity). There came to be a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\"distinction between functions performed by local officials as agents of state policy and functions that relate instead to the 'private\u2019 or parochial concerns of the local community.\u201d Cooperrider, <em>supra, </em>213.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The terms \"governmental\u201d and \"public\u201d came to be associated with activities that were seen as being the business of the state, which were conducted, by definition, for the benefit of the people of the state at large. These activities were contrasted to \"private\u201d or \"corporate\u201d activities, which benefitted only the residents of the municipality (the corporation). The distinction was based on the identity of the governmental entity to which a particular activity was thought to be properly entrusted rather than the nature of the activity itself, which is the consideration at the core of what came to be the distinction between governmental and proprietary functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Accordingly, <em>Corey </em>and <em>Ostrander </em>can be distinguished on the ground that the defendants in those cases were municipalities and the cases were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>decided on that basis. MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) was meant to bring into uniformity the liability of all governmental entities; the criterion has become the nature of the activity in question rather than the identity of the governmental entity entrusted with carrying out that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We are left, therefore, without any applicable Michigan case precedent directly determining whether construction of a storm sewer is an activity for the \"common good of all\u201d, and therefore a governmental function for the performance of which a governmental agency is immune from tort liability at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Reference to cases in foreign jurisdictions is equally unhelpful. There is notable inconsistency both in the manner in which the question before us has been treated in other states and the rules of law governing decisions elsewhere. For every case that can be found in a sister jurisdiction for the conclusion that a municipal or quasi-municipal government is immune from liability for damages caused by negligence in sewer or drain construction, another case can be found reaching the contrary result. Sometimes decisions are reached on consideration of the doctrine of governmental immunity and sometimes not. Often, the complicating aspect of the law of nuisance is introduced into the decisions of other states. It suffices to say that there is no discernible predominating thread of foreign authority construing a governmental immunity statute comparable to Michigan\u2019s to provide meaningful guidance in the resolution of the question before us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We undertake then to analyze the nature of the activity involved in this case to determine whether it is for the \"common good of all\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Because this case is before us on an appeal from a reversal of a summary judgment, there is no factual record from which we can learn the details of the size, location, and immediate necessity of the drain in question, the topography of the area in which it has been built, or the manner in which it complements other sewage and drainage facilities in Jackson County. It is clear, however, that the drain was being constructed under the authority of a governmental entity, the John Saines Project 1 Drainage District, and under the direction of the drain commissioner, Wendell Gee. As such, it was a public project authorized, conceived, designed, financed, and constructed, and now maintained, by authority of legislative enactment, the Drain Code of 1956, MCL 280.1; MSA 11.1001, of which more will be said below. We can and do take judicial notice that the purpose of such a drain is necessarily public in the sense that it is intended to serve the general public interest as distinguished from an essentially private interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The Legislature has explicitly declared that drains are to be \"located, established, constructed and maintained\u201d by \"a county drain commissioner\u201d, as was the case here, \"whenever the same shall be conducive to the public health, convenience and welfare\u201d. MCL 280.2; MSA 11.1002. Plainly, that is a mandate intended to serve the common good of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The drain in question was planned, designed, and constructed, and is maintained, not as a benefit to a single private landowner or group of landowners, but as part of a comprehensive state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>wide system of water management control mandated by the Legislature in the Drain Code. While that legislation authorizes the establishment of local drainage districts for the planning, funding, and construction of such drains, the entire process is tightly controlled and circumscribed by the highly detailed and pervasive Drain Code having statewide application. As is evident from an examination of the lengthy and detailed statute, the purpose of each public drain, among the thousands of such drains in the state, is to collect and move storm and waste water in a certain direction, at an appropriate rate, through facilities designed and engineered to guard against disease, flooding, and property damage. The drain here in question is such a drain and was built therefore for the protection of all the citizens and the benefit of all the property in the State of Michigan. For these reasons, together with those discussed more fully in Part IIC, we think it is plain that such a purpose is \"for the common good of all\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Even if we were not convinced of the correctness of the \"common good of all\u201d test, but subscribed instead to our late brother Moody\u2019s version of the \"essence of governing\u201d test for identifying a governmental function, we would reach the same result in this case, a result contrary to that reached by the Court of Appeals. Moreover, if the activity involved in this case is a \"governmental function\u201d according to Justice Moody\u2019s definition, it necessarily is one conducted \"for the common good of all\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">As indicated in his separate opinion in <em>Parker, supra, </em>p 200, our brother described the test to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>which he subscribed, and we repeat it here for ease of reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\"To delineate a complete and balanced definition of governmental function within a simplistic format would be presumptuous. However, as a basic guideline, <em>the crux of the governmental essence test should be founded upon the inquiry whether the purpose, planning and carrying out of the activity, due to its unique character or governmental mandate, can be effectively accomplished only by the government. </em>Unless liability would be an unacceptable interference with government\u2019s ability to govern, activities that fall outside this perimeter, although performed by a government agency, are not governmental functions and therefore not immune.\u201d (Moody, J., <em>concurring). </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Accepting, for the sake of discussion, that our late colleague\u2019s test is the correct standard for determining whether the activity in question in this case was a governmental function, we think it is evident that it was, and that the drainage district is therefore clothed with immunity from tort liability for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff Michael Ross.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Analyzed under Justice Moody\u2019s criteria, the question before us becomes whether the laying out, designing, financing, construction, and maintenance of a public drain is an \"activity\u201d, the \"purpose, planning and carrying out\u201d of which, \"due to its unique character or governmental mandate\u201d, can be effectively accomplished only by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The Court of Appeals answered that question in the negative because it determined that \"the <em>construction </em>of a drain may be effectively accomplished by others than the government\u201d. 93 Mich App 698. We think, however, that it will not do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>simply to focus, as the Court of Appeals did, upon the \"construction\u201d of a drain and conclude that such an activity is not governmental because it can be effectively accomplished by persons in the private sector. Of course that is so, if \"construction\u201d is narrowly defined as only the actual labor involved in the excavation, grading, laying of the drain tile or pipe, masonry work, backfilling of the drain site, removal of construction equipment, and the workers\u2019 departure from the project. Certainly all \"construction\u201d of any public project \"may be effectively accomplished by others than the government\u201d, and it usually is. The construction work on virtually all governmental projects, including buildings, bridges, sewers, highways, reservoirs, and other public projects is usually performed by private contractors to whom a construction contract has been awarded on a bid. Indeed, that was the case here. Michael Ross\u2019s employer, Dunigan Brothers, Inc., was hired by the drainage district to build the drain. The \"activity\u201d which the governmental agency was engaged in here was the creation of the John Saines Drain. It was a process which began with an idea and ultimately ended with departure from the construction site of the men and machines used in the construction phase of the drain building project. The countless intermediate steps, however, included planning, conferences, bid letting, engineering surveys, financing arrangements, preparation of drawings, public meetings, land surveys, soil borings, site preparation, and a host of other mental, physical, and mechanical functions culminating in the first flow of water through the new drain. To properly apply the test announced by Justice Moody and purportedly applied by the Court of Appeals below, one does not focus merely upon the labor involved in the construction phase of the project in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>answer the question whether the purpose, planning, and carrying out of the \"activity\u201d, due to its unique character or governmental mandate, can be effectively accomplished only by the government. The proper focus is much broader and should embrace the entire \"activity\u201d: creation of a public drain from conception to completion, including all of the necessary intermediate steps. That is particularly true in this case where the size, location, and direction of the water flow of the drain is part of an interdependent network of drains throughout the state, having common purposes, and built under the coordinating mandate of a state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We turn to consider whether the activity in question, more particularly its purpose, planning, and execution, due to its uniqueness or to governmental mandate, \"can be effectively accomplished only by the government\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Certainly it is obvious that the planning, engineering, construction, and maintenance of a single and isolated storm or waste water drain is not an activity which can be effectively carried on only by the government. Undoubtedly, there are many storm drains in the state which were privately financed and built, and were designed primarily to serve the convenience of the property owners who built them. That is particularly so in the less populous rural areas of this state. There is nothing about drain construction per se which is indigenous to government or implicates uniquely governmental interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In reality, however, the thousands of public drains situated throughout the state must, in the totality, serve a common purpose: to provide for the healthful, efficient, safe, and systematic drainage and flow of storm and waste water in a man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ner conducive to the health and welfare of the people of the State of Michigan. If each landowner were left to provide or to refuse to provide drainage of surface and waste water in a fashion and in a direction which he saw fit, the risk of disease and the threat of serious property damage, environmental contamination, and danger to natural resources would be imminent, evident, and unacceptably high.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">As early as 1915 this Court stated in <em>Cilley v </em>Sullivan, 187 Mich 447, 453; 153 NW 773 (1915):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\"As the state has become more populous, and with the progress of scientific thought and investigation, the question of the public health has become more and more recognized as a question of vital interest to the State at large, and it needs no argument to demonstrate that proper drainage is one of the very essential prerequisites to the creation of proper sanitary and healthful conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">More recently, the people of this state, in Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 52, declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\"The conservation and development of the natural resources of the state are hereby declared to be of paramount public concern in the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the people. The legislature shall provide for the protection of the air, water and other natural resources of the state from pollution, impairment and destruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">As noted by the Oakland County Drain Commissioner in his brief amicus curiae:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">\"The practical purpose for the construction of any county drain is to conserve and protect the natural resources of the state. Without the protection afforded by modern storm drainage facilities, large areas of the state would be exposed to severe pollution, impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and destruction from storms and natural drainage flows which cannot be accommodated by existing natural drainage patterns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The interdependence of the state\u2019s network of storm drains and waste water control systems is an important indication of the fact that the design, layout, construction, and maintenance of such a system is a function uniquely appropriate to government and is most effectively carried on by it. While it is conceivable that a person or a community might choose to live without electric power or natural gas, such a decision need have little, if any, impact upon neighboring communities. However, the failure of a private landowner, or an entire community, to collect, divert, and dispose of storm and waste water through a public drain system, carefully coordinated statewide to guard against health hazards and property damage, could have a disastrous effect upon neighboring communities which make use of common lakes, streams, and ground water. Thus, although it is obvious that there may be many instances in the state of privately planned, financed, and constructed drains, the fact remains that on a statewide basis the functions which the drains are designed to accomplish could not be assured without the coordinating and coercive power of government. In a state of nine million people, it would be impossible, for example, to assure the existence of a surface water control system adequate to meet the health and safety needs of the people and the integrity of the environment without compulsory public financing of drain construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">What is written here about the governmental character of the activity involved in this case must be understood to apply with equal force to the construction of a small storm water drain in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>remote rural area of our state and to the complex and massive water and pollution control system for the highly populous urban areas of our state.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We agree with the observation made by amicus curiae City of Detroit that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\"In the case of the construction and operation of modern water and/or sewage systems, government\u2019s role is pervasive. The vast majority of water and sewage systems in Michigan are constructed, owned and operated by government. This observation is underscored when urban areas are considered, for all such areas are serviced by large, sophisticated and integrated water and sewage systems, constructed, owned and operated by government. The haphazard and sporadic efforts of privately owned companies could not begin to satisfy the public\u2019s demand for water and sewage systems in these areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\"Such activity, moreover, furthers an express public policy since it is essential to the protection of the public health, and * * * is mandated by federal and state statutes. The construction and operation of modern sewage and water systems is supported by substantial annual appropriations of tax revenues. Finally, the magnitude and complexity of the modern water and/or sewage system gives it a unique character and furthers an express governmental mandate, such that it can only be 'effectively\u2019 accomplished by government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">A further indication that the purpose, planning, and. carrying out of an interdependent statewide storm water drain construction and maintenance system \"can be effectively accomplished only by government\u201d is the size of the fiscal commitment necessary to sustain such a system.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Amicus curiae City of Detroit represents to this Court that in 1980 the total cost of the capital improvement program for the six-county southeastern Michigan regional pollution abatement system was 252 million dollars; of that amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>184.8 million dollars was provided by federal and state governments. In that same year, the total operation and maintenance cost for the Detroit waste water treatment system, adjusted for inflation, was in excess of 75 million dollars, a substantial portion of which was paid by federal and state government. While the Detroit water pollution abatement system involves a massive and complex system for sewage disposal, and the John Saines Drain apparently does not, the point remains, nevertheless, that in the densely populated urban areas of the state, storm and waste water collection, drainage, and purification must be a coordinated and integral part of a massive multimillion dollar overall system for water management in order to guard against disease, property damage, and environmental contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">A comprehensive statewide system of drains which can collect and move storm and waste water in the direction and at a rate which will protect the people of the state from the risk of disease, flooding, and damage to public and private property, and which will preserve and enhance the environment and tend to preserve natural resources, is a function uniquely appropriate to a coordinating state government, specifically charged constitutionally with protecting the health and welfare of all citizens. Furthermore, they are functions specifically mandated by the Legislature in the Drain Code, pursuant to which the drain was built.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Upon examination of the Drain Code, one is immediately struck by the pervasiveness of the role of the state and local government in the planning, constructing, financing, maintenance, and operation of a drainage system for the state. The code is a comprehensive law providing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>county drainage districts, prescribing the duties of county drain commissioners, and providing for the establishment, construction, and maintenance of drains, the levying and collection of drain taxes, and related matters. The lengthy and highly detailed provisions of the statutory scheme suggest the importance to the public health and welfare of the proper drainage of public and private lands. The sweep of the statute can be appreciated at a glance by reference to the preamble of the law which states its purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\"An act to codify the laws relating to the laying out of drainage districts, the consolidation of drainage districts, the construction and maintenance of drains, sewers, pumping equipment, bridges, culverts, fords, and such structures and mechanical devices as will properly purify the flow of such drains; to provide for flood control projects; to provide for water management, water management districts, and subdistricts, and for flood control and drainage projects within such district; to provide for the assessment and collection of taxes; to provide for the investment of funds; to authorize public corporations to impose taxes for the payment of assessments in anticipation of which bonds are issued; to provide for the issuance of bonds by drainage districts and for the pledge of the full faith and credit of counties for payment of such bonds; to authorize counties to impose taxes when necessary to pay principal and interest on bonds for which full faith and credit is pledged; to validate certain acts and bonds; and to prescribe penalties for violations of the provisions of this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Thus, it is clear that, while permitting the existence of some private drains, the Legislature has seen fit virtually to pre-empt the field of planning, design, construction, and maintenance of storm and waste water drains in this state by enacting mandatory provisions in the Drain Code coordinat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ing the location, construction, and financing of drains, and even authorizing the condemnation of property for their construction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The statute is a persuasive indication that, in the judgment of the Legislature, to which we owe considerable deference, the coordinating effect of a compulsory state law is necessary to assure the preservation of \"the public health, convenience and welfare\u201d in connection with the construction and maintenance of such drains.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We are of the view, therefore, that whether measured by the notion that the construction of the drain in question was for the \"common good of all\u201d, or by the standard that \"the purpose, planning and carrying out of the activity\u201d in question \"due to its unique character or governmental mandate, can be effectively accomplished only by the government\u201d, the conclusion is inescapable that the activity in which the drainage district was engaged at the time of plaintiff Michael Ross\u2019s injury was a \"governmental function\u201d for which the district is immune from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-8\">Williams and Coleman, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b95-9\">Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae6\"><em>(for affirmance). </em>There are many activities contributing to the common good which are engaged in by state agencies.

As in the case of supplying water, power, transportation and other services sometimes supplied by public utilities, however, the fact that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>state agency engages in an activity does not convert the activity into a function of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Accordingly we would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-7\">Fitzgerald, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b96-8\">The late Justice Blair Moody, Jr., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-14\"> In the order granting leave to appeal, we specifically directed the parties \u201cto include among the issues to be briefed: whether the Court of Appeals erred by applying the 'essence of governing\u2019 test in determining that the third-party defendant drainage district\u2019s activity in the instant case did not enjoy governmental immunity\u201d. 408 Mich 959.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\"3 ' \u201cThe underlying test is whether the act is for the common good of all without the element of special corporate benefit or pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>profit.
