We hold that the acquittals do not require that the convictions be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Hunt was convicted of attempted breaking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>entering<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and of felony-firearm. He contends that the trial judge erred in refusing a requested instruction that, should the jury acquit him of the underlying felony, it could not convict him of felony-firearm. We hold that the judge did not err in refusing to so instruct.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The trial judges set aside Lewis\u2019 and Johnson\u2019s felony-firearm convictions on the ground that the verdicts were inconsistent, and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the authority of its opinion in <em>People v Vaughn, </em>92 Mich App 742; 285 NW2d 444 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed Hunt\u2019s convictions. It concluded, however, that the trial judge had erred in refusing to give the requested instruction, because the language of the statute \"indicates that a defendant cannot be convicted of felony-firearm unless he is also convicted of the underlying felony\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it found that the error was harmless. The Court suggested an instruction for future cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The people, although satisfied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the result, sought leave to appeal because of the suggested instruction. Given that we were granting leave to appeal in <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>we granted leave to appeal in <em>Hunt </em>as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">These consolidated appeals present the following issues: (1) Where a defendant charged with an underlying felony and felony-firearm is not convicted of the underlying felony or any lesser offense but is convicted of felony-firearm, may the conviction stand? (2) Must a trial judge instruct a jury that, if it acquits on the underlying felony and all lesser offenses, it must acquit on the felony-firearm charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We hold that the asserted inconsistencies in verdicts do not invalidate the convictions of felony-firearm. We reverse the Court of Appeals in <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>reinstate the convictions of felony-firearm, and remand to the trial courts for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">We affirm the Court of Appeals in <em>Hunt, </em>but we disagree with its reasoning. The trial judge did not err in refusing to instruct that the jury must acquit on the felony-firearm charge if it acquits on the felony charge. We disapprove of the instructions proposed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Lewis and Johnson contend that the verdicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>were inconsistent because conviction on a felony charge must precede conviction on a charge of felony-firearm. The people contend, on the authority of this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>People v Vaughn, </em>409 Mich 463; 295 NW2d 354 (1980) (reversing the Court of Appeals decision relied on by that Court in <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Johnson), </em>that this Court permits seemingly inconsistent verdicts and that the acquittals do not require reversal of the felony-firearm convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In <em>Vaughn, </em>a jury convicted the defendant of felonious assault, but acquitted him of felony-firearm. The people\u2019s evidence tended to show that the defendant had committed a felonious assault with a revolver; however, the defendant denied having a gun and making an assault, and the people offered no gun in evidence. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, in convicting the defendant of felonious assault, the jury must have decided \"that a gun did exist\u201d and in acquitting him of felony-firearm \"must necessarily have determined the nonexistence of the gun. Thus the verdicts are inconsistent\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because of the inconsistency, the Court of Appeals vacated defendant\u2019s conviction of felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In reversing, this Court noted that federal and many state courts do not require consistency in jury verdicts on several counts of a multi-count indictment. Additionally, this Court said that \"[j]uries are not held to any rules of logic\u201d and have the power to acquit as a matter of leniency. Merely because the jury has the power to \"release a defendant from some of the consequences of his act\u201d, it does not follow that the jury intends to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\"absolv[e] him from all responsibility\u201d. 409 Mich 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">When a jury responds to a multi-count indictment, lawyers and judges are often tempted to reconcile the verdicts, to strive for some rational compatibility. But to do so imposes an artificial gloss on jury verdicts. Narrowly viewed, a jury\u2019s acquittal on one charge in a multi-count indictment signals no more than the jurors\u2019 agreement not to convict on that charge for whatever reason satisfactory to them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The inconsistency in the instant verdicts suggests that the juries either compromised or were lenient.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>If the jury was lenient, the defendant was not prejudiced by the inconsistency in the verdicts and has no cause for complaint. In that hypothesis, although 12 jurors agreed that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the underlying felony, they nonetheless extended mercy, convicting him only of what they may have thought was a lesser offense instead of both.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The defendant may, however, have been prejudiced if the jury compromised. If it compromised, there is the risk that some of the jurors who agreed to the compromise did not believe beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>reasonable doubt that the defendant committed a felony, but nonetheless agreed to convict the defendant of felony-firearm (although commission of a felony is an element) in exchange for the agreement of other jurors to acquit the defendant of the underlying felony. If that is what occurred, then the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on both charges. The remedy, where a jury is unable to agree on a unanimous verdict, is not dismissal of the charges, but the declaration of a mistrial, and the defendant can be required to stand trial again on the charges in respect to which the jurors are unable to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The defendants do not, however, seek new trials, but instead seek dismissal of the felony-firearm convictions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendants argue that a verdict of not guilty on the felony charge represents a finding by the jury that the defendant did not commit the felony, and since he did not commit the felony he cannot be guilty of felony-firearm. But that is to look at the matter from only one side. The conviction of felony-firearm may be read as an implicit finding that the defendant did commit the felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Because we see no reason to regard differently for this purpose the express finding of not guilty of the underlying felony and the implicit finding of guilty of the underlying felony, the defendants are not entitled to have their convictions of felony-firearm set aside on the premise that the acquittals of the felony charges were findings that they did not commit the underlying felonies inexorably requiring that the felony-firearm convictions be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The jury, to repeat, either was lenient or compromised. If the former, the defendant has no cause for complaint. But if the jury compromised, the finding that the defendant did not commit the underlying felony was part and parcel of that jury compromise which, in convicting the defendant of felony-firearm, implicitly found that the defendant did commit the underlying felony. A compromise is indivisible. We cannot properly enforce only part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">It is contended that the language of the felony-firearm statute<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> requires that sentencing for conviction of a felony is a prerequisite for imposition of the sentence for felony-firearm with the consequence that where, as here, the people have not secured a conviction for a felony no sentence can be imposed for felony-firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Although the Legislature no doubt contemplated that a person convicted of felony-firearm would also have been convicted of an underlying felony, it made commission or the attempt to commit a felony and not conviction of a felony an element of felony-firearm. See Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Having in mind the legislative purpose to provide separate punishment for carrying a firearm in the commission of or attempt to commit a felony,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we are satisfied that it is both within the letter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the statute<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the spirit of the legislative purpose to construe the statute as providing for the imposition of sentence in a case where the jury convicts of felony-firearm but acquits of the underlying felony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It would not be consistent with the legislative purpose in enacting the felony-firearm statute to conclude that it intended that a felony-firearm conviction be set aside and no punishment at all be imposed in a case where the jury, extending leniency or compromising, failed to convict of the underlying felony, but did convict of felony-firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The people contend that the Court of Appeals erred in declaring in <em>Hunt </em>that the judge should have instructed, as requested by Hunt\u2019s lawyer, \"that if they acquit the defendant of the underlying felony count, they cannot convict of felony-firearm\u201d. The Court of Appeals nevertheless found the error to be harmless because Hunt had been convicted of both the felony charge and felony-firearm. We agree with the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">While the felony-firearm statute makes commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>sion or the attempt to commit a felony an element of the offense of felony-firearm, it does not make conviction of a felony or of an attempt to commit a felony an element of the offense. The statute is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The judge may and should instruct the jury that a person cannot be convicted of felony-firearm unless the jury finds that \"he committed] or attempted] to commit a felony\u201d. Because conviction of a felony or of an attempt to commit a felony is not an element of the offense, the jury may not be instructed that it must convict of an underlying felony in order to convict of felony-firearm.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Reversed in <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>and remanded for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Affirmed in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b522-5\">Fitzgerald, C.J., and Williams, Coleman, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-13\"> Kenneth Lewis was charged with second-degree murder.

The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">\"Had the jury thought that its exercise of mercy [in convicting on only one or two counts] would provide defendant with a basis for claiming that he could not be sentenced for the crimes of which he was found guilty, it is quite possible that there would have been guilty verdicts on all * * * charges.\u201d 459 P2d 85.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">See also <em>United States v Carbone, </em>378 F2d 420, 422 (CA 2, 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b516-15\"> Another view of the jury\u2019s verdict is that the jury was confused, did not understand the instructions, and did not know what it was doing. If that is what occurred, then the confusion taints the verdict finding the defendant not guilty of the underlying felony as well as the verdict finding him guilty of felony-firearm. Jury confusion is not a reason to set aside the verdict of conviction and to uphold the verdict of acquittal, but rather would argue for setting aside both verdicts, with a new trial on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">We have considered the possibility that the jury concluded that the defendant had not committed a felony but convicted him because the jurors concluded that the defendant was a bad man who should be punished. While that is possible, it is possible in any case where a defendant is convicted. The inconsistency in the verdicts does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>.suggest that that is what occurred. If the appellate courts were to set aside a verdict because of the possibility that the defendant was convicted not because he was found to have committed the charged offense but because the jury thought that he deserved to be punished, few if any convictions would be sustained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\"> This Court has recognized that a jury has the power \"to release a defendant from some of the consequences of his act without absolving him of all responsibility\u201d. <em>Vaughn, supra, </em>409 Mich 466. See also <em>Dunn v United States, </em>284 US 390, 393; 52 S Ct 189; 76 L Ed 356 (1932), quoting with approval the opinion of Judge Hand in <em>Steckler v United States, </em>7 F2d 59, 60 (CA 2, 1925). The jury speaks as \"the voice of the country\u201d. 2 Pollock &amp; Maitland, History of English Law, p 623; <em>United States v Maybury, </em>274 F2d 899 (CA 2, 1960). Even when the facts are undisputed, a jury may return a verdict which reflects an interpretation of the evidence which differs from a judge\u2019s. <em>Horning v Dist of Columbia, </em>254 US 135, 138-139; 41 S Ct 53; 65 L Ed 185 (1920). See also <em>People v Chamblis, </em>395 Mich 408, 420; 236 NW2d 473 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">\"Because the jury is the sole judge of <em>all </em>the facts, it can choose, without any apparent logical basis, what to believe and what to disbelieve. What may appeal to the judge as 'undisputed\u2019 need not be believed by a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Some have gone so far as to argue that it is the power of the jury to disregard law and facts that justifies retention of juries in criminal cases: from that power flows the flexibility necessary to prevent injustice, for the collective judgment of a cross-section of the community can most properly determine the injustice of a general rule as applied to a particular case. Wigmore, <em>A Program for the Trial of Jury Trial, </em>12 J Am Jud Soc 166 (1929).
