The agreements are on forms specifically approved by the Michigan Commissioner of Insurance and are executed in furtherance of the legislative intent to foster arbitration of disputes among \"health care providers\u201d, hospitals, and patients as provided in the medical malpractice arbitration act of 1975, MCL 600.5040 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.5040 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">Defendant, Dr. M. S. Piskin, appealed the circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss or to compel arbitration. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the circuit court. Plaintiffs, Jacqualine Kukowski and Clement Kukowski, now challenge the decision of the Court of Appeals which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>held the agreements signed by Jacqualine Kukowski to be unambiguous and obliged her to arbitrate any dispute which arose \"out of or in connection with the health care rendered * * * by [the] hospital, its employees and [the] independent staff doctors * * * who [had] agreed to arbitrate\u201d. I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Defendant entered this case as a consultant when there arose a suspicion that Jacqualine Kukowski might have tuberculosis. The doctor prescribed ethambutol, an admittedly appropriate drug per se for treatment of tuberculosis. It was administered by defendant in St. Mary\u2019s Hospital and was continued on an outpatient basis at Kent Community Hospital. Plaintiffs brought suit against defendant alleging negligence and malpractice in the failure to warn of or examine for the known adverse effects of the drug. Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint filed in the Kent Circuit Court that Jacqualine Kukowski lost her vision as a result of defendant\u2019s negligence. They also submitted the matter for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The matter comes to the Supreme Court as an interlocutory appeal, so neither the facts nor the trial procedure concerning the alleged injury is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The core question is whether Jacqualine Kukowski is bound to arbitrate her claim against defendant by certain agreements which she signed upon admission to each of the hospitals. Plaintiffs claim that the agreements bound Mrs. Kukowski to arbitrate disputes only with the hospitals which submitted the forms to her, and that a separate agreement would have been necessary to bind her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>with respect to defendant. Defendant contends that his agreements with the hospitals to arbitrate disputes arising out of inpatient or outpatient health care in the hospitals (more fully set forth below) and Jacqualine Kukowski\u2019s agreements to arbitrate disputes with \"independent staff doctors and consultants who have agreed to arbitrate\u201d are binding upon her in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The patient signed two agreements with Kent Community Hospital and one with St. Mary\u2019s Hospital. One agreement with Kent was a \"Hospital Out-Patient Form\u201d. The others were \"Hospital InPatient, Out-Patient Surgery and Emergency Room Form[s]\u201d. All forms were approved by the Michigan Commissioner of Insurance. The agreements<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were essentially the same and provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\"I understand that this hospital and I by signing this document agree to arbitrate any claims or disputes (except for disputes over charges for services rendered) which may arise in the future out of or in connection with the health care rendered to me during this hospital stay and/or emergency room visit by this hospital, its employees and those of its independent staff doctors and consultants who have agreed to arbitrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">\"I understand that this agreement to arbitrate is binding on me and all my agents, representatives and heirs and assigns, as well as on this hospital, its employees and those of its independent staff doctors, and consultants who have agreed to arbitrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The defendant was an independent staff doctor who had agreed to arbitrate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Plaintiffs emphasize the beginning of the first sentence of the agreement Jacqualine Kukowski signed: \"I <em>understand that this hospital and I </em>by signing this document agree to arbitrate any claims\u201d. They argue that this language is clear and unambiguous in showing that the agreement is only between the hospital and Jacqualine Kukowski and that the defendant is not a party to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The agreement, however, must be viewed in the context of the medical malpractice arbitration act of 1975, MCL 600.5040 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.5040 <em>et seq. </em>The act applies to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\"[T]he arbitration of a dispute, controversy, or issue arising out of or resulting from injury to, or the death of, a person caused by an error, omission, or negligence in the performance of professional services by a health care provider, hospital, or their agent\u201d. MCL 600.5040(1); MSA 27A.5040(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The definition of \"health care provider\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> includes defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The act describes two types of arbitration. The first is an agreement with a health care provider who is not the employee of a hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\"A person who receives health care from a health care provider may, if offered, execute an agreement to arbitrate a dispute, controversy, or issue arising out of health care or treatment by a health care provider who is not an employee of a hospital.\u201d MCL 600.5041(1); MSA 27A.504(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The second is an agreement with a hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\"A person who receives health care in a hospital may execute an agreement to arbitrate a dispute, controversy, or issue arising out of health care or treatment rendered by the hospital.\u201d MCL 600.5042(1); MSA 27A.5042(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the hospital\u2019s arbitration agreement that Jacqualine Kukowski signed does not extend to a non-employee health care provider. The medical malpractice arbitration act clearly provides otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\"Notwithstanding the continuing existence of a health care provider-patient arbitration agreement <em>all surgical and medical procedures performed by a participating health care provider in a hospital shall be covered by the terms and conditions applicable to the agreement between the patient and the hospital. </em>Post-discharge treatment in the health care provider\u2019s office subsequent to discharge from such institution will be governed by the terms of any existing health care provider-patient arbitration agreement.\u201d MCL 600.5042(5); MSA 27A.5042(5). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>This statute unambiguously states that the agreement between the hospital and patient extends to participating health care providers for the medical procedures which they perform in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Plaintiffs assert two reasons why MCL 600.5042(5); MSA 27A.5042(5) is not controlling. First, they contend that the defendant\u2019s allegedly negligent conduct ought not be characterized as <em>\"surgical and medical procedures\u201d </em>within the meaning of MCL 600.5042(5); MSA 27A.5042(5). By the same reasoning, one could argue that when a physician is negligent or engages in malpractice the physician\u2019s activities are not \"the performance of professional services\u201d. The argument, however, would render the entire act meaningless in light of its stated application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\"The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to the arbitration of a dispute, controversy, or issue arising out of or resulting from injury to, or the death of, a person caused by an error, omission, or <em>negligence in the performance of professional services </em>by a health care provider\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\"[S]urgical and medical procedures performed by a participating health care provider in a hospital\u201d, as that phrase is found in MCL 600.5042(5); MSA 27A.5042(5), plainly was intended to apply to allegedly negligent surgical or medical procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Plaintiffs also seek to avoid the clear import of MCL 600.5042(5); MSA 27A.5042(5) by arguing that the arbitration agreement failed to communicate adequately the content of that subsection. They say that, absent a disclosure of the wording of that subsection, the statutory presumption of the validity of the agreement would not apply. This argument is premised on subsection (8) of MCL 600.5042; MSA 27A.5042, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\"An agreement to arbitrate which <em>includes the provisions of this section </em>shall be presumed valid.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that the agreement did not inform the patient of the statutory provision in subsection (5) that \"all surgical and medical procedures performed by a participating health care provider in a hospital shall be covered by the terms and conditions applicable to the agreement between the patient and the hospital\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The arbitration agreement, however, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\"I understand that this agreement to arbitrate is binding on me and all my agents, representatives and heirs and assigns, as well as on this hospital, its employees and <em>those of its independent staff doctors, and consultants who have agreed to </em>arbitrate(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">This language plainly disclosed that the agreement to arbitrate the disputes arising from the health care rendered in the hospital was binding on the patient and her independent staff doctor. This provision adequately communicated the content of MCL 600.5042(5); MSA 27A.5042(5). Therefore, there is no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the arbitration agreement signed by Jacqualine Kukowski does not cover her dispute with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Hospitals and health care providers are referred to in tandem throughout the act. It unfolds an all-inclusive plan to implement the public policy of speedy and flexible resolutions of disputes by voluntary submission to arbitration throughout the spectrum of the care and treatment of patients by health care providers and hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>A scheme is provided for arbitration concerning care and treatment by physicians, both in their offices and in the hospital, of outpatients or inpatients. It also provides for care by the hospital, its employees, etc., alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">A fair reading indicates that the sections and subsections are interrelated. The physician\u2019s agreement with the hospital to arbitrate covered the circumstances of this case. Section 5042 then became applicable and, accordingly, Jacqualine Kukowski, in unequivocal wording, agreed to arbitrate with the hospital and was informed that the agreement bound her and the independent staff members who had agreed to arbitrate. She was advised of her right to a jury or bench trial, and that she was under no obligation to sign the arbitration agreement and could revoke the agreement within 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Nevertheless, she did sign the agreement and did not revoke it as provided. To the contrary, she filed a demand for arbitration which, so far as we know, continues in progress. She has the forum of her choice in which to pursue her claim and cannot be said to be without adequate remedy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-7\">Fitzgerald, C.J., and Ryan, J., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b107-8\">Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">Plaintiff-appellant Jacqualine Kuk\u00f3wski was treated in St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in July, 1976, for removal of a lesion. In September, 1976, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>it was suspected that she had tuberculosis, and she was readmitted to St. Mary\u2019s. Upon readmission, she executed an arbitration agreement with the hospital. She thereupon came under the care of Dr. Piskin who prescribed and administered to her a drug called \"ethambutol\u201d. She was released from St. Mary\u2019s on September 28, 1976, and continued under Dr. Piskin\u2019s care as an outpatient at Kent Community Hospital, with which hospital she executed another arbitration agreement. Dr. Piskin had executed an \"Independent Health Care Provider and Hospital Agreement to Arbitrate\u201d with each of the hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Plaintiffs brought suit against defendant charging negligence and malpractice in his administration of the drug \"ethambutol\u201d, claiming that it caused the total loss of Jacqualine Kukowski\u2019s vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Defendant moved to dismiss the suit, asserting that plaintiffs were obliged to arbitrate the claim under the agreement with the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the agreement signed by Jacqualine Kukowski was an unambiguous undertaking to submit to arbitration any claim arising out of the health care provided during the course of her hospital stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The medical malpractice arbitration legislation, MCL 600.5040 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.5040 <em>et seq., </em>provides for two types of arbitration agreements. Section 5041 provides for arbitration agreements between a \"health care provider\u201d (doctor, etc.) and patients.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 5042 provides for arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>agreements between hospitals, etc., and patients.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither \u00a7 5041 or \u00a7 5042 expressly provides for a single agreement binding all three parties \u2014 the patient, hospital and health care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Although the Legislature might have provided for such single agreement, it did not. Likewise, the parties might have effected that result through appropriate provisions, but no suggestion of agency or third party beneficiary intendment appe\u00e1rs in their agreement form.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The agreements signed by Jacqualine Kukowski and St. Mary\u2019s and Kent Community Hospitals are of the type contemplated in \u00a7 5042.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mrs. Kukowski and the hospitals were bound to arbitrate disputes arising out of health care or treatment rendered by the hospitals. No agreement of the type contemplated in \u00a7 5041 was executed in this case. Therefore, Mrs. Kukowski did not, in accordance with the statute, agree to arbitrate her claim against Dr. Piskin and she is not obligated to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">We have long recognized arbitration as a desira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ble method of dispute resolution and we are mindful of the importance of properly resolving the growing number of medical malpractice claims. The Legislature has not compelled arbitration absent agreement between the parties. Were it to do so, we would be concerned with the constitutionality of the effort. We may not, however, under the guise of construction of a contract, rule to effect such policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Because it was not necessary to decision, we have not considered the constitutionality of the medical malpractice arbitration act in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-8\">Williams and Levin, JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b110-9\">The late Justice Blair Moody, Jr., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> The agreements provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">\"Arbitration Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">\"Hospital In-Patient Surgery and Emergency Room Form</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">\"I understand that this hospital and I by signing this document agree to arbitrate any claims or disputes (except for disputes over charges for services rendered) which may arise in the future out of or in connection with the health care rendered to me during this hospital stay and/or emergency room visit by this hospital, its employees and those of its independent staif doctors and consultants who have agreed to arbitrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">\"I understand that Michigan law gives me the choice of trial by judge or jury or of arbitration.
