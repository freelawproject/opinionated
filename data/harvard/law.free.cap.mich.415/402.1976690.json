The lease was of vacant land and was entered into to develop a shopping center in Ann Arbor. The development fell through when efforts to rezone part of the parcel and to obtain building permits on the rest failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">Before the lease became \"legally effective\u201d, the partnership, with the consent of the landlord, assigned the lease to a corporation with capitaliza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tion of $1,000 which assumed \"due performance\u201d of the tenants\u2019 obligations under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">The trial judge, sitting without a jury, \"pierced the corporate veil\u201d and entered a judgment for unpaid rent and real estate taxes against the partnership, the corporation, and three stockholders of the corporation, two of whom were partners and one of whom was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We conclude that the trial judge clearly erred in finding for the plaintiff and that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The lease provided that upon an assignment, so consented to, the obligations on the part of the tenant \"shall terminate\u201d and \"thereafter all liabilities and obligations shall be binding only upon the assignee\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">At the time the assignment was executed, the partnership had the right, under the agreement of the parties, to rescind the lease and thereby avoid personal liability under the lease. The assignment was thus executed before the lease became \"legally effective\u201d and the obligation to pay rent or taxes commenced under the lease. The members of the partnership had no personal liability when the assignment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The landlord\u2019s attorney was apprised of the thin capitalization of the assignee corporation, and that the purpose of the assignment was to limit the liability of the partners of the assignor partnership, and there is no suggestion that any of the defendants misrepresented either the capitalization of the assignee corporation or denied that their purpose in assigning was to relieve themselves of personal liability so that the lease need not be rescinded before the obligation to pay rent became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The plaintiffs landlord, recognizing that unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>they consented to the assignment, the partnership, because of problems encountered in obtaining rezoning of the property, would exercise its option to rescind the lease, consented to the assignment to the undercapitalized corporation with knowledge that it was undercapitalized and that the purpose was to insulate the individuals involved in the defendant partnership from personal liability. The trial judge erred in piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Early in 1971, agents of the Robert Meyer Company, a partnership, approached the plaintiffs to secure a lease to develop a shopping center on ten acres of land in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">This land was comprised of two parcels, one zoned for commercial use, and the other restricted to residential use. From the outset of the lease negotiations, the parties understood that development of the entire tract depended upon rezoning the residential parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">By July, 1971, the details of the lease were made final. The parties agreed to a 50-year lease at an annual rent of $36,000. Besides this fixed sum, the lease provided that once the shopping center was in operation, plaintiffs would receive 15% of the rent from each of the subtenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Thereafter, the lease was placed in escrow to \"become legally effective\u201d if the land was rezoned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>If it was not rezoned by January 3, 1972, the partnership had the option of cancelling the lease by delivering written notice. Failure to exercise the option was to operate as a waiver of the conditional delivery in escrow and render the lease binding. However, a time when the cancellation privilege would become inoperative was not specified. The lease was actually released from escrow on March 14, 1972, approximately a month after the February 17, 1972 date of the assignment and consent to assignment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In the ensuing months of 1971, the partnership\u2019s efforts to rezone the land aroused considerable local opposition. The rezoning problem was still unresolved as the deadline for cancelling the lease approached. The members of the partnership, Meyer Weiner and Benjamin Rabin, did not wish to terminate the lease since there was still a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>possibility that the land might be rezoned. But, at the same time, they were unwilling to hazard personal liability on a lease which absent rezoning was valueless to them. To solve this dilemma, they approached plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer and requested assignment of the lease to a corporation created for the purpose of reducing their personal exposure. Unless such steps were taken, the partnership would exercise its rights under the escrow agreement and cancel the lease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties signed an agreement dated February 17, 1972, assigning the lease to Packard Platt Plaza, Incorporated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Shortly after the lease assignment, the Ann Arbor Planning Commission refused to rezone the property. Instead of abandoning the project, the developers scaled down their plans and sought a building permit to develop a shopping center on the land already zoned for commercial use. To reflect this change, the parties orally agreed to modify the lease provisions. The non-commercial parcel was deleted from the lease, and the annual rent was cut from $36,000 to $18,000. Mr. Rabin testified without rebuttal that the plaintiffs at no time suggested that they need not agree to such a reduction because the defendants were, by reason of the release of the lease from escrow, personally liable despite the assignment to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The prospects for this smaller development project soon dimmed as well. The building permit application was not only denied, but the planning commission initiated a petition to return the commercial parcel to residential zoning. The developers filed a writ of mandamus in the circuit court to overturn the planning commission\u2019s decision. The writ was denied, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial. In April, 1976, this Court refused to grant leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">After five years of effort and development expenditures in excess of $178,000, all attempts to develop the property had proved futile, and the developers had no alternative but to abandon the development plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Though appellants\u2019 unsatisfied rental obligation dates back to May 1, 1972, the time at which monthly rent became due under the terms of the lease, no attempt was made to enforce the lease until April 21, 1975, when an action was filed in the circuit court to collect back rent. Following a bench trial, judgment was entered against the defendants in the amount of $203,446.59. Meyer Weiner and Benjamin Rabin, both partners in the Robert Meyer Company and stockholders of Packard Platt Plaza, Incorporated, were found personally liable on the lease, along with Joshua Weiner, a stockholder in the assignee corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the partnership\u2019s failure to cancel the lease pursuant to the escrow agreement bound the defendants and placed the risk of the development scheme\u2019s failure on defendants\u2019 shoulders. The lease assignment to a corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>without meaningful assets is viewed as an impermissible attempt to evade this liability. This contention rests on an incorrect reading of <em>Cinderella Theater Co v United Detroit Theaters Corp, </em>367 Mich 424; 116 NW2d 825 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">By limiting an investor\u2019s financial risk to the amount of his stock contribution, the corporate form serves important social policies by creating an incentive to pool resources and to channel them into productive activity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By the same token, freeing shareholders from all personal liability runs the risk that the corporate form may be used as a shield for action the law would not condone if done by an individual and as a subterfuge for increasing one\u2019s personal autonomy at the expense of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In an effort to strike a balance between these opposing policies, this Court has held that fraud or other attempts to evade the law justify invoking equity\u2019s power \"to look through and behind the legal entity of corporate existence\u201d. <em>Gledhill v Fisher &amp; Co, </em>272 Mich 353; 262 NW 371 (1931). This test is not to be applied in a mechanistic fashion. <em>Brown Bros Equipment Co v State Highway Comm, </em>51 Mich App 448; 215 NW2d 591 (1974). The entire spectrum of relevant fact forms the background for such an inquiry, and the facts are to be assessed in light of the corporation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>economic justification to determine if the corporate form has been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Plaintiffs did not plead or prove at trial fraud or other violation of law. No evidence was introduced at trial that defendants misrepresented the capitalization of the corporation or their intended purpose in organizing the corporation and assigning the lease to the corporation. A pre-existing obligation was not assigned to the corporation; rather, the assignment was made at a time when the partnership still had the option of rescinding all liability under the lease that was assigned to the corporation, and the partnership obtained the landlord\u2019s written consent to the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The plaintiffs and the defendant partnership undertook a problematic and speculative real estate venture. The developers staked their expertise and investment capital, but, as the escrow agreement shows, they would not assume a personal obligation unless the land was rezoned. The landowners wagered that the gain from their land in its developed state would more than exceed its present value, for the lease guaranteed them not only a base rent of $36,000, no doubt reflecting the land\u2019s post-development value, but a significant percentage of the rents from the shopping center\u2019s occupants. At the outset, the parties shared the risk that the effort to develop the property might prove futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 presentation proceeds on the assumption that at a time when the prospects for developing the land were becoming increasingly less favorable, the developers decided to expose themselves to unlimited personal liability on a 50-year lease with aggregate rent exceeding 1.5 million <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>dollars no matter what the outcome of their efforts. One would expect that as the probability of failure increased experienced real estate developers would seek to contain their risks, not to embrace larger ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">The function of the assignment of the lease was to continue the parties\u2019 initial allocation of risk. The plaintiffs would rescind the lease pursuant to the reserved power to do so unless an assignment limiting the developers\u2019 liability was consented to by the landlord. The option to cancel the lease was bypassed in favor of the contested lease assignment. The plaintiffs were not victimized by an abuse of the corporate form. The defendants merely exercised their bargaining power. If the plaintiffs did not consent to the assignment, then the developers would exercise their option to cancel and all development efforts would cease. The plaintiffs\u2019 desire to enhance the value of their land would have been unsatisfied, left to brave the arrival of yet another developer who might dictate the same or even harsher terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Subsequent events support the conclusion that the plaintiffs understood that there was no personal liability on the lease. The plaintiffs did not make a formal request for rent or reimbursement for taxes paid by the plaintiffs until the commencement of this action three years after the first rental payment came due. When it became apparent that it would be impossible to rezone the residential tract for commercial use, plaintiffs agreed to modify the lease, severing the residential parcel and reducing the rent due. If plaintiffs were really looking toward the production of present rents rather than rents from the land in its developed state, then there was no reason to consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the modification. By plaintiffs\u2019 own hypothesis, the liability was already in existence and capable of enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The assignment to the corporation was not a fraud or an attempt to evade the law, but only a means for perpetuating the original understanding of the parties. Now that both parties have lost their gamble, there is no warrant for using the device of piercing the corporate veil to radically change the terms of their bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Instead, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cinderella Theater </em>is said to hold that a lease assignment to a corporation for the purpose of avoiding a pre-existing liability <em>without allegations of any wrongdoing </em>merits fastening personal liability on corporate shareholders. In <em>Cinderella Theater, </em>two corporations entered into a lease for a movie theater. The lease contained a provision permitting the lessee to assign the lease to a third party without the landlord\u2019s consent. When the lessee\u2019s theater began to sustain heavy financial losses, the lessee took advantage of the assignment clause and liquidated its investment through assignment to a corporation devoid of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Upon the lessor\u2019s action for rent, this Court analyzed the situation not as a problem in corporation law, but as one of lease interpretation. It held that a proper construction of the assignment clause required the implication of a covenant restricting lease assignment to only solvent assignees. Any other interpretation violated the lessor\u2019s firmly grounded expectation that the lessee would absorb the risk of his own enterprise\u2019s failure. <em>Cinderella Theater </em>does not conclude that a lease assignment <em>may never </em>be used to avoid a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>existing debt; rather it concludes that where an assignment clause is self-executing and circumstances show that assignment to an insolvent corporation was not contemplated, a protective covenant will be inserted into the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\">The instant case is the mirror image of <em>Cinderella Theater. </em>From the inception of the lease, plaintiffs were protected from the possibility of an evasive assignment to a sham corporation. Their written consent was necessary before such an assignment took legal effect. Though the lease provided that consent to an assignment could not be unreasonably withheld, such a refusal in the context of a proposed assignment to the most fragile of corporate shells would have been fully justified. Yet plaintiffs consented to an assignment to a corporate shell fully aware that the purpose of the assignment was to insulate the developers from personal liability before the obligation to pay rent under the lease became indefeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Cinderella Theater </em>that a covenant to protect against a lessee attempting to shift the risk of his business\u2019s failure to the landlord was implied in the lease does not justify imposing liability on the individual defendants in the instant case who acted before they were personally liable with disclosure to the landlord of their purpose and with the consent of the landlord.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The plaintiffs also rely on the language of the lease providing that if the lease is assigned to a non-corporate entity or to more than one person, corporation, or entity, the assignees \"and all members of such entities shall assume\u201d the obligations of this lease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That provision is not self-executing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>It does not provide that all assignees and all members of such entities shall \"be deemed\u201d to assume the obligations of the lease. The assignee corporation agreed in writing to assume the tenants\u2019 obligations under the lease but none of the individual defendants executed an assumption of the tenant\u2019s obligations under the lease, and, to repeat, the consent to assignment signed by the landlord expressly stated that the landlord would thereafter look to and recognize the assignee corporation \"as the tenant under said lease\u201d. It is also clear in the context that the word \"entity\u201d refers to a non-corporate entity and that the shareholders of a corporation are not \"members of such entities\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Moreover, it is again pertinent that in not rescinding the lease, in accepting the release from escrow of a copy of the lease, and in assigning the lease to a corporation with a nominal capitalization, the partners of the defendant partnership manifested their purpose and intent not to assume personal liability, and that the plaintiffs, in consenting to the assignment, expressed their agreement and consent to that purpose. Plaintiffs have not shown that the assignment could have served any purpose other than that claimed by the defendants. Any arguable doubt concerning the meaning of the language of the lease and of the assignment should in those circumstances be resolved in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">It is also noteworthy that the rule for which the plaintiffs would have this Court write would produce an anomalous result. A court will refuse to pierce the corporate veil where corporate action is not fraudulent or otherwise illegal, but, if plaintiffs\u2019 rule is adopted, the corporation could impose liability on its stockholders. There is no warrant for conferring this power on the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">All jurisdictions which have decided the issue agree that shareholders must expressly consent to the terms of a contract which would expose them to personal liability for corporate obligations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Any other rule would unsettle the relationship between a corporation and its stockholders.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-5\">Fitzgerald, C.J., and Kavanagh, Williams, Coleman, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b485-6\">Riley, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> The escrow agreement provided that the lease \"was delivered to [the escrow agent] to be held for the mutual benefit of both landlord and tenant upon the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">\"1.

The letter states that a representative of the partnership and corporate defendants would shortly be in Ann Arbor and at that time would like to pick up both the executed assignment and an executed copy of the lease. It thus appears that what was contemplated was that the lease would be released from escrow at the same time that the executed copy of the assignment and consent to assignment was delivered.

Nothing contained herein shall preclude the right of stockholder or owner of interest at the time of the signing of this lease to transfer all or part of his or their interest by gift or otherwise, to or for the benefit of his wife, children or heirs.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b483-5\"> The lease provision has two clauses. The first designates the assignments to which the provision applies. They fall into two classes: (1) an assignment to a \"partnership, tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy, syndicate, joint venture or similar entity\u201d and (2) an assignment to \"more than one person, corporation or other entity\u201d. The second subjects all such assignments to the condition that \"all persons, corporations, and entities and all members of such entities shall assume the obligations of this lease jointly and severally\u201d. Thus, if an unprovided-for assignment occurs, then the assumption requirements of the second clause are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">With respect to the first class of assignments, no explicit reference to a corporation is made. Only with difficulty can it be argued that a corporation is a \"similar entity\u201d to a partnership, tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy, syndicate, or joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Nor would an assignment to a corporation come within the language which creates the second class of assignments. First, this language posits an assignment to <em>more than one </em>assignee. Second, this language draws a contrast between \"corporations\u201d and \"other entities\u201d. Such a disjunction would normally imply that the words were meant to stand in opposition, not that they were mutually inclusive of one another. Third, if the previous analysis is accepted, the reference in the first category of assignments to a \"similar entity\u201d excludes the concept of a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">If an \"entity\u201d is not a \"corporation\u201d, then the subsequent reference to \"all members of an entity\u201d in the second clause of this provision would not refer to a \"corporation\u201d, and, thus, these words would not perform the function plaintiffs attribute to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Moreover, the lease provision requires that \"members * * * shall assume\u201d the lease obligations, not that they will be deemed to have assumed them. This language looks toward the future, requiring a voluntary lease assumption by the members of the assignee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Absent authorization in its charter, the universal rule is that a corporation does not possess the authority to bind stockholders to personal liability for its debts without their consent. <em>Thomas v Matthiessen, </em>232 US 221; 34 S Ct 312; 58 L Ed 577 (1914). See, generally, 13A Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>(1961 ed), ch 58, \u00a7 6218, p 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\"> The present case is an example of the mischief such a rule could create. A shareholder, Joshua Weiner, who was not personally liable on the lease before it was assigned and whose relationship to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>transaction was at best incidental, now finds himself ensnared by the wording of this clause.</p>\n<p id=\"AW3\">Moreover, only three out of the seven shareholders in Packard Platt Plaza, Incorporated, were joined as defendants in this action. The record shows that the unjoined shareholders had no ownership interest in the assigning partnership and no personal involvement whatsoever in the development efforts. Yet if plaintiffs\u2019 theory is accepted, then as shareholders they also became jointly and severally liable on the leasehold obligation. Conceivably, if this judgment is affirmed, defendants may seek to reduce their extensive liability and launch an action for contribution even though these shareholders had no expectation that this bare connection would expose them to such hazard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
