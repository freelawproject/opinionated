The resolution instructed the City Clerk of Gardena to forward a copy of the map and legal description of the area proposed for annexation to the Secretary of the Boundary Commission of Los Angeles County. This was done on March 23, 1959. On April 1, 1959, the Boundary Commission notified the City Clerk that the boundaries of the proposed annexation were approved with some slight revisions in the legal description, and informed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>City Clerk of Gardena that the proposed annexation was entirely within the boundaries of the proposed \u2018Alondra Addition\u2019 to the City of Torrance which had been previously approved by the Commission on March 18, 1959. On April 21, 1959, Resolution No. 1558 was adopted by the City Council of the City of Gardena, amending Resolution No. 1548, and employing the Boundary Commission\u2019s revised description. A hearing on protests was duly scheduled and held. Ordinance No. 497 approving the \u2018Crenshaw Boulevard Annexation\u2019 was adopted by the City Council of Gardena on July 9, 1959; a certified copy was sent to the Secretary of State and an affidavit of completion of the annexation was filed with the County Recorder of Los Angeles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">\u2018 \u2018 The City of Torrance also initiated an annexation of certain territory referred to as the \u2018Alondra Addition\u2019 in accordance with the Annexation Act of 1913, governing the annexation of inhabited territory (Sections 35100, et seq.; The territory to be annexed by Gardena\u2019s \u2018Crenshaw Boulevard Annexation\u2019 was part of Torrance\u2019s \u2018Alondra Addition.\u2019 On March 3, 1959, the Planning Commission of the City of Torrance recommended that the \u2018Alondra Addition\u2019 be annexed, and on March 4, 1959, the City Council of the City of Torrance consented to the commencement of the annexation proceedings as required by Section 35106. A written description of the territory proposed for annexation was filed with the Secretary of the Boundary Commission of Los Angeles County on March 5, 1959. (Section 35002.) On March 18, 1959, the Boundary Commission made its report revising and approving the written description. A notice of intention to circulate a petition was published by the proponents of the petition on March 22, 1959, as required by Section 35111.

The first issue is stated as follows: \u201c (1) That independent of the Gardena annexation proceedings, Torrance lacked jurisdiction to go forward with the Torrance annexation because of the pendency of the proposed incorporation of the City of Lawndale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">As shown by the reproduced portions of the reporter\u2019s transcript, the Lawndale matter was not presented to the trial court for determination. On the contrary, appellant stipulated that there was but one issue.  As stated in <em>Munfrey </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 779, 785 [171 P.2d 750] :</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">\u201cAlso as a general rule where a case has been tried upon one theory that theory must be adhered to on appeal, and a party who has tried his case wholly or in part on a certain theory, which theory was acted upon by the trial court, cannot, on appeal, change his position and adopt a different theory, since to do so would be unfair to the trial court and to opposing counsel. <em>(Blanc </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>[167 Cal. 719 (141 P. 217)]; <em>Marra </em>v. <em>Aetna Construction Co., </em>15 Cal.2d 375, 379 [101 P.2d 490] ; <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins.

As stated therein at page 575:</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">\u201cDefendant has attempted to inject a plethora of issues on this appeal which have no materiality to the fundamental point involved, and to which counsel by stipulation narrowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the actual trial of the case. The alleged facts upon which defendant now attempts to raise new issues were not raised in the trial court, are not included in the written stipulation filed, and are directly contrary to the oral declarations of defendant made to the trial court, as to what the issues were. . . . Under such circumstances, new issues of the character now urged . . . cannot be considered for the first time on appeal. [Citations.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The issue presented for determination, and the law applicable to the acquisition of jurisdiction in annexation proceedings were set forth in the trial court\u2019s memorandum as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u201cThe question for decision is whether the City of Gardena acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the disputed territory on March 23rd when it adopted the resolution of intention to annex, <em>without having first obtained a boundary commission report as required by Section 35002.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\u201cAs between rival annexation proceedings, the legislative body first obtaining jurisdiction retains it exclusively until final determination of the particular proceeding. <em>(City of Burlingame </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 705 [203 P.2d 807] ; <em>Hubbell </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>142 Cal.App.2d 1 [297 P.2d 724] ; <em>Borghi </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 463 [284 P.2d 537] ; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>City of San Pablo, </em>132 Cal.App.2d 447 [283 P.2d 57].)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\u201cThe time at which jurisdiction is acquired in annexation proceedings has been determined ... [to be as follows]. In a proceeding to annex <em>inhabited </em>territory the adoption of the resolution approving the circulation of a petition confers the exclusive jurisdiction for a period of 50 days within which to complete annexation of the territory. <em>(City of Costa Mesa </em>v. <em>City of Newport Beach, supra </em>[165 Cal.App.2d 553 (332 P.2d 392)] ; <em>Borghi </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>supra; Section 35113.) The City of Torrance adopted Resolution No. 3654 on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>24, 1959, to annex the \u2018Alondra Addition\u2019 which is, as indicated, inhabited territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\u201cProceedings to annex <em>uninhabited </em>territory are instituted and jurisdiction attaches \u2018when a valid <em>and </em>sufficient petition for annexation has been filed with the legislative body of a city <em>or </em>that body has instituted such proceedings on its own motion.\u2019 (Government Code Section 35308.) <em>(City of Costa Mesa </em>v. <em>City of Newport Beach, supra.) </em>The proceedings are instituted on a city\u2019s own motion when a resolution of intention to annex is adopted pursuant to Section 35310. Gardena\u2019s Resolution No. 1548 was adopted on March 23, 1959, to annex the \u2018 Crenshaw Boulevard Annexation\u2019 which is uninhabited territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">\u201cThe City of Torrance concedes that if Resolution 1548 to annex the \u2018 Crenshaw Boulevard' territory was validly enacted by the City of Gardena, Gardena would have priority over the City of Torrance and would retain jurisdiction until final determination of their proceeding. (Section 35308.) \u201d In support of appellant\u2019s contention that section 35002 is merely a directory provision intended to encourage definiteness and certainty in boundary descriptions, and is not mandatory, two cases are cited. The first is <em>Jefferson Union School District </em>v. <em>City Council of Sunnyvale, </em>129 Cal.App.2d 264 [277 P.2d 104]. In that case the attack upon the annexation was being made by a school district. The basis for the attack was that the petition for annexation was circulated and signed before it was submitted to and reported upon by the county boundary commission, even though such submission and report occurred prior to the adoption of the resolution by the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The court held that \u201cthe provisions of section 35002 are directory, not mandatory. \u2019 \u2019 The court stated at page 266 : \u201cWhen, as in the instant case, a city council has received an appropriate petition bearing the signatures of a sufficient number of landowners and a report of the county boundary commission that the proposed boundaries described in the petition are definite and certain, it would seem an idle and useless act to return the petition to the proponents for resignature by the petitioners and resubmission to the council. \u2019 \u2019 Unlike the Jefferson case, the case at bar involves two jurisdictions competing for priority in annexation proceedings. There seems little doubt that even if all the steps in the Jef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ferson ease had been taken in proper order, the same result would have been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The second case cited by appellant is <em>Southern Lumber Go. </em>v. <em>City Council of San Jose, </em>146 Cal.App.2d 133 [303 P.2d 599], The Southern case, like the Jefferson case, did not involve two jurisdictions competing for priority. In <em>Southern, </em>the annexing city did file a proposed description with the boundary commission prior to the commencement of annexation proceedings. The city of San Jose complied with the Annexation of Uninhabited Territory Act of 1939 by filing the proposal with the county commission before passing its resolution of intention to annex plaintiff\u2019s land. Subsequently, the board of supervisors adopted a resolution to incorporate into the city of South San Jose the area proposed to be annexed by San Jose, but the election was called off. The city of San Jose then adopted a second resolution of intention to annex the identical territory as described in its first resolution to annex. The court held that the resubmission of the proposal to the boundary commission would have been an idle act and as such was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Appellant also cites two cases which did involve competing cities. <em>(City of Costa Mesa </em>v. <em>City of Newport Beach, </em>165 Cal.App.2d 553 [332 P.2d <em>392]; City of Cupertino </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 29 [8 Cal.Rptr. 525].) Neither of these cases is helpful to appellant in resolving the issue before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In the Costa Mesa case at page 557, the court rejected the contention that it was the submission of the matter to the boundary commission which constituted the institution of annexation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">With reference to the conditions precedent to the institution of annexation proceedings as distinguished from the issue of \u201cwhat\u201d constitutes institution of proceedings, the court stated at page 557:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\"><em>\u201cNo annexation proceeding may be instituted until the proposal therefor has been submitted to and reported upon by the county boundary commission.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">We believe that the trial court was correct when it determined that the requirements of section 35002 are mandatory where the contest for annexation is between two cities. We hereby adopt, as set forth in pertinent part hereafter, the trial court\u2019s memorandum:</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">\u201c. , . It is to be noted that in neither case (i.e. Jefferson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and Southern) was the court concerned with whether obtaining a boundary commission\u2019s report before enacting the resolution is mandatory when, as here, two cities are racing to obtain jurisdiction. Factually the cases differ with the case at bar in that the court in the cited cases was concerned with property owners in the annexed territory, and in both cases the court found that the purpose of the statute had been fulfilled, the election was fair, the result would have been the same if Section 35002 had been complied with and no one was injured or prejudiced. Here we have the problem of a dispute between two cities in rival annexation proceedings competing for the same territory. In inhabited territory, in the absence of a majority protest of property owners the electors of the annexed territory are entitled to vote on the issue of annexation. Thus it cannot be said the result would have been the same if Gardena had complied with Section 35002 because its non-compliance in effect denied the property owners in the territory to be annexed the privilege of expressing their preference on whether to annex to Torrance or not, and later to have the electors residing in the territory to vote thereon at an election called for that purpose. In this sense their rights were prejudiced because Gardena\u2019s resolution only gave to such property owners the option of approving or disapproving annexation to Gardena. The City of Torrance was also in fact prejudiced by following the preliminary procedures prescribed by Sections 35000, et seq. It waited, as it was required to do under the Government Code, until it had received a report from the boundary commission before enacting its resolution approving the circularization of the petition seeking the annexation. . . . Under these circumstances may it be said the Legislature [sic] purpose, as reflected by Section 35002 was accomplished when, it may be presumed, Gardena, with notice of Torrance\u2019s intention to annex the territory in question, proceeded to adopt its notice of intention one day before Gardena would have acquired jurisdiction by the expediency of omitting the requirement of first obtaining a boundary commission report? It may be as pointed out in the Jefferson and Southern Lumber cases, in a situation involving property owner disputants, a resubmission of the report to the Boundary Commission previously approved would be an idle act, or the adoption of a resolution under Section 35310, before the Boundary Commission approved the boundaries, but subsequently approved by the Commission would be a mere technical non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>compliance, particularly where the facts disclose that the election was fair, the result would have been the same regardless, and no prejudice or injury results. Here, where two cities are competing to obtain jurisdiction over the same territory the consequences of noncompliance may be much different because it involves the principle of orderly government and the rights of property owners and electors in the territory to be annexed. To approve the procedure taken by Gardena would result for all practical purposes in the elimination of Section 35002 as a prior procedural step. Legislative history involving annexations in California discloses heroic and detailed attempts by the Legislature to insure orderly government by enacting measures designed to curb the unseemly conduct of governmental agencies in their rivalry to expand by annexation or incorporation. Thus various provisions of the Government Code provide that once jurisdiction attaches in an annexation or incorporation proceeding no other petition for annexation or incorporation shall be filed, nor shall any legislative body consent to the circulation of a petition or initiate any proceedings on its own motion until such proceeding is terminated or defeated. (Sections 35113; 35115; 35308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\u201cSection 35002 uses the verb \u2018shall\u2019 and should be construed as mandatory under Section 14 of the Government Code unless modified by Section 5 of the same Code which provides that definitions found among the \u2018general provisions\u2019 including Section 14, shall govern unless \u2018the provision or the context otherwise requires.\u2019 The court in <em>Jefferson [Union School </em>Dist.] v. <em>City Council [of Sunnyvale], supra, </em>held that under the facts of that case \u2018the context does otherwise require, <em>to the extent at least that there has been a technical noncompliance in this case.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) It is elementary that the language used in any opinion is to be understood in the light of the facts and the issues then before the court. <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>Bakersfield </em>[&amp; <em>Kern Elec. Ry. Co.], </em>36 Cal.2d [582] 590 [225 P.2d 223].) As previously indicated, the factual situation in the case at bar is far different from the factual situation in the Jefferson and Southern Lumber cases. It is this court\u2019s opinion that omitting to follow the requirements of Section 35002 where the contest for annexation is between two cities is not a mere technical noncompliance but is substantive and one that involves orderly procedure to insure good government. In these circumstances the context of Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>35002 does <em>not </em>otherwise require any other interpretation of the word \u2018shall\u2019 other than that it is mandatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 26, 1961.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Government Code, section 35002, provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cNo petition seeking the annexation of territory to a city shall he circulated or filed, . . . <em>nor shall any legislative body initiate proceedings to annex on its own motion, until a written description of the proposal for the annexation of territory to a city has been filed with the secretary of the boundary commission of the county and the boundary commission has prepared, or caused to be prepared, a report to the proponents upon the annexation proposal with respect to the definiteness and certainty of the proposed boundaries, the nonconformance of proposed boundaries with lines of assessment or ownership, the creation of islands or corridors of unincorporated territory and other similar matters affecting the proposed boundaries.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
