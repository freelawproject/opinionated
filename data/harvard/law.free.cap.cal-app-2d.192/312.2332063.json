She further denied that she at any time possessed any property other than her own. Upon a hearing overruling a demurrer filed by plaintiff to the answer, it was also determined that defendant would file a disclaimer to the property described in the complaint. The disclaimer was filed thereafter prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">During trial, when it clearly appeared that a certain fence was on defendant\u2019s land, plaintiff was permitted by the court to amend his complaint by reducing the damage claimed from $1,500 to $1.00 and eliminating completely thereupon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>claim for exemplary damages of $5,000. Plaintiff\u2019s action was, therefore, aimed at the presence of certain rubbish on his land put there by defendant for a period of about one week.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The court determined (1) that plaintiff owned the real property described in his complaint; (2) that defendant owned the adjoining property; (3) that a wooden fence which paralleled the common boundary was wholly on defendant\u2019s property; (4) that defendant at no time had been in possession of plaintiff\u2019s property; and (5) that the small amount of rubbish placed by defendant upon the approach to plaintiff\u2019s property shortly before December 9, 1958, was removed on December 14, 1958, by defendant, \u201cand that, as to that act, the plaintiff suffered no damage.\u201d The court concluded: (1) Defendant did not trespass or claim any interest in plaintiff\u2019s property; (2) plaintiff suffered no damage by any act of defendant; and (3) gave defendant judgment and her costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument seems to be that the issue of ownership was framed by the pleadings (defendant\u2019s denial based on information and belief) and thus he was entitled to a judgment quieting title since the court found him to be the owner. With judgment, he argues, he was entitled to costs. Nominal damages, he further contends, follow from the finding that defendant deposited rubbish on plaintiff\u2019s property and that defendant was deprived of access, possession and use of the property. He concludes with the contention that, as a matter of law, he was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Plaintiff overlooks the disclaimer filed by the defendant. He, on one hand, contends that the disclaimer was improper in an ejectment action and, on the other hand, contends that the pleadings framed an action to quiet title. Insofar as the pleadings framed the issue as quiet title, the disclaimer was entirely proper (41 Cal.Jur.2d, Quiet Title, \u00a7\u00a7 59, 90; cf. <em>Tesseyman </em>v. <em>Jovick, </em>130 Cal.App.2d 384, 388 [278 P.2d 921]) and the suit either should have been dismissed <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>City of Stockton, </em>39 Cal.App. 552, 559 [179 P. 894]; <em>Moranda, </em>v. <em>Mapes, </em>100 Cal.App. 629, 632 [280 P. 713]) or, at best, should have proceeded on the original ejectment theory. Certainly, title was no longer in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Assuming, then, that the trial proceeded on the theory of ejectment, that is, seizin, entry and ouster, the plaintiff failed to prove the elements of ejectment in that he showed only a temporary trespass by the defendant.  The evidence received on the issue of trespass was proper, not to establish a trespass cause of action, but rather for the limited purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of determining whether or not the trespass was of such a continuing nature as would establish an ouster by the defendant and enable the plaintiff to prove the elements for his ejectment action.  Clearly, possession and ouster by a defendant cannot be inferred simply from the fact that he committed a single trespass <em>(Frazier </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>97 Cal. 370, 372 [32 P. 319] ; 17 Cal.Jur.2d, Ejectment, \u00a7 19), though a continuing trespass might be construed as possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Here, the court determined that the defendant\u2019s single and limited occupation of the plaintiff\u2019s land was not the type of trespass that could support an action for ejectment. Since the pleadings were expressly limited to ejectment by the filing of the disclaimer, and since the amended complaint asked only \u201cfor damages in the sum of $1.00 for rents, issues, and profits of said real property,\u201d there was no issue as to damages for <em>trespass, </em>because trespass <em>per se </em>was never part of the action before the trial court. Even in view of the liberal allowance of amendment to conform to proof, there was no attempt to amend the pleadings here to state a cause of action for trespass, or to include a prayer to quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The trial court properly found for the defendant on the ejectment issue. The award of costs to the prevailing party was proper. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1032, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The judgment for the defendant, and the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside that judgment and enter a new and different judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 663) are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Fox, P. J., and Ashburn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 13, 1961, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 12, 1961.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
