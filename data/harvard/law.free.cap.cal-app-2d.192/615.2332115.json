J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxO\">This is an appeal from a money judgment in a personal injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Before the entry of the judgment appellants made a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. They did not at that time reserve the right to apply for a new trial. However, a week later they filed a notice of motion for a new trial. The trial court struck this motion and denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Thereafter judgment was entered on the verdict in favor of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">Appellants assign as error the striking of their motion for a new trial. There was no error. Appellants waived the right to apply for a new trial by failing to contemporaneously reserve such right at the time they made a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 629; <em>Estate of Jackson, </em>157 Cal.App.2d 198, 203-204 [320 P.2d 563].) Moreover, appellants did not file the notice of intention to move for a new trial within five days after making the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as required by section 659 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Peek, J., and Schottky, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
