They called for an ambulance at 2:11 a.m. She appeared injured, with blood issuing from her head, nose and mouth. The officers detected a strong smell of an unknown alcoholic beverage about the person of petitioner and her vehicle. The physical evidence at the scene indicated petitioner\u2019s vehicle had struck a legally parked, unoccupied vehicle prior to coming to rest on the lawn. Petitioner was taken by ambulance to a hospital, her injuries were treated, and at the request of a police officer a doctor took a blood sample from the still unconscious petitioner. No warrant was obtained either for her arrest or for a search of her person. Later petitioner was charged with violating section 23102, subdivision (a), of the Vehicle Code (misdemeanor drunk driving).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus and prohibition in the Sutter County Superior Court, contending that the police in this case were not authorized to arrest her <em>without a warrant </em>since they had no reasonable cause to believe she had committed a felony, nor did she commit a public offense in their presence. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 836.) Since there was no probable cause to arrest without a warrant, petitioner contends there was no probable cause to search without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The court ordered that a writ of prohibition issue restraining the Justice Court of the Yuba City Judicial District from taking any further action to prosecute or try petitioner for a violation of California Vehicle Code section 23102, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The People of the State of California appeal, <em>alleging: \u201cA. </em>The extraction of a sample of the defendant\u2019s blood was reasonable, and, therefore, lawful because of the emergency and exceptional circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">\u201cB. The arguments urged by defense counsel below do not require that the evidence obtained by the blood test be excluded as the product of an unlawful search.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">\u201cC. Conclusion: The search in the present ease was lawful as within the doctrine of emergency or exceptional circumstances, therefore, the evidence obtained by such search is admissible. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Although the record does not divulge any probable cause that petitioner had committed a felony, particularly since no one else was injured (cf. Veh. Code, \u00a7 23101), section 836 of the Penal Code provides, in part, that a peace officer may arrest a person without a warrant \u201cwhenever \"he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a public offense in his presence.\u2019 \u2019 The term \u2018 \u2018 in his presence\u201d is liberally construed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lavender, </em>137 Cal.App. 582, 586-589 [31 P.2d 439].) Neither physical proximity nor sight is essential. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>170 Cal.App.2d 36, 41 [338 P.2d 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Here, the officers testified that they arrived on the scene in less than one minute after receiving the radio alert. It was apparent to the investigating officers that petitioner\u2019s car had struck a parked car. Petitioner\u2019s car and her breath strongly smelled of alcohol. Under these circumstances, there was sufficient evidence for arrest for misdemeanor drunk driving. By the very nature of the situation, arrests for drunk driving arise in the context of an arrest made by an officer without a warrant. <em>(Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 768 [16 L.Ed.2d 908, 918, 86 S.Ct. 1826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">\u201c The United States Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 10 [68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436], recognized that under certain \u2018exceptional circumstances, ' among them, threatened destruction of evidence, law enforcement officers have the right to conduct a search and seizure without a warrant, without consent and without the same being incident to an arrest.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huber, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 663, 667 [43 Cal.Rptr. 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">\u201cCalifornia cases, too, have recognized the right of police officers in an emergency to make a search without a warrant, without consent, and not as an incident to arrest. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huber, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d at p. 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">Case law upholds the legality of the taking of a blood sample, even though no warrant had been obtained, no consent given, and no <em>formal </em>arrest made. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duroncelay, </em>48 Cal.2d 766 [312 P.2d 690] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pack, </em>199 Cal.App.2d 857 [19 Cal.Rptr. 186] <em>; People </em>v. <em>Huber, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 663; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 634 [49 Cal.Rptr. 712] ; and see <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>16 L.Ed.2d 908.) In each of these cases the court noted that the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for drunken driving. However, each of these cases involved <em>felony </em>drunk driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">California recognizes the right of officers confronted with emergency or exceptional circumstances to make a reasonable search without a warrant or consent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>63 Cal.2d 690, 706 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Huber, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d at p. 670.) The doctrine has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>been applied to the withdrawal of blood in suspected intoxication cases in view of the fact that the intoxicating effect of alcohol diminishes with the passage of time, the scientific reliability of the blood alcohol test to exonerate as well as to convict, and the imperative public interest involved. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huber, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d at p. 670; <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>16 L.Ed.2d at pp. 919-920.) So far as is known this doctrine has not been applied in this state to a misdemeanor drunk driving ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">That the case before us charges misdemeanor drunk driving does not require a different rule. The rationale for taking blood samples set forth in <em>Huber, supra, </em>is equally applicable to misdemeanor drunk driving cases. Any other conclusion would seriously thwart the imperative public interest involved. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Duroncelay, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at p. 772; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>65 Cal.2d 543, 546 [55 Cal.Rptr. 393, 421 P.2d 401] [breathalyzer test].)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Pierce, P. J., and Friedman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">The petition of the plaintiff and respondent for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 31, 1967.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
