Lisner\u2019s motion under section 995 of the Penal Code was denied. He pleaded not guilty, and trial by jury was waived. All counsel stipulated that the cause would be submitted on the testimony contained in the transcript of the preliminary hearing, subject to the court\u2019s rulings and the right of each side to offer additional evidence. At the time of trial the People offered additional testimony by George H. Weiner and by Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Plygare. Defendant testified in his own behalf. Lisner was found guilty as charged, proceedings were suspended, and he was given three years\u2019 probation, as a condition of which he was ordered to pay a fine of $500, plus penalty assessment, and to make restitution. Lisner appealed from the \u201cjudgment and order granting probation.\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Lisner contends that he was convicted upon evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and that evidence of his admissions was improperly received because he had not been advised of his constitutional rights before his statements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">\n<em>Summary of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">On March 3, 1965, Charles Plygare, an employee of Sterling Liquor distributors, hauled away 200 cases of his employer\u2019s liquor without his employer\u2019s consent. Two days later Plygare met Lisner at the Roma Inn, a bar and restaurant owned by Lisner\u2019s sister, by whom Lisner was apparently employed. Plygare asked Lisner if he would be interested in buying some part of the liquor. Lisner \u201casked how hot it was\u201d and Plygare replied \u201cit wasn\u2019t too hot.\u201d Plygare showed Lisner liquor invoices for the liquor he was attempting to sell, which invoices were made out to about 34 different licensees. Lisner\u2019s sister, the licensee for Roma Inn, was not among them. Lisner told Plygare that he would be \u201cinterested in the vodka and actually most anything at a right price.\u201d The two men dickered over the price and ultimately agreed upon a price of $700 for the purchase of 25 cases of Pleishmann\u2019s vodka, 5 cases of Sonya vodka, and 4 eases of Pleishmann Select Bourbon. The approximate wholesale value of that liquor was $1,100. Plygare delivered the liquor to Lisner at the Roma Inn and Lisner paid Plygare the $700 purchase price in cash about midnight on March 5, 1965. Lisner knew that the price was substantially below the market value, but he testified that he attributed the reduced price to a representation that the source of the liquor was someone who was going out of business and that he did not know it was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Officer Donald Zellers, of the Los Angeles Police Department, had received information that there was stolen liquor at the Roma Inn. He called George Weiner, special agent for the State Alcoholic Beverage Control, told him what he knew of the case, and the two men arranged to go to the Roma Inn with Lieutenant William Carter and with Plygare, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>in custody. The four men went to the Roma Inn on March 19. While Carter and Plygare waited in the parking lot, Weiner and Zellers went into the bar about 11:30 a.m. and met Lisner. Weiner showed Lisner his identification as agent for the Alcoholic Beverage Control, told Lisner that he was conducting an investigation and that he wanted to search the premises. He introduced Officer Zellers as \u201cDon Zellers\u201d but he did not tell Lisner that Zellers was a police officer. Zellers and Weiner asked Lisner if they could inspect the back bar, and Lisner readily agreed. Weiner asked Lisner if he would show them the paper work covering the purchase of the liquor on the premises. Lisner told him that no invoices were retained at the Roma Inn, because all of the papers had been turned over to accountants. After looking behind the bar, Weiner told Lisner that he wanted to search the room where supplies were kept. Lisner took a key from a key chain and opened the door to a small room containing about ten loose cases of assorted liquor and ten cases in boxes. Zellers told Lisner that he had been informed that Lisner had bought 34 eases of different types of alcoholic beverages from Plygare for $700 cash on the 5th of March. After looking at the liquor in the storeroom Zellers said to Lisner: <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Sam, these are two of the cases that Plygare sold you.\u201d Zellers told Lisner that he was interested in recovering \u201cthe other 32 cases.\u201d Lisner thereupon said to Zellers, \u201cCan I speak to you by myself?\u201d Zellers said, \u201cYes,\u201d and the following exchange took place between Lisner and Zellers outside the presence of Weiner: Lisner said, \u201cWho is your boss?\u201d and Zellers replied, \u201cI am my boss.\u201d Lisner said, \u201cI can do yon some good.\u201d Zellers replied, \u201cYou can not do me any good . . . Sam, I am interested in recovering the 32 cases of liquor, where are they?\u201d Lisner said, \u201cI got rid of them.\u201d Zellers asked, \u201cDo you have it stashed?\u201d and he replied, \u201cI have 23 cases of it stashed.\u201d Weiner came into the room, along with Lieutenant Carter and Plygare, to whom Zellers related the conversation he had with Lisner.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Zellers testified that he advised Lisner prior to any conversation with Lisner that \u201che had a right to have an attorney present at all stages of the proceedings and that he had a right to remain silent and that anything he said could be used later in court.\u201d Weiner, however, testified that Lisner was not advised of his constitutional rights before their first conversation with him, but that he was advised at some later, unspecified time during their visit with Lisner at the bar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Lisner testified that he was not advised of his constitutional rights at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Lisner was placed under arrest and taken to the police station by Zellers. During the trip to the station Lisner gave Zellers repeated assurance that he would get the other 32 cases of liquor for him. Neither the arrest nor the search of the Boma Inn premises was made pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Lisner contends that his incriminatory statements made to Zellers and Weiner were the fruit of an illegal search and thus inadmissible. <em>(Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 471, 475 [9 L.Ed.2d 441, 83 S.Ct. 407]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stoner </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 595, 598-599 [55 Cal.Rptr. 897, 422 P.2d 585].) The search was illegal, he says, because Zellers and Weiner obtained entry to the premises and Lisner\u2019s consent to the subsequent search by deception: Lisner was led to believe that Zellers was an employee of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Department conducting an investigation with Weiner upon behalf of that department when, in fact, Zellers was a police officer and the purpose of the investigation was to locate stolen liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Neither the entry nor the search was illegal. The premises which were searched were not a dwelling or a private place of business, but a public bar. Traffic in spiritous liquors, including the vending of liquor at public barrooms, has long been the subject of stringent public regulation. Conduct of law enforcement agencies, impermissible in respect of businesses standing higher in the public esteem, is often permitted in enforcing liquor laws. \" Where the evidence is sought by governmental officers, pursuant to a regulatory function, both the privilege against self-incrimination . . . and the guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure are limited.\u201d (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 89, p. 83.)  The entry, the examination of the records of Roma Inn and the subsequent search of the premises were statutorily authorized by sections 25753 and 25755 of the Business and Professions Code, giving agents and local police officers wide powers to visit and to inspect the premises of liquor licensees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The search was not illegal, with or without Lis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ner\u2019s consent, unless Zellers and Weiner exceeded the statutory authority thus conferred, or Zellers and Weiner were guilty of fraud or deception so flagrant that the authority otherwise conferred by statute cannot immunize their activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The investigation conducted at the Roma Inn did not exceed the scope of authority conferred by sections 25753 and 25755. Those sections authorize inspection of licensees\u2019 premises not only by employees of the department but also by peace officers for the purpose of enforcing the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. Both law enforcement agencies have a legitimate interest, reinforced by statute, in examining the premises of licensees for suspected violations of the penal statutes of California, particularly including potential illegal sales of contraband liquor. That legitimate interest is not impaired or destroyed because the discovery of contraband liquor may lead to an arrest of an employee of a licensee as well as to action by the department against a licensee. Nothing in the record suggests that Zellers and Weiner extended the search beyond that incident to enforcement of the alcoholic beverage control statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">There remains the question whether Zellers and Weiner so conducted themselves as to be chargeable with fraud, vitiating the authority given to the department and to peace officers to make a reasonable search of the licensee\u2019s premises. The only facts which remotely bear upon this contention are these: Zellers was not identified as a police officer but merely as a \u201cnew man,\u201d or simply \u201cDon Zellers,\u201d from which it could have been inferred by Lisner that Zellers was an employee of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Department; neither Zellers nor Weiner disclosed to Lisner that the object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>their visit was to locate contraband liquor. These facts standing alone do not constitute fraud or such deception as will vitiate an otherwise legal entry and search. Lisner had no reason to suppose that Zellers and Weiner were paying a social call upon him. The announced purpose of the visit was to conduct an investigation. Neither Weiner nor Zellers had a duty to inform Lisner of the exact capacity of Zellers. These facts fall far short of bad faith on the part of Zellers and Weiner. Lisner must have known that when records were not produced to substantiate the inventory on the bar premises, the officers might well draw inferences not only adverse to the licensee but potentially adverse to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Lisner\u2019s extrajudicial statements were not obtained in violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 478 [12 L.Ed.2d 977, 84 S.Ct. 1758], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 168, 398 P.2d 361].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Zellers testified unequivocally that, before any statements were elicited from Lisner, Zellers advised Lisner of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel. The trial court could have believed Zeller\u2019s testimony even though it was in some respects contradicted by the testimony of Weiner and of Lisner. It is elementary that the resolution of conflicts in the testimony is the function solely of the trial court with which this court cannot interfere. Zeller\u2019s warning adequately informed Lisner of his rights, and his declarations thereafter were admissible against him. <em>(E.g.,People </em>v. <em>Luker </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 464, 473 [47 Cal.Rptr. 209, 407 P.2d 9]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garner </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 212, 219-220 [44 Cal.Rptr. 217].)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The judgment (order granting probation) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Kaus, P.
