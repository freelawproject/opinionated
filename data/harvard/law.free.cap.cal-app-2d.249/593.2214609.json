Verdict and judgment went for defendant. Plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">The basic question on this appeal is whether the court prejudicially erred in admitting evidence as to the manner in which the accident occurred that was outside defendant\u2019s pretrial statement as to how it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">The accident occurred in the late afternoon of May 22, 1961, on Vanowen Street, 195 feet east of the intersection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Yanowen Street and Yan Alden Avenue in Reseda. Plaintiff, Elva I. Frasca, was eastbound in the southerly traffic lane which was unmarked.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant was traveling in the same direction. A rear end collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In the joint pretrial statement defendant did not state the portion of the highway on which she was traveling, merely that she was \" eastbound on Yanowen Street.\u201d In her separate pretrial statement defendant stated, under the heading Factual Issues Remaining in Dispute: \u201c (a) <em>The manner in which the accident occurred: </em>Defendants<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> contend that defendant Yiola 0. Warner was driving her vehicle in an easterly direction behind the vehicle operated by plaintiff Elva Frasca; that after both vehicles crossed the intersection of Yanowen and Yan Alden, and at a point about 195 feet past the intersection, said plaintiff, without proper or adequate warning or signal suddenly brought her vehicle to a stop to avoid colliding with a third vehicle which was attempting to back into a parking space at the <em>curb; </em>that said defendant applied her brakes and swerved her vehicle to the left, but was unable to avoid a collision, and the right front of defendant\u2019s vehicle struck the left rear of plaintiff\u2019s vehicle a glancing blow. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Under the heading Legal Issues Remaining in Dispute, defendant stated: \u201c (a) Negligence of defendant Viola Warner, (b) Negligence of plaintiff Elva Frasca. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In order to evaluate the problem at hand it is important to have a precise statement of the testimony of the operators of the two cars as to how the accident occurred. Plaintiff testified that she was traveling east on Vanowen and stopped at its intersection with Yan Alden because the traffic light was red. She \u201cwas in the lane nearest to the parked cars.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There were no cars immediately behind her while she was waiting for the green light. She checked on that by looking in her rear-view mirror two or three times while waiting for the light to change. But there was a line of three cars to plaintiff\u2019s left. During this period plaintiff looked ahead and observed some distance away that the driver of a car was \u2018 \u2018 trying to back into a parking place\u201d but was having some difficulty \u201cso he pulled out again to back in for the second time.\u201d As she went through the intersection plaintiff ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>served \u201cThere was quite a lot of traffic\u201d on her left and that she \u201ccould not get in the other lane,\u201d so she \u201cproceeded very slowly\u201d\u2014about ten miles per hour\u2014\u201canticipating that by the time I got to the person parking that he would park and I could proceed on.\u201d She applied her brakes a couple of times to break her speed a little as \u201cI noticed he wasn\u2019t getting into the parking place as fast as I thought he would.\u201d She did not know how close she was to the parking car when defendant\u2019s ear hit her car \u201cfrom behind.\u201d She said that the defendant\u2019s car pushed her car forward and the right front fender of her car hit the left front fender of the parking car (driven by a Mr. Cain) which \u201cwas pointed in a northerly direction.\u201d After the impact of plaintiff\u2019s car with the Cain car, the former was \u201calongside\u201d of the latter\u2014\u201ca little to the back, \u2019 \u2019 according to Mr. Cain.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">A police officer for the City of Los Angeles testified that Vanowen Street was 60 feet wide with a white line in the center; that the highway for both east and west travel was 30 feet. The officer was at the scene soon after the accident and placed the point of impact between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s cars at 23 feet north of the south curb of Vanowen Street. He based his opinion as to the point of impact on the skid marks of the defendant\u2019s car, and the presence of debris and glass from both cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was that at the time of the impact she was driving in the lane (unmarked) next to the parked cars, and that no part of her car was in the lane to her left. She was asked this question on cross-examination: \u201cDid you swerve your car to the left just before the accident ? A. Absolutely not. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Defendant testified that she stopped for the red light signal at the intersection of Vanowen and Van Alden in the lane next to the center line. She traveled in this same lane at a speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour until, as a result of her son\u2019s outcry, she observed plaintiff\u2019s car about a car\u2019s length away. Defendant slammed on her brakes and turned her wheels slightly to the left. She did not, however, cross over the center line of the roadway. Defendant\u2019s front right fender came in contact with plaintiff\u2019s rear left fender. It was a glancing blow. We then have these questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201c Q. Will you state at the moment of this collision whether or not any part of Mrs. Frasca\u2019s [plaintiff] vehicle was occupying the lane or a portion of it that your car was in ? A. I would say yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>\u201cQ. And at the moment of the collision can you tell us in what direction Mrs. Frasca\u2019s vehicle was pointed? A. Northeast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201cQ. And at the moment of the collision in what direction was your vehicle pointed ? A. Bast, slightly north. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Mrs. Frasca\u2019s car was suddenly in front of defendant going very slow. \u201cPlaintiff gave no signal\u201d but she did not make a sudden stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">After defendant rested, plaintiff made motion that the fact of the northeast direction of this automobile, any other matters in relation to any type of lane change or attempted lane change by defendant be stricken from the record as not in conformity with the written interrogatories and with the pretrial factual contentions of defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also moved for a directed verdict, or at least, that the court instruct the jury that contributory negligence was not an issue. Plaintiffs \u2019 motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Reduced to its simplest terms, it is plaintiffs\u2019 position that, in view of defendant\u2019s pretrial statement as to the factual issues remaining in dispute, defendant could only establish contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff by evidence that, \u201cwhile driving in the southerly traffic lane, she [plaintiff] did in fact suddenly stop without sufficient reason or signal when defendant was behind her. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">It is important that we bear in mind the precise factual issue defendant stated remained in dispute: It is stated in this language: \" <em>The Manner in Which the Accident Oc</em>curred.\u201d (Underscoring in the record.) Then follows a statement of what \u201cDefendants contend\u201d the evidence would show as to the manner in which the accident occurred. It appears that in some details defendant was in error. But it does identify the accident, its location, the parties involved; the fact a third party was attempting to park his car, that this interrupted plaintiff\u2019s forward progress, that defendant, in an effort to avoid hitting plaintiff\u2019s car applied her brakes and swerved her car to the left but was unable to prevent the right front of her vehicle hitting the left rear of plaintiff\u2019s vehicle a glancing blow. This leaves some uncertainty as to the lane of traffic (unmarked) in which defendant was traveling, and what plaintiff did when she found her forward progress interrupted by the car that was backing into the parking space. As to the lane in which defendant was traveling, it is true her counsel stated in the first and second lines of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ant\u2019s pretrial statement that she \u201cwas driving her vehicle in an easterly direction behind the vehicle operated by plaintiff Blva Frasca;\u201d after the semicolon the statement deals with operations of both vehicles after they crossed the intersection of Vanowen and Van Alden and no mention is made as to the traffic lane in which defendant was traveling. This circumstance has some significance since, in the joint pretrial statement under paragraph \u201cM\u201d\u2014\u201cDirection of and lanes vehicles were traveling in,\u201d we find this statement: \u201cDefendants\u2019\u2014Bast bound on VanOwen Street.\u201d There is no designation of the lane in which defendant was driving. At best, this created an uncertainty which was properly the subject of oral testimony. Plaintiff testified that she looked in her rear-view mirror two or three times while she was waiting for the traffic light to turn green, and there was no ear immediately behind her. Defendant testified that she stopped for the change of the traffic light in the lane nearest to the center line which would be to the left of plaintiff. Defendant also testified that, after crossing the intersection, she continued in that lane until the accident with plaintiff\u2019s car. Since it was established that defendant was driving in the lane nearest the center line, and, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, defendant hit her car \u201cfrom behind,\u201d it becomes relevant to determine the movement and location of plaintiff\u2019s car after her forward progress had been interrupted in her lane of travel by Cain backing his car into a parking space.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Thus, the testimony that, at the moment of the collision, plaintiff\u2019s car was occupying \u201cthe lane or a portion of it\u201d in which defendant\u2019s car was located, and that plaintiff\u2019s car was pointed in a northeast direction, and that the impact of the ears was 23 feet north of the south line of Vanowen Street (which placed it at least in part in defendant\u2019s lane of travel) was important and relevant in determining the movements of plaintiff\u2019s car and <em>the manner in which the accident occurred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the testimony relative to the \u201cnortheast\u201d direction of plaintiff\u2019s car, and \u201cany other matters in relation to any type of lane change or attempted lane change,\u201d as not in conformity with the pretrial factual contentions of defendant, the court made these pertinent observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cThe Court: Well, gentlemen, I cannot buy the argument that the trial court is put in a straitjacket by the pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>statement and its hands are tied, cannot instruct on issues that the evidence clearly demonstrates exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cNow, we say that the pretrial is designed to achieve justice and the truth, and yet, if that is true, then putting the trial court in a strait jacket is going to obstruct justice and the truth rather than to achieve it. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The philosophy underlying the trial court\u2019s rulings on the matters at bench is in harmony with the principles announced by the federal courts which have had extensive experience in dealing with pretrial orders and statements. <em>(Century Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>316 F.2d 15; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>328 F.2d 591.) In <em>Century Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(pp. 19-20) the court stated: \u201cBut, while the pre-trial order should measure the dimensions of a lawsuit and govern its course in the absence of some good reason for departure, this does not mean that the order should not be liberally construed to embrace all of the legal and factual theories inherent in the issues defined therein. Any other construction of the pre-trial order would tend to unduly constrict the trial of the case and defeat the central and salutary purpose of the Federal Buies of Civil Procedure to insure the trial of every lawsuit on its merits. . . . and not to defeat it on a technicality.\u201d In <em>Clark </em>the court stated at page 594: \u201c. . . it is a fundamental principle of pre-trial that this procedure be flexible, with' power reserved to the trial judge to amend the order or permit a departure from strict adherence to the pre-trial statement of either party, when the interests of justice make such a course desirable.\u201d The decisions of our own courts are not contrary to these principles. In <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>177 Cal.App.2d 207 [2 Cal.Rptr. 104], the court stated: \u201cWe do not believe that it was intended that the pretrial order should do away with the power of the trial court to permit amendments to conform to the proof. Justice may sometimes require that the effect of a pretrial order be not so restrictive even when the order is not modified.\u201d (P. 211.) This statement was quoted in <em>Rocky Mountain Export Co. </em>v. <em>Colquitt, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 204, 206 [3 Cal.Rptr. 512] ; <em>Vesci </em>v. <em>Ingrim, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 419, 424 [11 Cal.Rptr. 830], and <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>209 Cal.App.2d 450, 452 [25 Cal.Rptr. 923], In <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Disneyland, Inc., </em>213 Cal.App.2d 297 [28 Cal.Rptr. 689], the court commented: \u201cThe purpose of pretrial is to expedite the proceedings and to facilitate the correct determination of the issues.\u201d (P. 300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">To have granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>question would have left the jury with an incomplete picture of how the accident occurred. This would not have served to facilitate \u201cthe correct determination of the issues,\u201d <em>(Mays </em>v. <em>Disneyland, Inc., supra) </em>and would not have been in the interest of justice. The trial judge acted well within his discretion in making the rulings here challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Following the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motions to strike or to advise the jury that contributory negligence was not an issue, and for a directed verdict plaintiffs asserted surprise<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by reason of the court\u2019s rulings and made a motion to reopen their case. The motion was granted. Plaintiffs then called Mr. Cain, the operator of the ear that was in the process of being parked. He did not recall having seen either of the cars before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In view of our conclusions it is unnecessary to discuss other points that counsel have debated.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Jefferson, Acting P. J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 6, 1967, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 17, 1967.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-19\">Retired Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> There was, however, a center line separating east and west traffic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A3q0\">Defendants other than Viola 0.
