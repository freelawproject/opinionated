The Board filed its answer and a hearing was held. The facts are undisputed and are as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>forth in the findings of the court and with the conclusions of law are, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">\u201c1.1 \u2018Respondent is the California State Board of Pharmacy which is a hoard within the Department of Professional and Vocational Standards of the government of the State of California. Said Board is responsible for the enforcement and administration of the laws of the State of California relating to pharmacies which laws are set forth in Division 2, Chapter 9 of the Business and Professions Code. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201c1.2 \u2018At all times mentioned herein, petitioner was and is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\u201c1.3 \u2018Petitioner owns and operates Warrack Hospital located in Santa Rosa, California, which is licensed as a hospital under Division 2, Chapter 2 of the Health and Safety Code (Sections 1400, et seq.).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">\u201c1.4 \u2018On or about April 13, 1965, Petitioner applied to said Board for a permit to operate a pharmacy at said Hospital.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">\u201c1.5 \u2018Said pharmacy laws authorize said Board to issue a permit to conduct a pharmacy not only to a natural person but also to a firm, association, partnership and corporation. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">\u201c1.6 \u2018On April 29, 1965, at San Francisco, California, said Board refused to issue to Petitioner such a permit on the sole . . . ground that some of Petitioner\u2019s shareholders and officers were physicians and surgeons licensed under Chapter 5, Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code. Petitioner otherwise complied with all requirements of said Board for the issuance of a pharmacy permit. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">\u201c1.7 \u2018On May 18,1965, at Palm Springs, said Board reconsidered said application but denied the same on the same grounds. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">\u201c1.8 \u2018Business and Professions Code, Section 4080.5 enacted and effective in 1963 provides: \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c The board shall not issue any new permit to conduct a pharmacy to a person who is licensed under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2000 of this division.) \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">\u201c1.9 \u2018Chapter 5 (Sections 2000, et seq.) of the Code provides for the licensing of physicians and surgeons to practice medicine in the State of California. Only a natural person may be so licensed to practice medicine. Section 2006 of said Chapter provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe term \u2018person\u2019 means a natural person when a right, privilege, or power is conferred by this chapter upon a person.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">\u201c1.10 \u2018Petitioner, a corporation, is not a natural person and is not \u201ca person who is licensed under Chapter 5\u201d within the meaning of Section 4080.5. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201c1.11 \u2018In the proceeding by which said Board so refused to grant said permit, a hearing was not required to be given Petitioner, evidence was not required to be taken.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cII. The following facts were stipulated to by the parties (\u2018Stipulation Of Pact\u2019 (Court\u2019s Exh. 1)), the Stipulation was accepted by the Court and therefore the facts accepted as true:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201c \u2018In order to avoid any issue of fact arising as a result of the denial of the allegations of paragraph 4 of the Petition for Writ of Mandate, Petitioner and Respondent hereby stipulate as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201c \u20181. There are 62,240% shares of the stock of Petitioner outstanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201c \u20182. There are 3,167% of such shares owned directly by 38 physicians and surgeons licensed under Chapter 5, Division II, of the Business and Professions Code. The largest single such shareholder holds 276% shares. Thus, approximately 5% of the shares of Petitioner are owned directly by licensed physicians and surgeons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">\u201c \u20183. There are 37,420 shares of Petitioner (or about 60% of the outstanding stock) owned by Katella Community Hospital, a partnership. The partnership interests in Katella Community Hospital are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">\u201c\u2018(a) Hospital Building Company holds 27%% of the partnership interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-12\">\u201c \u2018 (b) Sharpe Medical Management Corporation owns 4% of the partnership interests; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">\u201c\u2018(c) Doctor\u2019s Participating Company, a corporation, owns 68%% of said partnership interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-14\">\u201c \u2018No licensed physician and surgeon holds any interest in Hospital Building Company or in Sharpe Management Corporation. The only stock of Doctor\u2019s Participating Company owned by a licensed physician and surgeon is that held by L. H. Glaser, M.D., who is neither an officer or director of Petitioner nor a member of its staff. Dr. Glaser owns 100% of the stock of Doctor\u2019s Participating Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-15\">\u201c \u20184. Therefore, the indirect holding of Dr. Glaser in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Katella Community Hospital is 41.1% (68.5% of 60% equals 41.1%).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201c \u20185. Therefore, the total direct and indirect ownership of Petitioner by licensed physicians and surgeons is 46.1%, consisting of said 5% direct ownership and 41.1% ownership by Dr. Glaser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">\u201c \u2018There are no questions as to matters of fact essential to the determination of the Petition within the meaning of Section 1090 of the Code of Civil Procedure. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u2018 \u2018 III. The Court additionally finds true:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">\u201cIII.l That there is no plain or speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law available to Petitioner other than said Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\u201cIV. The Court makes no findings upon Paragraph 12 of the Petition. The constitutionality or unconstitutionality of Section 4080.5 Business and Professions Code is not herein involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">\u201cFrom the foregoing facts, the Court makes the following Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">\u2018 \u2018 Conclusions Of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">\u201cI. Petitioner is entitled to have issued unto it, and a duty is specially imposed by law upon Respondent to issue unto Petitioner, a Permit under the Pharmacy Law (Division 2, Chapter 9, \u00a7\u00a7 4000 to 4416 B. &amp; P. Code) to operate and conduct a Hospital Pharmacy (\u00a7 4435.1 B. &amp; P. Code), in the Warrack Hospital, Santa Rosa, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-14\">\u201cII. Section 4080.5, B. &amp; P. Code does not prohibit, nor is Respondent empowered thereunder to refuse to issue a Permit to Petitioner to operate and conduct a Hospital Pharmacy in the Warrack Hospital, Santa Rosa, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-15\">\u201cIII. Section 654, B. &amp; P. Code does not prohibit, nor is Respondent empowered thereunder to refuse to issue to Petitioner a Hospital Pharmacy Permit to operate and conduct a Hospital Pharmacy in the said Warrack Hospital, Santa Rosa, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-16\">\u2018 \u2018 IV. A Peremptory Writ of Mandate should issue, directed to respondent, commanding it to issue unto Petitioner a Permit under the Pharmacy Law to operate and conduct a Hospital Pharmacy in the Warrack Hospital, Santa Rosa, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-17\">\u201cV. Petitioner is entitled to have and recover of and from Respondent its costs and disbursements herein. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The question is does section 4080.5, Business and Professions Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> compel the Board to deny a pharmacy permit to a corporation the stock of which is owned by licensees doctors of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Appellant justifies its denial of a nharmacy permit under the theory that the Board \u201cshall not issue any new permit to conduct a pharmacy to a -person who is licensed under Chapter 5 ...\u201d At the same time, appellant admits that \u201c [o]nly a natural person may be so licensed to practice medicine. ...\u201d and that \u201cPetitioner, a corporation, is not a natural person and is not \u2018a person who is licensed under Chapter 5\u2019 within the meaning of Section 4080.5.\u201d (Findings 1.9 and 1.10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Appellant asserts however that it has \u201cthe power to look behind the facade of corporate applicants and inquire into the qualifications of the owners of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is further asserted by the Board that the purpose of section 4081<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was to allow the Board the power to determine whether any nonnatural applicant for a permit was beneficially owned by persons who are ineligible for -a permit under section 4080.5, Business and Professions Code. The Legislature could have prohibited or barred corporate applicants which were \u201cbeneficially owned\u201d by a person or persons licensed by chapter 5, but it did not expressly do so. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>legislative history of section 4081 demonstrates that it was not intended thereby to be a grant of power to the Board to police the provisions of section 4080.5. The doctrine of piercing the corporate veil repeatedly in the past has been brought into play to prevent fraud, but admittedly this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In any event, it would seem from the face of the record that Warrack seeks only to operate a hospital pharmacy, and under section 654, Business and Professions Code, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> such a facility is exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">On this date this court has filed its opinion in <em>Magan Medical Clinic </em>v. <em>California State Board of Medical Examiners, post, </em>p. 124 [57 Cal.Rptr. 256] which is dispositive of the issue presented in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">For the reasons herein stated, and for the reasons stated in <em>Magan, </em>the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Wood, P.
