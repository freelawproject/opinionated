That memorial, among other things, stated: \u201cWhen this State government was formed, the whole country on the west and north was one continued wilderness, inhabited by none but savages, and but little known to the people or to the Government of the United States. Its geography was unwritten, and none of our citizens possessed an accurate knowledge of its localities, except a few adventurous hunters and Indian traders. The western boundary of- the State' a? indicated by the act, of Congress of the sixth of March, eighteen hundred1 and twenty, and adopted by the Constitution of Missouri; is a 'meridian line passing, through the middle of the mouth of the Kansas River, where the same empties into .the Missouri River,\u2019 and extends from the parallel of latitude of 36 degrees' and thirty minutes north, 'to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the river Des Moines.\u2019 The part of this line which lies <em>north of the Missouri River </em>has never be\u00e9n surveyed and established, and consequently its precise position, and extent are unknown. It is believed, however, that it extends about one .hundred miles north, from the Missouri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>River, and almost parallel with the course of the stream, so as to leave <em>between the line and the river a narrow strip of land, </em>varying in breadth from fifteen to thirty miles. This small strip of land was acquired by the United States from the Kansas Indians, by the treaty of the third of June, eighteen hundred and twenty-five, and is now unappropriated and at the free disposal of the General Government. . . . These considerations seem to us sufficiently obvious to impress upon the public mind the necessity of interposing, whenever it is possible, some visible boundary and natural barrier between the Indians and the whites. The Missouri River, bending as it does, beyond our northern line, will afford the barrier against all the Indians on the southwest side of that river, by extending the north boundary of this State in a straight line westward, <em>until it strikes the Missouri, so as to include within this State the small district of country between that line and the river, </em>which we suppose is not more than sufficient to make two, or at most three, respectable counties. ... In every view, then, we consider it \u00e9xpedient that the district of country in question should be annexed to and incorporated with the State of Missouri; and to that end we respectfully ask the consent of Congress. . . . With these views of the present condition and future importance of that little section of country, and seeing the impossibility of conveniently attaching it now or hereafter to any other State, your memorialists consider it highly desirable, and indeed necessary, that it should be annexed to and form a part of the State of Missouri.

It is not the bed and banks which constitute the river, but the natural stream of water. When observed from the standpoint of the reason upon which the legislature of.

In this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that territory known as Platte\u2019s Purchase, was annexed to Missouri by reason of a memorial coming from its. legislative department in 1831, wherein certain important and substantial reasons were set out why the Missouri River, north of the mouth of the.Kaw, should be fixed forever as an absolute boundary of Missouri. Soon afterwards this territory was annexed to the jurisdiction of the State. Congress had undoubted authority to annex the territory in the manner herein described. There can be no question but that it was the intention of the legislature of Missouri to make the request in the manner herein presented, because it was so shown clearly from the resolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-5\">As the annexation statute construed in the light of the memorial, shows the plain intention of Congress was to make the Missouri River wherever it might run the absolute boundary of the State, it matters not whether those conditions still exist which were considered in the memorial, and which authorized, warranted and induced Congress to so ordain. The conditions which moved Congress to enact the statute may have passed away.

Indeed, had the fact in question been raised'long prior to the admission of Nebraska into the Union, and after the annexation statute had been approved, no one would have questioned the right of Missouri to claim and obtain absolute sovereignty over the territory here involved. This principle is made manifest by reason of the terms of the statute construed in the light of the memorial and it fixes a vested privilege and right in the State of Missouri regardless of what might afterwards have been done by the Federal Congress without the consent of this complainant.

The act furnishes no foundation for complainant\u2019s argument that the shifting channel of the Missouri River, wherever it may be, whether changed by accretion or avulsion, is the eternal boundary line between Missouri and Nebraska.

But on the day just named, July 5, 1867 (which was after the admission of Nebraska into the Union), within twenty-four hours and during a time of very high water, the river, which had for years passed around what is called McKissick\u2019s Island-, cut a new channel across and through the narrow neck of land at the west end of Island Precinct (of which McKissick\u2019s Island formed a part), about a half mile wide, making for itself a new channel and passing .through what was admittedly, at that time, territory of Nebraska. After that change the river ceased to run around McKissick\u2019s Island. In the course of a few years, after the new channel was thus made, the old channel dried up and became tillable land, valuable for agricultural purposes, whereby the old bed of the river was vacated about fifteen miles in length. This change in the bed or channel of the river became fixed and permanent; for, at the commencement of this suit it was the same as it was immediately after the change that occurred on the fifth day of July, 1867. The result was that the land between the channel of the river as it was prior to July 5, 1867, and the channel as it was after that date and-is now, was thrown on the east side of the Missouri River; whereas, prior to that date it had been on the west side.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The fundamental question in the case is, whether the sudden and permanent change in the course and channel of the river occurring on the'fifth day of July, 1867, worked a change in the boundary line between the two States.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The former decisions of this court relating to boundary lines between States seem to make this case easy of solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>10 Pet. 662, 717, argued elaborately by eminent lawyers, Mr. Webster among the number, this court said: \u201cThe question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded by a stream of water, which changes its course gradually by alluvial forma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tions,. shall still hold by. the same boundary, including the accumulated soil. No other rule can be applied on just principles. Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss, by the same means which may add to his territory; and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable- for his gain.\u201d It was added \u2014 what is pertinent to the present case \u2014 that \u201c this rule is no less just when applied to public, than to private rights.\u201d The subject was under consideration in <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>11 Wall. 395, and <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>136 U. S. 479. But it again came under consideration in <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>143 U. S. 359, 361, 367, 370. In the latter case, the court, after referring to the rule announced in <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>and citing prior cases in which that rule had been recognized, said: \u201cIt is equally well settled, that where a stream, which is a boundary, from any cause suddenly abandons its old and seeks a new bed,'such change of channel works no change of boundary; and that the boundary remains as it was,' in the center of the old channel, although- no water may be flowing therein. This sudden arid rapid change of channel is termed, in the law, avulsion. In Gould on Waters, sec. 159, it is said: \u2018But if the change is violent and visible, and arises from a known cause, such as a freshet, or a cut through which a new channel is formed, the original thread of the stream continues to mark the limits of the two estates.\u2019 2 Bl.

C.), 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u201cThese propositions, which are universally rec\u00f3gnized as correct where the boundaries of private property touch on streams, are in like manner recognized where the boundaries between States or nations are, by prescription or treaty, found in running water. Accretion, no matter to which side it adds ground, leaves the boundary still the center of the channel. Avulsion has no effect on .boundary, but leaves it in the center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of the old channel.\u201d Again, in the same case, .the court, referring to the very full examination of the authorities to be found in one of the opinions of Attorney General Cushing (8 Op. Atty. Gen\u2019l, 175), said: \u201cThe result of these authorities puts it beyond doubt that accretion on an ordinary river would leave the boundary between two States the varying center of the channel, and that avulsion would establish a fixed boundary, to wit, the center of the abandoned channel. It is contended, however, that the doctrine of accretion has no application to the Missouri River, on account of the rapid and great changes constantly going on in respect to its banks; but the contrary has already been decided by this court in <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Land Company, </em>134 U. S. 178, 189.\u201d In <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>it appeared that the Missouri River near the land there in dispute had pursued a course in the nature of an ox-bow, but it suddenly cut through the neck of the bow and made for itself a new channel. The court said: \u201cThis does not come within the law of accretion, but that of avulsion. By this selection .of a new channel the boundary was not changed, and it remained as it was prior to the avulsion, the center line of the old channel; and that, unless the waters of the river returned to their former bed, became a fixed and unvarying boundary, no matter what might be the changes of the river in its new channel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Manifestly, these observations cover the present case and make it.clear that the boundary line between Missouri and Nebraska in the vicinity of Island Precinct cannot be taken to be the middle of the channel of the Missouri River, as it has been since the avulsion of 1867 and now is, but must be taken to be the middle of the channel of the river as it wasi prior to such avulsion. We cannot see that there are any facts or circumstances' that withdraw the present case from the rule established in former adjudications;</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Counsel for Missouri contend that the act admitting Missouri into the Union, the memorial sent by the Legislature of that State to Congress in 1831, and the act of June 7,1836, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>proclamation of the President as to the extinguishment of. Indian titles to lands between Missouri, as originally bounded, and the Missouri River, show that Congress intended that, so far as the boundary of the State of Missouri was concerned, the middle of the channel of the . Missouri River, wherever it may be at any particular time \u2014 and regardless df any changes, however caused or however extended, or permanent, suddenly occurring in its course or channel \u2014 was to be taken as a perpetual, natural monument fixing the boundary line. We cannot accept this view. We perceive no reason to believe that Congress intended, either by the acts of 1820 and 1836 relating to Missouri or the act admitting Nebraska into the Union, to alter the recognized rules of law which fix the rights of parties where a river changes its course by gradual, insensible accretions, or the rules that obtain in cases where, by what is called avulsion, the course of a river is materially and permanently changed. Missouri does not dispute the fact that when Nebraska was admitted into the Union the body of land described in the present record as Island Precinct was inNebraska.' It is equally clear-that those lands did not cease to be within the limits of Nebraska by reason of the avulsion of July 5, 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">For the reason stated we adjudge, in respect of the matters involved in this suit, that the middle of the channel of the Missouri River, according to its course as it was prior to the avulsion of July 5, .1867, is the true boundary line between Missouri and Nebraska. Accordingly, the original bill must .be dismissed, and a decree entered in favor of the State of Nebraska on its cross bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">It appears from the record that about the year 1895 the county surveyors of Nemaha County, Nebraska, and Atchison County, Missouri, made surveys of the abandoned bed of the Missouri River, in the locality here in question, ascertained the location of the original banks of -the river on either side, and to some extent marked the middle of the old channel. If the two States agree upon these surveys and. locations as correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>marking the original banks of the river and the middle of the ,old channel, the court will, by decree, give eifect to that agreement; or, if either State desires a new survey the court will order one to be made and cause monuments to be placed so as to permanently mark the boundary line between the two States. The disposition of the case by final decree is postponed for forty days, in order that the court may be advised as to the wishes of the parties in respect of these details.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
