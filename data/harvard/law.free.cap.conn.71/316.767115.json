The reason for treating this institution in an exceptional manner is that it contributes to the welfare of the State. Its function is largely a public function. Its work is done primarily, indeed, for individuals, but ultimately for the public good. Other communities pay large sums to secure the presence of a lunatic asylum, a jail or a state prison; hut the assessors of New Haven would strip this venerable seat of learning of an exemption for which it returns, in mere money value, a twenty-fold equivalent. Courts of justice, should occasion require, would he astute in finding reasons to defeat so inequitable a result. The plaintiff\u2019s buildings are within the statutory exemption. This appears from a consideration of Colonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and State legislation in reference to the exemption claimed; from the construction given to that legislation by the uniform and universal practice of the Colony and State for nearly two centuries; from the nature and character of the work authorized by the plaintiff\u2019s Acts of incorporation, and of the means and methods necessary to carry into effect the objects and purposes of said Acts; from the significant fact no reported case can be found where an attempt, even, has been seriously made to subject \u201c a college building \u201d to taxation ; from the overwhelming weight of authority, as shown by the decisions in analogous cases. Gen. Stats. Rev. 1702, Rev. 1750, p. 108, Rev. 1784, p. Ill, Rev. 1796, p. 252, Rev. 1808, p. 438; Pub. Acts, 1802, p. 25; Comp, of 1838, p. 602; Rev. 1849, pp. 603, 604; Pub.

The practical construction given to this legislation appears from the fact that prior to October, 1896, none of the buildings mentioned in the first of the reasons of appeal were ever in fact taxed or set in the list of New Haven, or elsewhere for that purpose. The controlling force of such long continued and universal practice is a matter of elementary law. <em>Yudkin </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>60 Conn. 429. The buildings sought to be taxed are, in the most restricted and appropriate sense of the words, exclusively occupied as kl colleges,\u201d as no other buildings are or can be. 6 Ency. Brit. (9th ed.) p. 142. It is an important fact that this is the first serious attempt to subject a college dormitory, so-called, to taxation; and the following decisions are conclusive against the success of the attack. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>24 N.

There is nothing in the charter of 1701 which exempts or attempts to exempt the estate of the University from taxation. The charter of 1745 removes the limitation to hold property provided by the Act of 1701, and for the first time exempts college property from taxation. But the only exemption from rates or taxes was based solely upon the amount of yearly value (which we assume to mean yearly income). It does not exempt the building because it is occupied as a college, or because it is owned by and used exclusively for scientific, literary, benevolent or ecclesiastical societies. It does not exempt property that is non-income producing. The amendment of 1834 simply increases the exemption from the yearly value of \u00bf\u00a3500, to the right to hold real estate affording an annual income of not more than $6,000. It also exempts from taxation other funds, absolutely. The charter and the statute laws should be strictly construed. <em>Gillette </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>31 Conn. 357; <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Theological Sem., supra ; Brainard </em>v. Colchester, 31 id. 410. The dormitories. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>so-called, are not exempt under \u00a7 3820 of the General Statutes. The statute does not provide that buildings used for the benefit or promotion of the college, or for the accommodation or benefit of students, or for dining-rooms or sleeping rooms for students, shall be exempt from taxation. The statute does not say that when the income is used for the benefit of the University or for the b\u00f3nefit of the students, it shall not be taxed. The exemption is limited to property exclusively occupied as colleges. The dormitories are not exclusively occupied as colleges. They are unfitted for any other use or purpose than that to which they are at present devoted, to wit: as sleeping, study and living rooms for the use of students. It appears from the finding and term bills that these dormitories are rented, and that the net income compares favorably with ordinary investments of like character. \u00b0 The result of the investments in these buildings shows that the University has made a safe and profitable business transaction. The following cases sustain our claim, that the above property is not exempt from taxation. <em>Cincinnati College </em>v. State, 19 Ohio, 110; <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Sheffield Scientific School, </em>59 Conn. 166; <em>Manresa Inst. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>61 id. 228; <em>University </em>v. <em>People, </em>99 U.

The dining-hall is assessed at $8,100. The business carried on in it yields a profit equivalent to the interest upon $10,000, the cost of the equipment, and an additional amount for a sinking fund. There are two items of property about which no question can be made: the first relates to the residence occupied by Prof. Brown, assessed at $15,078; the second relates to three lots on Howe street, assessed at $3,165. Did we have no statutes exempting from taxation, but in place thereof had statutes directly appropriating the money of the State, city or town for the benefit of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>institutions, there would he no doubt but that they would receive a very strict construction. It is not any excuse to an assessor for failure to discharge his duty, that his predecessors in office failed to discharge their duties/ Furthermore, the rights of the public cannot be waived or affected by omission to assess property which ought to be assessed, no matter for how long continued. Before any construction of the statutes in question can be claimed by force of alleged acquiescence, it must be shown that the assessors knew of the facts which exposed the property of the appellant to taxation. King <em>v. </em>Hogg, 1 T. R. 721; <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>12 Allen, 316; <em>Landon </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>11 Conn. 263.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b331-6\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aud\">In 1887 the corporation of the President and Fellows of Yale College in New Haven was authorized to use the title \u201cYale University,\u201d and gifts received and contracts made under either of said names were declared to be valid. The powers of the corporation were not otherwise changed. 10 Special Laws, 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In October, 1895, the University filed with the assessors of the town of New Haven a list of the property owned by it subject to taxation for the year 1896. The list contained seven pieces of land valued at $57,680. To this list the assessors added certain buildings used for dormitories and dining-hall, with the land on which they stood, valued at $214,990; and also added certain vacant building lots, dwelling-houses and factories, valued at $167,112. The plaintiff appealed to the board of relief, which confirmed the action of the assessors. This appeal is an application to the Superior Court, alleging that the board of relief acted illegally in confirming the action of the assessors, and praying for appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The alleged illegality depends on the meaning given to two statutes, <em>vis., </em>\u00a7 3820 of. General Statutes, and the Act of 1834 amending the charter of the College, which appears also in \u00a7 3822 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\"><em>First. </em>Section 8820 of the General Statutes provides that \u201c buildings or portions of buildings exclusively occupied as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>colleges, academies, churches or public school-houses or infirmaries,\u201d shall be exempt from taxation. If buildings used by the College exclusively as dormitories and dining-halls for its students, are buildings exclusively occupied as a college, then the action complained of in adding to the list dormitories and dining-hall, was illegal; if such use is not a college occupation, then said action was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The word \u201ccollege,\u201d used to denote a constitutent of or the equivalent of \u201c university,\u201d has acquired a definite meaning. As first used \u201c college \u201d indicated a place of residence for students, and occasionaly an \u201c universitas \u201d or \u201c studium generale.\u201d The expressions \u201c universitas stiidii \u201d and \u201c universitatis collegium,\u201d occur in early official documents. A suggestion of the modern university appears in the college and library of Alexandria founded and endowed by Ptolemy Soter. Here the Museum provided, from the first, lodgings and refectory for the professors, and later similar provisions were made for the students. A writer of the 12th century speaks of the \u201c handsome pile of buildings, which has twenty colleges whither students betake themselves from all parts of the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The university in Europe developed about the year 1200. It was a community organized for the study of all branches of knowledge and authorized by Pope, King or Emperor to confer degrees upon those found competent to instruct others. At Bologna; perhaps the earliest organized university, we find colleges almost from the beginning. Such college was a separate house with a fund for the maintenance of a specified number of poor students. Similar colleges existed in Paris, Oxford and other universities. At first little more than lodging rooms and refectory, they grew, especially in England, to be the home of the students for all purposes. The instruction and discipline of the university was through the colleges. The conditions of the early universities were peculiar. Vast throngs of students were gathered at one place; they were divided into \u201cnations,\u201d each, as at Paris, with its own proctor or procurator; they were further divided among faculties each with its dean. The divisions into nations and faculties were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>cross divisions; and another cross division was that into colleges and halls (hall sometimes meaning an unorganized college, and sometimes used as synonymous with college). With changes in conditions, the college was largely eliminated from the continental universities, while in England the university became practically the associated colleges. Merton College, Oxford, founded in 1264, was the prototype of the English college. That college consisted of the chapel, refectory and dormitories. Here the scholars called fellows, in token of the spirit of equality and companionship, lived under one government, educational and moral, and prepared to take the degree granted by the university. As the colleges increased all non-collegiate students were driven away. The vagabonds or chamber-dekyns, <em>i. e. camera </em>degens, living in lodgings as opposed to those who lived in a college, disappeared. Each student in a college must belong to the university, and each student of the university must be attached to a college. And the heads of the colleges administered the university. Thus was developed the English theory of the university, where the honors and influence of the <em>studium gener\u00f3le </em>are gained and enjoyed by students living and working under the government of their respective colleges. As Newman says, the university to enforce discipline developed itself into colleges, and so the term college \u201cwas taken to mean a place of residence for the university student who would there find himself under the guidance and instructions of superiors and tutors, bound to attend to his personal interest moral and intellectual.\u201d (See passim, Vol. 3, Newman, Hist. Sketches; Lyte\u2019s History of University of Oxford; Vols. 1 and 2 Huber\u2019s English Universities; Ency. Brit., University.) The college and university however were sometimes united in one corporation. Newman says, \u201cThe University of Toulouse was founded in a college; so was Orleans.\u201d Trinity College, Dublin, styled in its charter (1591) \u201c The College of the Holy undivided Trinity of Queen Elisabeth near Dublin,\u201d is both university and college. It was founded by the Queen as a \u201c <em>mater universitatis ; </em>\u201d but the hope was not realized and the university and college have ever since re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>mained one, called in common speech indiscriminately \u201c Trinity College, Dublin,\u201d \u201cDublin University,\u201d \u201cThe University of Trinity College, Dubliu.\u201d Marischal College, Aberdeen, was founded in 1593 as a college and a university, with power of conferring degrees. And so at the beginning of the 17th century the students of an English university lived in. colleges, were instructed and governed through colleges, whether the university included a number of colleges or a single college; and among the buildings indispensable for every college were the great hall or dining-room, and the living rooms or dormitories.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In establishing universities in the new world, the limitations of the people compelled the founders to follow the example of Trinity College, Dublin, and Marischal College, Aberdeen, and not that of Oxford and Cambridge. Upon the same corporation wak conferred the power of the university in granting degrees, and of the college in government; and such c.ommunity and the buildings required for its use were known as \u201c the College.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The first appropriation to endow a \u201cUniversity\u201d in Virginia, was made in 1607. In 1660 an Act of the colonial legislature endowed \u201cthe College,\u201d and in 1693 William III. established the University, described in the charter as \u201c a certain place of universal study or perpetual college of divinity, philosophy, languages and other good arts and science,\u2019\u2019-and named it \u201cThe College of William and Mary in Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The settlers of New England early felt the need of a local university, and the first step was the erection of a college, <em>i. e. </em>a building where the students were to be lodged, fed and instructed while pursuing the university studies and qualifying for its degrees. In 1630 the General Court at Boston advanced \u00bf6400 for this purpose, and subsequently appointed Newtown as the seat of the university, and for this reason changed the name of the town to Cambridge. 2 Mather\u2019s Magnolia, pp. 7-9, 19, 20; Quincy\u2019s <em>Hist, of Harvard. </em>In 1642 the court established overseers of \u201ca College founded in Cambridge,\u201d and in 1650 the charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>was granted. The statutes immediately adopted, provided that all students admitted to the college \u201cmust hoard at the Commons,\u201d and also provided for conferring the first and second degrees in arts. While the college exercised some of the privileges of a university, doubt was felt as to the power of the General Court to confer such privileges. The colonial charter of 1692 was construed as authorizing the court to erect a university, and immediately, as Mather says, the General Assembly granted \u201c a charter to this University,\u201d authorizing it to grant degrees \u201cas in the Universities in England.\u201d This charter expired within three years, from failure to receive the royal approval, and the college was subsequently reorganized under the charter of 1650. The degree of D. D. was conferred by the College in 1693 on Increase Mather, its president, who, in conferring the degrees at the first commencement after the new charter, maintained that \u201cthe right of establishing universities, ('academias) is reserved to all those, and to those only, who hold the sovereignty in the State,\u201d and that the General Court, under the charter of 1692, possessed such sovereignty. No other degree of doctorate was conferred until 1771, when Nat\u2019l Appleton was made doctor of divinity; and a few years later George Washington was made doctor of laws. The Massachusetts Constitution of 1779 recognized \u201cThe University at Cambridge,\u201d and ratified and confirmed all the rights and privileges it had been accustomed to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The Colonies of Connecticut and New Haven were at first unable to erect a college by themselves,-and for some years contributed to that of Cambridge. The plan of a college at New Haven was early mooted, and in 1654 steps were taken towards its consummation. Davenport wished to direct the benefaction of Governor Hopkins to the founding of a college, and the court of that Colony acceded to that plan. The difficulties attending the union of the Colonies of New Haven and Connecticut obstructed the execution of the plan, and eventually the funds were appropriated to the Hopkins Grammar School. In 1698 the plan was revived, and ten of the principal ministers agreed to stand as trustees to found, erect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>and govern a college. They formed themselves into a society at New Haven in 1700, and the same year, at a meeting at Branford, they (in the language of Trumbull) \u201cfounded the University of Yale College.\u201d 1 Trum. <em>Hist, of Qonn. </em>402. In 1701 the General Court of Connecticut granted to said trustees the privilege of founding, endowing and ordering a \u201c Collegiate School,\u201d and authorized them to acquire and hold real estate not exceeding the value of \u00bf6500 per annum, and personal property to any amount, for the use of said school and for erecting and endowing the same. 4 Col. Rec. 368. The Act did not purport to establish a college and university, unless by indirection; but the trustees, following the example of Harvard, proceeded at once to grant degrees in arts. Until 1716 the school was migratory; the trustees then decided that it should be established at New Haven, and this decision was confirmed by the legislature the following year. 6 Col. Rec. 30. In pursuance of this authority, aided by appropriations by the colonial government, as well as by gifts from Governor Yale and other benefactors, a college house \u201c for the entertainment of the scholars \u201d was so far finished in 1718 as \u201c to be fit for the reception and accommodation of all the students.\u201d It contained nearly fifty studies and was furnished with a convenient hall, library and kitchen. At the commencement for that year, in the presence of the authorities of the Colony, the trustees did, \u201c with one consent agree, determine and ordain that our College House shall be called by the name of its munificent patron, and shall be named Yale College.\u201d 2 Trum. <em>Hist. Conn. </em>11. In 1745, under the energetic rule of President Clapp, a body of statutes was drawn up, derived partly from the laws and customs of the College, partly from the laws of Harvard, and partly from the University of Oxford; and the same year the General Court assuming the right of exercising within its jurisdiction the powers of sovereignty belonging to an independent government, not inconsistent with express statutes of England, which it always claimed, though with much fear and trembling and with great caution, granted a charter somewhat like in form to a royal patent, erecting a corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>university and college under the name of \u201c The President and Fellows of Yale College in New Haven,\u201d endowing it as university and college with the power of self-government and of making all reasonable laws and ordinances for that purpose, and with the power of conferring all such degrees as are usually given in colleges or universities, and with the power to appoint a scribe or register, a treasurer, tutors, professors, steward, and all such other officers and servants usually appointed in colleges or universities for the promotion of good literature, and for the well ordering and managing the affairs of said College. It is plain that the College thus erected involved, as an essential feature, the education and government of university students in college houses under college officers. The \u201c Colleges or Universities \u201d referred to in the charter were the universities in England administered by associated colleges, or the single colleges endowed with the privileges of a university. In both, the \u201c College \u201d involved, necessarily, buildings for the residence and entertainment of the officers and students. The General Court again and again contributed to the erection of such buildings. When in 1753 the trustees of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) applied to the General Assembly of Connecticut for leave to set up a lottery to raise money \u201c to build a public house for entertaining the students and better answering the good ends designed in founding and erecting said college,\u201d the Assembly granted the liberty, \u201c on consideration of the matters in said petition, and for the encouragement of religion and learning.\u201d 10 Col. Rec. 217. The \u201c College \u201d and the buildings for entertaining the students under college government, were inseparable. In 1818 Yale College consisted of three college buildings for housing the officers and students, a lyceum, a chapel, a kitchen and large dining-room; and it was this college whose charter was confirmed by our Constitution of 1818.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The settled meaning of \u201c College \u201d as a building or group of buildings in which scholars are housed, fed, instructed and governed under college discipline, while qualifying for their university degree, whether the university includes a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>of colleges or a single college, is now attacked. <em>We </em>have deemed it proper to trace this meaning with sufficient detail to demonstrate the utter unreason of the attack. This peculiar function of a college is inherent in the best conception of the university. This meaning has been attached to the English word for 800 years; it was the only meaning known at the time our first American colleges were founded, it was recognized and distinctly affirmed in the charter of Yale College, it has since been affirmed by repeated Acts of legislation, and has received the sanction of constitutional confirmation. It was impossible for the legislature to express its meaning more clearly than in the language of \u00a7 8820: \u201cBuildings occupied as colleges.\u201d If it had been said: \u201cDormitories, dining-halls and other buildings occupied as colleges, \u201d the meaning would have been the same, and the amplification would have added nothing to the precise certainty of the language used. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>24 N. J. L. 497; <em>Northampton County </em>v. <em>Lafayette College, </em>128 Pa. St. 132; <em>Ramsey County </em>v. <em>Macalester </em>College, 51 Minn. 437; <em>Griswold College v. Iowa, </em>46 Iowa, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The fact that certain sums are. paid for use of the rooms occupied, does not alter the character of the occupation. A church is none the less a church, because the worshippers contribute to the support of services by way of pew rent. A hospital is none the less a hospital, because the beneficiaries contribute something towards its maintenance. And a college is none the less a college, because its beneficiaries share the cost of maintenance; and it is immaterial whether such contribution .is lumped in one sum, or apportioned to sources of expense, as tuition, room rent, lecture fee, dining-hall, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The defendant further claims that even if some dormitories may be occupied as a college, yet \u00a7 3820 must be construed strictly, because it is. a statute exempting property from taxation, and that so construed, the finding of the committee requires the court to hold that the dormitories assessed are not in fact buildings erected for the use of students, but in substance constitute an investment in the business of furnishing apartments for rich men at highly remunerative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>rates, and that the student, as a student, is in fact and by the very necessity of the case excluded from any oce pation of the buildings; and therefore, upon the principle laid down in <em>Sunday School Union </em>v. Philadelphia, 161 Pa. St. 307, 315, 316, \u201cif such institution sees fit to engage in trade for the purpose of increasing its revenue, or making any part of its business \u2018self-supporting,5 the trade part of its business can be taxed, and ought to be.\u201d <em>Cincinnati College </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Ohio, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Neither contention is correct. The rule that laws exempting property from taxation should be strictly construed, is well-settled and is based on solid reason. But it is often referred to, and several times in our own reports, in cases where it has no application and is not in fact applied. <em>Gillette </em>v. Hartford, 31 Conn. 351, 357; <em>Brainard </em>v. Colchester, ibid. 407, 410; <em>First Unitarian Society </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>66 Conn. 368, 374 ; <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Theological Seminary, </em>ibid. 475, 482. The last two cases mark the distinction in treating a mere charter exemption, and a statute declaring public buildings non-taxable. The rule is limited by the reasons which brought it about. These are two: exceptions to a general rule should be distinctly stated; private privileges are obnoxious to the law and must be clearly expressed. The rule in truth is based on a presumption of intention; the legislature ordinarily intends its laws to apply to all equally; it does not intend to grant privileges to select individuals. So when exceptions ' or special privileges are claimed under a statute, this ordinary or presumptive intention is entitled to weight, according to the circumstances, in ascertaining the actual intention expressed by the language used.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">These reasons do not fully apply to the law under discussion. The non-taxation of public buildings is not the exception but the rule. The corporations, whether municipal or private, which own and are by law charged with the maintenance of such untaxed buildings, are not the recipients of special privileges, in any sense obnoxious to the law. This clause of \u00a7 3820 does not exempt any individuals from the burden of taxation that is common to all; it does not grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to one, particular privileges denied to all others; it declares that lands and buildings sequestered to certain public uses, <em>i. e. </em>taken out of the body of private property and devoted exclusively to the common good, from which no individual can derive any profit, are not taxable property. And this has been, not the exception, but the rule from the foundation of our government. The seats of government, State or municipal, highways, parks, churches, public school-houses, colleges, have never been within the range of taxation; they cannot be exceptions from a rule in which they were never included.Our theory of taxation was laid down in the Code of 1650, and has not been changed, except so far as the <em>corpus </em>rather than the revenue of the estate may have become the basis of assessment. \u201c Every inhabitant shall contribute to all charges both in church and commonwealth whereof he doth or may receive benefit, . . . proportionably to his ability; \u201d his ability to be determined by his occupation and the amount of his ratable or taxable estate. It is the person enjoying the benefits of government who is taxed according to his ability. The mere stuff of land and buildings is not the subject of taxation, except as it may be the source of profit, present or prospective, to some person bound to contribute to the charges of government. And this same Code compelled each town to tax itself for the support of schools, that youths might \u201c be fitted for the University,\u201d and appointed Commonwealth collectors to demand of every family gifts for the maintenance of scholars at Cambridge. 1 Col. Rec. pp. 547, 555. Buildings erected by means of such taxes and gifts were not a source of profit to any person; towns and trustees charged with the maintenance of such buildings were contributors to the public benefit rather than recipients. So these public buildings were not taxed; they were not exempted, because they had not been within the range of taxation; they were simply not mentioned in our tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">It was different with exemptions in the more strict sense. The polls and estates of individuals were from time to time exempted; in 1667 those of commissioners or magistrates in the plantations were so exempted, and a like exemption was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tendered Winthrop to induce him to accept the appointment of Governor. 2 Col. Rec. 59, 64. In 1699 the estates of settled ministers were exempted from paying rates, and in 1708 the polls of students at the Collegiate School were exempted. 4 Col. Rec. 287, 440. And many like exemptions occur. When the legislature in 1702 adopted our statute of charitable uses, it not only secured the perpetuation of gifts for pious uses according to the intent of donors, but also declared that estates so given shall be \u201cfree from payment of rates.\u201d This was an exemption of a very wide range and somewhat uncertain description. The language is perhaps broad enough to cover some public buildings which previously had been and afterwards remained untaxed because of the nature of the property and not by reason of special legislative exception ; but the main purpose of this declaration of exemption related to productive funds, lands or personal estate, given for charitable uses, possibly with special reference to the gifts of Hopkins, Gibbons, and Talcott, which had recently come into use for the support of grammar schools, to anticipated gifts for the support of the \u201c Collegiate School \u201d and to appropriations made for payment of ministers\u2019 salaries. 4 Col. Rec. 31; <em>Atwater v. </em>Woodbridge, 6 Conn. 223, 227. And so we find that subsequent laws of taxation except as exempt from payment of rates, not only prior personal exemptions, but \u201c in like manner all lands in this Colony sequestered to or improved for schools and other pious uses <em>\u201d; 8 </em>Col. Rec. 133 : and that this special exemption in the same words continued until 1821, when the Act of 1702 was changed by the omission of the tax exemption. Since then the only exemption from taxation of funds given for \u201c pious uses,\u201d is to be found in special charters, or in general \u25a0 acts passed from time to time. But public buildings, whether belonging to the State or to some trustee appointed by the State, occupied as colleges, school-houses and churches, were not specially named in the tax laws as exempted, because they were not included in \u201c ratable estate \u201d as taxable property. When the legislature in 1822 saw fit to formally declare that property of the United States, of the State, and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>municipal governments, and \u201c the buildings occupied as colleges,\u201d etc., should be exempt from taxation (Public Acts of 1822, p. 35), it did not alter the. character of the property, or the reason of its not being taxed. The declaration was not an exemption, in the strict sense of the word, as to buildings occupied as colleges and schools, any more than as to property of the United States. They were untaxed, as they had been for nearly two hundred years without any legislative declaration, because they are not \u201c ratable estate \u201d; because they had been placed in that class of property which ought not to be taxed, by virtue of a public policy too clear to be questioned, and which had been followed without any specific legislation by our government from its very beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The reason of such a public policy is apparent. The principle that property necessary for the operation of State and municipal governments, and buildings occupied for those essential supports of government, public education and public worship, ought not to be the subject of taxation, has been with us accepted as axiomatic. It has been incorporated into the constitutions of several States. It has been inseparably interwoven with the structure of our government and the habits and convictions of our people, since 1638. It is not based merely on the theory of the general benefit resulting from an increase of pious uses. All exemptions imply some public benefit; otherwise they are invalid. It is not merely an act of grace on the part of the State. It stands squarely on State interest. To subject all such property to taxation would tend rather to diminish than increase the amount of taxable property. Other conditions being equal, the happiness, prosperity and wealth of a community may well be measured by the amount of property wisely devoted to the common good in public buildings, parks, highways, and buildings occupied as colleges, school-houses and churches. To tax such property would tend to destroy the life which produces a constant increase of taxable property as well as some benefits more valuable. It is a misnomer to call the non-taxation of such property an exemption in favor of the governmental agency in which the legal title is vested. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>sequestered to such public use, tbe whole property by that act\u2014equivalent to a single taxation to the extent of confiscation\u2014passed out of the domain of private property, lost all value as ratable estate, and became incapable of measuring the ability of any person to contribute to the charges of the Commonwealth whereof he receives the benefit. These are, in brief, the positions which the history of Connecticut shows to have been the foundation of our revenue laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">This clause of \u00a7 3820 is not strictly so much an exemption from taxation, as the declaration of a public policy well-settled and long established; it must therefore be construed reasonably so as to give full effect to the policy declared, as well as to avoid abuse and frustrate evasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The argument urged by the defendant in support of its claim that the dormitories assessed are practically used for the purposes of trade, is substantially this: The College is intended primarily for scholars who are poor, and the great majority of foundations express this purpose more or less clearly; no one shall be prevented by limitations of birth or means from the full development of his capacities for the service' of the State; an essential feature of the College is equality ; no special privileges nor honors can be secured except through personal worth. When, therefore, in the apportionment of rooms the students are practically divided on the right hand and left according to the marks of wealth, and, as the finding shows, the poor student is relegated to the unsightly discomfort represented by seventy-five cents a week and the rich student promoted to the comparative luxury represented by ten dollars a week, a rule of apportionment is adopted which violates the essential conditions of college life, and the buildings or portions of buildings appropriated to the rich students cease to be college buildings, because the average student is excluded from their occupation. There would be force in this argument, so far as it is supported by facts, if addressed to the college authorities. We do not care to minimize,its force for that purpose; it goes without saying that the most costly gifts cannot compensate for any loss of that spirit of independent equality winch is the life of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>University, and which has heretofore especially characterized this plaintiff. But the argument does not touch the essential contention that the dormitories are used for trade and not as college buildings. The committee finds that these buildings \u201c are occupied by students of the College as study and living rooms, under the supervision and management of college officers resident therein for that purpose; \u201d and that they \u201c are unfitted for any other use or purpose.\u201d And such'is admittedly the fact. This is conclusive. The criticism of the defendant goes deeper, and claims that the rules for ordering the occupation of college buildings tend to the perversion of the purpose of the College. But the power to make these rules is vested in the trustees by the charter; wise or unwise, they are an exercise of charter power. As to their effect thus far, the committee finds that the corporation administers a college within the true intent and meaning of its charter, \u201cwherein all such persons of good moral character as desire to avail themselves of its advantages, irrespective of nationality, domicil, color, creed, or religious belief, are, at a moderate cost, to the number of about 2,500 annually, instructed in the arts and sciences.\u201d There are no special facts found necessarily inconsistent with this conclusion. We are not now, therefore, called upon to decide whether a complete perversion of college purpose involves a forfeiture of college rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">All the dormitories occupied by students, the building used as a dining-hall, the observatory buildings, the two houses furnished by the College for the officers of the observatory, the adjoining land found to be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the observatory, and No. 121 Elm street, used as a college yard in connection with the college buildings, are non-taxable property under \u00a7 3820.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Some suggestion was made in argument, that this section might include buildings occupied but not owned by the College ; we do not admit this interpretation, but express no opinion, as the question is not involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\"><em>Second. </em>The Act of 1834 amending the charter of Yale College is as follows: \u201c That the funds which have been, or may hereafter be, granted, provided by the State of Connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ticut, or given by any person or persons, to the corporation of the President and Fellows of Yale College in New Haven, and by th\u00e9m invested and held for the use of that institution, shall, with the interest thereof, be and remain exempt from taxation. Provided, however, that the said corporation shall never hold in this State, real estate free from taxation affording an annual income of more than six thousand dollars ; and provided also, that the private property of the officers of the institution, shall not be exempt from taxation ; and that the said corporation shall, on or before the first day of September, A. D. 1884, give its assent to this Act, and transmit the evidence thereof to the Secretary of the State, to be by him recorded.\u201d 1 Private Laws, p. 481. The same language in. respect to taxation is repeated in \u00a7 3822, which was passed in 1882 (Public Acts, Chap. 98) to exclude the charters of the colleges which were claimed to be in the nature of contracts, from the operation of Acts affecting taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Some of the considerations suggested in discussing the clause of \u00a7 3820, apply to the construction of this charter. In granting such a charter the State constitutes the corporar tion its agent, for a purely public purpose, and intrusts it with authority, which can only be derived from the State, to confer degrees in scholarship and learning upon those found worthy. The legislative intent is indicated in the charter of Wesleyan College, which provides that the Act \u201c shall be liberally construed, for every beneficial purpose hereby intended.\u201d 1 Private Laws, 472. The State has been very careful to treat its colleges precisely alike in the matter of taxation, and it is hardly possible that one rule of construction was intended for Wesleyan, and another for Yale and Trinity. But it is unnecessary, in treating the question now before us, to invoke any special rule of construction. The charter, in the broadest terms, exempts all the property of the College from taxation. This possibly may cover the buildings occupied as colleges which are non-taxable by virtue of our settled public policy, as declared in \u00a7 3820 ; but its main purpose was to exempt all estate and funds invested and held lawfully, <em>i. e., </em>\u201c for the use of the College,\u201d including both principal and income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The only limitation on this absolute exemption is contained in the <em>proviso: </em>\u201c Provided, however, that said corporation shall never hold in this State, real estate free from taxation, affording an annual income of more than six thousand dollars.\u201d The contention of the defendant is that whenever the income from real estate exceeds the sum of 16,000, not only the real estate producing such excess of income, but also all the unproductive real estate the College may hold, becomes at once liable to taxation. We'think this requires us to interpolate into the charter a limitation it does not contain. By the original charter, \u201c all the lands and ratable estate, belonging to the said .College, not exceeding the yearly value of five hundred pounds sterling,\u201d as well as the estates of the president and professors, were freed from rates, etc. It is not easy to determine the precise meaning of this language, without a detailed examination of the conditions of 1745 in reference to which it was used. This is unnecessary. It is certain that by this provision it was intended to exempt all the property the College was likely to own for an indefinite period, and that the provision served that purpose for nigh a hundred years. The precise restriction the legislature of 1745 had in mind is now immaterial. It was abandoned in 1834; a new provision in respect to taxation, different in form and substance, was then adopted in reference to a new future.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">This new provision was intended to be broader than the old, as shown not only by the language used, by the wider field of public usefulness opening to the College, but also by the controlling fact that in view of the full exemption of the College property, <em>i. e. </em>the funds devoted to public use, the College surrendered the existing exemption of the private estates of its president and professors. The Act of 1884 plainly exempts all the property of the College from taxation; and the <em>proviso </em>qualifies this exemption only for the purpose of imposing a limited restraint on the mode of investment. It is not an absolute limitation to the holding of real estate, but it is a provision which makes it the interest of the College to itself limit its holding. It is not presumed that the College- will, to any considerable extent, invest its funds in un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>productive property, so there is no direct limit to its holding of such land; but the College might well be tempted to put all its funds into productive real estate, and the <em>proviso </em>directly restrains this tendency by limiting its right to hold real estate producing more than $6,000 a year, unless it pays taxes on the excess. If the College finds in any year that its revenues from land exceed $6,000, It must choose between its unlimited exemption from taxation and its unlimited right to hold real estate; if it chooses the former it must sell so much of its productive land as will reduce its income within the limit, if it chooses the latter, it must pay taxes on the land instead of selling it. In this way the State sought to exempt all the funds of the College from taxation, and through the potent operation of self-interest to keep the investment of those funds in real estate within reasonable bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Counsel for the plaintiff urged with great force, in further support of this view, the fact that here the enacting clause is a total exemption, and a <em>proviso </em>can withdraw from the enacting clause nothing that is not fairly within its terms. In speaking of this rule Justice Story said s \u201c We are led to the general rule of law which has always prevailed, and become consecrated almost as a maxim in the interpretation of statutes, that when the enacting clause is general in its language and objects, and a proviso is afterwards introduced, that proviso is construed strictly, and takes no case out of the enacting clause which does not fall fairly within its terms. In short, a proviso carves special exceptions only out of the enacting clause; and those who set up any such exception, must establish it as being within the words as well as within the reason thereof. \u201d <em>United States </em>v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">For reasons before given, we think that students\u2019 fees, whether apportioned to room rent or tuition, cannot be treated as income of real estate, and that land occupied and reasonably necessary for the plant of the College is not productive real estate within the meaning of the <em>proviso </em>in the Act of 1834. The vacant lots added by the assessors are exempt from taxation. The dwelling-houses and factories added by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the assessors are also exempt, unless some one or more of these must he added to the list returned by the plaintiff in order to reduce its net income from all its other real estate within its prescribed limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Certain questions as to a few items of properly were submitted without argument; the nature of these questions is not quite clear. It appears that a lot on Cannon street was sold to one Robert Brown, a professor in the University, by parol, and the money needed to build a dwelling-house advanced to him; that he has built and occupied the house and has repaid a portion of the loan, but has j&gt;aid nothing on the purchase price. This presents a case of property substantially owned and enjoyed by a private, person, while the title remains in the College; the lot and house should be added to the plaintiff\u2019s list. Its charter does not exempt from taxation property held for private use. It appears, also, that a number of lots have been leased to private parties on long leases, the tenants agreeing to pay the taxes. So far as the town is concerned, such agreements by the tenants are inoperative. If the revenue from these leases is in excess of the $6,000 derived from the other real estate, the lots should be added to the plaintiff\u2019s list. It will be necessary for the Superior Court to proceed to a further hearing for the purpose of ascertaining these facts, unless the parties shall agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The record does not show any impropriety on the part of the plaintiff in dealing with its exemption, unless possibly in the case of the Brown house; but in order to exclude any false implication, we deem it proper to add that the charter does not authorize the College to hold any property exempt from taxation for any private use, and does not authorize any commercial dealings with its exemptions, whether by way of mere speculation in vacant land, of selling land on long leases at nominal rents, or otherwise. This statute was intended to serve a great public use in pursuance of a most beneficial public policy, and the construction to be given such a statute requires that the intent shall not be defeated either by clear evasion or undue restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The Superior Court is advised to render judgment ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the hoard of relief to strike from the plaintiff\u2019s tax list all the items added by the assessors, except the \u201c Brown house,\u201d and except such items, if any, of productive real estate as it may find to be necessary to retain in order to bring the net income from all other real estate within the sum of $6,000; and to take further proceedings for the purpose of ascertaining this fact, unless it shaR be settled by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
