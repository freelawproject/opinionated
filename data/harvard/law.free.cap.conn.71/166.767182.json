The new partnership earned on their business until the 28th of January, 1895, when they sold out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to the defendant. This transaction was witnessed by a written agreement as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents that we, George H.

Cady of said Riverton, do hereby sell, bargain, transfer and convey unto the said Frederic E. Cady all of the goods, wares and merchandise, store fixtures and furniture belonging to us, said Whitney &amp; Hines, and contained in the store in said Riverton now occupied by us; also all book accounts, choses in action and accounts and bills receivable due to us on account of said store business, also our goodwill; to have and to hold the same to him the said vendee, his executor, administrator and assigns forever, to him and their own proper use and behoof. And we the said vendors, do for ourselves, our heirs, executors and administrators, covenant and agree with said vendee to warrant and defend said property to him, the said vendee, against all persons whatever, together with full power and authority to collect said book accounts, choses in action, bills and accounts receivable, and to receipt therefor. As an additional consideration for the above conveyance the said- vendee has agreed and does hereby agree to assume and to pay and does hereby assume and agree to pay all of said Whitney and Hines\u2019 liabilities and bills, debts and claims owing from them, said Whitney &amp; Hines, to all persons, parties and copartnerships whatsoever, and to save them harmless therefor. The said George H. Whitney has agreed and does hereby agree not to engage in the mercantile business, such as said Whitney &amp; Hines have been conducting and hereby sell to said Cady, in said Riverton, for the period and term of five years from the date hereof; nor is he, said Whitney, for and during said period, to invest his money in said business and conduct or have the same conducted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>any other person, for him or for his benefit, and in opposition or competition to said Gady. In witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands at Winchester, Conn., this 28th day of January, A. D. 1895, and agree that this instrument shall remain in the possession of Samuel A.

The defendant, in pursuance of the agreement, proceeded to collect the bills receivable, to sell the goods, and to pay the partnership debts and liabilities of the plaintiffs, until March, 1895, when, as the defendant claimed, the plaintiff Whitney engaged in business in opposition'to the defendant, in violation of the agreement: and the defendant then refused to pay the liabilities of the plaintiffs remaining unpaid. On May 18th, 1895, the plaintiffs brought this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-12\">The complaint alleges an agreement as follows: \u201c On or about the 28th of January, 1895, the plaintiffs sold and delivered to the defendant aR of the goods, wares, merchandise, store fixtures and furniture then belonging to the plaintiffs and contained in the store in the village of Riverton then occupied by said plaintiffs; also all book accounts, choses in action, and accounts and bills receivable then due to the plaintiffs on account of said store business ; and in part consideration therefor the defendant then and there agreed to pay all said plaintiffs\u2019 liabilities, bills, debts and claims owing from them to the persons, parties and copartnerships whatsoever, and to save them harmless therefrom.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-13\">The complaint then alleges that the defendant has refused to pay certain of the liabilities he promised to pay; that bills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>amounting to $1,800 remain unpaid; and that civil actions have been brought against the plaintiffs for the recovery of these unpaid bills. The prayer for relief claims damages, and a specific performance of the defendant\u2019s agreement to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 liabilities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">To this complaint the defendant demurred, mainly on the ground that the defendant\u2019s contract was one of indemnity, and the plaintiffs had not as yet suffered damage by its breach. The court ('Elmer, &lt;/.) overruled the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-7\">The defendant then answered, admitting certain paragraphs of the complaint, denying others, and alleging that the agreement relied on by the plaintiffs was in writing, and setting out the written agreement. The answer states a second defense as follows: \u201c1. The first defense is made a part of this defense. 2. On the day of March, 1895, or thereabouts, and while the defendant was in the faithful performance of his agreement, the plaintiff Whitney engaged in the mercantile business in said Riverton, which business was of the same kind as that bought by the defendant from the plaintiffs, and invested money therein, and had the same conducted by another or others for himself and for his benefit, and in opposition and competition to the defendant, and continued to be engaged or interested in said business for some months, or until July, 1895, all in violation of his agreement thereinbefore referred to, and to the great damage and prejudice of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-8\">The plaintiffs moved to strike out paragraph two of the second defense, as impertinent; and this motion the court <em>(Ralph </em>Wheeler, V.) granted. Afterwards the parties went to trial on the other issues raised by the answer. The court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs to recover $1,456.61 damages, made a finding of facts, and the defendant appealed, assigning as errors that the court erred in overruling the demurrer, and in granting the motion to expunge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-9\"><em>William 0. Case, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-10\">This act of Whitney was the defense of the defendant, and his sole defense. He entered into the agreement on Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>uary 28th, 1895, in consideration of the express stipulation therein contained, that Whitney should not re-engage in business in Riverton, and the agreement of which this was a constituent part was signed by Whitney &amp; Hines, and as signed by them submitted to the defendant, who assented to and accepted all the stipulations therein contained. This was a partnership agreement binding both Whitney <em>&amp; </em>Hines, and was a proper and sufficient defense. <em>Boutelle </em>v. Smith, 116 Mass. 114; <em>Palmer </em>v. Mallet, cited in 2 Lind, on Part. p. 487.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-6\"><em>Samuel A. Herman, </em>for the appellees (plaintiffs).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-7\">The defendant\u2019s promise was not exclusively one of indemnity, but also a promise to pay. <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Folger, </em>34 Iowa, 71; <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>131 Mass. 99; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>1 Conn. 244; <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>21 id. 117; <em>Redfield </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>27 id. 31; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Atwater, </em>42 id. 253. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expunge was correctly decided by the court, as the agreement in restraint of trade is the individual agreement of George H. Whitney, and not that of the copartnership. An individual liability of a partner cannot be set off or recouped against a copartnership claim. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1016 ; <em>Pitkin </em>v. <em>Pitkin, </em>8 Conn. 325; <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>7 id. 221; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Green, </em>6 id. 14; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>19 id. 394; <em>Synder </em>v. <em>Spurr, </em>33 id. 407. An analysis of the instrument will demonstrate that it was George H. Whitney, individually, and not Whitney &amp; Hines, that was to refrain from trade as therein provided.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-8\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoJ\">The demurrer was properly overruled. The contract set up in the complaint is not merely a promise to idemnify; it is also an express promise to pay. In such case a refusal to pay is a breach of the contract. <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>21 Conn. *117, *123.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The court erred in expunging paragraph two of the second defense. (The paragraph, however, is improperly pleaded as a second defense; it should have been added to the previous allegations of the answer.) The guaranty against competition from the plaintiff Whitney, was a material part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the consideration for the defendant\u2019s promises to the firm. The agreement is made by \"Whitney &amp; Hines as partners; they agree to sell their stock in trade, assets and goodwill, to the defendant, for a cash payment and \u201c the performance of stipulation and agreements hereinafter contained; \u201d they then say, <em>\u201c </em>as an additional consideration for the above conveyance, the said vendee has agreed \u201d to pay the firm liabilities, and the said Whitney has agreed not to engage in the mercantile business such as Whitney &amp; Hines have been conducting \u201c and hereby sell to said Cady.\u201d This document they sign with their firm name. The defendant\u2019s assent is as follows: \u201c I hereby accept the above instrument and con sent and assent and agree to all of the stipulations contained therein.\u201d Certainly this is, at least, equivalent to a sale by Whitney &amp; Hines and a purchase by Cady, upon the part consideration that the business such as that sold shall not for a certain period be carried on by one of the partners in opposition to Cady. If the agreement had promised that neither partner should interfere, the consideration would be enlarged, but it would not be any more truly a consideration for the firm contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendant alleges the failure of this consideration. A partial failure of consideration may be material in estimating damages in an action on the contract. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ellsworth, </em>3 <em>Conn. </em>483, 488; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Mix, </em>11 id. 432, <em>438; Andrews </em>v. <em>Wheaton, </em>23 id. 112, 118. Even if Hines may not be liable for all damages accruing to Cady from Whitney\u2019s conduct, he cannot, jointly with Whitney, claim a specific performance of the agreement, if Whitney\u2019s conduct in violation of the agreement has made its performance as a whole impossible, and its partial performance inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">We think the allegation expunged was material to a proper defense. If there were a doubt as to this, the doubt would surely be a substantial one upon which the defendant would be entitled to be heard in full on demurrer; it is not one of those questions that may be summarily disposed of on a motion to expunge. Such motion is outside the regular pleadings in a cause. It was not intended and is not adapted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>test the substantial rights of parties; its main use is to enable the court to purge the record of impertinence and surplusage. Practice Act, p. 4, \u00a7 10. Granting the motion may be discretionary. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Shares, </em>63 Conn. 39, 42. To reject, on such a motion, substantial claims of a party, may practically be depriving him of his day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">There is error, the judgment of the Superior Court is set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
