The plaintiff is and for a number of years has been a real estate agent doing business in the city of New Haven. 2. In December, 1897, John <em>W. </em>Bacon and James Osborne, the president and vice-president, respectively, of the Savings Bank of Danbury, the defendant in this action, called at the office of the plaintiff in New Haven, and placed the property then owned by said bank and known as the Elliott House, situated on the corner of Chapel and Olive streets, in said city of New Haven, in the plaintiff\u2019s hands for sale. 3. Both said Bacon and said Osborne were in the practice of visiting New Haven each week from the time they placed said property in the hands of plaintiff for sale until early in the following February, when the property was sold to Mr. George H. Bishop, and on each of said visits called at the plaintiff\u2019s office to inquire as to the prospects of sale. 4. At the first or second visit of the said Bacon and Osborne to the plaintiff\u2019s office, in December, 1897, Mr. Bacon produced and read to the plaintiff a letter dated some eighteen months prior to that time, which letter contained an offer of some $38,000 for said property, made in behalf of one George H. Bishop, the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>who became the purchaser of the property in the following February. 5. At the time of reading said letter said Bacon or Osborne said to the plaintiff that said Bishop might be a possible purchaser, and requested the plaintiff to see him and use his influence to induce him to buy the property. 6. The plaintiff then agreed to see Mr. Bishop in reference to the property, and did call at his office twice during December, but failed to find him. 7. About the first of January, 1898. the plaintiff, on going again to Mr. Bishop\u2019s office to see him in reference to this property, met him on Chapel street, and talked with him regarding the property, stating that the bank was particularly anxious to sell and avoid the expense of alterations in the property which it would be compelled to make if it was not disposed of, and that he, Bishop, could purchase the property at a very low price, and for a number of thousand dollars less than he had previously offered for the same property, and that the property was as good then as it ever was. 8. A few days later said Bishop called twice at the office of the plaintiff to obtain the keys of the Elliott House to examine the property, and not finding the plaintiff at Iris office left word with his bookkeeper as to the object of the visit. 9. The plaintiff on being informed of Mr. Bishop\u2019s calls telephoned him that by going to the Elliott House barber shop and using his, the plaintiff\u2019s, name, he could secure entrance to the property. 10. Said Bishop about the middle of January after receiving this information from the plaintiff' did call at the Elliott House as directed, and examined the property. 11. On another and subsequent occasion in January, 1898, the plaintiff met Mr. Bishop while the latter was in his carriage on Chapel or State street, and had a further talk with him regarding the purchase by him of the Elliott House property. 12. At the time of the sale of the property to Mr. Bishop, and at the request of the bank officials, the said Bishop executed and delivered to the bank a bond,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> agreeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to hold the hank harmless from any commission to the plaintiff. 13. The property was sold to Mr. Bishop for the sum of $25,000, he to pay whatever commissions there might be due for the sale of the property as a part consideration thereof. 14. On the 5th, 12th, and 17th of January, 1898, said John W. Bacon saw Mr. Bishop in New Haven, and talked with him regarding some changes the bank contemplated making in said property in case the same was not sold, and also spoke to him regarding his purchase of the property. 15. Mr. Bacon, though visiting at the plaintiff\u2019s office each week in reference to the sale of this property during said month of January, did not inform the plaintiff that he was having any negotiations with Mr. Bishop, nor did the plaintiff have any notice whatever that any one connected with the bank was negotiating with Mr. Bishop until after the sale of the property to the latter. 16. The Elliott House was a well known piece of property, and Mr. Bishop was familiar with it, having made an offer some sixteen months previous to December, 1897, but until the interview with the plaintiff about the 1st of January, 1898, he had made no move regarding this property since his previous offer, and had abandoned his negotiations for the purchase of the same for the period of a year and a half, or more. 17. Two per cent is the ordinary eotab-' lished and usual commission, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, for the sale of real estate. 18. No agreement for any special rate of commission was made between the parties to this suit. 19. The plaintiff was the procuring cause of the sale of said property to said George H. Bishop at the price of $25,000, and the commission due him for the same is $500. 20. The plaintiff in his opening testimony offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>a letter written on the 5th day of Febr nary by himself to John W. Bacon, then an officer and president of the defendant bank. The letter was written after the plaintiff had learned from Bishop that he, Bishop, had made an offer for the property. The defendant objected to so much of the letter as follows: \u2018 Which offer comes from Mr. Bishop on account of my bringing to his notice the property of the Elliott House being for sale.\u2019 21. The entire letter is as follows: \u2018 John W. Bacon, Treasurer, Danbury, Conn. Dear Sir. About two weeks ago I called Mr. George H. Bishop\u2019s, of Peck &amp; Bishop Company, attention to the Elliott House property as a very desirable piece of property to own. At that time he seemingly did not take much interest in the matter; told m\u00e9 he would think it over. He called at my office a few days ago and requested the keys, and I gave him the instructions left by you some little time ago, as I have previously written you, to go to the barber shop in the Elliott House building and use my name, where he could get the keys handed him by request to inspect the property. He has examined the building, etc., and this A. M. informs me that he has submitted to the bank an offer in writing, which offer comes from Mr. Bishop on account of my bringing to his notice the property of the Elliott House being for sale. Yours truly, L. G. Hoadley.\u2019 The objection of the defendant to the letter was stated as follows: \u2018 <em>Mr. Stoddard. </em>It seems to me, if your Honor pleases, that while some parts of this, the first part, possibly, might be admissible for some purposes, that this part which reads as follows: \u2018 Which offer comes from Mr. Bishop on account of my bringing to his notice the property of the Elliott House being for sale,\u2019 was no proper matter tending to prove the fact, and I object to that part of the letter as tending to .prove the fact that the sale was brought about by Mr. Hoadley, because it is a declaration in his own interest, and after the sale was made.\u2019 The ruling of the court upon the admission of the letter was as follows: \u2018 <em>The Court. </em>I don\u2019t think, gentlemen, that that statement is binding upon the bank, but I think the letter to the bank is admissible. I don\u2019t think the fact that this man said that this sale was brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>about by his efforts is binding or conclusive; but the fact that he made such a statement to the defendant in this case I think is admissible, and I should allow it to come in for the purpose of proving the fact that he said so.\u2019 22. The plaintiff in opening his case offered the deposition of James Osborne, of the Danbury Savings Bank, and in connection therewith counsel for the plaintiff and defendant made the following statements: <em>\u2018Mr. Wright. </em>There is a deposition here of Mr. James Osborne, of the Danbury Savings Bank. There is only a portion of this deposition that is pertinent to our case in chief, and I will only read so much of it as I claim now, and leave the balance for rebuttal. The deposition is as follows: [reading deposition]. That is as far as I care to read now. <em>Mr. Stoddard. </em>That is down to and including the answer 12 on page 4 of my copy ? <em>Mr. Wright. </em>Yes. <em>Mr. Stoddard,. </em>Well, very well. <em>Mr. Wright. </em>Let me examine it a little further; it may be possible there is only a question or two. If you have no objection we might read the whole deposition now. <em>.Mr. Stoddard. </em>You must take your own course. <em>Mr. Wright. </em>Well, I will stop there.\u2019 23. After the defendant had rested, and in the evidence in reply, the plaintiff offered to read the remainder of said deposition, and among other questions and answers the following from his direct examination in said deposition. \u2018 Q. 15. Were you present at a meeting of the directors of the Savings Bank of Danbury when Mr. Bishop\u2019s offer for the Elliott House was received and acted upon ? \u2019 The defendant objected to the question as immaterial, irrelevant, and not within the issues, and because it should have been offered in the opening if at all. The court overruled the objection, and the defendant duly excepted, and the witness answered, <em>\u2018 </em>I was.\u2019 24. Thereupon plaintiff offered Q. 16 of said deposition as follows: \u2018Q. 16. Where was such meeting so held, and who was present thereat ? \u2019 The defendant objected to this question as immaterial, irrelevant, and not within the issues of the case, and that it ought to have been introduced if at all in the opening. The court overruled the objection, admitted the question, and the defendant duly excepted. The witness an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>swered: * The meeting was held in the directors\u2019 room in the Savings Bank of Danbury; Judge Brewster was there, Henry M. Robinson was there, Mr. Woodman of Bethel, and Dwight H. Rogers, Mr. Henry C. Ryder, the treasurer, and myself. I don\u2019t recollect whether Mr. Hartwell was there; they\u2019ll back up my testimony to-day.\u2019 This evidence was claimed to show what the transaction between the bank and Mr. Bishop was; what the property was sold for; what was said regarding the commission, and what arrangements were made regarding the commission on this transaction. Counsel for the plaintiff in offering this evidence stated that be was not sure whether it was evidence which should have been introduced in the opening, or rebuttal, and therefore he asked the court in the exercise of its discretion to admit the testimony. The testimony admitted after the court had notified the defendant that it would be given an opportunity to reply to this testimony if it desired so to do. 25. The defendant claimed upon the trial under the above and foregoing evidence that the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of the sale to Bishop of the property in question, and that upon the above and foregoing facts he was not entitled to recover his commission as a broker upon the sale of said property to said Bishop. The defendant also claimed under the arrangements between the officers of the bank and the plaintiff, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any commission, in view of the fact that the property was sold for no more than $25,000; and the defendant desires to review the above questions of law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">The substance of the correspondence claimed as showing the legal effect of the bond of Mr. Bishop, was as follows: February 2d, 1898, Bacon writes to Hoadley: \u201cYou spoke once of submitting in writing a low offer for the place, the buyer to pay all commissions and taxes.

For that purpose it was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The admission, of the latter part of Osborne\u2019s deposition, upon rebuttal, was within the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The other claims of the defendant are included under four heads: 1. The alleged insufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment rendered. <em>2. </em>The alleged insufficiency of the testimony given to support the facts found. 3. The alleged omission from the finding of facts material to present the questions of law decided by the court. 4. The alleged finding of material facts without any evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\"><em>First. </em>Where an owner places land with a real estate broker for sale, he agrees, in the absence of any special contract, to pay the customary commission or brokerage in case a sale is consummated with a purchaser who was led to begin the negotiation through the intervention of the broker. It is immaterial that the purchaser at some prior time had been engaged in a bootless negotiation with the owner in respect to the same property, or that the owner, after the broker has interested the purchaser, secretly pursues the negotiation and himself completes the sale, or that the owner of his own accord effects a sale at a less price than that he gave the broker. If any act of the broker in pursuance of his authority to find a purchaser is the initiatory step that leads to the sale consummated, the owner must pay the commission. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Mc</em>Clatchie, 36 Conn. <em>136, 141; Schlegal </em>v. <em>Allerton, </em>65 id. 260, 264. Applying this well settled law to the facts found, judgment for the plaintiff must follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Whether or not a particular person is the \u201c procuring cause \u201d of a sale, is a question of fact for the jury; but the defendant claims that upon a trial to the court the conclusion of the judge is erroneous if he violates any rule or principle of law in drawing that conclusion from the subordinate facts found, and that if Iris conclusion from the subordinate facts is in plain conflict with the settled rules of logic and sound reasoning, he does violate a principle of law and his conclusion is reviewable by this court as an error in law. This claim is correct. <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>New </em>York, <em>N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>70 Conn. 159, 173, 183. Testing the judgment in view of this claim, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>below finds that the plaintiff interviewed Bishop (the purchaser), called his attention to the property, and urged upon him considerations that should induce him to renew his negotiation for its purchase; that in pursuance of this Bishop applied to the plaintiff for permission to examine the property, obtained entrance to the building through information given him by the plaintiff, and examined the property; and that shortly after Ms mind had been so directed by the plaintiff to a purchase, the defendant, through its president, Bacon, without the knowledge of the plaintiff, took up the negotiation with Bishop which resulted in a sale. There are no other facts which essentially affect the force of these upon the question of \u201c procuring cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We cannot say that the inference drawn by the court from these facts is unreasonable. The procuring cause of sale is such intervention of the broker for that purpose as constitutes the foundation on which the negotiation is begun. The court might reasonably infer that the efforts of the plaintiff to induce Bishop to renew his attempt to purchase were the origin of the negotiation and resulting sale. If so, the plaintiff was the procuring cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\"><em>Second. </em>The facts adjudicated by the trial court cannot be retried here upon the certified testimony. This is too firmly settled by repeated decisions to admit of discussion. A record should not be cumbered with such futile assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\"><em>Third. </em>The defendant claims that the fact that the sale was made by the defendant through its president to Bishop, and the fact that the exclusive sale of the property was not given to the plaintiff, were improperly omitted from the finding of the court. The facts seem to be substantially included in the finding; but however that may be, an inspection .of the evidence certified shows that they were admitted or undisputed facts; and we have treated them as included in the finding. The omission of such facts is not an error that affects the judgment, unless by correcting the record and includmg them in the finding, it appears that the court erred in its ruling on some question of law material to the judgment. The correct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ness of the rulings of the court below is not affected by including these facts in the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"AH8h\">The defendant further claims that the fact that the defendant, through its president, told the plaintiff, before the property was sold, that if the defendant was compelled to sell the property for $25,000, no broker\u2019s commissions would be paid by the defendant, is improperly omitted from the finding. This fact might be material to present a question of law raised by the defendant on the trial, and if it were an admitted or undisputed fact its omission would be an error which, if material, we should correct. An inspection of the evidence certified does not sustain the defendant\u2019s claim. If we were to treat this fact as included in the finding, the defendant\u2019s claim of law could not be sustained. \u2022 After a broker has rendered the services which make him the procuring cause of a sale, the owner cannot escape liability by telling the broker that he will pay no commission if he decides to sell at a certain sum. The alleged remark of Mr. Bacon, to have any force, must have been made prior to the rendition of the plaintiff\u2019s services. This does not appear. The law is clear that a broker does not forfeit his commission because the owner avails himself of the services rendered to sell at a price less than that limited <em>(Schlegal </em>v. <em>Allerton, </em>supra) ; and the owner\u2019s position is not improved, if he seeks to fortify his evasion of liability by telling the broker, after the rendition of the services, that he will pay no commission if he (the owner) sells at such price.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The other exceptions to the finding do not call for special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\"><em>Fourth. </em>The claim that the court has found material facts without any evidence to support such finding, is baseless. On the contrary, it is apparent from the record\u2014and the more apparent the closer the record is studied\u2014that any judge hearing this evidence, weighing the conflicting testimony and passing on the credit of the witnesses as they appeared upon the stand, might reasonably reach the conclusion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In <em>Thresher </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>69 Conn. 404, 408, we stated the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>effect of recent legislation (since consolidated in the Act of 1897, Public Acts of 1897, pp. 888, 895;, relative to procedure on appeals to this court. The peculiar construction of this appeal suggests the advisability of a more particular statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">A finding by the trial judge is unnecessary when the record of the court, including the judgment file, discloses the alleged errors; that is, it is unnecessary when the appeal is used as a substitute for the former motion in error; but the ultimate and subordinate facts on which the judgment is founded must, on request of counsel, be stated in the judgment. When the appeal is used as a substitute for the former motion for a new trial, or for such motion as well as for a motion in error, a finding by the trial judge is necessary, and may serve a triple purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">First, it may contain a statement of the facts on which the judgment is founded. Strictly these facts should appear in the judgment, as when the appeal serves the purpose only of a motion in error; but the practice is, authorized inferentially by the statute, to include these facts in the finding, when one is necessary. No error can be assigned in respect to weigfiing the evidence from which these conclusions are drawn. They are adjudicated facts which this court cannot retry. Where the ultimate facts are mere conclusions from subordinate facts found from the evidence, a party is entitled to have the subordinate facts stated, for such conclusions may be reviewable. But these subordinate facts must be facts found from the evidence, and not a mere recital of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Second, the finding may contain a statement of facts found which are necessary to present a question of law, and the question of law must be one made at the trial and decided by the judge. Such facts, whether affirmative or negative, are adjudicated facts which this court cannot retry; but they may not be included in the statement of facts on which the judgment is founded, because the question of law which made them material has been decided adversely by the judge. It is for the purpose of securing the statement in the finding of such facts, that the process provided in sections nine and ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>of the Act of 1897 is chiefly efficacious. If such facts are omitted, the appellant may file exceptions to the finding and have the evidence relevant to the question certified, for the purpose of making it appear by the record that it was an admitted or undisputed fact. Or, if this course is not followed, the appellant may, under sections eleven and twelve of the Act, apply to this court to rectify the appeal. But in either case, it must appear that the omitted fact was an admitted or undisputed fact, and that its statement in the finding is necessary to properly present a question of law decided adversely to the appellant. If it so appear, then the finding will be corrected by treating it as containing the fact, and the question of law will be considered in view of the corrected finding. This process is well adapted to prevent the omission from the finding, of material facts found by the trial*court, but it is an abuse to use the process for the mere purpose of asking the statement of a fact in the language of the counsel rather than of the judge, or of loading the record with insignificant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Third, the finding may contain a recital of what actually took place at the trial, for the purpose of presenting for review rulings of the trial court upon questions of evidence or other rulings not directly affecting the judgment. Such recital is made from the notes of the judge, which were formerly the only authentic source from which such facts could be made to appear, but now the notes of the official stenographer furnish another authentic source. And, if necessary, under the provisions of sections eleven and twelve of the Act, such notes may be made to appear in the finding, so that this court, may review the rulings complained of, in connection with the state of facts existing at the trial as shown by the recital of the judge read in the light of the certified evidence. The addition of long extracts from the stenographer\u2019s notes, is, however, rarely necessary; a brief statement by the judge is clearer and usually sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The process authorized by the statute is intended, primarily, to facilitate the fullest possible exercise of jurisdiction by this court in correcting errors in law, and we have given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the statute a very broad construction to give effect to this purpose. If an appeal is properly prepared by the appellant, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a trial court to so frame a finding that this court cannot get at the substantial errors in law involved. So far, however, as the language of the statute may imply a determination by this court upon the evidence certified, of facts lawfully adjudicated by the trial court, it was decided in <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Morning News Co., </em>67 Conn. 504, and in subsequent cases, that we are prevented from giving it effect by the paramount authority of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">There is no error in the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
