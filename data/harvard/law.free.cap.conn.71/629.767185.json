Gilldea and Charles Hazard, carrying on.business at Elmira, New York. The Gould Roofing Company purchased the business of the Elmira Company and the notes in suit, made by the Gould Company to the order of the defendant and by him indorsed, were given in part payment of the purchase price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-11\">The defendant offered evidence to prove and claimed to have proved, that on the 23d of October, 1894, when the sale to the Gould Company was being consummated, the said Gilldea and Hazard represented to the defendant that the business of the Elmira Company was very valuable; that one Theron A. Gould was and had been associated with them to all intents and purposes as a partner, and that there was due to him from the Elmira Company about $7,000, which, with the consent of the said Theron A. Gould, who was about to become identified with the Gould Company, they would indorse upon the notes delivered to the Elmira Company; that the defendant was influenced and induced by said representar tions to indorse and deliver said notes; that said representations were false and fraudulent, that the business of the Elmira Company was worthless, that there was nothing due to said Theron A. Gould, and that the said Gilldea and Hazard never intended to make any indorsement of payment whatever on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>account of such indebtedness upon said notes or any of them. Further facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b641-6\"><em>Goodwin Stoddard </em>and <em>William B.

The court, against the defendant\u2019s objection, permitted Mr. Bacon, a professional bookkeeper who had charge of the plaintiffs\u2019 books at the time the notes in question were given, and who had examined them for the purpose of ascertaining the facts to which he testified\u2014the books themselves having apparently been present in court\u2014to state what balance was due Tlieron A. Gould upon the books at the time said note was indorsed; and to testify what at that time the interest of Tlieron A. Gould was, assuming he had one third of the profits and that the outstanding accounts upon the books on that date had been collected and the merchandise sold had been paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The evidence received was relevant. It tended to prove that the representations, which the plaintiffs conceded they had made, were true; and was admissible to rebut the proof of fraud offered by the defendant. The court was justified in allowing the facts to be proved by the testimony of the bookkeeper. Though the facts testified to could have been ascertained from the books of account, by computation, and as the result of many other facts, they were nowhere explicitly stated in the books. When the facts sought to be proved are of such a character, and the books or accounts are voluminous, so that the examination of each item during the trial would consume much time and it would be difficult for the jury to understand the accounts, or make the necessary computation, the court may in its discretion permit a competent witness who has examined the books with reference to the point sought to be established, to testify to the result of such an examination, or to present schedules verified by his testimony, showing the details of the computation he has made. But in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>cases, unless there is some legal excuse for not producing the books of account from which the witness has obtained the results testified to, they must be produced, if required by the opposing party, for examination, or to enable him to cross-examine the witness. 1 Greenl. on Ev.
