That at the time when the bridge company executed to the city and town of New Haven, on the 31st day of December, 1886, the deed of that date set forth in and made a part of the finding upon reservation hi the Supreme Court of Errors (being Exhibit B, and found on pages 37 to 40, both inclusive, of this record), the plaintiff was the equitable owner of all the capital stock of said bridge company. This evidence was offered for the purpose of showing that the injunction should not extend to the whole width of parcel B, but only to so much thereof as constitutes the crossing limited as is claimed in the agreed finding of facts. The plaintiff objected, for the reason that the record, finding and agreed statement of facts was conclusive upon the defendant; that parcel B had been adjudicated to be the property of the plaintiff, and that this evidence was not admissible for the purpose of varying the statement of facts to affect the judgment of the Supreme Court. The court sustained the objection and excluded the evidence, the defendant duly excepting. The defendant admitted that the map, Exhibit A, made part of the finding, properly indicated and showed the location and dimensions of parcel B in all directions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\">\u201c 2d. For the same purpose, evidence tending to show that in 1889 the city of New Haven paved a part of the causeway west of the easterly boundary of parcel B referred to in said finding and opinion of the Supreme Court of Errors, and to a point within about two feet of the easterly track of the plaintiff\u2019s railway, and that since that date the said city of New Haven had kept said pavement in repair at its own expense. The plaintiff objected to any further evidence upon the questions that might be affected by such testimony, and to the admission of the same, for the reasons given in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>objection to the last question, and the court thereupon excluded the same, the defendant duly excepting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">\u201c There was no claim on the part of the defendant that any of the evidence so offered was newly discovered, or was not known to the defendant and its counsel at and prior to the time of the agreed statement of facts and finding upon reservation for the advice and consideration of the Supreme Court of Errors. Thereupon the defendant asked the court to rule as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">\u201c 1. That the defendant has under its charter and the authority derived from the General Assembly, the city of New Haven and the railroad commissioners, a right to construct its tracks and operate its railroad at the place in question, upon payment of compensation therefor to the plaintiff. And the defendant further asked the court to limit the injunction to be granted to the plaintiff until the defendant should have made compensation to the plaintiff, to be voluntarily accepted, or to be assessed according to law. The court declined so to rule, and the defendant duly excepted to said ruling. 2. That pursuant to the advice as given by the Supreme Court of Errors, the injunction order should be limited to the actual crossing, in pursuance of paragraph 11J of the agreed statement of facts. The court declined so to rule, and the defendant duly excepted to said ruling. 3. That by the terms of the deed from the bridge company to the city and town of New Haven, the westerly boundary of that portion of the westerly approach to said bridge was Bridge street, upon the westerly side of said crossing, and that the whole of said crossing for the whole width of parcel B was by the terms of said deed conveyed to said city and town as and for a public highway. The court declined so to rule, and the defendant duly excepted to said ruling. 4. That the title to parcel B is not an issue in this cause, but only that portion thereof actually occupied by the tracks of the plaintiff; and that said crossing is subject to an easement of passage on the part of the public. The court declined so to rule, and the defendant duly excepted to said ruling. 5. That the approach to the toll-bridge is a public highway, save only for the chartered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>right of the bridge company to collect tolls thereon, and that said right is a franchise, and not assignable to the plaintiff. The court declined so to rule, and the defendant duly excepted to said ruling. 6. That the plaintiff is bound by the statute law of this State (\u00a7 8499) to keep said crossing in repair at its own expense, and that no inference hostile to the defendant should be drawn by reason of the performance of said duty by the plaintiff. The court declined so to rule, and the defendant duly excepted to said ruling. 7. That the advice of the Supreme Court of .Errors did not extend to or cover the removal of the trades of the defendant, but only to the operation by the defendant of its cars over a portion of parcel B, and that no order of removal should be granted. The court declined so to rule, and the defendant duly excepted to said ruling.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-6\">The errors assigned are the rulings of the court upon evidence, and the refusal to grant defendant\u2019s request for rulings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-7\">In this court the defendant filed the following motion to dismiss said appeal: \u201cThe said New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company, defendant in error, now moves to dismiss said appeal, because said appeal is from the judgment, decree,, and decision of the Superior Court, made and rendered October 7th, 1898, conforming and pursuant to the consideration and advice of this court adjudicated and given June 17th, 1898, upon a reservation by said Superior Court for the consideration and advice of this court of said case, and of all questions of law arising in said case upon the pleadings and upon the written statement of facts in the case stip-. ulated and agreed to by the parties plaintiff and defendant, and signed by them by their respective attorneys, which statement of fact was also by the consent and request of both of the said parties found by said Superior Court to be true; and said judgment of said Superior Court so appealed from was so made and rendered after the plaintiff in error had on July 2Sd, 1898, applied to said Supreme Court of Errors for leave to file a motion for a reargument of the case, and was made after said application for reargument was denied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>this court on July 26th, 1898, as will more fully appear by the files and records of this case, and in the printed record now before the court, and by the opinion of this court reported in volume 70, page 610, of the Connecticut Reports ; and said files, record, and opinion, and advice are hereby referred to and made part hereof. Wherefore the defendant in error moves that said appeal be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-6\">The plaintiff also filed a plea in abatement upon the grounds set forth in the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-7\">The answer to the motion filed by the defendant was as follows: \u201c The Fair Haven and Westville Railroad Company, appellant, denies the allegation in the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, that said decree, judgment and decision appealed from conforms and is pursuant to the consideration and advice of this court adjudicated and given June 17th, 1898 <em>; </em>and the appellant further states that the said judgment is not in all respects in conformity with and pursuant to said consideration and advice of this court, in that it adjudicates and determines matters beyond and not included in said consideration and advice, and not in any manner passed upon by this court, and in certain other respects said judgment is contrary to the advice of this court, as will appear by reference to the files and records of this case, and the opinion of this court reported in volume 70, page 610, of the Connecticut Reports.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-8\">The defendant also filed an answer and a demurrer to the plea in abatement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-9\"><em>Greorye D. Watrous </em>and <em>Henry F. Parmelee, </em>with whom was <em>James D. Dewell, Jr., </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-10\"><em>Henry Stoddard, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b599-11\">Torrance, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArY\">Upon an inspection of the record in this case we are of opinion that the motion to dismiss the appeal should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">This court held in the former hearing in this case, that the land included within parcel <em>B </em>as described in the record was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the property of the plaintiff, in or over which the defendant had no right to operate its railroad, or to maintain its tracks, fixtures, or other things as described in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">It advised the Superior Court to grant the prayer'of the complaint. That prayer was for an injunction, both restraining and mandatory, covering the whole of parcel B. The judgment complained of is in accordance with that advice. A hearing was advised for a prescribed, special and limited purpose, namely, to settle the terms of the injunction. In the view here taken of the scope of the opinion and advice given in the former case, the evidence rejected and the rulings refused had no bearing upon the settlement of the terms of the injunction, within the meaning of the advice given with reference to a hearing upon this point. Under these circumstances the defendant had no right of appeal. <em>Derby </em>v. <em>Al</em>ling, 48 Conn. 255; <em>New Haven Northampton Co. </em>v. State, 44 id. 876; <em>Clarke\u2019s Appeal, </em>70 id. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
