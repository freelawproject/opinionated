As amended on January 8th, 1892, said article provides for the disposition of the benefit fund as follows: 1. To the person designated by the deceased in his application; the association reserving the right to have a guardian appointed in case such person is a minor. 2.

Osborne and the defendant Louise P. Severson, each of age. Said Lucy B. Osborne had living at that time two children, to wit, the defendant, Mabel P. Stivers, and one Harry S. Osborne, both of whom are still living. Said Prouty in his application for membership designated his said wife as the person who should receive the money payable upon his death. This designation was never changed, and he never made any other designation. His daughter, Lucy B. Osborne, died February 29th, 1882. His wife died in August, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b731-9\">April 23d, 1890, said Prouty made a will by which he gave to his granddaughter, the defendant Mabel P.

Stivers claimed <em>(a) </em>that she was entitled to the whole amount found due from the association, by virtue of her grandfather\u2019s will; (6) that defendant Louise P. Severson was not entitled to any portion of said fund, because she was not a minor at the date of her father\u2019s death, nor at any time during his membership; (e) that the original by-laws respecting payment of benefits apply to this case, and that the amendments could not deprive Prouty of his right to have said benefit fund paid to Iris executor or administrator ; (d) that said amendments were void, except as the records of the association show they were legally adopted or approved; (e) that said Prouty had a vested right to have said benefit paid in accordance with the by-laws in force when he became a member, or at least he was only bound by such subsequent changes as were legally made, and as by their language were explicitly applicable to existing memberships; (/) that if said fund is not legally payable to said Mabel P.

Upon the trial, it appearing that the records of the meetings of said association were silent concerning a large number of the amendments to the by-laws of the association, and among them the amendment of January 14th, 1887, aforesaid, and concerning the action of the association in framing and promulgating its by-laws as amended, the defendant Mrs. Sever-son offered evidence <em>aliunde </em>these records, to wit, the pamphlet publications of the by-laws aforesaid, together with the evidence of sundry officers, directors, and members of said association who were present at said meeting, and at subsequent meetings held on January 8th, 1892, and January 12th, 1894, to prove that said amendments of January 14th, 1887, as they appeared in the pamphlet publication thereafter made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and as above recited, were in fact made and adopted by the vote of said meeting, and in the manner prescribed for said amendments, and that said article VII as thus amended was at the meeting of January 8th, 1892, and January 12th, 1894, re-adopted and confirmed. To the admission of all this evidence the defendant Mabel P. Stivers, through her counsel, objected, as incompetent, and for the reason that the action of said association at said meetings could only be shown by the records thereof kept by its secretary, and that no changes or amendments of said by-laws would be valid unless recorded in said records. The court overruled said objection and admitted said evidence, the defendant Mabel P. Stivers duly excepting. 19. Upon the evidence so admitted the court found that said amendment of January 14th, 1887, had been made, and the amended article VII, as hereinbefore recited, adopted at a regular annual meeting of said association on that day held, in the manner prescribed in the by-laws for amendments thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-6\">The appeal assigns as error the rulings of the court in admitting said evidence, in sustaining the claim of the defendant Louise P. Severson, and in refusing to sustain the claims of the defendant Mabel P. Stivers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b733-7\"><em>Charles K. Bush, </em>for appellant, Mabel P. Stivers.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b733-8\"><em>Charles S. Hamilton, </em>for the appellee, Louise P. Severson.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b733-9\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqK\">It is not essential to the validity of the acts of a voluntary association that they should be recorded; if recorded, such record consists merely of written entries of its acts, made by a clerk appointed by the association for that purpose for its own convenience only, and such entries are not of so solemn a character as to be conclusive. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>United States A. &amp; L. Ins. Co., </em>24 Conn. 591, 601. The court properly admitted the evidence offered to prove the adoption of the amendments to the by-laws. The finding that the amendments were adopted is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Mr. Prouty had no vested right in having the fund payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>at liis death\u2014in the event of there being no beneficiary designated by him\u2014disposed of as provided by the by-laws in force at the time of his admission as a member. The terms of the contract between the members imply a submission to such changes in this matter as the association may make; these changes apply to all members alike, and the by-laws in force at the death of a member determine the disposition of the fund. <em>Knights of Columbus </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>70 Conn. 545, 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The by-law in force at Prouty\u2019s death requires the fund to be paid to Louise P. Severson; and the testamentary gift by Prouty of all his estate to his granddaughter, can have no effect upon this disposition of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
