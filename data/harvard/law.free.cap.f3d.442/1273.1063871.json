Paley was involved in laundering the proceeds of a friend\u2019s drug sales in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). One of his laundering schemes was an investment in the stock of a privately-held company, and the stock appreciated significantly in value. The district court, in calculating the total amount of the laundered funds for which Paley was accountable under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2S1.1 (Nov.2004), included the appreciated value of the stock, instead of just the initial investment amount. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-14\">Paley, an attorney in Boca Raton, Florida, and drug dealer Brian Rowland, engaged in two separate money laundering transactions. First, they bought a fishing boat together for $120,000. Rowland contributed $60,000 of his drug proceeds toward the purchase price, and Paley financed his $60,000 contribution. Paley was listed as the sole owner on the vessel\u2019s title. Paley concedes that he should be held responsible for laundering Rowland\u2019s $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-15\">Second, Paley and Rowland invested $20,000 in the stock of a private company that was one of Paley\u2019s legal clients. Rowland contributed $15,000 of that amount, with Paley contributing the remaining $5,000. The company eventually repur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>chased Paley and Rowland\u2019s shares for $120,000. Paley issued Rowland a check for $103,000 for his share of the investment. It is not clear from the record why Rowland, who had supplied 75 percent of the initial investment, received 89 percent of the proceeds. In any event, Rowland then rewarded Paley for investing his drug proceeds in such a lucrative asset by paying him an additional $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">Paley\u2019s position is that for sentencing guidelines purposes he should be held responsible for the $15,000 initial investment by Rowland, the $40,000 that Rowland paid him, and the $60,000 that Rowland contributed to buying the boat, which adds up to $115,000. He should not, he insists, be held responsible for the $88,000 appreciation in value of Rowland\u2019s share of the investment ($103,000 proceeds minus $15,000 purchase price). The issue we must decide is whether the district court correctly held that Paley was responsible for the appreciation in value of Rowland\u2019s share of the investment to $103,000, and therefore $163,000 in total, factoring in the $60,000 from the boat transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">In deciding this issue we have to consult four guidelines provisions. We begin with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X4.1, which provides that the base offense level for misprision of a felony is nine levels lower than the offense level for the underlying offense. The offense underlying Paley\u2019s misprision conviction is money laundering, which is covered by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1. Because Paley was only involved in laundering money and not in the substantive drug offense that generated the money to be laundered, subsection (a)(2) of that section applies. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2S1.1(a)(1)-(2). That provision specifies that the base offense level for Paley\u2019s crime is eight plus the number of offense levels corresponding to the \u201cvalue of the laundered funds\u201d as provided by the table in \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(2). The table sets the base offense level for various property offenses such as theft and forgery according to the amount of loss. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1). That is where the amount of the appreciation in the value of the investment comes in. Finally, because Paley knew the laundered funds were drug proceeds, \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(1) applies to add six offense levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">The graduated table in \u00a7 2B1.1 provides that the offense level for $163,000 \u2014 the number which includes the full amount of the stock\u2019s appreciation- \u2014 -is ten. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(F) (applying to a loss of more than $120,000 but not more than $200,000). Add to that the base offense level of eight as directed by \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2) and the six offense levels provided in \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(1) and then subtract nine levels per \u00a7 2X4.1, and you get an offense level of 15. With a criminal history category of I, the resulting sentencing range is 18 to 24 months. That is the guidelines calculation the presentence investigation report used, and the district court adopted it after overruling Paley\u2019s objection to the amount of the laundered funds. The district court sentenced Paley to 18 months, the bottom end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">If Paley is correct that he should have been held responsible for only $115,000, the guidelines range drops six months on both ends. The table in \u00a7 2B1.1 provides that the base offense level for $115,000 is eight. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(E) (applying to a loss of more than $70,000 but not more than $120,000). Therefore, the total offense level would have been 13, and the resulting sentencing range should have been just 12 to 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of the facts concerning the amount of money involved in a money laundering scheme only for clear error. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>320 F.3d 1223, 1225 (11th Cir.2003). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. Id. </em>Because Paley preserved this issue by timely objection in the district court, if there was error we will reverse unless it was harmless. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">Our holding in <em>United States v. Barrios, </em>993 F.2d 1522 (11th Cir.1993), persuaded the district court to include the appreciation in value of the stock in its calculation of the \u201cvalue of the laundered funds\u201d as required by \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2). <em>Barrios </em>involved the application of \u00a7 2S1.1 before its amendment in 2001. In that case, the defendant Barrios sent $595,000 of his drug proceeds to Jose Nasser who deposited the funds in bank accounts in three countries. <em>Id. </em>at 1523-24. Some time later, Nasser issued ten checks totaling nearly $675,000 to Barrios, who then gave them to Nicholas Cure to deposit in an offshore bank. <em>Id. </em>at 1523. Barrios argued that he should be held responsible only for the initial deposit of $595,000, and not for the $675,000 amount, which included nearly $80,000 in interest earned while the funds were on deposit with the banks. <em>Id. </em>at 1523-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">The pre-2001 amendment version of \u00a7 2S1.1 contained a graduated table that provided for an increase in the base offense level if the \u201cvalue of the funds exceeded $100,000.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(2) (Nov.1992). Of importance for Barrios was that $600,000 was the break point between applying a four level enhancement or a three level enhancement. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2S1.1(b)(2)(E). The district court in <em>Barrios </em>included the $80,000 in interest earned on the drug proceeds in calculating the value of the funds pursuant to the former \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(2). 993 F.2d at 1524. This Court affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">In doing so, we focused on the meaning of the term \u201cfunds.\u201d <em>See id. </em>We noted that a district court is \u201c \u2018required to consider the total amount of funds that it believed was involved in the course of criminal conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. De La Rosa, </em>922 F.2d 675, 679 (11th Cir.1991) (reviewing for clear error district court\u2019s determination of the amount of money involved in a money laundering operation)). We also agreed with the Tenth Circuit that \u201cfunds\u201d \u201c \u2018obviously refer[s] to funds that are used by the defendant in an unlawful monetary transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>971 F.2d 562, 575 (10th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">Our holding in <em>Barrios </em>that the interest was properly included in the \u201cvalue of the funds\u201d turned on the fact that \u201cwhatever interest was earned on the original drug proceeds ... stayed with the funds throughout the remainder of the laundering process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, the interest \u201cbecame part of Barrios\u2019 continuing money laundering scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected Barrios\u2019 argument that including the interest \u201cdistorted] the magnitude of the criminal enterprise involved\u201d because \u201cincluding interest in this case gave an accurate reflection of the size of the money laundering scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1525. Finally, we stated that the public policy against money laundering was furthered by including the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>terest \u201cwhere that interest was combined with funds which thereafter continued through laundering transactions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">The district court in the present case thought that under our 1993 decision in <em>Barrios </em>the return earned on criminally derived funds must be counted as part of the funds involved in money laundering. In 2001, however, \u00a7 2S1.1 was amended. The amended version, which applies in this case, no longer uses \u201cthe value of the funds\u201d as a specific offense characteristic. Instead, \u00a7 2S1.1 now provides that the \u201cvalue of the <em>laundered </em>funds\u201d should be used in determining the offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2) (Nov.2004) (emphasis added). The commentary to the amended provision defines \u201claundered funds\u201d as follows: \u201cLaundered funds means the property, funds, or monetary instrument involved in the transaction, financial transaction, monetary transaction, transportation, transfer, or transmission in violation of\u2019 the money laundering statute. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 cmt. n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">In <em>United States v. Martin, </em>320 F.3d 1223 (11th Cir.2003), we recognized that the change from \u201cvalue of the funds\u201d at issue in <em>Barrios </em>to \u201cvalue of the laundered funds\u201d in the revised \u00a7 2S1.1 could affect the money laundering calculation. In that case, the defendant, Martin, deposited a stolen check totaling just over $380,000 into an attorney trust account that he maintained. <em>Martin, </em>320 F.3d at 1225. A few days later he wrote nine separate checks totaling about the same amount and then used those checks to obtain cash or to purchase cashier\u2019s cheeks and certificates of deposit for his family, friends, and others. <em>Id. </em>In total, Martin engaged in 97 separate transactions totaling over one million dollars. <em>Id. </em>In calculating Martin\u2019s sentence under the former \u00a7 2S1.1, the district court used the total amount instead of the $380,000 from the initial stolen check. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">Relying on <em>Barrios, </em>this Court rejected Martin\u2019s argument that \u201cthe \u2018value of the funds\u2019 necessarily means the amount of money originally injected or infused into the money laundering scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1226. We held that \u201c[b]y adding together the individual transactions for which [Martin] was convicted, the district court\u2019s calculation accurately reflected the scope of the criminal enterprise because each of the 97 money laundering counts constituted a separate harm to society by further impeding law enforcement\u2019s efforts to track the ill-gotten gains.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Martin </em>and <em>Barrios </em>because both of those cases involved the old version of \u00a7 2S1.1, not the amended version. We specifically recognized in our <em>Martin </em>opinion that \u201c[g]iven the substantial changes to the money laundering provisions, our holding today does not apply to the \u2018value of the laundered funds\u2019 in \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2) of the 2001 Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227 n. 3. Because, as we recognized in <em>Martin, </em>the 2001 revisions to \u00a7 2S1.1 changed the relevant term for sentence calculation purposes from \u201cthe value of the funds\u201d to \u201cthe value of the laundered funds,\u201d we must interpret the latter phrase, something that neither <em>Barrios </em>nor <em>Martin </em>do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">\u201cLaundered funds\u201d as used in \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2) include \u201cthe property, funds, or monetary instrument involved in the [money laundering] transaction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 cmt. n.l. This case involves funds and property, the property being the stock that was purchased with funds and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>appreciated significantly in value. For two reasons we are persuaded that the \u201claundered funds\u201d should not include the stock\u2019s appreciation in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">First, the inclusion of the modifier \u201claundered\u201d before \u201cfunds\u201d indicates that the funds which should be considered for sentencing purposes are those that were actually laundered. In the stock scheme at issue in this case, the funds that were laundered by Paley are the $15,000 that Rowland contributed toward the stock investment. The appreciation of Rowland\u2019s share of the investment to $103,000 may have been merely fortuitous or may have resulted from Paley\u2019s investment acumen, but it was not the product of the money laundering scheme itself. It did not convert those funds to laundered funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Second, if we were to hold that the value of the laundered funds included the appreciation in value of an asset purchased with drug proceeds, we would open the door to an absurd result when laundered funds are used to purchase an asset that ultimately decreases in value. It would be unsound policy to interpret \u201cvalue of the laundered funds\u201d in \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2) in a way that would make the sentence in a money laundering case (or misprision case where the underlying offense is money laundering) hinge on how successfully the proceeds of the crime are invested. (The forfeiture provision applicable to money laundering cases prevents the launderer and his criminal client from keeping the profits of the money laundering operation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(1) (requiring forfeiture of \u201cany property, real or personal, involved in [money laundering], or <em>any property traceable to such property\u201d) </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in its interpretation of the sentencing guidelines when it found that Paley was responsible for the stock\u2019s appreciation in value. <em>Cf. United States v. Pizano, </em>421 F.3d 707, 727 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201cin a money-laundering offense involving layering, the Value of the laundered funds\u2019 is the amount originally derived from criminal activity and then laundered, not the aggregate total of the funds involved in each layer\u201d and stating that \u201cthe Value of the laundered funds\u2019 should be limited to funds originally injected or infused into the money-laundering scheme\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">The government urges us to hold that the district court\u2019s error in interpreting the guidelines was harmless. An error is harmless if it \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). The government bears the burden of persuading us that the district court would have imposed the same sentence even if it had not erred in interpreting the guidelines. <em>See id., </em>112 S.Ct. at 1121. It points out that the district court stated that sentencing Paley to 18 months imprisonment, the low end of the range, \u201cdoes adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense and provides just and reasonable punishment\u201d and that the court noted that Paley could have faced a money laundering charge carrying a potential 20-year sentence. But the district court also said that \u201c[t]his, quite frankly, is a difficult sentencing for the Court,\u201d and disclosed that it was \u201cgreatly influenced by the Advisory Guidelines.\u201d Considering all of the court\u2019s statements, we are not persuaded that the government has carried its burden of showing that the district court would have given Paley the same sentence regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>of its error in calculating the guidelines range. It might have, but it might not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">We note in closing that this is a good example of a case in which the district court could have avoided the necessity of appellate review and a remand for resen-tencing on this issue by explicitly stating\u2014 if true \u2014 that even if the court were wrong on the disputed guidelines issue, it would have imposed the same sentence under the guidelines (since the sentence was within both possible ranges) or by using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 767, 773-76 (11th Cir.2005) (Carnes, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s interpretation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 281.1(a)(2) and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
