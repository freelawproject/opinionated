After Johnson failed to respond timely to the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>dent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition as moot, the district court dismissed the petition with prejudice. The district court relied on Local Rule 7.2(C)(2), which permits a court to grant a motion as unopposed if a party fails to respond timely to the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Before addressing whether Johnson\u2019s case was improperly dismissed for failure to file a timely response, we must first determine whether this case is moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Johnson has finished serving his term of imprisonment and has begun serving his term of supervised release. Although Johnson remains \u201cin custody\u201d while on supervised release,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole-some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction-must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has held that if a prisoner wrongfully serves excess prison time, he is not automatically entitled to a reduction in his term of supervised release.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But, as the Court noted, a district court may exercise its discretion to modify an individual\u2019s term of supervised release, taking into account that an individual has been \u201cincarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison term.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this case, the possibility that the district court may alter Johnson\u2019s period of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2), if it determines that he has served excess prison time, prevents Johnson\u2019s petition from being moot.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Relying on Local Rule 7.2(C)(2), the district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s petition as moot following the respondent\u2019s unopposed motion. We have recognized the power of district courts to \u201cadopt local rules requiring parties who oppose motions to file statements of opposition.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But we have not \u201capproved the automatic grant, upon failure to comply with such rules, of motions that are dispositive of the litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Ramsey v. Signal Delivery Service, Inc., </em>the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When the plaintiffs failed to respond, the district court granted the motion as unopposed, citing a local court rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On appeal, this court vacated the judgment because a few months delay in responding to the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>to dismiss \u201cdid not constitute the type of extreme delay\u201d that would warrant dismissal with prejudice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Absent a \u201c \u2018clear record of delay or contumacious conduct,\u2019 \u201d the district court should have considered whether less severe sanctions would suffice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Similarly, in this case the district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s petition solely because two months after the motion to dismiss was filed, Johnson had not filed a response. The district court did not explore whether less severe sanctions would suffice. Nor is there a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct. Under these circumstances, the district court erred in dismissing Johnson\u2019s petition with prejudice. For these reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-5\">.
