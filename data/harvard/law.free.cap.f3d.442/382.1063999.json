HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Juan Arviso-Mata appeals the 70-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction of illegally re-entering the United States after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Arviso presents three issues: (1) whether the district court erred in calculating Arviso\u2019s criminal history score; (2) whether the district court\u2019s application of the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines was harmless error; and (3) whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We affirm Arviso\u2019s conviction, vacate Arviso\u2019s sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">/</p>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">Without the benefit of a plea agreement, Arviso pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after being previously deported. The presentence report (PSR) established Arviso\u2019s base offense level at 8. He received a 16-level enhancement because he was deported previously following a conviction for transporting undocumented aliens within the United States. He received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. His total offense level was 21, with a resulting guidelines range of 70 to 87 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-18\">Arviso filed written objections to the PSR. He objected to the 16-level enhancement on the basis of <em>Blakely v. Washington. </em>He also objected to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), but he conceded that this argument was foreclosed. At sentencing, the court asked Arviso\u2019s counsel for any - objections to the PSR. Counsel stated: \u2018Tour honor, we filed a Blakely objection to the 16 level enhancement for his August, 1994 conviction for purposes of further appellate review..,. Outside of that,.Your Honor, we have no objections to the PSR. The [August 1994] conviction was 10 years ago. We\u2019d ask the Court to consider a sentence at the low end.\u201d After overruling the single objection, the district court sentenced Arviso to 70 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Arviso timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Arviso raises three issues on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred in calculating Arviso\u2019s criminal history score. Second, he contends the district court\u2019s application of the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines was not harmless error. Third, he contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Admitting that the issue was not raised below, Arviso contends that the district court plainly erred in assessing two criminal history points for his 1993 misdemeanor conviction of illegal entry into the United States because the sentence was imposed more than ten years prior to the commission of the instant offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government contends that this asserted error, in addition to being forfeited, was also waived. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u201cWaiver and forfeiture are two different means by which a defendant may react to an error by the government or the district court in the proceedings in a case.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The doctrines are similar', although distinct. Forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right; waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Forfeited errors are reviewed under the plain error standard; waived errors are entirely unreviewable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">Waiver is the \u201c \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no evidence, here, that counsel knew of the sentencing - guidelines issue and that he consciously chose to forego it. The government\u2019s only evidence of waiver is counsel\u2019s statement that, other than the <em>Blakely </em>objection, he had no problem with the PSR. This statement, alone, is insufficient to establish that Arviso\u2019s counsel abandoned a known right. The unpublished opinions cited by the government are inapposite. In both <em>United States v. Martinez </em>and <em>United States v. Molina, </em>the defendant objected, in writing, to the pre-sentence report, but subsequently affirmatively abandoned the objection before the court at sentencing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We cannot say the same occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">Turning to the merits, we review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because there was no objection below, Arviso must establish that the district court plainly erred in application of the guidelines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The district court assessed Arviso two criminal history points for his 1993 conviction of illegal reentry. According to the indictment for the instant offense, Arviso was arrested for the instant offense on August 3, 2003. According to the PSR, Arviso pled guilty to the prior offense on March 3, 1993.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 4A1.2(e), computation of criminal history points is determined by the length of the sentence and the date of the imposition or release of the sentence. Here, Arviso was sentenced to five years of probation without supervision. There was no term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Section 4A1.2(e) governs whether prior convictions count for criminal history purposes. Under \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(1), \u201c[a]ny prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month that was imposed within fifteen years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense is counted.\u201d This provision is not applicable, as Arviso\u2019s prior conviction did not result in imprisonment exceeding one year and one month. Under \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2), \u201c[a]ny other prior sentence that was imposed within ten years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense is counted.\u201d This provision is not applicable, as the instant offense occurred on August 3, 2003 and the sentence for the prior offense was imposed on March 3, 1993, which is outside the ten-year period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we are left with \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(3), which provides that \u201c[a]ny other sentence not within the time periods specified above is not counted.\u201d As Arviso\u2019s March 1993 conviction does not fall within the time periods specified in \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(1) or (2), it should not have counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Our conclusion that the district court erred is not changed by the subsequent revocation of Arviso\u2019s probation on September 13, 1994. Following revocation, Arviso was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Section 4A1.2(k)(1) provides that \u201c[in the case of a prior revocation of probation, ... add the original term of imprisonment to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation. The resulting total is used to compute the criminal history points for [\u00a7 4A1.1]].\u201d Here, the original term of imprisonment was zero months; the additional term was three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Section 4A1.2(k)(2)(B) explains how the new term of imprisonment affects the counting of criminal history points under \u00a7 4A1.2(e). If the total term of imprisonment exceeds one year and one month, we are instructed to use \u201cthe date of last release from incarceration on such sentence.\u201d This provision is inapplicable, as Arviso\u2019s new term of imprisonment was only three months. Ignoring a provision regarding minors, in all other cases \u201cthe date of the original sentence\u201d is used. Here, that is March 3, 1993, which, as discussed previously, is outside the window for consideration under \u00a7 4A1.2(e) and \u00a7 4A1.1(b). The district court plainly erred in considering Arviso\u2019s March 1993 conviction for purposes of enhancing his criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Second, Arviso contends the district court erred by applying the mandato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ry sentencing guidelines, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Technically, the erroneous application of the guidelines as mandatory is a <em>\u201cFanfan </em>error.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The government concedes that Arviso preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>error for appeal and that the issue is reviewed for harmless error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The government contends that the error is harmless because the court imposed a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence at the law end of the guidelines range. However, the government cannot carry is arduous burden of showing that the district court would not have sentenced Arviso differently under an advisory guidelines system.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Finally, Arviso contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Al-mendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>which this Court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED. We VACATE Arviso\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-14\">. 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.1(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\">. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dodson, </em>288 F.3d 153, 160 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\">. <em>United States v.
