Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have commented on the impact of <em>Booker. </em>We conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not affect the sentence received by Defendanb-Appellant Jose Luis Robles-Vertiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-17\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">Robles-Vertiz pleaded guilty to and was convicted of being in the United States illegally after removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Standing alone, a \u00a7 1326(a) offense carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Robles-Ver-tiz\u2019s \u00a7 1326(a) offense, however, did not stand alone: Prior to his removal from the United States, Robles-Vertiz had been convicted of an aggravated felony which, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), increased the maximum penalty for his \u00a7 1326(a) offense to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Robles-Vertiz\u2019s prior conviction also produced a 16-level increase in his offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d), as a result of which his sentencing range was 46-57 months. The district court departed downward, lowering Robles-Vertiz\u2019s Criminal History Category from III to II, which resulted in a new sentencing range of 41-51 months. The court then sentenced Robles-Vertiz at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the bottom of this new range, imposing a sentence of 41 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Robles-Vertiz objected to the sentence on the ground that it exceeded the maximum authorized by \u00a7 1326(a), but the district court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Robles-Vertiz then appealed his sentence to us, contending that his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum in violation of his rights under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, because the indictment charging him with a \u00a7 1326(a) violation did not separately state a \u00a7 1326(b) offense. In his brief on appeal, Robles-Vertiz acknowledged that precedent foreclosed that argument, but that he raised it to preserve possible Supreme Court review. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Robles-Vertiz then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. After the Court handed down <em>Booker, </em>Robles-Vertiz filed a supplemental petition for certiorari in which, for the first time, he raised a <em>Booker </em>challenge to his mandatory Guidelines sentence. The Supreme Court granted Robles-Vertiz\u2019s petition, vacated our judgment affirming his sentence, and remanded for our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We again affirm RoblesVertiz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Adj\">A <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">As Robles-Vertiz raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his supplemental petition for certiorari, we review it only in the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we have yet to define the precise contours of \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d we know that this standard is more onerous than the plain error standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It follows, then, that if RoblesVertiz cannot meet the requirements of plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy the requirements of extraordinary circumstances review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And, Robles-Vertiz cannot meet the requisites of plain error review because he has failed to show that the error in his case affected his substantial rights. We therefore need not address whether extraordinary circumstances exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the circumstances in a case meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>a district court\u2019s sentencing of a defendant under the formerly-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines (1) constitutes error (2) that is plain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He will carry this burden only if he can \u201cshow[] that the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That may be shown, in turn, by the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemonstrat[ion of] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To demonstrate such a probability, the defendant must identify in the record an indication that the \u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By all accounts, this burden is \u201cdifficult\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014but not impossible<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>B. Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In measuring a defendant\u2019s attempt to show that a plain error affected his substantial rights, our decisions have considered \u201ctwo issues: first, whether the judge made any statements during sentencing indicating that he would have imposed a lesser sentence had he not considered the Guidelines mandatory; [and] second, the relationship between the actual sentence imposed and the range of sentences provided by the Guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Robles-Vertiz does not contend that the district court made any statements expressing a preference for a lower sentence: He concedes that \u201cthe district court made no particular remarks disagreeing with the requirements of the mandatory guidelines,\u201d or otherwise indicating that it would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, Robles-Vertiz calls to our attention (1) \u201csympathetic circumstances surrounding [his] illegal reentry offense that support a finding of a reasonable likelihood of a lower sentence\u201d\u2014 namely, his five children, his disability, his steady work in the United States, and the fact that he returned to the United States to be with his family; and (2) the facts that the district court (a) departed downward from the Guidelines\u2019 sentencing range before sentencing Robles-Ver-tiz, and (b) imposed the minimum sentence permitted by this lower sentencing range. He argues that \u201c[t]hese circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>stances\u201d prove that the error in this case affected his substantial rights because, \u201cdespite the court\u2019s demonstrated willingness to reduce Robles[-Vertiz\u2019s] sentence, any ... reduction [beyond the downward departure] based on the sympathetic circumstances ... was virtually foreclosed.\u201d After all, contends Robles-Vertiz, \u201c[u]n-der the mandatory guideline scheme, departures were severely limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We hold that Robles-Vertiz has not carried his burden of showing that <em>Fanfan </em>error \u201c \u2018affected the outcome of [his] district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, he concedes that he cannot identify any statements in the record demonstrating that the \u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And, Robles-Vertiz\u2019s other evidence fails to make up the difference. True, his contention \u2014 that the district court granted him a downward departure because it viewed the <em>pre-departure </em>Guidelines sentencing range as being too severe \u2014 is plausible. But it is beside the point as well. We are concerned not with whether the district court thought that the <em>pre-depar-ture </em>Guidelines sentence was too severe; rather, our concern is whether, under an advisory Guidelines system, the district court would have imposed a sentence different from that which it <em>actually </em>imposed, i.e., different from its <em>post-departure </em>sentence. Although the district court\u2019s downward departure may plausibly indicate that it viewed the pre-departure sentence as too severe, it says nothing about the post-departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Robles-Vertiz disagrees. He contends that, had the then-mandatory Guidelines permitted the district court to take into account the \u201csympathetic circumstances\u201d of his case, the court would have departed further downward than it did. Again, though, this argument is unavailing; Robles-Vertiz can point to nothing in the record indicating that the district court would have relied on his individual circumstances to impose an even lower sentence than it did. Moreover, Robles-Vertiz\u2019s contention that under the then-mandatory Guidelines the district court could not have considered his circumstances in ordering a less severe sentence is simply incorrect. Although the Guidelines state that \u201c[physical condition,\u201d \u201c[e]mployment record,\u201d and \u201c[f]amily ties and responsibilities\u201d are \u201cnot ordinarily relevant in determining whether\u201d to depart downward,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the truth is in the details: As the very terms of these Guidelines policy statements suggest, Robles-Vertiz\u2019s circumstances are not <em>\u201cordinarily\u201d </em>relevant<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; but they may be relevant in certain circumstances.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Had the district court considered Robles-Vertiz\u2019s circumstances to be sufficiently compelling, then, it could have considered them. And, finally, even though the Guidelines are now advisory, sentencing courts still must consider them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is thus true that the district court could order a less onerous sentence on remand, but it is at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>equally possible that the court could impose precisely the same one \u2014 or even a greater one.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Robles-Vertiz next attempts to meet his burden by emphasizing the fact that the district court sentenced him at the bottom of the post-departure Guidelines range. Under our decision in <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>though, Robles-Vertiz\u2019s invocation of this fact alone is not enough to carry his burden.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And, contrary to Robles-Vertiz\u2019s argument, <em>Bringier </em>is not distinguishable from this case. Robles-Vertiz argues that unlike the defendant in <em>Bringier, </em>he presents sufficiently \u201csympathetic circumstances\u201d to raise a reasonable likelihood that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory Guidelines scheme. The differences between this case and <em>Bringier, </em>however \u2014 for example, that Bringier was a \u201clarge-scale drug trafficker\u201d while Robles-Vertiz is \u201can illegal alien who merely crossed the border\u201d \u2014 have no bearing on the question whether we may infer from a Guideline-minimum sentence that Robles-Vertiz would have been sentenced differently under an advisory scheme. The significance of any factual differences is, of course, borne out in the sentences imposed: Bringier was sentenced to a Guideline-minimum 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, compared to Robles-Vertiz\u2019s 41 months. Yet, in neither case may we conclude that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory scheme. Robles-Vertiz\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Bringier </em>is simply unconvincing. He has not carried his burden under the third prong of the plain error test. As Robles-Vertiz has failed to satisfy plain error review, we do not reach his argument that the error in his sentencing seriously affected the fairness, integrity and public reputation of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Finally, in a last-ditch effort, Robles-Vertiz expresses disagreement with the mechanics of Mares\u2019s plain error standard. He recognizes that <em>Mares </em>forecloses this argument, but nonetheless raises the point to preserve a challenge to <em>Mares\u2019s </em>articulation of the plain error standard of review. He insists that we got it wrong in <em>Mares, </em>and that the plain error standard employed by other courts (the Sixth Circuit, for example<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>) gets it right. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that actually or effectively overturns it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">As Robles-Vertiz cannot satisfy plain error review, he certainly cannot demonstrate the presence of extraordinary circumstances that would entitle him to re-sentencing. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Robles-Vertiz\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s pending motion to rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>state our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\">. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\">. <em>United States v.

It is clear that there was no <em>\"Booker\" </em>error or Sixth Amendment violation in this case because the only enhancement to Robles-Vertiz\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (reaffirming that \"[a]ny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of gu\u00fcty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d) (emphasis added). This case presents what we have termed <em>Fanfan </em>error because the district court sentenced Robles-Vertiz pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). These semantics do not affect our analysis, however, because \"a district court's <em>Fanfan </em>error will be treated the same as <em>Booker </em>error in cases where the sentencing predated those decisions.\u201d <em>United States v.
