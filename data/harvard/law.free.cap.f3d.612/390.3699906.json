HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">Our plaintiff wants a federal court in Louisiana to assert specific personal jurisdiction over a New Mexico resident and a New Mexico partnership so that it may bring claims of breach of contract and breach of a fiduciary duty. As neither defendant remaining in this appeal was an actual party to that contract or otherwise assumed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">Willow Bend, a Colorado limited liability company whose members reside in both Colorado and Louisiana, held an option to purchase a parcel of land in St. John the Baptist Parish, in the Eastern District of Louisiana. In the fall of 2006, it began negotiating with a New Mexico resident, Vincent J. Garcia, for a joint venture arrangement to assist in the property\u2019s financing. Garcia, the president of Blue Dot \u2014 a New Mexico corporation \u2014 and managing partner of Downtown ABQ Partners \u2014 a New Mexico partnership \u2014 indicated that one of the two entities would assist in purchasing the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">A month\u2019s worth of negotiations later, Willow Bend and Blue Dot \u2014 but not Downtown ABQ or Garcia in his personal capacity \u2014 entered into a financing agreement. By the contract\u2019s terms, Blue Dot was to either profit from the subsequent resale of the property to a third-party purchaser or, failing a sale, become a 65 percent owner in the property. Garcia, acting on Blue Dot\u2019s behalf, twice visited the state to inspect the property. He and his representatives spoke with Louisianian attorneys, brokers, and real estate agents concerning the property, Blue Dot\u2019s intent to finance the purchase of it, and financial and zoning details related to the planned purchase. The contract Blue Dot signed chose Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">As it happened, the would-be third-party purchaser pulled out, and Blue Dot was unable to fund the purchase price to obtain its 65 percent ownership stake. Willow Bend sued Garcia, Blue Dot, and Downtown ABQ for breach of contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>breach of fiduciary duty in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The district court found personal jurisdiction lacking as to Garcia and Downtown ABQ and dismissed them from the lawsuit. Satisfying itself of its jurisdiction over Blue Dot, the court then entered a judgment for money damages in the amount of $2,425,000 against the New Mexico corporation and in Willow Bend\u2019s favor. Unhappy with this result, Willow Bend timely appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Garcia and Downtown ABQ for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">A federal district court in Louisiana sitting in diversity may exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant if (1) the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the protections and benefits of Louisiana by establishing \u201cminimum contacts\u201d in the state, and (2) the exercise of the jurisdiction complies with traditional notions of \u201cfair play and substantial justice.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Though minimum contacts may give rise to either \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction, Willow Bend pushes only the latter, which exists when the \u201cplaintiffs cause of action\u201d \u2014 in the present case, footed on theories of breach of contract and fiduciary duty\u2014 \u201carises out of or results from the defendant\u2019s forum-related contacts.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Faithful to the adage that \u201c[ejach defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State must be assessed individually,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court examined the defendants one at a time. Blue Dot, the court concluded, was obliged to defend Willow Bend\u2019s lawsuit because, as we have mentioned, it had contracted to finance the purchase of a plot of land in the state; Garcia- \u2014 -acting as the corporation\u2019s president \u2014 twice visited Louisiana; and Garcia and other Blue Dot representatives repeatedly contacted Louisianians about the property. And, again, the contract \u2014 on which Willow Bend\u2019s claims are based \u2014 chose Louisiana law. Downtown ABQ, conversely, was not a party to that contract: it is a legal entity separate and apart from Blue Dot, and had only one contact with the state in its name \u2014 the ordering of an appraisal for the property from a Louisiana firm. A far cry from \u201cminimum contacts,\u201d to be sure. As for Garcia, the district court observed that he too was a non-party to the financing agreement, finding \u201cno evidence\u201d that it would be reasonable to pierce the corporate veil and hold Garcia individually liable or to conclude that Garcia acted in his individual capacity during contract negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">For reasons unexplained, Willow Bend acquiesces to the district court\u2019s first con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>elusion \u2014 that no cause exists to veil pierce and hold Garcia accountable under Willow Bend\u2019s contract with Blue Dot \u2014 complaining only that it has \u201csubmitted affidavits establishing that Garcia acted on his own behalf as well as on behalf of his two corporate entities when he conducted activities in the forum state.\u201d This, Willow Bend says, demonstrates that Garcia was \u201ctransacting business\u201d in Louisiana and is now amenable to suit there. But because these activities fell short of consummating a contractual relationship in Garcia\u2019s personal capacity or on Downtown ABQ\u2019s behalf, Willow Bend is left arguing that \u201c[t]he only distinction between Blue Dot and the other defendants is that Blue Dot was party to a written agreement to buy Louisiana property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Yet that written agreement is no throwaway: in fact, it is the critical forum contact in this case, and the linchpin of the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Blue Dot. Willow Bend\u2019s winning breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims against Blue Dot arose out of and resulted from Blue Dot\u2019s primary contact with the state of Louisiana \u2014 its contract with Willow Bend. Without a contract tying the non-signatories Garcia and Downtown ABQ to Willow Bend\u2019s claims against them, however, those claims share an inadequate nexus to the forum: they did not \u201carise out of or result from\u201d the defendants\u2019 contacts with the state of Louisiana. In fact, those claims failed to arise altogether. Willow Bend sued for breach of <em>contract </em>and breach of <em>fiduciary duty, </em>after all, and a defendant cannot be said to have breached a contract it never made or to have skirted a duty it never assumed. Unlike Blue Dot, neither Garcia nor Downtown ABQ can be sued for breach of contract in this action because they were simply not parties to any contract with Willow Bend, while, for the same reason, Garcia owed no individual fiduciary duty to Willow Bend and so could not have breached that either.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Willow Bend contracted with Blue Dot \u2014 and Blue Dot alone \u2014 and it is with Blue Dot that its claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty must lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">As this case demonstrates, specific jurisdiction is bound up with the claim asserted \u2014 it is claim-specific.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Had Willow Bend put forth claims independent of a contractual relationship \u2014 common law fraud, for instance \u2014 nothing said today would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>necessarily precluded a finding of personal jurisdiction over Garcia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But Willow Bend did not so the district court\u2019s order dismissing Garcia and Downtown ABQ from this action is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. <em>See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 476-77, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (quotation marks omitted). The Louisiana long-arm statute must confer personal jurisdiction over the defendant and the exercise of personal jurisdiction must comport with due process under the United States Constitution. <em>See Latshaw v. Johnston, </em>167 F.3d 208, 211 (5th Cir.1999). Because the Louisiana long-arm statute extends to the limits of due process, we collapse the two-step inquiry into a single question: Would the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendants be permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13:3201(B) (2010); <em>Walk Haydel &amp; Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Coastal Power Prod. Co., </em>517 F.3d 235, 242-43 (5th Cir. 2008). Resolving all disputed facts submitted by the plaintiff, as well as all facts contested in the affidavits, in favor of jurisdiction, we review the district court's dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo. <em>See McFadin v. Gerber, </em>587 F.3d 753, 758 (5th Cir.2009). Willow Bend must make only a prima facie showing of the predicate facts. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\"><em>. See Seiferth v.

Willow Bend baldly asserts that \"Garcia negotiated and promised to provide funds to permit the purchase of the Louisiana property in exchange for undivided interests in it,\u201d but it was Blue Dot \u2014 not Garcia or Downtown ABQ \u2014 that entered a written agreement with Willow Bend. And it is this contract, in which Blue Dot agreed to assist in financing the purchase of Louisiana real property and to litigate any resultant disputes under Louisiana law, that forms the basis of Willow Bend\u2019s claims. Willow Bend also claims that, \u201d[a]t Garcia\u2019s request, Willow Bend\u2019s attorneys drafted documents to form Willow Bend NM Developments, LLC, with Willow Bend and [Downtown] ABQ as the sole members of the new limited liability company, which would become the owner of the property.\u201d But this agreement was never executed, and by all accounts it would have formed under the laws of New Mexico. For his part, Garcia did not so much as guarantee Blue Dot's contractual performance under the financing agreement between Blue Dot and Willow Bend. <em>See Forsythe </em>v. <em>Overmyer, </em>576 F.2d 779, 784 (9th Cir.1978) (finding personal jurisdiction over the chairman and sole stockholder of the defendant corporation because the chairman had personally guaranteed the corporation\u2019s contract with the plaintiff). In Louisiana, a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is subject to the ten-year prescriptive period typically associated with the enforcement of contractual rights. <em>See Barksdale v.
