Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 189<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) and found true the firearm use allegation (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, 1203.06, subd. (a)(1).) Probation was denied and he was sentenced to state prison for a total term of 17 years to life. Appellant appeals on various grounds and also petitions for habeas corpus on the ground that he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial. The proceedings have been consolidated for decision. We deny the petition and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Two families are entwined in these events, the Gregory and Sanders families. In 1985, when these matters occurred, Kelvin Sanders was married to, but estranged from, Raynetta Gregory Sanders. On occasion he would spend the night with her at the Gregory family residence, 2009 N. Slater Street in Compton.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>On the morning of July 11, 1985, Kelvin Sanders was at the Gregory residence, having spent the night there. At around 10 a.m. appellant, Kelvin\u2019s brother, arrived to pick him up. Appellant was driving his sister\u2019s car, a burgundy BMW.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">As Kelvin joined appellant in the car, two of Raynetta\u2019s younger brothers, Norman and David Gregory, approached the BMW and punched appellant. Each hit him once. When appellant, in retaliation, tried to run them down with his car, they threw rocks at the BMW, cracking its windshield. As appellant was leaving he said to Norman and David, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back. We\u2019re going to get you, motherfuckers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">About five minutes later another Sanders brother, Calvin, arrived at the Gregory residence looking for Kelvin. Learning Kelvin had departed with appellant, Calvin left.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Approximately 20 minutes later Raynetta received two short telephone calls from Kelvin who said she should get out of the house. She dressed her children and went next door.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">About 20 minutes after the phone calls various witnesses heard what sounded like a gunshot. David, Terrell, and Norman Gregory and their friends Darryl Anderson and William Thomas all ran to the inside front door of the Gregory home. They all saw<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant in front of the house standing with a rifle. Raynetta, after she heard what sounded like a cherry bomb ran outside, looked towards her house, and saw appellant with a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">With all five young men crowded around him, Norman Gregory opened the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Appellant said, \u201cCome out now, motherfuckers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Norman replied, \u201cPut the gun down. Let\u2019s go head up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Appellant walked towards the Gregory front door, raised the rifle, pointed it at the door and fired. The gunshot fatally struck Norman Gregory in the back of the neck and exited his left jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">Appellant ran to the burgundy BMW, in which Kelvin and perhaps a third person were sitting, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">When the police arrived, before the ambulance, Norman was bleeding profusely. Some witnesses initially told the police that it was Xavier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Sanders, appellant\u2019s brother, who had shot Norman, and one witness at first told them he wasn\u2019t sure who the shooter was.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The defenses were alibi, that the victim was shot from inside the residence, and that if shot from outside, Xavier Sanders was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Appellant contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">1. CALJIC jury instruction No. 2.11.5 prejudiced appellant by creating the impression that the jury should not consider appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">2. The prosecutor\u2019s comments appealing to juror passion and prejudice were misconduct requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">3. The trial court erred in considering the \u201cvictim impact statement\u201d contained in the probation report when sentencing appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">4. Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel when Mr. Jefferson failed to produce testimony from appellant\u2019s brother that he, not appellant, was the actual shooter, and again when Ms. Abramson declined to move for a new trial on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">5. The trial court was under a sua sponte duty to order either a new trial or further factual hearings once it learned of Xavier\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">1. <em>CALJIC jury instruction No. 2.11.5 prejudiced appellant by creating the impression that the jury should not consider appellant\u2019s defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">Over appellant\u2019s objection the trial court instructed the jury that, \u201cThere has been evidence in this case indicating that a person other than defendant was or may have been involved in the crime for which the defendant is on trial, [fl] You must not discuss or give any consideration as to why the other person is not being prosecuted in this trial or whether he has been or will be prosecuted.\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.11.5 (4th ed. 1979).)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">Appellant argues that there was no evidence more than one person \u201cwas involved in the crime\u201d and that therefore \u201cthe instruction inferred [s/c] that the jury should . . . not discuss [] . . . why appellant . . . was being prosecuted for the death of Norman Gregory.\u201d In other words, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>maintains, even if the jury believed appellant was not the person with the rifle or if they believed the victim was shot by some other person from <em>inside </em>the house, this instruction directed them to still convict appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We disagree both with appellant\u2019s assumption and with his interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">A trial court has a duty to instruct a jury \u201con the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>St. Martin </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 531 [83 Cal.Rptr. 166, 463 P.2d 390].) There was evidence that a person other than the shooter may have been involved in the crime. E.g., Kelvin Sanders was with appellant at the Gregory residence when appellant said <em>\u201cWell </em>be back. <em>We\u2019re </em>going to get you. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Then, at the time of the shooting many witnesses saw one or two other people in the burgundy BMW, the car appellant used. One witness, David Gregory, thought the other person in the car was Kelvin Gregory. Thus, there was an evidentiary predicate for the instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s interpretation, the instruction did not impinge upon any of appellant\u2019s defenses. It merely directed the jury not to be distracted from its task of determining <em>appellant\u2019s </em>guilt or innocence by considering whether some uncharged person might, to some degree, be culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We find no error in the giving of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s comments appealing to juror passion and prejudice were misconduct requiring reversal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Appellant cites the following examples of prejudicial prosecutorial argument: \u201cThere is a four inch gap spurting blood\u201d; \u201c. . . four-inch hole in his cheek\u201d; \u201cAgain Norman is shot; he is laying down; there is a four inch gap in his neck. The ambulance never seems to get there.\u201d; \u201c. . . 4 inch gap, spurting blood . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Initially, we note that appellant made no objection to any of these prosecutorial comments and is therefore precluded from claiming error on appeal. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) The reason appellant, which is to say trial counsel, made no objection to these during-argument comments is no doubt because they are not objectionable.  During argument counsel may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201ccomment on the credibility of a witness in light of all the evidence presented.\u201d (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Prysock </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 972, 997 [180 Cal.Rptr. 15].) That is what the prosecutor, by these relatively bland comments, was attempting to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Defense counsel had impeached prosecution witnesses by their inconsistent statements to the police. The prosecutor attempted to explain the inconsistencies by describing the circumstances: the witness\u2019s brother or friend had just been shot through the neck and jaw, was motionless on the ground, bleeding profusely, and no ambulance had yet arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As the prosecutor himself explained in argument, \u201cI did not mean to prejudice the case or prejudice the defendant in any way when I bring up this four-inch gap. I\u2019m not trying to appeal to your sympathy. The reason it\u2019s important is so you understand why witnesses might have made mistakes shortly after when the ambulance isn\u2019t even there. You shouldn\u2019t convict Sheldon Sanders because of a four-inch gap, but one of the things you have to consider, is it possible someone can really make a mistake when their brother has a four-inch gap, spurting blood and there is no ambulance that seems to be coming? That it is something you should consider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">3. <em>The trial court erred in considering the \u201cvictim impact statement\u201d contained in the probation report when sentencing appellant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In accordance with California Rules of Court, rule 419, the probation report, which the trial judge read before imposing sentence, contained statements by members of the victim\u2019s family about the victim, appellant, and the crime. Appellant claims it was error for the report to contain these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Appellant relies on <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529]. <em>Booth </em>is distinguishable since it holds that the Eighth Amendment is violated when \u201cvictim impact\u201d evidence is presented to a <em>jury </em>during the <em>sentencing phase </em>of a <em>capital murder trial. </em>None of the three emphasized factors were present here. Not only did <em>Booth </em>not disapprove the use of \u201cvictim impact\u201d information by judges for sentencing purposes <em>(id. </em>at p. 507, fn. 10 [96 L.Ed.2d at p. 451]) but it condoned their use as trial <em>evidence </em>in appropriate circumstances, other than the sentencing phase of a capital case. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Levitt </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 500 [203 Cal.Rptr. 276] is also misplaced. There the trial judge, in imposing an upper and consecutive term, expressly relied upon the effects of the victim\u2019s death upon his wife and unborn child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In the instant case there was no such express reliance. To the contrary, the trial judge demonstrated exemplary objectivity and balance. She stated, \u201cI read the probation report which speaks in detail of the effect of this tragic incident on the victim\u2019s family, and I think it\u2019s very obvious to this court that there are two families here who have been touched greatly by this, who have been affected greatly by this unfortunate incident, [f\u00ed] I have to say that I understand both sides of the family. I don\u2019t think there is anyone sitting here who is feeling that, one, we\u2019re going to get somebody, or two, we\u2019re not going to get anyone. I think we all understand there has been a tremendous tragedy no matter which side of this courtroom you\u2019re sitting on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We find no sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">4. <em>Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel when Mr. </em>Jefferson<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>failed to produce testimony from appellant's brother that he, not appellant, was the actual shooter, and again when Ms. </em>Abramson<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>declined to move for a new trial on that basis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention of ineffective representation by his trial counsel, Mr. Jefferson, is based upon matters outside the record on appeal and which, therefore, we may not consider. <em>(Loving &amp; Evans </em>v. <em>Blick </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 603, 613-615 [204 P.2d 23]; <em>Pulver </em>v. <em>Avco Financial Services </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 622, 631-632 [227 Cal.Rptr. 491]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 250, pp. 256-257.) In his petition for habeas corpus appellant makes the identical contention, a contention we consider later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Appellant also contends that other privately retained counsel, Ms. Abramson, ineffectively represented him at the sentencing hearing by failing to make a motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Appellant does not claim that Ms. Abramson, who obtained four continuances, inadequately investigated possible grounds for such a motion. Rather, he states \u201c[f]or reasons not completely clear from the record, Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Abramson declined to make a new trial motion. . . .\u201d  But as our Supreme Court has observed \u201d \u2019In some cases . . . the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged. In such circumstances, unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation, these cases are affirmed on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 888, 916 [254 Cal.Rptr. 508, 765 P.2d 940], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 426 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In fact Ms. Abramson did tell the trial court why she had decided not to make a new trial motion. She stated, \u201cI don\u2019t feel the law is such that a motion for new trial based on incompetency of counsel would lie.\u201d Of course, counsel has no duty \u201cto make motions which simply clutter up the record with no benefit to his individual client.\u201d <em>(In re Lower </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 144, 149, fn. 3 [161 Cal.Rptr. 24].)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Instead Ms. Abramson, in August 1988, filed with the trial court a petition for habeas corpus. The petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">We find appellant\u2019s contention without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">5. <em>The trial court was under a sua sponte duty to order either a new trial or further factual hearings once it learned of Xavier\u2019s confession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Appellant argues that when Ms. Abramson informed the court that appellant\u2019s brother, Xavier Sanders, had confessed to shooting the victim, the court on its own motion should have ordered a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Penal Code section 1181 does not confer such authority upon the trial court. It provides that \u201c[w]hen a verdict has been rendered or a finding made against the defendant, the court may, upon <em>his </em>application, grant a new trial. . . .\u201d Thus, appellant not having made a motion for new trial, the court was without authority to grant one. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rothrock </em>(1936) 8 Cal.2d 21, 24 [63 P.2d 807]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 513, 520 [142 Cal.Rptr. 218]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 129, 135 [88 Cal.Rptr. 753].)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Alternatively, appellant urges that the trial court \u201cat the very least [should have] order[ed] an evidentiary hearing in support of a <em>sua sponte </em>new trial motion.\u201d But holding an evidentiary hearing would not have supplied authority absent before the hearing. No purpose would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>served by such a hearing, and appellant fails to cite any authority in support of it. Moreover, the trial court having no reason to doubt that appellant was being competently represented by experienced counsel, Ms. Abramson, it would have been officious and inappropriate for the court to have abandoned its impartial function in favor of an adversary one.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The Habeas Corpus Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In his habeas corpus petition appellant summarizes his denial-of-effective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim as follows: \u201cPrior to commencement of Petitioner\u2019s second trial[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] on the murder charge for which he is now incarcerated, his trial counsel, Phillip Jefferson, was repeatedly told by Petitioner\u2019s mother, Regina Sanders, and by Petitioner himself, that Petitioner\u2019s brother, Xavier Sanders, not Petitioner, fired the shot that resulted in the death of the victim. Mr. Jefferson also knew or should have known that contained in the police reports in his possession were early statements from some of the eyewitnesses identifying Xavier Sanders, by his nickname \u2018Zuba,\u2019 as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u201cMr. Jefferson failed to investigate or exploit the issue of Xavier\u2019s guilt, refused to interview Xavier, and refused to call Xavier to testify at Petitioner\u2019s trial even though he was told by Petitioner\u2019s mother that Xavier was willing to testify truthfully to his own culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u201cXavier Sanders at all times before and during Petitioner\u2019s trial was ready, willing and able to testify that he was the perpetrator of the acts resulting in the death of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u201cPetitioner contends that counsel\u2019s failings herein were not for any strategic or tactical reasons, but were because of inadvertance or ineffectiveness. These actions individually and cumulatively resulted in withdrawing a potentially meritorious defense that went to the very heart of the prosecution\u2019s case and prejudiced Petitioner in that it is reasonably probable that a more favorable result would have occurred but for counsel\u2019s failings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">After consolidating appellant\u2019s appeal and habeas corpus petition we issued an order of reference to the Los Angeles County Superior Court for the purpose of taking evidence and making findings of fact relative to appellant\u2019s allegations of counsel incompetency. The reference hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>assigned to Superior Court Judge Madge S. Watai. Judge Watai had presided over the second trial and thereafter had received, considered, and ruled upon appellant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus and/or <em>coram nobis. </em>She appointed Attorney Rowan Klein to represent appellant at the evidentiary hearing. At appellant\u2019s request Judge Watai also appointed an investigator and an expert witness, Attorney Paul Fitzgerald, to assist Mr. Klein.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The reference hearing was held on October 27, 1989. Six witnesses testified: Xavier Sanders, who was represented by counsel; Mark Bledstein, appellant\u2019s attorney at the first trial; Leslie Abramson, appellant\u2019s attorney at the sentencing hearing; Regina Sanders, appellant\u2019s mother; Edward J. Sanchez, appellant\u2019s investigator; and Paul Fitzgerald, an attorney and expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Xavier Sanders testified that he, appellant, and Kelvin Sanders drove his sister\u2019s BMW to the Gregory home and that he took the rifle out of the car trunk. When asked questions about what he then did he refused to answer, asserting his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Mark Bledstein testified that before the first trial Xavier Sanders told him that he had fired the rifle which killed Norman Gregory.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">As Judge Watai summarized it, Leslie Abramson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">\u201cAttorney Leslie Abramson was retained by the Sanders family to represent Petitioner in his quest for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">\u201cTestified that file received from attorney Philip Jefferson consisted of preliminary hearing transcript and police reports only. There were no investigator\u2019s report or notes.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">\u201cThat in response to her inquiry, Philip Jefferson stated that he did not need transcript from first trial because he could use the police reports to impeach the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">\u201cIn response to her inquiry, Mr. Jefferson stated that he was aware that Xavier Sanders said that he shot Norman Gregory, but that he did not use Xavier because he felt that he could prove that Xavier was the shooter by using the police reports containing statements of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">\u201cThat he, Jefferson, felt that he was representing the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-14\">\u201cThat she, Leslie Abramson, witnessed Xavier Sanders sign and acknowledge his declaration attached to the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Appellant\u2019s mother, Regina Sanders, testified that Mr. Jefferson refused to speak to Xavier Sanders and when Xavier appeared at the trial courtroom told him to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Edward Sanchez authenticated two exhibits, a tape of a recorded interview of Xavier Sanders by Rowan Klein, and the transcript of that recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Paul Fitzgerald, as described by Judge Watai, testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u201cThat Philip Jefferson should have filed a formal discovery motion;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u201cThat Jefferson should have obtained a transcript of the first trial for impeachment purposes and for evidentiary information;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u201cThat Jefferson should have hired a private investigator to interview witnesses and identify witnesses;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\u201cThat he should have had an expert on ballistics, expert on eyewitness identification and a forensic pathologist;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\u201cThat he should not have used defense of \u2018shot from inside the house\u2019 because it turned out to be not a viable defense when prosecution rebutted with an expert;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">\u201cThat Jefferson should have used defense of mistaken identification;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">\u201cThat Xavier Sanders should have been called to testify and upon his exercise of his right against self-incrimination, his statements to others would be admissible as a declaration against penal interest;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">\u201cThat in his opinion, there is a likelihood that a result more favorable to Sheldon would have followed if above action had occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">\n<em>Standard of review: denial of effective assistance of counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">A claim of denial of effective assistance of counsel has two components. \u201cFirst, [appellant] must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; specifically, he must establish that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms. Second, he must establish prejudice. He must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result would have been different.

His declaration that he shot at the car and then shot in the air would not be against his penal interest.

For example, it states trial counsel Philip Jefferson \u201chad left the state,\u201d an assertion without basis in the record. It describes Mr. Jefferson\u2019s state bar status, an irrelevancy,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> again without evidentiary support in the record. It omits the inculpatory colloquy between the victim and his murderer. It creates the impression that eyewitness Darryl Anderson, when first interviewed by the police, said the shooter was \u201cZuba\u201d (i.e., Xavier), when in fact he identified the shooter as \u201cKake,\u201d appellant. It states as a fact that the person who best knew both appellant and his brother Xavier, Raynetta Sanders, \u201coriginally told the police the shooter was Xavier not the petitioner.\u201d This is a \u201cfact\u201d which the dissent creates in violation of all appellate standards of review. Ms. Sanders testified that <em>appellant </em>was the shooter and that she told the Compton police officer that appellant was the shooter. The dissent utterly censors her testimony and instead transforms into \u201cfact\u201d the contrary testimony of an officer who chased the crying and hysterical Ms. Sanders for a block, immediately after she saw her brother shot and dying from a four-inch hole in his head, who interviewed her for three to five minutes, claimed to have taken but destroyed handwritten notes, and to have <em>obtained from Ms. Sanders </em>the full, accurate license number of the BMW getaway car, although his department\u2019s files contained a computer printout with that license number!</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>It omits that Ms. Sanders not only positively identified appellant as the shooter but described how he was dressed, down to his white Fila boatmoc shoes. It omits that she was equally detailed in describing Xavier, who remained in the BMW on the passenger side wearing a beige button-down-the-front shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The dissent also omits from its retelling Terrell Gregory\u2019s testimony that about 25 minutes before the shooting he overheard one of Kelvin\u2019s phone conversations to Raynetta and heard appellant, also on the phone with Kelvin, say: \u201cI\u2019ll get you back. I\u2019m going to get revenge. It\u2019s not over.\u201d And he then heard Kelvin yell: \u201cKake [appellant] get off the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">It includes that eyewitness William Thomas told the police the shooter was \u201cKake\u201d (appellant) but omits his corroborative description of appellant, 5 feet 7 to 8 inches tall and weighing between 100-125 pounds (Xavier, as described by Ms. Sanders, was 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed about 180 pounds). It includes that William Thomas later told the police \u201che was not sure\u201d but omits his testimony that, in fact, he <em>was </em>sure and only told the police he wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t want to get involved. It includes the half-truth that expert witness Mr. Fitzgerald at first testified there was no plausible explanation for not offering \u201cXavier\u2019s confession\u201d and omits the full truth that he then testified it <em>\u201cwould </em>be a reasonable tactical decision not to present that evidence\u201d if the defense attorney had determined it was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\n<em>Failure to Secure Transcript of First Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">One of the legs supporting the dissent\u2019s conclusion of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is that \u201cJefferson (trial counsel) failed to secure a transcript of the first trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The impression given by the wording of this claim is that the first trial transcript was just sitting around someplace, like on the desk of Mr. Bled-stein, appellant\u2019s lawyer at the first trial, and that Mr. Jefferson was too lazy, or too indifferent, or too incompetent to even ask for it. Of course, as the dissent fails to state, Mr. Jefferson didn\u2019t \u201csecure a transcript of the first trial\u201d because there was no transcript to secure. It hadn\u2019t been prepared and didn\u2019t exist.  Mr. Jefferson would have had to privately order one from the court reporter, or request the trial judge to do so, which request may well have been denied.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The dissent totally ignores even the existence of this decision, whether or not to privately order the transcript of the first trial. Known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>every experienced criminal defense attorney, if not to the dissent, are the delicate advantages and disadvantages of such an order. First, there is the expense, hundreds if not thousands of dollars, depending upon its length, borne by the client, or in this case by his family. Second, there is delay. Reporters spend their days in court, reporting ongoing trials, and have only evenings and weekends to dictate for transcription already concluded trials. All reporters are backlogged. Months of delay are common. Third, ordering a transcript for the defense means a copy will be available for the prosecution. Fourth, such an order risks alerting and arousing the prosecution from what might otherwise be bureaucratic \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d case handling. Fifth, an assessment of need. Here there was little or none. The first trial was brief, lasting only three or four days, and appellant, other family members, and Mr. Bledstein were all percipient observers available to brief Mr. Jefferson. Additionally, Mr. Jefferson had all the police reports and witness statements plus the transcript of the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The record is bereft of reason to question Mr. Jefferson\u2019s decision not to order a transcript of the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The dissent, knowing it must identify <em>prejudice, </em>not merely dereliction, strains to find some. First it looks to trial inconsistency and states: \u201cThus he (Mr. Jefferson) could not take advantage of inconsistent statements between the testimony of the five eyewitnesses at the first trial and their testimony at the second trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">What inconsistent statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Since a transcript of the first trial was later prepared and introduced at the evidentiary hearing, (as was, of course, one of the second trial) and studied by appellant\u2019s third attorney, privately retained criminal defense specialist, Ms. Leslie Abramson, fourth attorney, criminal defense specialist Mr. Rowan Klein, and fifth attorney, defense witness at the evidentiary hearing, Mr. Paul Fitzgerald, it is notable that <em>the dissent fails to specify a single such inconsistent statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Second, still straining to find prejudice, the dissent squints at physical evidence. It states: \u201cNor did the case file reflect Jefferson informed himself about physical evidence used in the first trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">One might more sensibly ask why the 52-page dissent fails to reflect the basis for its assumption that case files of criminal defense attorneys memorialize such information. Or why the dissent fails to reflect what this physical evidence was. Or how not informing himself about it, assuming he did not, had any bearing on the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>This balloon of dissent speculation is punctured by reality. The only physical evidence at the first trial was a set of photographs and an autopsy report. The autopsy report was also an exhibit at the second trial and, as demonstrated by the 33 pages of cross- and recross-examination of its author, Mr. Jefferson was minutely familiar with it. As to the photographs, it would take but a moment to look at them. And as the 1,422-page trial record repeatedly indicates, no prosecution exhibit was admitted, let alone shown to a witness, without Mr. Jefferson\u2019s prior scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Third, in its final effort at discovering prejudice, the dissent states: \u201cA transcript would also have informed Jefferson about the court\u2019s prior rulings, instructions given and the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case through opening and closing statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Of course, the dissent fails to specify a single \u201cprior ruling\u201d that, had Mr. Jefferson known of, would have been helpful. Nor a single instruction. Nor a single theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The transparent triviality of its argument, more befitting a first-year law school student aflush with issue spotting passion, is laid bare by the fact that Judge LaFont presided over the first trial and Judge Watai over the second. Not only are trial rulings without binding effect but when made by a <em>different </em>trial judge fail to provide even predictive assistance. The same, of course, is true of jury instructions. As to becoming informed \u201cof the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case\u201d\u2014just what is the dissent talking about? Was there a question, an alternative, a doubt, a mystery about \u201cthe prosecution theory?\u201d What was the prosecution going to do, claim that appellant <em>poisoned </em>the deceased?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">If the dissent has discovered some other possible \u201cprosecution theory of the case,\u201d it has failed to share its discovery with us.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\n<em>Failure to Hire a Private Investigator, Ballistics Expert, etc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The dissent mentions, although without much enthusiasm, that \u201cJefferson <em>allegedly </em>failed to hire a private investigator to interview witnesses and gather evidence from the scene; failed to hire a ballistic expert; and, failed to familiarize himself with crime scene photos and other physical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">This argument may be expeditiously and mercifully put to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\"> First, as the dissent concedes, the record simply fails to establish that Jefferson failed to hire a private investigator or ballistics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>expert. (As the dissent puts it, \u201cJefferson\u2019s absence made it impossible to discover what he actually did or did not do.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Second, even if no such experts were hired (and, of course, there is no presumptive duty to hire them), the dissent fails to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Third, the record affirmatively demonstrates that Mr. Jefferson had interviewed his witnesses (e.g., this cross-examination of defense witness Calvin Sanders: \u201cQ. Mr. Sanders, before you took the stand yesterday, who did you talk to about your testimony in this case? [fl] A. Mr. Jefferson and my family. [fl] Q. Okay. You went over pretty much what you would say with Mr. Jefferson; is that correct? [fl] A. Yes, sir.\u201d), had investigated prosecution witnesses (e.g., David Gregory\u2019s possible bias against appellant as elicited by this cross-examination of him: \u201cQ. When he [appellant] was at your niece\u2019s birthday party, did you threaten him and make him leave the niece\u2019s birthday party; is that correct? []f] A. Yes.\u201d), and had inspected the scene (among the 24 trial exhibits presented by Mr. Jefferson many were photographs and/or diagrams of the scene).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>Conflict of Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The dissent concludes that Mr. Jefferson was involved in a conflict of interest. The first basis for its conclusion is a snippet from a brief telephone conversation between Mr. Jefferson and appellant\u2019s newly hired lawyer, Ms. Abramson, who was then engaged in trying to prove Mr. Jefferson\u2019s representation of appellant was inadequate and entitled appellant to a new trial. According to Ms. Abramson\u2019s recollection (the dissent fails to mention whether <em>her </em>files reflect any contemporaneous note-taking) Mr. Jefferson said he was representing \u201cthe family.\u201d The other basis, the dissent states, is \u201cXavier\u2019s statement he was shooed away from the courthouse\u201d by Mr. Jefferson.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The dissent evades, apparently intentionally, the possibility Mr. Jefferson might have had a legitimate reason for shooing Xavier away from the courthouse. <em>Intentionally </em>evades because the dissent refers to the prosecution\u2019s question about Xavier\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d being perjurious, a question asked of defense expert Mr. Fitzgerald, but instead of then giving Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s answer to that question it instead summarizes an earlier answer, given <em>before </em>the subject of perjury was broached. Thus, reading from the dissent one is utterly misled into believing the matter was then, and is now, <em>closed. </em>This is the distorted dissent version: \u201cThe prosecution speculated the reason Mr. Jefferson excluded Xavier\u2019s testimony was because it was perjurious, or in the alternative, because Mr. Jefferson anticipated Xavier would take the Fifth Amendment in the second trial as well. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>court-appointed criminal law expert, Mr. Fitzgerald, testified there was no plausible explanation whatever not to offer as evidence the best defense available to one\u2019s client\u2014someone else\u2019s confession to the shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In fact, the matter was not and is not closed. This is the prosecutor\u2019s question and this is Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s answer to that question:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u201cQ. Along those lines, what if he determined that wasn\u2019t true about Xavier and that he was dealing with perjury?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u201cA. Then it would be\u2014that would be a reasonable tactical decision not to present that evidence, and I think the lawyer is duty bound not to present it if he determines that there is a very reasonable likelihood this is perjured testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Having taken its evasive tack, the dissent fails to consider what reasons Mr. Jefferson might have had for telling Xavier to leave the courthouse. For example, if Xavier remained for jurors to casually observe or for the prosecution, noticing him present, to formally identify for the jury, much damage to appellant\u2019s \u201cmistaken identity\u201d defense might have resulted. Although witnesses, such as Ms. Sanders, used <em>words </em>to contrast appellant\u2019s height of 5\u20199\u201d with Xavier\u2019s 6\u20192\u201d, and appellant\u2019s slight 130 pounds with Xavier\u2019s sturdy 180 pounds, the impact of having appellant and Xavier stand before the jury, side by side, could have been devastating.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">This consideration, just one of many, may have prompted Mr. Jefferson\u2019s conduct and is ignored by the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">We postpone for later discussion a consideration of why Mr. Jefferson may have chosen not to call Xavier as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Concerning the other basis, the proposition borders on the absurd. Mr. Jefferson, who, unlike appellant\u2019s first attorney, Mr. Bledstein, never represented Xavier, never received funds from Xavier, never was willing to interview Xavier, and didn\u2019t permit Xavier to observe his brother\u2019s trial was at the same time supposedly representing Xavier\u2019s interest in derogation of appellant\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">The contradictions of this dissent proposition do not end there. Xavier is portrayed by the dissent as always willing and eager to tell the truth and take the consequences. This avowed posture is absolutely congruent with the posture of the rest of the family. The family fired Mr. Bledstein because he didn\u2019t call Xavier and Kelvin Sanders as witnesses at the first trial. The family hired Mr. Jefferson so that Xavier and Kelvin <em>would </em>be called as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>witnesses at the second trial. The family told Mr. Jefferson that Xavier, not appellant, was the shooter and that they wanted the truth brought out at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">There simply was nothing to create a conflict about.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Finally, again omitted by the dissent, in the words of appellant\u2019s expert criminal defense witness, Mr. Fitzgerald, on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u201cQ. And you are not aware of any pressure by the people who retained Mr. Jefferson to exonerate Xavier at the expense of Sheldon or do anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201cA. [Fitzgerald] No. I think I was aware of some pressure to the contrary, or at least I am unclear. But at least certainly there was no pressure to withhold testimony about Xavier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">\u201cQ. To the detriment of Sheldon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">\u201cA. [Fitzgerald] No, right. You\u2019re quite correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">\n<em>Failure to interview Xavier, obtain a statement from him, and call him as a witness.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">The related alleged failings of Mr. Jefferson which the dissent finds \u201cegregious\u201d are his failure to interview Xavier, to obtain a statement from him, and to call him as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">The dissent argues that without interviewing Xavier, Mr. Jefferson\u2019s decision not to call him as a witness could not have been an informed one.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">We disagree. Mr. Jefferson, without interviewing Xavier, knew that Xavier claimed to have done the shooting. In Mrs. Sanders\u2019s declaration she stated, \u201cNumerous times before the second trial, I told Mr. Jefferson the truth about Xavier\u2019s involvement and that we wanted him to put Xavier on the stand.\u201d Further, Ms. Abramson (appellant\u2019s third lawyer) testified that she \u201casked him [Mr. Jefferson] if he knew that Xavier Sanders was the shooter. He said yes, he knew that. He had been told, that is what he said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">Similarly without merit is the belabored point that Mr. Jefferson should have attempted to obtain a written statement from Xavier or, failing that, searched for witnesses who could testify to his declarations against penal interest (i.e., that he had told them he was the shooter).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>There are several observations to make. First, Mr. Jefferson was not the first of appellant\u2019s lawyers not to obtain (or at least to attempt to use) a written statement from Xavier. Mr. Bledstein, a criminal defense specialist for 15 years, the lawyer who defended appellant at his first trial, did not offer any such statement after Xavier asserted his privilege against self-incrimination and became unavailable. Nor did Mr. Bledstein call a witness to testify to Xavier\u2019s declaration against interest. This despite the fact that he had available Xavier\u2019s mother and father both of whom, according to Mrs. Sanders\u2019s declaration, could have so testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">That Mr. Bledstein also chose not to introduce Xavier\u2019s extrajudicial statements suggests neither coincidence nor dereliction but purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Second, there is little doubt Mr. Jefferson could have, and knew he could have, obtained a statement from Xavier. What such a statement might have said and what its value might have been is another matter. To illustrate this dubious matter we briefly compare the three statements Xavier did make: his June 21, 1988, declaration prepared by appellant\u2019s third attorney, Ms. Abramson (No. 1 statement), the transcription of his June 30, 1989, interview by appellant\u2019s fourth attorney, Mr. Rowan Klein (No. 2 statement), and the transcript of his October 27, 1989, abortive testimony at the evidentiary hearing (No. 3 statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">No. 1 statement: \u201cOn my own I had decided to just go to the Gregory home and break the windows out of one of their cars. I intended to do it with a bumper jack. . . . [fl] I opened the trunk to get the bumper jack, saw the gun and decided to shoot out the windows on one of the Gregory cars instead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">No. 2 statement: \u201cThen I got in the car and then him [appellant] and Ke[l]vin jumped in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u201cQ. And before you got in the car, was there any discussion about doing something?</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u201cA. No. There wasn\u2019t none.

If the answer is yes and \u201cthere simply could be <em>no </em>satisfactory explanation\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farmer, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 888, 916) for a failure to do so, and prejudice is shown, then appellant has been denied effective assistance of counsel. But it is appellant\u2019s burden, by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Plager, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d 1537, 1543), to demonstrate this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">Conversely, if there <em>could </em>be a satisfactory explanation for not seeking admittance of Xavier\u2019s statement, then appellant has not met his burden of proof and his petition should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Thus, the only way to answer this fundamental question is to <em>consider </em>whether or not there is a \u201csatisfactory explanation\u201d for not seeking admittance of Xavier\u2019s \u201cstatement.\u201d We now consider such possible explanations.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Abandonment of Alibi</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Xavier\u2019s account pinned appellant to the scene at the time of the murder and obliterated appellant\u2019s alibi. Mr. Jefferson would have had to abandon a complete alibi defense supported by <em>three </em>witnesses: Michael Henderson, Calvin Sanders, and Calvin Sanders, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>Abandonment of Inside-shot Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Xavier\u2019s account eliminated the inside-shot theory, another complete defense. This defense was based upon the victim <em>facing </em>the shooter at the time of the fatal shot (a fact testified to by every percipient prosecution witness) but the victim being shot in <em>back of the neck. </em>It was further supported by the testimony of some witnesses that <em>three </em>shots were fired but only two rifle casings recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">\n<em>Recently Manufactured Evidence Impeachment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">The prosecutor would have called appellant\u2019s <em>first trial </em>alibi witnesses, Mr. Henderson, Mr. Sanders (appellant\u2019s father), and Kelvin Sanders. If in the teeth of Xavier\u2019s story they maintained that appellant was with <em>them </em>and <em>not </em>at the murder scene, then Xavier\u2019s confession is destroyed. So is appellant\u2019s fate. If, on the other hand, they retract their alibi, surely being forced to admit it was unsuccessful at the first trial, they inevitably expose the willingness of appellant\u2019s family to commit perjury for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The unsuccessfulness of the alibi at the first trial, in combination with the inevitable revelation that Xavier did not choose to testify at the first trial, creates the damning odor of recently manufactured evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\n<em>Generation of Absolute-Identification Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Xavier being absent from the second trial, the eyewitness merely identified appellant as the shooter. With Xavier present and testifying <em>he </em>was the shooter, there would have been a drum beat parade with every eyewitness positively identifying appellant and positively eliminating Xavier as the shooter. All the initial semantic confusion of \u201cZuba\u201d and \u201cKake,\u201d significant impeachment at the second trial, would disappear like a pulf of smoke in a tornado.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\n<em>The Dogs That Did Not Bark</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">To offer Xavier\u2019s \u201cI was with appellant and Kelvin when / did the shooting\u201d version is to irresistibly cause jurors to ask themselves: why isn\u2019t Kelvin testifying to this? Why didn\u2019t Kelvin testify to this at the first trial? And, jury instructions notwithstanding, why isn\u2019t appellant testifying to his own innocence if Xavier is telling the truth?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\n<em>Xavier\u2019s \u201cConfession\u201d Is Not Credible Because It Is Not Inculpatory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">If you know your confession <em>can </em>convict you it is, for that reason, against your penal interest and credible. If you know your confession <em>cannot </em>convict you it is, for that reason, not against your penal interest and not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">For example, if on January 1, 1990, Charlie Fessup was in New York with a bishop, a rabbi, and a minister, all televised in an all-day prayer session, his confession to a January 1, 1990, noontime stabbing in Los Angeles is not against his penal interest and is not credible. Charlie Fessup <em>knows </em>his confession cannot convict him because contrary evidence refutes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">For the same reason, Xavier\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d was not against his penal interest and was not credible because he knew\u2014and the jury would be so informed\u2014that it could never result in his conviction. He had available five eyewitnesses who had twice testified that he was innocent and that appellant was guilty. Further, he had a trump card: retraction. \u201cI was only trying to help my little brother\u201d\u2014who could fail to understand and believe him?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Thus, another\u2019s confession, always triumphant on Perry Mason, had bleak prospects for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">\n<em>Xavier Guilty and Appellant Guilty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Not only would Xavier\u2019s version destroy all of appellant\u2019s other defenses, but even if believed it might still result in appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">If the jury believed that Xavier fired the fatal shot but that appellant abetted him to do so, then appellant will be convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">There is substantial evidence that could constitute such abetting: appellant and the victim did not get along; the victim punched appellant without provocation; appellant tried to run his car over the victim; when he was unsuccessful appellant said, <em>\u201cWe\u2019ll </em>be back. <em>We\u2019re </em>going to get you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>motherfuckers\u201d; appellant, over the phone, about 25 minutes before the shooting said, \u201cI\u2019ll get you back. I\u2019m going to get revenge. It\u2019s not over\u201d; appellant promptly returned to the scene with his two brothers; the victim was shot to death. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>Xavier\u2019s Confession Is Inconsistent With the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Xavier, in his various statements, asserted he got out of the car, walked to the rear, opened the trunk, and removed the rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Every witness who saw the driver exit testified he did so <em>carrying </em>a gun. No witness testified the driver went to the trunk, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Xavier stated he walked towards the driveway, shot a car window, shot in the general direction of the house, and left. According to Xavier\u2019s version he was mute. He never even saw let alone talked to anyone in the Gregory doorway.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Multiple witnesses described the driver as walking towards the driveway and saying such things as: \u201cCome out now motherfuckers. Come out now.\u201d Or: \u201cWhere are all you guys <em>now. </em>I\u2019ll kill you motherfuckers.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\n<em>A Duty Not to Introduce Perjured Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Mr. Jefferson, who had the benefit of confidentially interviewing appellant, and certainly of talking to Kelvin Sanders, not only decided to call neither as a witness but may have determined that Xavier\u2019s account was false. Having so determined, as Mr. Fitzgerald testified, he was \u201cduty bound not to present it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">As the United States Supreme Court has recently stated, \u201cthe right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned perjury. A lawyer who would so cooperate would be at risk of prosecution for suborning perjury. . . .\u201d <em>(Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 157, 173 [89 L.Ed.2d 123, 139, 106 S.Ct. 988].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">Considering these nine explanations, we conclude that appellant has not met his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">More importantly, after extraordinary care to hear and weigh every error claimed by petitioner, we are satisfied that justice has been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b300-16\">The petition is denied and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">Lillie, P.

This is not one of the typical cases where the issue on appeal is whether a guilty man should be let free because he was convicted through illegally obtained evidence. Nor is it a case where the error asserted on appeal would only serve to reduce the prosecution\u2019s evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt to something less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. No, this is one of those rather rare cases where if the alleged error was committed it goes to the core issue of the defendant\u2019s <em>innocence </em>of the crime for which he was convicted. Innocence, not just in the sense the prosecution failed to prove him guilty. But innocence in the full sense of the term\u2014he did not commit that crime, someone else did.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">I am not certain the full flavor of this case is captured in the majority\u2019s statement of facts. Following what I acknowledge are accepted and appropriate standards, the majority tells the story of the murder with the appellant unequivocally cast in the role of the murderer. In this unusual case, however, I do think it important to retell the story in a somewhat different fashion, incorporating some of the defense evidence as well as the People\u2019s evidence in the chronology. This will make it easier to evaluate whether petitioner\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance and, if so, whether that ineffective assistance prejudiced appellant\u2019s opportunity for a different outcome in this second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On the morning of July 11, 1985, Kelvin Sanders was at the home of his estranged wife, Raynetta (Gregory) Sanders. At approximately 10 a.m., petitioner, Kelvin\u2019s brother, arrived to pick up Kelvin. Petitioner drove a burgundy BMW which belonged to his sister Sheree but which Xavier, another brother, often drove.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">As Kelvin and petitioner prepared to leave in the BMW, two of Raynetta\u2019s younger brothers, Norman and David Gregory, both beat petitioner with their fists without apparent provocation. Petitioner then drove the BMW in a way allegedly designed to hit Norman and David, although it did not. Norman and David picked up some rocks, threw them at the car and cracked the windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">A few minutes later, another Sanders brother, Calvin, Jr., came to the Gregory house to pick up Kelvin. Upon learning petitioner had already picked up Kelvin, Calvin, Jr., left.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Shortly thereafter, Raynetta received two telephone calls in quick succession from Kelvin, each lasting a few minutes. Apparently at his suggestion, she dressed her children and went next door. Raynetta estimated one-half hour passed from the time petitioner left the Gregory residence and the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>she went next door. Approximately 20 minutes later Raynetta heard a loud \u201cbang\u201d outside and ran out of her neighbor\u2019s house and into the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">From within the Gregory house, Norman, David and Terrell Gregory, along with their friends, William Thomas and Darryl Anderson, ran to the front door. All five of them crowded around the doorway. The wooden front door was open and they looked out through a door composed of heavy iron mesh screen and thick steel bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In the street outside the Gregory house they saw someone with a rifle. The witnesses in the doorway differed whether the man fired two or three shots. But they agreed the shot fired at the house hit one of them, Norman Gregory. Norman died a few days later as a result of that gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">When interviewed by the police two of the four survivors who had watched through the screen door\u2014Terrell Gregory and Darryl Anderson\u2014 identified the man holding the rifle as \u201cZuba,\u201d a nickname for petitioner\u2019s brother, Xavier. Another, David Gregory, testified at the preliminary hearing he wasn\u2019t sure whether he saw Xavier. The fourth, William Thomas, first told the police the shooter was \u201cKake,\u201d a nickname for petitioner, but later told police he was not sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Meantime, Raynetta Sanders had an unobstructed view of the shooter from the street outside her neighbor\u2019s property and was sister-in-law to both petitioner and Xavier, so presumably knew them best. Ms. Sanders also originally told the police the shooter was Xavier, not the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Thus, three of the five eyewitnesses, including the one with the best view and knowledge of the Sanders brothers, identified Xavier, not petitioner, as the man with the rifle who fired the shot that killed Norman Gregory. A fourth first said it was petitioner then said he was not sure, and the fifth was not sure who it was. (By the time of trial, however, all five of these witnesses had changed their stories and identified petitioner as the shooter.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Petitioner was arrested at his parents\u2019 home on July 12, 1985. Xavier retained Attorney Mark Bledstein to represent Xavier on the matter of turning himself in to the police. Although told by both Xavier and Kelvin Sanders that Xavier, not petitioner, had fired the fatal shot, Bledstein advised Xavier to assert his Fifth Amendment rights and make no statement to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">After Xavier\u2019s release from custody, Bledstein assumed representation of petitioner. While in custody on another matter, Xavier was subpoenaed to petitioner\u2019s first trial. Xavier indicated his willingness to testify truthfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>but upon advice of counsel instead asserted his Fifth Amendment rights and was not allowed to testify. The first trial resulted in a hung jury and a mistrial was declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Petitioner\u2019s parents then retained Attorney Philip Jefferson to represent petitioner at the second trial. Prior to this trial, Regina Sanders, petitioner\u2019s mother, told Jefferson that Xavier, not petitioner, was responsible for the shooting. Xavier himself came to Jefferson\u2019s office prepared to explain the details of his responsibility for the shooting but the lawyer refused to talk to him. Later Xavier actually came to the courtroom during petitioner\u2019s second trial prepared to testify he had fired the fatal shot but Jefferson instructed him to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The jury never had the opportunity to hear Xavier\u2019s testimony he was the shooter <em>or </em>any of his several out-of-court declarations admitting this fact. In the absence of that evidence, the jurors convicted petitioner of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The Sanders family then retained Attorney Leslie Abramson to review the record for a possible statutory motion for a new trial based on incompetence of counsel. Abramson determined Jefferson had failed to do many significant things a conscientious defense attorney would have done. Nonetheless, she concluded a statutory motion would not lie based solely on the record. Abramson instead opted to file a petition for habeas corpus based on Jefferson\u2019s failure to present evidence of Xavier\u2019s confession as the shooter. However, Abramson stated to the referee, \u201cBased on knowing these three [Sanders brothers], the information that I got from Xavier and my own conversations with my client, I firmly believe that Xavier Sanders, who has a prior record, including possession of a weapon, is the brother who did this shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The trial court (also the referee in the later habeas corpus hearing which is the subject of this opinion) then sentenced petitioner to 17 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The petition for habeas corpus was filed based on two independent grounds\u2014ineffective assistance of counsel at the second trial and newly discovered evidence. The petition was accompanied by Xavier\u2019s declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, he was the shooter, as well as petitioner\u2019s mother\u2019s declaration Xavier confessed to her he was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">After petitioner\u2019s appeal and petition were consolidated, this court issued an order of reference for an evidentiary hearing before the referee. The referee appointed Rowan Klein to represent petitioner; a private investigator to assist Klein; and a criminal law expert witness, Mr. Fitzgerald. Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>witnesses at the hearing included Xavier Sanders, who was represented by counsel; Mark Bledstein, petitioner\u2019s counsel at the first trial; Leslie Abram-son, petitioner\u2019s attorney at the sentencing hearing, and Regina Sanders, the mother of both petitioner and Xavier.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Most significantly Philip Jefferson, the trial counsel whose acts and omissions were in dispute, was unavailable for this habeas corpus hearing. He had left the state after accepting inactive status when the State Bar recommended him for disbarment due to a 10-year pattern of misconduct as an attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Before the evidentiary hearing, the lawyer, Rowan Klein, and the investigator interviewed Xavier. In this taped conversation, Xavier again admitted he fired the rifle. Then once again during Xavier\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing, he relayed most of the information found in these interviews, statements and declarations but when asked if he fired the gun, he refused to answer asserting his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">After reading the declarations and hearing the testimony at the hearing, the referee made the findings related in the majority opinion and denied the habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">I. Standard of Review of Ineffective-assistance-of-counsel Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The standards for measuring competency of counsel were enunciated by our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1]. The court instructed that defense counsel in a criminal case \u201cmust perform certain basic duties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424.) Among them are a duty of \u201c \u2018diligence and active participation in the full and effective preparation of his client\u2019s case\u2019 . . .\u201d and a \u201c \u2018 \u201cduty to investigate carefully all defenses of fact and of law that may be available to the defendant . . . <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 424-425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The duty to investigate was further elaborated on in <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587]. In commenting on defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate an otherwise obvious diminished capacity defense the court stated, \u201cBy his inaction, deliberate or otherwise, counsel deprived himself of the reasonable bases upon which to reach <em>informed </em>tactical and strategic trial decisions. . . . [1j] . . . [E]ven tactical decisions may demonstrate incompetence if made without the benefit of \u2018substantial factual inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 163, original italics.) The court went on to explain: \u201c \u2018Although counsel\u2019s decision not to raise the defense . . . was made for \u201ctactical\u201d and \u201cstrategic\u201d reasons sufficient in counsel\u2019s judgment to support it, in the circumstances of this case the failure of counsel to avail himself of information relevant to the defense removed all rational support from that decision. ... By failing to make any effort at all to follow the lead afforded by information in his possession counsel precluded himself from making a rational decision on the question . . . . [1J] Moreover, the possible defense so withheld must be termed a \u201ccrucial\u201d one\u2014 <em>especially in view of the insubstantiality of the defense actually offered. </em>[Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 162-163, original italics, citing <em>In re Saunders </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1033, 1048-1049 [88 Cal.Rptr. 633, 472 P.2d 921], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Later in <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaw </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 535 [198 Cal.Rptr. 788, 674 P.2d 759], the Supreme Court stated, \u201c \u2018defendant is denied the effective assistance of counsel if, by reason of counsel\u2019s failure to perform the obligations imposed upon him, defendant is deprived of an <em>adjudication </em>of a crucial or potentially meritorious defense.\u2019 ... \u2018A crucial defense is not one which, if presented, \u201cwould result inexorably in a defendant\u2019s acquittal.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 541, original italics, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 425, fn. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">II. Standard of Review of Referee\u2019s Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u201cAlthough the referee\u2019s findings of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are entitled to great weight, [a reviewing court] may reach an independent conclusion after [a] review of the record. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shaw, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 541.) In this case, as will be explained in detail in succeeding sections, the referee\u2019s findings are seriously flawed in several respects. Because Mr. Jefferson was not present at the evidentiary hearing he was not available to offer any explanations whatever as to his acts or omissions. According to a private investigator\u2019s declaration, Mr. Jefferson promptly left the jurisdiction after accepting inactive status when the State Bar recommended disbarment for a 10-year pattern of misconduct. As a result of his absence, most of the testimony concerning Mr. Jefferson\u2019s effectiveness was pure speculation. Most unfortunately, the trial court acting as referee itself indulged in speculation in finding Xavier would have taken the Fifth Amendment at the second trial and been considered unavailable. This is pure supposition, especially in view of the fact Xavier voluntarily showed up at the second trial prepared to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">III. Petitioner\u2019s Trial Counsel Failed to Provide Effective Assistance of Counsel in Several Respects During the Second Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Mr. Jefferson is charged with failing to properly prepare for trial in many different and significant respects with varying effects on the outcome of the trial. For example, Jefferson failed to secure a transcript of the first trial. Thus he could not take advantage of inconsistent statements between the testimony of the five eyewitnesses at the first trial and their testimony at the second trial. This despite the critical nature of the eyewitness testimony and the fact the pretrial identifications had been so shaky. Nor did the case file reflect Jefferson informed himself about physical evidence used in the first trial. A transcript would also have informed Jefferson about the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>prior rulings, instructions given, and the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case through opening and closing statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Jefferson also allegedly failed to hire a private investigator to interview witnesses and gather evidence from the scene; failed to hire a ballistics expert; and failed to familiarize himself with crime scene photos and other physical evidence. These issues could not be fully resolved at the evidentiary hearing as Jefferson\u2019s absence made it impossible to discover what he actually did or did not do. However, in response I note the record shows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>expert witness testified, without objection or contradiction, that his review of the files indicated Jefferson failed to hire an investigator. This same expert likewise testified this failure was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The most egregious omissions, however, revolve around Jefferson\u2019s failure to properly investigate and make proper use of Xavier Sanders\u2019s admission it was he, rather than petitioner, who fired the fatal shot. As a consequence, his decision not to call Xavier as a witness at the second trial was not an informed decision. Xavier\u2019s mother told Jefferson Xavier had confessed to her it was he, not petitioner, who fired the fatal shot. Yet Jefferson did nothing affirmative to follow up on that lead. Then when Xavier himself came to Jefferson\u2019s office, the lawyer told Xavier he did not want to hear anything he had to say.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Most significantly, he made no effort to obtain a signed statement from Xavier to the effect he was the shooter. That alone represented ineffective assistance of counsel since any reasonably competent lawyer would have sought to obtain a witness statement of some sort from a person who said it was he rather than the lawyer\u2019s client who committed the crime. Such a statement could be used either in connection with the witness\u2019s testimony at trial or in lieu of that testimony should the witness invoke the Fifth Amendment. As further evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel, when Xavier appeared in court during the second trial claiming he was ready to testify truthfully, Jefferson ordered him to leave. Xavier was left with the impression Jefferson wanted to protect Xavier from potential criminal liability in the event the district attorney discovered his presence and ordered him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Mr. Jefferson was not available at the evidentiary hearing to explain why he failed to use the one witness who could most help his client or why he failed to obtain or attempt to obtain a written or taped statement from this witness. The prosecution speculated the reason Mr. Jefferson excluded Xavier\u2019s testimony was because it was perjurious, or, in the alternative, because Mr. Jefferson anticipated Xavier would take the Fifth Amendment in the second trial as well. The court-appointed criminal law expert, Mr. Fitzgerald, testified there was no plausible explanation whatever not to offer as evidence the best defense available to one\u2019s client\u2014someone else\u2019s confession to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The evidentiary hearing was ordered for the purpose of resolving the issue of Jefferson\u2019s motives and decision making processes in deciding not to use Xavier\u2019s confession as a defense. This the hearing could not do because Jefferson was not present. Nonetheless, the hearing did establish Jefferson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in at least four different ways in his handling of Xavier Sanders\u2019s possible testimony it was he rather than petitioner who fired the fatal shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">First, Jefferson failed to fulfill his duty to investigate the defense Xavier rather than his client was the shooter. According to the evidence in this record Jefferson did not interview Xavier about his statement to his mother that he fired the shot. He did not probe Xavier about his sincerity in offering to testify at the second trial that he, not his brother, had fired the shot. And, he made no effort to find out if Xavier had confessed these same facts to other people whose testimony might be used at trial in the event Xavier ultimately decided to invoke the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, whatever decision Jefferson was to make about calling Xavier as a witness was not an informed decision as required by case law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 222 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaw, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 541-542; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 162-163.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Second, Jefferson failed to do what any competent lawyer would do when a witness indicates directly or indirectly that he and not the lawyer\u2019s client is guilty. He did not even attempt to obtain a statement from Xavier confirming what Xavier represented he was willing to say about his guilt and petitioner\u2019s innocence. Had he done so he may very well have obtained a confession similar to the written declaration accompanying the habeas corpus petition or the taped interview Xavier voluntarily gave to the lawyer the court appointed to investigate this matter in connection with the habeas corpus hearing. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaw, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 541-542 [defendant deprived of effective counsel when attorney failed to investigate and call witnesses to corroborate alibi defense]; <em>In re Hall </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 408, 427-429 [179 Cal.Rptr. 223, 637 P.2d 690] [defendant denied effective counsel when attorney failed to investigate information indicating killer was another person and failing to investigate and call witnesses to corroborate alibi].) (The incriminating contents of these posttrial statements are discussed at pp. 394-399, <em>post.) </em>This would have given Jefferson powerful evidence of petitioner\u2019s innocence which could have been introduced as a declaration against interest even if Xavier ultimately elected to invoke the Fifth Amendment at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Third, Jefferson failed to even attempt to use the defense. The expert\u2019s conclusion there could be no strategic or tactical reason not to use an available and extremely powerful defense in a client\u2019s case seems obvious. The job of a defense counsel is presumably to defend, and Xavier\u2019s testimony (or his declaration, if necessary) he was the shooter, was the best defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>available to petitioner in this case. Indeed, this may have been petitioner\u2019s only viable defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defenses used in the second trial were mistaken identification; shot from inside the house by someone else; and alibi. The alibi witnesses simply were not credible. All three\u2014father, Calvin, Sr., brother Calvin, Jr., and friend, Mr. Henderson\u2014had an extraordinarily poor sense of time. In addition, much of the testimony was contradictory as to how they spent their morning hours together the day of the shooting. The \u201cshot from inside the house\u201d defense was even less effective. With demonstrations on trajectory and proof on the absence of gun powder or stipling inside the house, the state\u2019s ballistics experts destroyed any potential credibility in that defense. In fact, these two defenses were so embarrassingly weak it is understandable the jury was unconvinced of petitioner\u2019s innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The \u201cmistaken identification\u201d defense had merit, but according to the expert Fitzgerald, it is rarely a successful defense when the accused has a motive. It would have been a viable, and in all probability a successful, defense if Xavier\u2019s admission he was the shooter had come before the jury either out of his own mouth or out of the mouths of others he had confessed to. Accordingly, Jefferson\u2019s failure to call Xavier as a witness to give the \u201cmistaken identification\u201d defense the most powerful possible support is yet another independent ground for finding he rendered petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">There is still a fourth independent ground for finding Jefferson rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. When asked by Abramson why Jefferson did not want to use Xavier as a witness, Jefferson replied he did not want to get Xavier involved. When challenged as to whether he was representing someone other than just petitioner, Jefferson replied \u201cWell, I felt I was representing the family.\u201d This statement together with Xavier\u2019s statement he was \u201cshooed away\u201d from the courthouse when he voluntarily showed up to testify, is very troublesome. They provide strong evidence Jefferson was involved in a conflict of interest. He was attempting to protect everyone in the family while not being a zealous advocate for the one member of this family who was his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">This alone is enough of a showing to justify a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>(Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 475, 489-490 [55 L.Ed.ld 426, 438, 98 S.Ct. 1173] [\u201cJoint representation of conflicting interests is suspect because of what it tends to prevent the attorney from doing.\u201d]; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 60 [86 L.Ed. 680, 62 S.Ct. 457].) Here Jefferson\u2019s apparent perception he was representing the \u201cwhole family\u201d not just petitioner prevented him from risking Xavier\u2019s freedom by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>calling Xavier to the stand in order to protect Jefferson\u2019s only true client from a criminal conviction. A lawyer whose judgment is clouded by conflict and thus gives up even a possible defense is not giving his client effective assistance of counsel. Jefferson went further, however, by giving up perhaps the most powerful of defenses\u2014\u201cIt was me, not the defendant, who did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The majority adds yet a different speculation to explain Jefferson\u2019s inaction on Xavier\u2019s admissions of guilt. They conjecture the reason Jefferson did not investigate Xavier\u2019s admission of guilt nor attempt to obtain signed or taped statements of this admission nor call him as a witness was because he \u201cknew\u201d Xavier was lying. \u201cKnowing\u201d this and possessed of high ethical standards Jefferson refused to use Xavier\u2019s admission because as a lawyer he is not to use perjurious testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Of course, once again this is mere speculation. Jefferson was not present to testify about his supposed knowledge this was perjurious testimony and his supposed ethical inhibitions against using perjured testimony because he had left the state after being found guilty of a 10-year pattern of misconduct as a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">This speculation is one of several additional factual \u201cfindings\u201d the majority makes about Jefferson\u2019s state of mind beyond the factual findings the trial court made. These additional \u201cfindings\u201d are controverted by Jefferson\u2019s performance as a lawyer. On April 20, 1990, Jefferson was \u201cdisbarred from the practice of law in California by order of the Supreme Court of California.\u201d (See appendix to dissent, letter from Charlotte Blackford, Cal. State Bar, dated June 12, 1990.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This disbarment is based on findings and recommendations of the State Bar Court which inter alia found: \u201c[Jefferson] has pursued a <em>course of conduct </em>demonstrating a complete indifference to his legal and ethical duties, to the great detriment of his clients.\u201d (See appendix to dissent, <em>In the Matter of: Philip Jefferson, </em>case 83-0-11184, State Bar Court, Mar. 5, 1989, <em>post </em>at p. 424, italics added.) The State Bar Court findings of a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d are based, in turn, on specific instances of \u201ccomplete indifference\u201d and \u201cgreat detriment\u201d to clients stretching from 1979 through at least 1987. In most of these specific instances Jefferson was retained by clients and then did nothing to investigate their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">This evidence of Jefferson\u2019s pattern of past misconduct is relevant and admissible to refute the majority\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d on several grounds. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>these prior acts of misconduct are admissible to attack Jefferson\u2019s credibility as an out-of-court declarant (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210; 3 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Introduction of Evidence at Trial, \u00a7 1998; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1081 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619] [holding Prop. 8 repealed Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 786-790].)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Secondly, Jefferson\u2019s disciplinary record is admissible<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and highly probative on the issues of motive, knowledge, and intent which form the core of the majority\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d about what and why Jefferson failed to investigate Xavier\u2019s statements admitting guilt and exonerating petitioner. Here the majority \u201cfinds\u201d Jefferson\u2019s intent and motive in not investigating or using this exculpatory evidence was his desire to avoid presenting what he \u201cknew\u201d to be perjurious testimony. However, his disciplinary record documents a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d wholly inconsistent with this finding about Jefferson\u2019s knowledge, intent and motives. Instead this \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d reveals a lawyer motivated by laziness and indifference to clients whose intent was to do as little as possible in each case. This laziness and indifference is a more likely explanation for Jefferson\u2019s failure to investigate and use Xavier\u2019s confession than is any notion Xavier\u2019s confession was false, Jefferson had investigated and found out it was false, and was too ethical to use perjured testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Jefferson\u2019s disciplinary record and the State Bar Court findings also belie any of the majority\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d that his several failures\u2014the failure to obtain a transcript of the first trial, his failure to conduct tests or use expert witnesses, as well as his failure to investigate and use Xavier\u2019s confessions\u2014 were based on calculated tactical choices. To find this lawyer made such decisions with the intent of maximizing his client\u2019s tactical position is wholly inconsistent with the intent and motives manifest in the specific acts, the \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d and findings documented in the State Bar\u2019s disciplinary record appended to this dissent. There is every reason to believe Jefferson failed to properly investigate and prepare this defense not as a matter of calculated tactical choice but in \u201ccomplete indifference to his legal and ethical duties, to the great detriment of his [client, the petitioner in this case].\u201d (See appendix to dissent, <em>In the Matter of: Philip Jefferson, </em>case 83-0-11184, State Bar Court, <em>post, </em>at p. 424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In responding to the majority\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d about Jefferson\u2019s abhorrence at using allegedly perjured testimony, for instance, it is equally possible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>speculate Jefferson knew Xavier\u2019s admission was true\u2014or at least that it might be true\u2014but felt he was representing the entire Sanders family. Given the fact the first trial against petitioner had ended with a six to six jury deadlock, Jefferson may have been convinced he could obtain an acquittal of petitioner at the second trial without exposing Xavier to risk of criminal prosecution. If he had succeeded without Xavier\u2019s testimony the entire Sanders brood would have gotten off scot-free and he would have served his \u201cclient,\u201d the family, very well. On the other hand, if Jefferson used Xavier\u2019s full admission at petitioner\u2019s trial, he risked seeing two Sanders brothers go to prison. His \u201cclient,\u201d the family, would not have been too pleased with that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">I grant this is pure speculation about Jefferson\u2019s knowledge, understandings, motivations, and the like. But it is no more speculative than the majority\u2019s conjecture Jefferson \u201cknew\u201d Xavier was lying and because of his high ethical standards would not participate in the investigation of or presentation of perjured testimony. It is not critical or even relevant which of these speculations\u2014or any of the several other speculations the trial court or the majority offers to justify denial of habeas corpus\u2014is the \u201cbetter\u201d speculation. The key point, once again, is they are all mere speculations about what people would have done, might have known, could have thought, etc. In a world of hard evidence and sound reason, one speculation is no better than another. With the possible exception of some exotic field of mathematics of which I am not aware, there are no degrees of zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">IV. The Referee\u2019s Finding That Xavier Would Not Have Testified at the Second Trial That He, Rather Than Petitioner, Fired the Fatal Shot Is Supported Only by Speculation and Not by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The referee attempted to excuse Jefferson\u2019s failure to call Xavier as a witness by making a factual \u201cfinding\u201d that, if called, Xavier would have invoked his privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify at the second trial. This, likewise, is pure speculation, not a factual \u201cfinding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">It is undisputed Jefferson never talked to Xavier about his testimony or whether Xavier would take the Fifth Amendment at trial. Thus, he breached his duty to investigate all reasonable defenses and was guilty of ineffective assistance of counsel on that ground alone. Moreover, without taking these minimal steps required by his duty to investigate all reasonable defenses, Jefferson had no basis for concluding Xavier would refuse to testify and deciding to forego his appearance for that reason. This is especially true because Xavier voluntarily showed up at the second trial wanting to tell his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The only evidence in the record bearing on Xavier\u2019s willingness to testify at the second trial supports a finding he indeed would have testified. That evidence reveals he asserted his right against self-incrimination at the first trial only because petitioner\u2019s counsel at that trial\u2014who was Xavier\u2019s own former counsel\u2014told him to come to the trial and take the Fifth Amendment. As Xavier told Klein and the investigator in the taped interview, \u201c. . . Then [Bledstein] came down and he say you gonna take the fifth amendment. And I said for what? He said for your brother\u2019s case and I said alright <em>[sic], </em>so I just took the fifth amendment [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">But Xavier had confessed to his mother it was he, not petitioner, who had fired the fatal shot. So at the time of the second trial on his own motion, or perhaps at his mother\u2019s urging, Xavier voluntarily went to Jefferson to tell this lawyer it was he rather than his brother who did it. Before Xavier could say anything, however, Jefferson said, \u201cthat if I\u2019m the one that did it they don\u2019t need me near the court or my testimony, because they might grab me or somethin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Undaunted, Xavier came to court to testify in petitioner\u2019s trial it was he not petitioner who fired the shot that killed the victim. \u201cWe was in a lawyer\u2019s chamber outside of the courtroom, we was sittin\u2019 in there and [Jefferson] came, he said oh no, you don\u2019t need to be here, go on and get away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">When the investigating attorney, Klein, asked Xavier the next question at the taped interview: \u201cSo you were willing to testify in court that you did the shooting?\u201d Xavier\u2019s answer: \u201cRight. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Shortly thereafter, Klein explained what would have been the situation at the second trial: \u201cSo, ... if you went to court, at a minimum the judge would talk to you and tell you if you wanna talk to a lawyer, you can, and if you can\u2019t afford one you can have one, and that you don\u2019t have to say anything that would get you in any trouble. Did you understand that?\u201d Xavier\u2019s answer: \u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Klein then followed up with the crucial question: \u201cAnd you were still gonna say that you did it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Xavier\u2019s answer: \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">What a person <em>would </em>have done on a given occasion if given the chance is always a matter of speculation. But if there are degrees of speculation, it is an even more problematic conjecture when the only evidence in the record on what the person <em>would </em>have done on that occasion is the person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>testimony saying he would have done one thing and the speculator concludes he would have done the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The only indication in the record the referee could have used to speculate Xavier would have invoked the Fifth Amendment if he had been called at the second trial is the fact he asserted that right when asked certain critical questions at the habeas corpus hearing. But what Xavier did at the habeas corpus hearing is not proof of what he <em>would </em>have done years earlier at petitioner\u2019s trial. Since at the time of the habeas corpus proceeding Xavier\u2019s brother, the petitioner, already was convicted and in jail the counsel advising Xavier might have been concerned Xavier would supply evidence supporting an accessory charge against himself without convincing this referee his brother should be released. Thus, there was a risk both brothers could end up in prison, even though only Xavier was guilty. (This, too, is only speculation. But that merely illustrates my point. The referee entered into a \u201cnever never land\u201d of conjecture and surmise and pure guesswork when she ventured to \u201cfind\u201d what Xavier <em>would </em>have done if Jefferson had called him to testify at petitioner\u2019s second trial.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">V. Assuming Xavier Had Refused to Testify at the Second Trial, His Several Out-of-court Admissions Would Have Been Admissible at That Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Let us assume, however, one can \u201cfind\u201d Xavier would have asserted his right against self-incrimination at the second trial because he asserted that right to refuse answering some questions at the habeas corpus hearing. If so, then by the same logic one is inexorably led to the conclusion that if Jefferson had asked him before the second trial Xavier would have supplied a sworn written statement and a taped interview acknowledging he rather than petitioner fired the fatal shot. For, while it is true Xavier invoked the Fifth Amendment to certain questions at the habeas corpus hearing it is equally true that before this hearing he willingly furnished a sworn declaration and gave an attorney and his investigator a taped interview. In these statements, Xavier confessed he fired the fatal shot and petitioner did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Thus, assuming the referee was correct in speculating Xavier would have invoked the Fifth Amendment if called at the trial, the same logic demonstrates that except for his ineffective representation Jefferson would have had several of Xavier\u2019s confessions available at the trial\u2014the one to his mother, a sworn declaration he had signed, and a taped interview. (In addition, if he had conducted any sort of investigation Jefferson may well have uncovered other witnesses to whom Xavier had admitted he rather than petitioner was the shooter.) Those statements, in turn, could have been introduced as evidence if Xavier indeed became unavailable as a witness by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>asserting his right not to incriminate himself. Since he would then be unavailable, these out-of-court declarations would have become admissible as declarations against penal interest. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230; 1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook, (2d ed. 1982) Declarations Against Interest, \u00a7 6; 2 Johnson, Cal. Trial Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 40.35[2], at pp. 40-110-40-112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The majority disagrees these declarations would have been admissible. The opinion accepts the referee\u2019s finding that the claim \u201cXavier\u2019s statement would be admissible as a declaration against penal interest is not necessarily meritorious. . . . His declaration that he shot at the car and then shot in the air would not be against his penal interest. As in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(citation omitted), <em>there is </em>also a question of trustworthiness to be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">This \u201cfinding\u201d is in error on the facts and on the law. The instant case falls within the well-established principle allowing third party admissions of guilt into evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s innocence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Spriggs </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 868, 875 [36 Cal.Rptr. 841, 389 P.2d 377] [wife\u2019s admission that drugs were hers was admissible to prove drugs were not defendant\u2019s], expressly overruling <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1892) 94 Cal. 595 [30 P. 7] and its progeny, which had disallowed such evidence.) As our Supreme Court said in <em>Spriggs, </em>\u201c[A] person\u2019s interest against being criminally implicated gives reasonable assurance of the veracity of his statement against that interest.\u201d (60 Cal.2d at p. 874.) The <em>Spriggs </em>rationale won the day when the drafters of the California Evidence Code and the Legislature enacted section 1230 which permits such testimony. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence, <em>supra, </em>The Hearsay Rule, \u00a7\u00a7 688, 694; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frutos </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 979, 986 [205 Cal.Rptr. 204] [third party\u2019s hearsay admission of participation in crime admissible under Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 897, 903 [91 Cal.Rptr. 786, 52 A.L.R.3d 875] [third party\u2019s admission of guilt admissible under Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230 where third party later invokes privilege against self-incrimination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Even if the referee\u2019s characterization of the content of Xavier\u2019s out-of-court declarations had been accurate those statements still would have been admissible as declarations against penal interest. The California Evidence Code requires the declarant\u2019s statement to have \u201cso far subjected him to the risk of . . . criminal liability, . . . that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230.) That is all it requires. The Evidence Code does not require that the declarant have admitted to each and every element of the most serious charge which might be leveled against him. The only question is whether what he did admit to would subject him to the <em>risk </em>of criminal liability. Even accepting the referee\u2019s characterization that Xavier only said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>he fired \u201cat the car and in the air\u201d Xavier would have admitted to more than enough to <em>guarantee </em>he would be subjected to criminal liability for the death of Norman Gregory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Xavier said far more, however, than he \u201cshot a gun at the car and in the air.\u201d Indeed he told his mother he fired <em>the </em>shot which killed Norman Gregory, and Jefferson was aware of this fact when he declined to call Xavier and told him to get out of the courthouse. The mother could have testified to that statement once Xavier\u2019s unavailability was established by his invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Xavier\u2019s tape-recorded (and transcribed) statement to Klein, the lawyer, and to the investigator was even more incriminatory. After telling them he shot at the car he said \u201c. . . and then I shot one in the air, but <em>I shot one towards the house, </em>but I didn\u2019t hear nobody holler, so I didn\u2019t know if I hit anybody.\u201d (Italics added.) Later on, he said he fired two shots. \u201cI fired one in the car and one in the air <em>towards the house\" </em>(Italics added.) Still later Xavier told them the earlier reference to a shot \u201cin the air\u201d referred to \u201cthe one I fired towards the house, that they sayin\u2019 it went through the door.\u201d So the referee\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d Xavier only admitted to shooting at the car and in the air is not consistent with the evidence. Three times during the taped interview Xavier admitted to firing at the house and specifically admitted firing the shot other evidence shows was fatal to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Later in this same statement Xavier admitted he personally destroyed the rifle, which would be admissible against him as evidence of a guilty conscience. He further specifically stated he, and not petitioner, committed the crime for which petitioner was convicted. \u201cI\u2019ll do the time, ain\u2019t no sense of him goin\u2019 when I did it and everybody\u2019s keep sayin\u2019 he\u2019s the one that did it.\u201d Altogether, this is as close to an out-and-out confession of guilt as one could reasonably expect.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Any single one of these admissions in the taped interview would be sufficiently incriminating to satisfy the foundational requirement for a declaration against penal interest that it \u201cso far subjected him to the risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>. . . criminal liability, . . . that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230.) In combination, they create a net of admitted guilt from which it would be difficult if not impossible to extract oneself.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Furthermore, if a trial court had excluded the mother\u2019s testimony or Xavier\u2019s other declarations at the second trial on grounds of \u201cuntrustworthiness\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 872 [123 Cal.Rptr. 862], that ruling would have been reversible error. <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>is easily distinguished.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In that case, there was evidence before the trial court to the effect the declarant, a juvenile, had expressly agreed with the defendant, an adult, to \u201ctake the rap\u201d for a murder. The existence of this agreement combined with evidence the defendant had threatened the juvenile with serious bodily injury unless he \u201ctook the rap\u201d and the further fact the juvenile \u201ccould not suffer any real detriment to his own interests,\u201d that is, any further punishment as a result of accepting full blame, persuaded the court the juvenile\u2019s proffered \u201cconfession\u201d was \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d and should be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Here Xavier is an adult not a juvenile. Indeed he is older than petitioner and faced the same punishment for the crime he admitted as did petitioner. Moreover, unlike <em>Chapman </em>there was no evidence of any agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>between Xavier and appellant that Xavier would \u201ctake the rap\u201d for a crime petitioner committed. Nor is there evidence the younger brother threatened his older brother with great bodily injury unless he accepted the blame for the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Conceivably, evidence of this sort exists and might have been produced at the trial. But the referee could not support a \u201cfinding\u201d to this effect on <em>speculation </em>such evidence would be forthcoming. Nor could the referee\u2019s finding be supported by the <em>speculation </em>all older brothers would agree to take their younger brother\u2019s place in prison. Not too many people\u2014brothers or not\u2014consider it \u201ca far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done\u201d to falsely confess to another\u2019s crime and \u201ca far, far better rest, that I go to, than I have ever known\u201d to serve the real criminal\u2019s time in prison. No, as the majority concedes, the law requires the referee\u2019s findings to be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d not wild <em>speculation.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In the absence of evidence it is difficult to differentiate this pair of brothers and this crime from any other pair of brothers and a crime both of them could have committed but only one did. (For that matter, it is difficult to differentiate a pair of brothers from a pair of friends as far as motive and opportunity to collude are concerned.) Accordingly, unless we are ready to enunciate a blanket rule to the effect one brother\u2019s declaration against penal interest is always inadmissible in his other brother\u2019s trial there is no reason to single out petitioner and deny him the opportunity to introduce Xavier\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>several admissions and confessions in this case. As discussed above, (see fn. 9, <em>ante,) </em>a blanket rule would be inconsistent with the California Evidence Code and perhaps unconstitutional as well. Thus, Xavier\u2019s statements would have been admissible in petitioner\u2019s defense had Jefferson collected them and presented them at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><em>Chapman </em>cannot be read to create a requirement that declarations against penal interest in general\u2014or third party confessions of guilt in particular\u2014must be corroborated by other evidence to be admissible. The comparable provision of the Federal Rules of Evidence Evidence contains such a requirement (see pp. 404-408, <em>post) </em>but Evidence Code section 1230 does not. Nonetheless, I do think it noteworthy that here unlike <em>Chapman, </em>the declarant\u2019s statements do not stand alone. There is other evidence in the record to corroborate his out-of-court admissions of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Terrell Gregory (brother of the victim) told the police at the scene and again six days later the shooter was Zuba (nickname for Xavier). About an hour prior to the shooting Terrell was outside sitting on a car and observed petitioner being beaten by David and the victim, Norman Gregory. Presumably Terrrll would remember petitioner\u2019s face an hour later.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Darryl Anderson (neighbor from across the street) initially told investigating police the shooter was Kake (nickname for petitioner). But the very next day he told police Zuba (Xavier) was the shooter. (The majority in footnote 9 claims I create the impression in this dissent that this witness initially identified Xavier as the shooter. I do not. What I do point out, and deem significant, is the fact this witness wavered in his pretrial identification. A jury could believe he was right the second time rather than the first.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">William Thomas (neighbor from down the street) initially identified the shooter as Kake but six days later told police he was not sure who the shooter was. (The majority accepts Thomas\u2019s later explanation at trial he only told the police he wasn\u2019t sure because he didn\u2019t want to get involved. But a jury would not have to accept this explanation as true after hearing an admission by Xavier that he, not petitioner, fired the fatal shot.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">David Gregory (brother of the victim) was standing next to the victim when the victim was shot. David is the only person who consistently identified petitioner as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">These four witnesses were inside the house at the time of the shooting and observed the shooter, if at all, through an iron mesh, steel bar door.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Because Kelvin Sanders was married to Raynetta (Gregory) Sanders, much emphasis is placed on the fact witnesses are related to and presumably know each other well. The one person who knew the Sanders brothers best was Raynetta. During her marriage to Kelvin, they lived together for several months at the Sanders residence. Of all the witnesses she is in the best position to distinguish between Xavier and petitioner. At the scene, Ms. Sanders identified Xavier as the shooter, giving the police his full, complete name. Ms. Sanders\u2019s statements to the police at the scene are doubly significant because she is the only eyewitness who was outside and had a clear view of the shooter unobstructed by any mesh and bar door or bodies crowding around the doorway. While the record reflects she was upset and possibly hysterical when interviewed by the police, the reports also indicate she was coherent. She relayed details of the day\u2019s events including the fight in the morning between petitioner and her brothers as well as the substance of telephone conversations with Kelvin after the fight and before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The majority seeks to cast doubt on Ms. Sanders\u2019s identification of Xavier as the shooter on the day of the shooting. As a matter of fact, during her trial testimony Ms. Sanders denied she had even talked to the officer at that time. She had to concede, however, there was information in the police report, such as her correct date of birth, which must have come from her. Admittedly, as the majority in an almost unprecedented argument implies, it is <em>conceivable </em>the investigating officer could have lied or been otherwise mistaken about interviewing Ms. Sanders or about what she said in describing the events of the day and identifying the perpetrator as Xavier. There is no apparent reason for the officer to manufacture the fact or content of this interview. In any event, the police officer\u2019s testimony at the very least creates a jury issue whether Ms. Sanders initially and while still in an excited state identified Xavier rather than petitioner as the one who fired the fatal shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The majority likewise seeks to diminish the reliability of Ms. Sanders\u2019s initial on scene identification by emphasizing she was crying and hysterical from witnessing her brother shot and dying from a four-inch hole in his head. This may be a good argument to a jury. It does not\u2014or should not\u2014 carry much water with an appellate court. What the majority is describing is the quintessence of an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d or \u201cspontaneous declaration\u201d which common law jurisprudence and the California Legislature have long recognized to carry a special badge of reliability. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1240; 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 714 et seq., 2 Johnson, Cal. Trial Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 40.39.) That special badge derives from the fact the witness is so excited her normal ability to lie or distort is suspended. In essence, the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>speaks through the witness, uncensored and unembellished. \u201c \u2018The basis for this circumstantial probability of trustworthiness is \u201cthat in the stress of nervous excitement the reflective faculties may be stilled and the utterance may become the unreflecting and sincere expression of one\u2019s actual impressions and belief.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 306, 318 [246 Cal.Rptr. 886, 753 P2d 1082] quoting <em>Showalter </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R.R. Co. </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 460, 468 [106 P.2d 895].)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Because of this special reliability the officer\u2019s testimony about Ms. Sanders\u2019s statement to him that day would have qualified for admission as an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 306 [declarant\u2019s statements admissible as spontaneous declaration even though made 30 minutes after the crime and in response to questions from a police officer].) Meanwhile, other out-of-court statements Ms. Sanders later made when she had enough time to calculate her words would not carry that same badge of reliability. Consequently, barring some unique circumstance bringing them under another hearsay exception any later statements would have been inadmissible had she not appeared as a witness at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">At the very least this evidence that several eyewitnesses identified Xavier as the shooter early in the investigation should corroborate Xavier\u2019s presence at the scene as well as the possibility of Xavier as the shooter. This testimony is more than enough to bolster Xavier\u2019s several out-of-court admissions. The majority opinion seems to assume corroboration is required for Xavier\u2019s declaration against penal interest to be admissible, which it is not. Furthermore, the majority appears to assume corroboration must consist of <em>undisputed </em>evidence supporting the declaration. That is not necessary either. If corroboration were an essential prerequisite of admissibility, it would be enough there was admissible evidence\u2014no matter how strongly controverted by contrary evidence\u2014that supported the declaration. Here there is such admissible evidence, in the form of prior inconsistent statements <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and at least one statement that could have come in as an excited utterance (spontaneous declaration) as well. All of this admissible evidence pointed in the same direction as the declarations against penal interest\u2014 Xavier fired the fatal shot. Had the jury heard Xavier\u2019s out-of-court admissions it would have been free to choose the eyewitnesses\u2019 prior inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>statements and excited utterance along with Xavier\u2019s statements in preference to the eyewitnesses\u2019 trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">A declaration against penal interest does not become inadmissible because the prosecution introduced contrary evidence at the trial. The majority implies Xavier\u2019s statements would not have been admissible at petitioner\u2019s second trial because prosecution witnesses testified at that trial it was petitioner, not Xavier, who filed the fatal shot. Does this mean Xavier would not have been allowed to testify <em>in person </em>at the trial to confess his own guilt and exonerate petitioner? Would his testimony to this effect be <em>inadmissible </em>because others testified the shooter was petitioner not Xavier? Obviously not. The existence of contrary evidence only goes to the weight of Xavier\u2019s testimony not its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">For the same reason, Xavier\u2019s out-of-court statements would have been admissible as declarations against penal interest despite the presence of contrary evidence. These admissions still subjected him to a risk of criminal liability, all the more so because he admitted to acts such as bringing the gun and destroying it which exposed him to prosecution as an accessory even if the jury convicted his brother as the shooter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In this case, we have a compelling argument for admission of Xavier\u2019s several declarations against penal interest under California law. Not only are all the foundational requirements met for a declaration against interest, but the declaration is bolstered by corroborating evidence in the record of the trial. Accordingly, there is not a shred of doubt under California law Xavier\u2019s several statements that he, not petitioner, fired the fatal shot would be admissible as declarations against penal interest at any trial where he invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>VI. The Admissibility of Xavier\u2019s Out-of-court Declarations Is Guaranteed by the United States Constitution and Supported by Federal Decisions Interpreting the More Stringent Provisions of the Federal</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Rules of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The admissibility of Xavier\u2019s several admissions of guilt does not depend solely upon California Evidence Code section 1230 either. Their admissibility is further guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has held that, under some circumstances, the refusal to admit hearsay admissions of guilt by a third party violates the criminal defendant\u2019s right to due process regardless of the state\u2019s rules of evidence. In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra, </em>410 U.S. 284, the state trial court barred three witnesses from testifying a third party confessed to the murder for which the defendant was charged. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 298 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 310].) Although the state\u2019s rules of evidence barred the testimony as hearsay, the Supreme Court nonetheless held fundamental rules of due process mandated the testimony\u2019s admission as declarations against penal interest. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 302 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u201cFew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense. . . . Although perhaps no rule of evidence has been more respected or more frequently applied in jury trials than that applicable to the exclusion of hearsay, exceptions tailored to allow the introduction of evidence which in fact is likely to be trustworthy have long existed. The testimony rejected by the trial court here bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and thus was well within the basic rationale of the exception for declarations against interest. That testimony also was critical to [the defendant\u2019s] defense. In these circumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.\u201d (410 U.S. at p. 302 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 312-313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The majority opinion in the instant case further argues Xavier\u2019s confessions do not qualify as declarations against penal interest because he might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>have reneged after the statements had been introduced at petitioner\u2019s trial. But once again this possibility does not make a third party confession inadmissible. Indeed in <em>Chambers </em>itself the declarant had already reneged on his confession <em>before </em>the trial. Yet the United States Supreme Court held these declarations were admissible as a matter of constitutional right. (410 U.S. at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chambers, </em>the Federal Rules of Evidence adopted rule 804 which permits the admission of a declarant\u2019s hearsay statements against penal interest if the declarant\u2019s testimony is unavailable at trial. Unlike the California statute, the federal rule contains the more stringent requirement that \u201c[a] statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d (Fed. Rules Evid., rule 804(b)(3), 28 U.S.C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Despite this more stringent requirement, federal courts have admitted exculpatory statements where the circumstances are less corroborative and the declarant\u2019s exposure to possible penal consequences far less pronounced than those found here. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(10th Cir. 1985) <em>777 </em>F.2d 543, the defendant was convicted of possessing cocaine with an intent to distribute. On appeal, the court of appeals held the district court erroneously excluded the testimony of an attorney that a third party made inculpatory statements to him which exculpated the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 552, 554.) The corroborating evidence was the fact the defendant\u2019s fingerprints were not found on the containers holding the cocaine while the declarant\u2019s fingerprints were. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 554; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(5th Cir. 1978) 571 F.2d 285, 290; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett </em>(1st Cir. 1976) 539 F.2d 244, 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, supra, </em>539 F.2d 244, the more stringent federal provision was construed to require admission of a declaration much less incriminating or credible than Xavier\u2019s several admissions. In that case the declarant made an offhand comment during a poker game that he and two others were going to have some trouble from people in California concerning a theft of postal stamps. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 249.) When asked whether he meant the appellant or someone else, the poker player said no, it was someone else not the defendant who was involved. The district court excluded the testimony of another player in the game relating the declarant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">On appeal, the prosecution argued the declarant\u2019s statements were not sufficiently against his penal interests to be admissible. The court of appeals disagreed, stating: \u201cAlthough the remarks did not amount to a clear confes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>sion to a crime . . . , we do not understand the hearsay exception to be limited to direct confessions. ... A reasonable person would have realized that remarks of the sort attributed to [the declarant] strongly implied his personal participation in the stamp crimes and hence would tend to subject him to criminal liability. Though by no means conclusive, the statement would be important evidence against [the declarant] were he himself on trial for the stamp crimes. We cannot say, therefore, that it did not pose the sort of threat to [the declarant\u2019s] interest that the hearsay exception contemplates.\u201d (539 F.2d at p. 251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The court went on to hold statements exculpating the defendant need not be against the declarant\u2019s interests to be admissible. \u201cThe district court seemed to suggest that in order for exculpatory remarks such as [the declarant\u2019s] to be admissible as against interest, the innocence of the accused must itself be prejudicial to the declarant. On the present facts, we read the first part of rule 804(b)(3) more broadly, and conclude that so much of [the declarant\u2019s] remarks [exculpating the appellant] . . . should here be considered as part of the statement against [the declarant\u2019s] interest.\u201d (539 F.2d at p. 252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">It is noteworthy the circuit court of appeals ruled this offhand comment was admissible as a declaration against penal interest even though the only corroboration came from a prosecution witness who testified the appellant was <em>less </em>involved than his codefendants in the planning and execution of the postal theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Here, unlike the single conversation with the lawyer in <em>Lopez </em>and the offhand comment during a social poker game in <em>Barrett, </em>Xavier admitted his guilt and completely exonerated petitioner not once but several times, including in the form of a taped statement and a declaration under penalty of perjury. The possible penal consequences of making these statements were far more apparent when Xavier was submitting to a formal taped interview and executing a declaration under penalty of perjury than they would have been to the declarants in <em>Lopez </em>or <em>Barrett. </em>Xavier\u2019s statements also were more definitive in confessing his own guilt and especially in exonerating petitioner than the declarations found admissible in either <em>Lopez </em>or <em>Barrett. </em>Moreover, although unnecessary under California law, the evidence of corroboration here is at least as ample as that present in either <em>Lopez </em>or <em>Barrett. </em>As pointed out earlier, several witnesses initially identified Xavier as the person who fired the gun (see p. 400, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Since third party admissions of guilt of this nature are admissible under the more stringent Federal Rules of Evidence, a fortiori, they are admissible under the more lenient standard of the California Evidence Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>VII. If Petitioner\u2019s Trial Counsel Failed to Investigate and Use Xavier\u2019s Statements Because He Believed Them Inadmissible as Declarations Against Interest, This Erroneous Legal Conclusion Provided Further Grounds for Finding Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The record of the habeas corpus hearing in this case suggests the referee may have speculated defendant\u2019s trial lawyer, Jefferson, had concluded Xavier\u2019s statements would have been inadmissible at the second trial were he to have invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. This belief, in turn, would explain Jefferson\u2019s own failure to call Xavier at least if we also honor the speculation Jefferson thought Xavier would take the Fifth Amendment. However, given the clear admissibility of third party admissions as discussed above, Jefferson\u2019s belief that Xavier\u2019s statements would have been inadmissible furnishes yet another ground for finding petitioner lacked effective assistance of counsel. Any self-incriminating statements Jefferson had bothered to collect from Xavier or from other witnesses to whom Xavier had unburdened himself would have been admissible as declarations against penal interest. If Jefferson failed to ask Xavier for such statements and failed to investigate to find whether he had admitted his guilt to others because Jefferson considered such statements inadmissible at trial that erroneous legal position would itself evidence a fatal absence of competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In summary, petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel from Jefferson in several vital respects related to Xavier\u2019s possible testimony. First, Jefferson failed to investigate and make an informed decision about using Xavier as a witness. Second, he failed to attempt to obtain a signed statement from Xavier admitting he fired the fatal shot that could be used in connection with Xavier\u2019s testimony (or invocation of the right against self-incrimination) at trial. Third, Jefferson failed to call Xavier as a witness and thus test his self-proclaimed willingness to testify at the second trial that he, not petitioner, fired the fatal shot. Had he called Xavier to the stand, Jefferson would either have obtained Xavier\u2019s testimony or would have established the predicate for introducing Xavier\u2019s out-of-court declarations admitting his guilt. Fourth, if as the evidence suggests, Jefferson failed to take these steps because he felt he was representing the Sanders family and did not want to expose his client\u2019s brother to criminal prosecution in order to save his client, then Jefferson was bound up in an actual or perceived conflict of interest. Whether actual or perceived, this meant petitioner was denied his right to conflict-free representation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mroczko </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 86, 105 [197 Cal.Rptr. 52, 672 P.2d 835] [defendant denied effective assistance of counsel if attorney has possible conflict]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 663, 670 [119 Cal.Rptr. 500, 532 P.2d 148].) And finally, if Jefferson failed to take these steps because he erroneously believed Xavier\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>statements would be inadmissible as declarations against interest, he demonstrated a woeful misunderstanding of the law which, in turn, denied petitioner the best evidence available to support a powerful defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">VIII. If Xavier\u2019s Testimony or Out-of-court Admissions Had Been Introduced at the Second Trial or Were Introduced at a New Trial, It Is Probable the Outcome Would Be More Favorable to Petitioner</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Notwithstanding the referee\u2019s contrary finding, I have to agree with the expert witness, Fitzgerald, that had Xavier\u2019s admission been in evidence at the second trial, it is likely petitioner would have had a more favorable result. This is all the case law requires. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 694 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 218 [\u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaw, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 542; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson, supra, 25 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 165-166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">I am equally convinced that if a third trial were held it is probable petitioner would experience a more favorable result through the introduction of Xavier\u2019s own testimony or, failing that, through the introduction of his written declaration and taped oral admissions. (This assumes, of course, the People would elect to try petitioner a third time for this crime rather than using Xavier\u2019s confessions to prosecute him for the first time.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Can anyone seriously question the devastating impact of a witness testifying \u201cthe defendant didn\u2019t do it, I did it\u201d? Or even indulging the referee\u2019s speculation that Xavier would have asserted the Fifth Amendment at the second trial, who could deny the striking effect of a witness testifying \u201cmy son told me he not the defendant fired the fatal shot\u201d following immediately on the heels of this other son\u2019s invocation of the right against self-incrimination. Had Jefferson properly performed his duties as a lawyer the mother\u2019s testimony would have been further buttressed by a signed statement or other out-of-court declaration he had obtained from Xavier. The fact the jury already would have heard the confessing son was on the scene and had initially been identified as the perpetrator by most of the eyewitnesses shortly after the homicide would only give further credence to the out-of-court confessions and thus increase the chances the jury would reach a verdict favorable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The majority treats the prosecution\u2019s eyewitness testimony at the trial as sacrosanct. Somehow Xavier\u2019s admission of guilt and exoneration of petitioner could not incriminate him\u2014and presumably he knew this when he made these statements\u2014because what he said was inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>eyewitness descriptions at trial. But contrary evidence\u2014no matter how overwhelming\u2014does not render a self-incriminatory statement inadmissible. Even if this eyewitness testimony had been steadfast from the date of the murder to the present and even if the witnesses\u2019 motives were unassailable, that would not disqualify Xavier\u2019s out-of-court statements from admission as declarations against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In any event, the eyewitness testimony in this case was not steadfast before the trial. Nor were the motives of the witnesses unassailable. Indeed had Xavier\u2019s admissions of guilt and exoneration of petitioner come before the jury it is entirely possible the jurors would have believed this evidence over the contrary testimony of the victim\u2019s family and neighbors. Remember half the members of the earlier jury had not found this eyewitness testimony sufficiently convincing to convict petitioner. Why it proved unpersuasive is not part of this record. Perhaps it was because the majority of these eyewitnesses had wavered in their pretrial identifications of the shooter. Perhaps it was because some jurors at the first trial were concerned the witnesses were angrier at petitioner than his brother. This could have led the witnesses to talk it over after some had initially identified Xavier as the shooter and decide to name the petitioner as the shooter at the trial. Or perhaps some jurors at the first trial discredited the eyewitness testimony thinking these witnesses decided to pin the blame on petitioner because they felt that whoever pulled the trigger it was really petitioner\u2019s mission of revenge which led to the tragic shooting of their brother and neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">If six jurors at the first trial had enough doubts about petitioner\u2019s guilt to vote acquittal without hearing Xavier\u2019s in-court confession or out-of-court admissions, how can we say no juror at the second trial could have voted to acquit petitioner if they <em>had </em>heard this evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Indeed, this case closely resembles the facts in <em>In re Hall, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 408, where the Supreme Court reached the same conclusion as I urge here. There, the defendant\u2019s attorney failed to investigate or present evidence that a third party murdered the victim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 421, 428.) In finding the attorney acted incompetently, the Supreme Court noted: \u201cRepresentation of an accused murderer is a mammoth responsibility. When [the attorney] received information suggesting that his client was falsely accused of this most serious of crimes and that the guilty party was intimidating witnesses, he should have recognized his heightened obligation to investigate the case, to pursue reluctant witnesses, and to redouble efforts to overcome the unusual obstacles placed in the path of developing the apparent truth. Instead, he incompetently delegated his duty to others, and in effect deprived his client of a constitutionally guaranteed opportunity to prove his innocence. Through the dedicated efforts of family, friends, new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>counsel and many others in a common crusade for justice, petitioner has, after three years in prison, fully and convincingly demonstrated his right to receive that opportunity anew.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The same things can be said about any third trial that might take place were this petition granted. Once again petitioner could anticipate the probability of a more favorable result. Xavier would either testify or take the Fifth Amendment. If Xavier elected to assert his right against self-incrimination then his two posttrial confessions\u2014one written under penalty of perjury and the other recorded on tape\u2014would be admitted. So would his mother\u2019s testimony he had confessed to her it was he rather than petitioner who fired the fatal shot. And to reinforce Xavier\u2019s out-of-court admissions there would be all the testimony revealing the majority of eyewitnesses initially identified Xavier rather than petitioner as the man who fired the shot which killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">For all these reasons, I am firmly convinced petitioner is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, on this record at least, it is not out of the question that after reversal of petitioner\u2019s conviction Xavier Sanders could be tried for this crime rather than retrying petitioner. In an effort to justify the trial counsel\u2019s behavior and thereby save the present conviction, the trial court and the majority opinion spin a diaphanous web composed entirely of what the California Supreme Court labels \u201ccompound conjecture\u201d and call it findings. Unfortunately, unless a higher court intervenes this \u201ccompound conjecture\u201d will be enough to condemn the brother who proclaims his innocence\u2014and could well be innocent\u2014to spend his best years in prison while the brother who admits the crime remains free. I have trouble finding the justice in that.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Homicide is the most heinous of crimes. It is crucial the courts convict and punish the culprit. But it is also imperative we take extraordinary pains to <em>insure </em>the person we convict and punish indeed was the culprit. I unhappily conclude we have not done so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 23, 1990.

It does. True, the trial court ruled this evidence inadmissible. But petitioner\u2019s counsel wisely made an offer of proof which stated he possessed admissible evidence of the recommendation for disbarment, the reasons for the recommendation, and the fact Jefferson had thereafter accepted inactive status and left the state. The prosecution did not controvert the truth of this offer of proof only the relevance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">This evidence was admissible and should have been admitted to prove Jefferson\u2019s unavailability since that unavailability was a prerequisite to the introduction of much of the evidence at the hearing, especially that relating his out-of-court statements about his previously existing state of mind. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1251, subd. (a); 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) The Hearsay Rule, \u00a7 739, pp. 719-720; 2 Johnson, Cal. Trial Guide (1986) \u00a7 40.43[2][a], pp. 40-193-40-194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The majority points out the parties stipulated to Jefferson\u2019s unavailability. This stipulation did not necessarily foreclose petitioner from introducing independent evidence as to the trial lawyer\u2019s unavailability and the reasons for it. In any event, this evidence was admissible for other reasons and as to other issues in the case. (See pp. 392-393, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Subsequent to the habeas corpus hearing the State Bar proceeded to disbar Jefferson. I have attached as an appendix to this modification the State Bar\u2019s record of the disbarment and Jefferson\u2019s disciplinary record leading up the disbarment. These documents support and amplify petitioner\u2019s offer of proof at the habeas corpus hearing. (See appendix to dissent.) I have taken judicial notice of these disciplinary documents pursuant to Evidence Code section 452. <em>(1Younger </em>v. <em>Solomon </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 289, 299 [113 Cal.Rptr. 113].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">This evidence has become still more relevant because of the speculations the majority opinion attempts to use to justify Jefferson\u2019s failure to investigate and use Xavier\u2019s admissions in petitioner\u2019s defense. As will be discussed later in this dissent, the majority in effect employs a tautology. The opinion argues Jefferson was not incompetent because a competent and ethical lawyer would not have done what he did unless he had good reason. To state it as a syllogism:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">A competent and ethical attorney does not fail to investigate and use a valid third party confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Jefferson is a competent and ethical attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Consequently, the third party confession must have been invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">Or in other words, Jefferson was competent because he was competent. Thus, at its heart the majority\u2019s argument is based on assumptions about Jefferson\u2019s character\u2014his competence and ethical behavior. This places Jefferson\u2019s competence and ethical standards in issue and makes evidence bearing on those attributes of his character independently admissible. One cannot <em>assume </em>a person\u2019s good character and make speculative inferences based on that assumed good character and then reject evidence demonstrating the assumption is erroneous and indeed the person has bad character. (See, e.g., <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>See\u2019s Candies, Inc. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 743, 756-757 [250 Cal.Rptr. 195]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1100; 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>supra, </em>Circumstantial Evidence, \u00a7 329, at pp. 301-302; 3 Johnson, Cal. Trial Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 50.01 [4], at pp. 50-5 - 50-6.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\"> The majority devotes five full pages to an attempted refutation of this one paragraph mention that Jefferson should have obtained a transcript of the first trial. In this, perhaps the majority doth protest too much. Upon reflection, this one of Jefferson\u2019s many failures may be a worse default than I originally felt. The more I reread this section of the majority opinion the more I am convinced it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Originally I cited the failure to obtain a transcript of the first trial primarily to evidence Jefferson\u2019s generally lackadaisical approach to his defense of petitioner at the second trial. This failure coupled with others further refutes the assumption so vital to the majority\u2019s speculations, the assumption that Jefferson was a competent and highly ethical attorney who would not have failed to pursue a <em>potentially valid </em>third party confession but would have refused to pursue one he knew to be perjurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">At the risk of producing a five-page footnote to rebut a five-page critique over what I regard as one of Jefferson\u2019s less critical but quite revelatory failures as defense counsel, I will make a few observations. First, the transcript could have been obtained. The expert witness, Fitzgerald, had no trouble obtaining the transcript and reviewing it for the habeas corpus hearing. Second, this witness, an experienced trial counsel whom the prosecution stipulated was an expert in criminal defense, testified unequivocally that in order to render effective representation at the second trial Jefferson should have obtained a transcript of the first trial. \u201c(W)here the second attorney differs from the first attorney and wasn\u2019t present at the first trial, I think it\u2019s <em>absolutely imperative </em>that the lawyer obtain the transcript of the first trial.\u201d (Italics added.) The importance of this step is further underscored by the fact the opportunity to have a transcript of the first trial is deemed so critical it is guaranteed as a matter of constitutional right. <em>(Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 226 [30 L.Ed.2d 400, 92 S.Ct. 431]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hosner </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 60 [123 Cal.Rptr. 381, 538 P.2d 1141] [denial of transcript of first trial is per se reversible error]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 731 [209 Cal.Rptr. 328, 691 P.2d 994, 64 A.L.R.4th 723].)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">There may be some legitimate dispute whether Jefferson\u2019s incompetence in failing to obtain a transcript so prejudiced petitioner\u2019s actual defense at the second trial that we can say but for this particular incompetence petitioner would have had a more favorable outcome. The California Supreme Court, however, has recognized this is such an impossible task for an appellate court to undertake we must presume prejudice. \u201cEven if an appellate court were to undertake the extraordinary burden of reviewing the records of both trials, the court would only be able to hypothesize what use at the latter trial could have been made of the transcript of the former trial. While the assessment of the prejudicial effect of error always requires some speculation by the reviewing court as to how an average jury would have decided the case in the absence of error, an entirely <em>new level of compound conjecture </em>would be entailed in a court\u2019s first speculating what evidence might have been impeached, and how, and only then speculating how the trier of fact would have reacted to the speculated efforts at impeachment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hosner, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 60, 70. Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">In any event and at a minimum, there is little doubt Jefferson demonstrated incompetence when he failed to secure a transcript of the first trial. And there is little doubt this provides evidence of Jefferson\u2019s lackadaisical attitude toward the preparation and presentation of petitioner\u2019s defense at the second trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> The majority opinion contends Jefferson interviewed Xavier in confidence and thereafter chose not to use his testimony. However, the record does not support this factual assertion. Instead it supports the conclusion Jefferson refused to talk with Xavier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> Although this disbarment is not part of the record on appeal, it relates to \u201cfindings\u201d in the majority opinion which likewise were not part of the record. Jefferson\u2019s disciplinary record is appended because it bears on the majority\u2019s supplementary \u201cfindings\u201d about Jefferson\u2019s conduct, intent and motives not because it bears on the trial court\u2019s findings. As to those supplementary \u201cfindings\u201d this disciplinary record is both timely and cogent evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> Evidence of specific acts of misconduct is admissible if it bears on issues of motive, knowledge or intent.

If Xavier admits as he did that he owned the gun, took the gun out of the trunk of the car, and then fired the gun, this is very strong circumstantial evidence the bullets shot by the only gun fired that day killed the victim. Even at the evidentiary hearing, Xavier willingly testified he owned the gun, placed it in the trunk of the BMW, drove to the Gregory residence, there taking the gun from the trunk. Xavier further testified neither petitioner nor Kelvin knew of the rifle in the car and he saw neither petitioner nor Kelvin fire a gun. In other words, Xavier testified to most of the information contained in his declaration with the exception of admitting on the stand he fired the rifle. When asked this particular question then and only then did he invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\"> A leading commentator on California evidence law correctly points out Evidence Code section 1230, unlike some other hearsay exceptions, contains no separate requirement of \u201ctrustworthiness.\u201d (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 268-269.) Jefferson criticizes <em>Chapman </em>for this error in its analysis. \u201cThe <em>Chapman </em>holding is correct but its reasoning is unsound. There is no requirement set forth in Evid. \u00a7 1230 for the declaration-against-interest exception to the hearsay rule that the trial judge must make a finding that the statement is trustworthy as a prerequisite to admissibility. What <em>Chapman </em>should have said was that the circumstances were such that the proponent of [the declarant\u2019s] statement failed to satisfy the trial judge as to the requirement set forth in Evid. \u00a7 1230 \u2018that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u2019 The evidence of a motive to falsify because of threats would certainly justify a trial judge in finding that a reasonable man would make the statement which the proponent sought to have introduced even though he believed the statement to be untrue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The instant case likewise is distinguishable from <em>People </em>v. <em>Blankenship </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 840 [213 Cal.Rptr. 666], another decision excluding a third party admission <em>of </em>guilt. In that case, the purported admission was made to the defendant. So the defendant\u2014 and only the defendant\u2014was in a position to testify that the third person had in fact confessed to these crimes. \u201cAs the proposed testimony was to come from defendant himself it was highly suspect both because defendant had a motive to falsify and because accurate details concerning the crime could be explained by defendant\u2019s own knowledge and guilt rather than [the declarant\u2019s].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 849.) Here we have Xavier\u2019s signed statement under oath, his confession to his mother, his admission to his own first counsel, Bledstein, his testimony at the habeas corpus hearing, and his apparent eagerness to make the same admission to his brother\u2019s defense counsel. Consequently, in sharp contrast with <em>Blankenship, </em>there was no reason to doubt the veracity of the several witnesses in a position to testify as to whether the declarant <em>said anything and what he actually said.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> It is also possible to <em>speculate </em>Xavier\u2019s several confessions are part of an elaborate plot concocted by the Sanders family to save both brothers from conviction for this crime. A possible scenario for this speculation might run along the following lines. After petitioner\u2019s conviction is reversed Xavier\u2019s confessions are used to win acquittal for petitioner at his retrial. Xavier then reneges on his confessions and petitioner confesses his own guilt to win acquittal of his brother at Xavier\u2019s trial. At this stage, the confessing petitioner cannot be retried because of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">This scenario does not work, of course, if Xavier instead of petitioner is tried first after reversal of petitioner\u2019s conviction. Petitioner would still have the possibility of his own retrial hanging over his head during Xavier\u2019s trial and would nearly guarantee a return trip to prison by confessing guilt\u2014honestly or dishonestly\u2014at Xavier\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">But the real point is all of this is mere speculation. There is no evidence in this record establishing any collusion among members of the Sanders family to have Xavier <em>falsely </em>admit his guilt as a step toward saving both his brother and himself from criminal responsibility for this homicide. In the absence of such evidence, we cannot say the <em>speculative possibility </em>of such collusion among family members can support a blanket exception to Evidence Code section 1230 that declarations against penal interest are inadmissible if they were made by a brother\u2014or perhaps any relative\u2014of the defendant. To do so would represent judicial activism of the rankest sort since nothing in the language of section 1230 suggests any such exception. Indeed an exception of this nature might be unconstitutional. In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 284, 301-302, footnote 21 [35 L.Ed.2d 297, 312, 93 S.Ct. 1038], the United States Supreme Court expressly rejected the state\u2019s argument the <em>possibility </em>two defendants might collude to avoid successful prosecution of either was enough to justify a rule disallowing third party confessions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Under California law, prior inconsistent statements are admissible to prove the truth of the matter the declarant asserted not merely to impeach the declarant\u2019s testimony on the witness stand. In other words, a prior inconsistent statement is substantive evidence and by itself can support a finding or judgment which is the direct opposite of the witness\u2019s trial testimony. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., Deering\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code, \u00a7 1235 (1986 ed.) pp. 389-390; 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 701, at pp. 686-687; 2 Johnson, Cal. Trial Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 40.36[2], at pp. 40-123 - 40-124.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> At one point the majority spins the charming little fable of \u201cCharlie Fessup and the Three Clergy.\u201d As a parable designed to teach a lesson, however, it should have been saved for a different case. In the case before this court, Xavier was in Los Angeles at the scene of the crime, not in New York. So were \u201cthe bishop, the rabbi, and the minister\u201d and two of them initially told the police Xavier was the culprit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The majority opinion argues Xavier\u2019s several statements would be inadmissible as declarations against interest because they were able to identify some inconsistencies in isolated portions of those statements. I do not intend to bother to reconstruct the entire statements and compare where these statements are consistent and where they are inconsistent. Nor will I bother contrasting the relevance of the consistent portions with the relevance of the inconsistent portions. None of this analysis bears on the <em>admissibility </em>of these statements as declarations against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Consistency is <em>not </em>a hobgoblin for declarations against interest. There is no foundational requirement that all of a declarant\u2019s statements be consistent\u2014or even equally incriminating\u2014for one or more of them to be admissible. A jury is free to believe the most incriminating portions of each statement and reject the less incriminating portions. Consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>person making several such statements is subjecting himself to possible penal consequences for the most incriminating version of his involvement which can be constructed from the combined statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Each of Xavier\u2019s statements mentioned in the majority\u2019s \u201cinconsistency\u201d argument satisfies the applicable foundational requirement that the statement incriminate him. Combining the more incriminating portions of each creates a full scale confession of guilt. Accordingly, all are admissible. Even if there were a doubt about some, clearly the most incriminating ones must be admissible. It would make no more sense to exclude Xavier\u2019s several statements as declarations against penal interest because of some inconsistencies among them than it would to exclude several confessions a defendant might have given law enforcement because there were some inconsistencies among those confessions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\"> After dealing with the issues the majority raises in its \u201cResponse to Dissent,\u201d I note there remains a detritus of <em>ad hominem </em>comments directed at the dissent. These remarks are uncharacteristic and unworthy of members of this division. Regarding them as an aberration not a trend, I decline to respond in kind.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
