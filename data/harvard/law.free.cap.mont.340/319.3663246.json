The District Court also ordered that MSH could administer medications to D.V. through injections without D.V.\u2019s consent. D.V. appeals. We reverse and order the District Court to vacate the commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b62 D.V. raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance in violation of D.V.\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in allowing the testimony of the appointed \u201cfriend\u201d of D.V. when the court had earlier deemed that the \u201cfriend\u201d had a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">\u00b65 3. Whether the examination and evaluation by the court-appointed professional person satisfied statutory guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">\u00b66 Because we determine that Issue 2 is dispositive, we do not address Issues 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">\u00b67 On June 24, 2005, D.V., a 48-year-old man, was arrested for partner and/or family member assault and detained at the Cascade County Detention Center (the CCDC). D.V. allegedly threatened his mother when she refused to give him a checkbook which she indicated was for an account that had been closed. While incarcerated, D.V. refused to sleep, refused his medications, and was reportedly suffering a full-blown manic episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">\u00b68 On June 30, 2005, the Cascade County Attorney filed a Petition for involuntary commitment alleging that D.V. appeared to be suffering from a serious mental illness that rendered him a danger to himself and to the community. The Petition requested that the District Court order D.V. to undergo a mental health evaluation. The Petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>also requested that, if it was determined that D.V. was mentally ill, the court order that he be involuntarily committed to a mental health facility for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b69 The District Court held a hearing on July 5, 2005, to determine whether D.V. should undergo a mental health evaluation. D.V. was represented at the hearing by Vince Van der Hagen of the Cascade County Public Defender\u2019s Office. D.V. interrupted the proceedings several times stating, among other things, that he wanted to act as his own attorney, and calling the judge a \u201cjackass.\u201d At the close of the hearing, the court found that there was probable cause to believe that D.V. was seriously mentally ill, thus the court appointed Dr. Mark Mozer, a Great Falls psychiatrist, to conduct an examination. In addition, the court ordered D.V. to be transported to the psychiatric unit at MSH for detention pending further court appearances. Following the hearing, the District Court issued a written order for Dr. Mozer\u2019s evaluation and appointed D.V.\u2019s mother to be the \u201cfriend of respondent\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-102(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b610 On July 11, 2005, Carl Jensen of the Cascade County Public Defender\u2019s Office filed a motion for a confidential mental health evaluation of D.V. by another professional person of D.V.\u2019s choosing. The court granted the motion. On July 13,2005, Matthew McKittrick of the Cascade County Public Defender\u2019s Office advised the court that he and Dr. Mozer had gone to the CCDC for the purpose of conducting the court-ordered mental health evaluation of D.V., but D.V. was uncooperative to the extent that Dr. Mozer was unable to complete the evaluation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, D.V. refused to communicate with McKittrick and told him that he was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b611 A jury trial was held on July 25, 2005, regarding D.V.\u2019s involuntary commitment. Lawrence LaFountain of the Cascade County Public Defender\u2019s Office represented D.V. during the trial. During a conference with counsel and D.V. prior to voir dire, the court addressed several matters raised by D.V. and LaFountain. D.V. wanted a continuance of the trial claiming that he had been assaulted by the staff at MSH and that he needed to have a blood test for an alleged infection and an examination by a doctor for alleged injuries. The court noted that D.V. did not appear to have any injuries, hence the court declined D.V.\u2019s request to be sent to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u00b612 D.V. also claimed that the presiding Judge, the Hon. Julie Macek, had a conflict of interest because she had prosecuted a prior involuntary commitment case against him. Judge Macek stated for the record that she had no recollection of D.V., and LaFountain agreed that there was no legal conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b613 In addition, D.V. complained that he did not know who LaFountain was, that LaFountain had not called him during the previous week, that he was firing LaFountain, and that he wanted to represent himself. D.V. also complained about LaFountain\u2019s failure to subpoena any witnesses, but LaFountain responded that after reviewing the file, there were no witnesses he wished to subpoena for D.V. LaFountain also stated that he would not be calling the doctor who had conducted the independent evaluation of D.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b614 LaFountain informed the court that D.V. wanted to act as co-counsel and that LaFountain believed it would be detrimental to D.V.\u2019s case, especially if D.V. could not refrain from interrupting the proceedings. LaFountain also advised the court thatD.V. was behaving toward him in the same manner as he had behaved toward the other attorneys in LaFountain\u2019s office. LaFountain stated his belief that D.V.\u2019s detrimental behavior would continue and that D.V. should be removed from the courtroom during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b615 The District Court determined that it was in D.V.\u2019s best interests to have LaFountain represent him as LaFountain had a considerable amount of experience in such cases. Consequently, the court denied D.V.\u2019s request to fire LaFountain and represent himself. The court advised D.V. that the trial would proceed in an orderly fashion, that D.V. had a right to be present during the proceedings, and that if D.V. disrupted the proceedings, the court would admonish him outside the presence of the jury, but would not remove him unless D.V. refused to behave and follow the court\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b616 During voir dire, D.V. repeatedly interrupted the proceedings with questions, comments, and accusations. D.V. attempted to dismiss the entire jury panel at the conclusion of voir dire and made several remarks about certain prospective jurors. The District Court declared a recess and engaged D.V. in a lengthy discussion, outside the presence of the jury, in an effort to reduce D.V.\u2019s outbursts and to allow him to remain in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u00b617 When the trial resumed, Dr. Mozer testified that his mental evaluation of D.V. was limited by D.V.\u2019s refusal to cooperate, which Dr. Mozer attributed to D.V.\u2019s mental illness. Dr. Mozer further testified that he had provided care for D.V. since November 2004 and was familiar with D.V.\u2019s mental health history. Dr. Mozer stated that D.V. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>suffered from a schizoaffective disorder, a mental illness with features of both a mood disorder and a psychotic mental illness. Dr. Mozer described D.V.\u2019s symptoms and the recent progression of his illness, opining that in his present state of mind, D.V. posed a danger to himself and to others. Dr. Mozer recommended that D.V. be committed for mental health treatment. He testified that he considered local outpatient and inpatient programs and rejected them as unsuitable to D.V.\u2019s needs, especially since D.V. failed to participate in the past and refuses to participate at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b618 The State attempted to call D.V.\u2019s mother to testify about the incident which led to the assault charge and subsequent petition against D.V. LaFountain moved to disqualify her because she was serving as the court-appointed \u201cfriend\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-102(8), MCA. The court agreed that as both the complaining witness and the \u201cfriend,\u201d D.V.\u2019s mother had an inherent conflict of interest. Consequently, the court granted LaFountain\u2019s motion to preclude her from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b619 Thereafter, the State asked the court to appoint a different \u201cfriend\u201d for D.V. so that D.V.\u2019s mother could testify, but the court refused. The court did grant the State\u2019s motion for a short recess so that it could locate additional witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b620 In addition, LaFountain informed the court that D.V. wanted to put himself on the witness stand against LaFountain\u2019s advice and LaFountain inquired of the court whether D.V. could be kept from testifying if LaFountain and the \u201cfriend\u201d agreed that he should not. The court noted that \u00a7 53-21-119, MCA, provides that if the respondent is not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision about waiving his rights, those rights may be waived by respondent\u2019s counsel and the \u201cfriend\u201d of respondent, acting together, as long as a record is made of the reasons for the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b621 After trial resumed, the State called Robert Neal, a detention officer at the CCDC. Neal testified that when he attempted to assist one of the nurses at the CCDC in giving D.V. his medications, D.V. threw a bag of feces at him. The State also called Kathy Ann English, a social worker at CCDC, and Laurel Andercheck, a muse practitioner at CCDC. They both testified to D.V.\u2019s manic behavior while at CCDC describing D.V. as being agitated, angry, aggressive, hostile, abusive, and out of control. Andercheck also stated that D.V. hollered non-stop and refused to take his medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b622 LaFountain did not present any witnesses or exhibits on D.V.\u2019s behalf. LaFountain told the court, in chambers, that D.V. was becoming more agitated and combative as the trial progressed and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>he would concede that D.V. suffers from a serious mental illness. LaFountain indicated that he had discussed D.V.\u2019s condition with D.V.\u2019s mother, the appointed \u201cfriend,\u201d and that he decided to waive the remainder of the jury trial and proceed directly to the commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b623 D.V.\u2019s mother was called into chambers to make a record of her agreement with LaFountain. She stated that D.V. was not competent, that he was unable to make rational decisions, and that he was not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision about whether he should testify. She also expressed her agreement with LaFountain that the proceedings should be ended and that the court should consider the issues of commitment and placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b624 D.V. interrupted continuously throughout this conference, making various accusations and threats against his mother and LaFountain. LaFountain informed the court that D.V.\u2019s own expert had concurred with Dr. Mozer\u2019s assessment of D.V.\u2019s mental condition. LaFountain stated, and the State concurred, that under the statutes and relevant case law, it was appropriate to waive further jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b625 The District Court determined that there was a sufficient record to substantiate the allegations of the Petition. The court agreed that D.V. was suffering from a mental illness that was being aggravated by the trial proceedings. In addition, the court found that D.V. was not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision in his best interests at that point in time. Consequently, the court excused the jury and proceeded to consider whether D.V. should be committed to MSH or treated at a local facility. In that regard, the State argued that D.V. should be committed to MSH, while LaFountain argued that D.V. should be treated at a local facility such as Benefis in Great Falls or Pathways in Kalispell.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b626 In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order for Commitment to Inpatient Mental Health Care filed July 25, 2005, the court determined that D.V. was suffering from a mental disorder as defined in \u00a7 53-21-102(7), MCA; that he was unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health and safety; and that he posed an imminent threat of injury to himself and to others. The court concluded that the least restrictive placement for D.V., after considering all the alternatives necessary to protect D.V. and the public, and to permit effective treatment, was to commit D.V. to MSH. Thus, the court issued an Order committing D.V. to MSH for 90 days. The court also ordered that, if necessary, the attending physicians at MSH could administer medications to D.V. through intra-muscular injections or other prescribed means without D.V.\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u00b627 D.V. appeals the District Court\u2019s findings, conclusions and order.</p>\n<p id=\"Akc\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b628 Our review of the constitutional issues of due process and right to counsel involves questions of law and our review of such questions is plenary. <em>In re Mental Health of KG.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6 17, 306 Mont. 1, \u00b6 17, 29 P.3d 485, \u00b6 17 (citing <em>Pickens v.

On that basis, D.V. maintains that a determination of the issues raised here will assure that D.V., and others facing similar involuntary commitment in the future, will have their right to counsel more fully protected, will help set out guidelines for the appointment of \u201cfriends,\u201d and will give direction for mental health evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b630 \u201cMootness is a threshold issue which we must resolve before addressing the substantive merits of a dispute.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v.

No. 4, </em>214 Mont. at 364, 692 P.2d at 1263).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">\u00b631 In <em>Matter of N.B., </em>190 Mont. 319, 620 P.2d 1228 (1980), N.B. was involuntarily committed to Warm Springs State Hospital for three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>months of evaluation and treatment. We concluded in that case that the important constitutional questions presented there were not rendered moot by N.B.\u2019s release from the hospital. <em>N.B., </em>190 Mont. at 322-23, 620 P.2d at 1231. Similarly, after K.G.F. was involuntarily committed to Golden Triangle Mental Health, she contended that she was denied effective assistance of counsel during the course of the commitment proceedings. We concluded in A. <em>G.F. </em>that the controversy was not moot even though K.G.F. was no longer subject to the 90-day commitment order because the claimed constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in civil involuntary commitment proceedings is capable of repetition, yet evading review. <em>K.G.F., </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b632  We agree with D.V. that the important questions presented here are not rendered moot by his release from MSH. D.V.\u2019s 90-day involuntary commitment to MSH was too short in duration to allow the issues presented to be fully litigated prior to his release. Moreover, there is a reasonable expectation that D.V. could be subjected to the same action again in the future. Hence, the issues presented here are capable of repetition, yet evading review. <em>Heisler, </em>282 Mont. at 275, 937 P.2d at 48. Having determined that this case is not moot, we proceed to the dispositive issue raised by D.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b633 <em>Whether the District Court erred in allowing the testimony of the appointed \u201cfriend\u201d of D.V. when the court had earlier deemed that the \u201cfriend\u201d had a conflict of interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b634 The District Court appointed D.V.\u2019s mother as his \u201cfriend\u201d under \u00a7 53-21-102(8), MCA, to act in his behalf in \u201cdealing with legal proceedings, including consultation with legal counsel and others.\u201d D.V.\u2019s mother, however, was also the individual D.V. allegedly assaulted, which conduct brought about the commitment proceedings. On that basis, LaFountain moved to bar her from testifying at trial about the assault incident. The court agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">So I do not believe that it is appropriate to allow the testimony of the friend of the respondent in the position of a complaining witness. I think that\u2019s an inherent conflict of the respondent\u2019s right to privacy, the respondent\u2019s right to effective counsel, and would violate the whole reason that we appoint friends of respondents. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to have them also be the complainant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b635 Even though the court determined that D.V.\u2019s mother had a conflict of interest, the court did not appoint a substitute \u201cfriend\u201d to protect D.V.\u2019s interests. In addition, the court later permitted D.V.\u2019s mother, as the court-appointed \u201cfriend,\u201d to make a record of her consent to the waiver of D.V.\u2019s statutory rights. D.V. now asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>this was error as the inherent conflict of interest in this situation prevented his mother from being an effective \u201cfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b636  Section 53-21-102(8), MCA, defines the \u201cfriend\u201d of the respondent as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\"><em>any person willing and able to assist </em>a person suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment or a person alleged to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment in dealing with legal proceedings, including consultation with legal counsel and others. <em>The friend of respondent may be the next of kin, the person\u2019s conservator or legal guardian, if any, representatives of a charitable or religious organization, or any other person appointed by the court to perform the functions of a friend of respondent set out in this part. </em>Only one person may at any one time be the friend of respondent within the meaning of this part. In appointing a friend of respondent, the court shall consider the preference of the respondent. The court may at any time, for good cause, change its designation of the friend of respondent. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Thus, based on the language in this statute \u201cany person\u201d could be appointed by the court to act as the \u201cfriend\u201d of the respondent. The statute does not delineate any qualifications for acting as the \u201cfriend,\u201d nor does it set forth any sort of job description for the \u201cfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b637 D.V. makes a valid point that commitment proceedings are the only type of judicial proceeding where potentially anyone taken off the street may be appointed to act for another individual and given the power to waive that individual\u2019s rights and to have that individual stripped of their freedom and dignity for a period of up to six months. We agree with D.V. that in order to protect the privacy, liberty and due process rights of respondents in commitment proceedings, at a minimum, the \u201cfriend\u201d should be someone who is unbiased and objective and, certainly not, as in this case, the complaining witness. \u00b638 Section 53-21-119, MCA, gives the \u201cfriend\u201d of respondent enormous power over the respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">Waiver of rights. (1) A person may waive his rights, or if the person is not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision, <em>these rights may be waived by his counsel and friend of respondent </em>acting together if a record is made of the reasons for the waiver. The right to counsel may not be waived. The right to treatment provided for in this part may not be waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">(2) <em>The right of the respondent to be physically present at a hearing may also be waived by his attorney and the friend of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>respondent with the concurrence of the professional person and the judge </em>upon a finding supported by facts that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">(a) the presence of the respondent at the hearing would be likely to seriously adversely affect his mental condition; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(b) an alternative location for the hearing in surroundings familiar to the respondent would not prevent such adverse effects on his mental condition. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Thus, without any proper criteria delineated in our statutes for appointing an unbiased individual to act as the \u201cfriend\u201d of respondent, an individual acting as the \u201cfriend,\u201d but who did not have the respondent\u2019s best interests in mind, could waive respondent\u2019s rights, have respondent committed to a mental institution, and thereby, deprive respondent of his liberty and potentially gain control of respondent\u2019s property. Such a conflict of interest is contrary to the rights afforded every Montanan under Article II, \u00a7 17 of the Montana Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b639 We stated in <em>K.G.F. </em>that \u201cone purpose of our laws governing the treatment of \u2018seriously mentally ill\u2019 persons is to \u2018ensure that due process of law is accorded any person coming under the provisions of [Title 53, Chapter 21].\u2019 \u201d <em>K.G.F., </em>\u00b6 26 (quoting \u00a7 53-21-101(4), MCA). Hence, we constructed in <em>K.G.F. </em>a standard for ensuring the fundamental fairness of civil commitment proceedings as they relate to the effectiveness of counsel and we set forth the following authority for doing so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\"><em>Matter of W.M. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 225, 229, 828 P.2d 378, 381 (stating that civil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection, and citing <em>Addington v.

Ed. 2d 323, 330-31); <em>Matter of Shennum </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 442, 450-51, 684 P.2d 1073, 1078 (stating that procedural safeguards in commitment cases were \u201cinserted by the legislature because of the calamitous effect of a commitment: a deprivation of a person's liberty for up to three months ... and the inevitable damage to a person's reputation\u201d). <em>See also Foucha v. Louisiana </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 71, 80, 112 S. Ct. 1780, 1785, 118 L. Ed. 2d 437 (stating that freedom from bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the due process clause from arbitrary governmental action); <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S. Ct. 893, 902, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (stating that due process is \u201cflexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>K.G.F., </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b640 We further stated in <em>K.G.F., </em>that courts must safeguard the due process rights of the individual involved at every stage of the proceedings. <em>K. </em>G.F., \u00b6 42 (citing <em>Matter of Mental Health of </em>L.C.B., 253 Mont. 1, 7, 830 P.2d 1299, 1303 (1992)). That necessarily includes the appointment of the \u201cMend\u201d of respondent at the time of the initial appearance. And, a standard for ensuring the fundamental fairness of civil commitment proceedings as they relate to the appointment of the \u201cMend\u201d of respondent should be established. Consequently, we urge the Legislature to amend Title 53, Chapter 21, and set forth some qualifications or criteria to appoint only unbiased and objective individuals to act as \u201cfriend\u201d of the respondent in commitment cases. \u00b641 [3] In this case, we hold that the District Court erred in appointing D.V.\u2019s mother to act as his \u201cMend\u201d when she was also the complaining witness. Such appointment was a conflict of interest and prejudiced D.V.\u2019s right to a fair trial, thus we reverse on this issue. \u00b642 The dissent implies that we object to the appointed \u201cfriend\u201d being the respondent\u2019s \u201cnext of kin\u201d or someone with \u201cforeknowledge or previous involvement with a respondent.\u201d On the contrary, what we fault in this case is that the \u201cprevious involvement\u201d entails the \u201cMend\u201d being the victim of the crime which brought about the commitment proceedings. We are not saying that D.V.\u2019s mother was the wrong person to act as his \u201cfriend\u201d because she is his mother, or as the dissent characterizes it, that she is \u201ctaint[ed]\u201d because of her kinship with D.V., we are saying that she was \u201ctaint[ed]\u201d because she was the victim of the crime that put D.V. into this situation. Whether or not D.V.\u2019s mother testified in court about the actual crime, the fact remains that she was his victim. D.V.\u2019s due process rights cannot be fully served by having the victim of his crime determine whether or not he should be committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b643 Moreover, while, as the dissent asserts, the record here may \u201cscream[] out the necessity of D.V.\u2019s commitment,\u201d the victim of D.V.\u2019s crime should not be the one turning those screams into action. D.V.\u2019s mother was not the right person to represent D.V.\u2019s interests in this case. And, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion that \u201cany conflict of interest between D.V. and his Mend\u2019 clearly did not affect the outcome of the commitment hearing,\u201d in actuality the conflict prevented the commitment hearing from proceeding-D.V.\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d and his attorney made the decision to stop the hearing-thus, it not only <em>affected </em>the outcome, it <em>prevented </em>any outcome from the hearing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b644 Reversed with instructions that the District Court vacate the order of commitment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> D.V. was transported from MHS to the CCDC solely for the mental evaluation. He was returned to MHS immediately following his meeting with McKittrick and Dr. Mozer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b354-4\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AEI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b645 Vacating D.V.\u2019s commitment is not only unnecessary by reason of his mother\u2019s service as his \u201cfriend,\u201d but such relief has not even been requested by D.V. Further, it is not this Court\u2019s role to add its own requirements to the statute governing appointment of a \u201cfriend.\u201d Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b646 D.V. argues that his mother should not have been appointed as his \u201cfriend\u201d and as a consequence urges that \u201cher opinion should not be considered\u201d by this Court. His only other request is that \u201c[fjuture commitment cases should make certain that the appointed Friend, although apparently not needing any qualifications of any kind, certainly should be an objective party.\u201d He does not ask that his commitment be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b647 And for good reason. D.V. has presented no evidence or argument that he was prejudiced by his mother\u2019s participation in the commitment proceeding, and indeed, no prejudice to D.V. can be drawn from this record. To the contrary, the record here screams out the necessity of D.V.\u2019s commitment, and any conflict of interest between D.V. and his \u201cfriend\u201d clearly did not affect the outcome of the commitment hearing. D.V.\u2019s counsel decided to abort the trial without any testimony having been given by D.V.\u2019s mother, because the District Court had excluded it. Any objectively unbiased \u201cfriend\u201d who may have been appointed could not have come to any other reasonable conclusion but that D.V.\u2019s commitment was abundantly necessary. As well described by the Court\u2019s opinion, D.V.\u2019s lack of competence was undisputable, given his behavior prior to and during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b648 \u201cThis Court has repeatedly stated that a district court\u2019s decision will not be reversed or remanded when the eventual result of the case would be the same without the error.\u201d <em>In re S.C., </em>264 Mont. 24, 30, 869 P.2d 266, 269 (1994) (citation omitted). \u201cIt is well established that no civil case shall be reversed by reason of error which would have no significant impact upon the result; if there is no showing of substantial injustice, the error is harmless.\u201d <em>In re C.B. &amp; J.B., </em>2001 MT 42, \u00b6 16, 304 Mont. 252, \u00b6 16, 20 P.3d 117, \u00b6 16 (citation and internal quotations omitted). There being no question that the result here would have been the same even with a different \u201cfriend,\u201d we should not vacate D.V.\u2019s commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u00b649 Secondly, the Court urges the Legislature to review Title 53, Chapter 21, in order to designate qualifications and guidelines in selecting individuals to act as \u201cfriends\u201d in commitment cases. I agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>with the Court\u2019s recommendation to the Legislature. However, the Court then proceeds without legislative participation and inserts its own requirement that a \u201cfriend\u201d must have no conflicts of interest. Merely because the Legislature did not provide guidelines for appointing a \u201cfriend\u201d does not mean it is this Court\u2019s duty or prerogative to insert them. \u201c[0]ur role in interpreting a statute is simply to ascertain what is in terms or in substance contained within that statute, neither omitting what has been inserted nor inserting what has been omitted by the legislature.\u201d <em>MacMillan v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>285 Mont. 202, 208, 947 P.2d 75, 78 (1997) (emphasis added) (citing \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b650 The Court should be mindful of the function served by the \u201cfriend.\u201d The \u201cfriend\u201d is not the respondent\u2019s legal counsel, but, rather, is designed to serve a very different purpose. A \u201cfriend\u201d must be \u201cwilling and able to assist a person suffering from a mental disorder,\u201d may be \u201cthe next of kin\u201d and is selected in consideration of the respondent\u2019s preferences. Section 53-21-102(8), MCA (2003). The \u201cfriend\u201d is supposed to help the respondent through the process, including consultations with legal counsel and other professionals, and past familiarity with the respondent is encouraged. Section 53-21-102(8), MCA (2003). However, there will be few \u201cnext of kin\u201d who, though able to assist a respondent, do not carry the \u201ctaint\u201d of foreknowledge or previous involvement with a respondent. It is unwise for the Court to impose restrictions without proper consideration of the unique role to be fulfilled by the \u201cfriend\u201d and the difficult position in which a commitment proceeding may place the respondent\u2019s next of kin who are called upon to help the respondent, whose rights are no doubt the priority. There are rarely easy solutions, and I would await the Legislature\u2019s study and action on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b651 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-6\">JUSTICE WARNER and JUSTICE MORRIS join the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
