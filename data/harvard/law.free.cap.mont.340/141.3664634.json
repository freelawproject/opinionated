We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b63 Did the WCC err when it interpreted \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), to allow the use of multiple methods to calculate Sturchio\u2019s average actual wage from concurrent employments?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\u00b64 On June 11, 2005, Augustina Sturchio (Sturchio) suffered a back injury while working as an on-call certified nursing assistant (CNA) for Priorcare at Liberty County Nursing Home in Chester, Montana. Wausau accepted the claim and began paying medical and wage-loss benefits. At the time of her injury, Sturchio was concurrently employed with five employers: Priorcare, as an on-call CNA; Prairie Travelers, as an on-call CNA; Toole County Ambulance, as an on-call EMT; Marias Medical Center, as an on-call CNA; and Saints Nursing, as a traveling CNA. Sturchio\u2019s employers differed in their methods of paying compensation with some paying weekly and others paying sporadically based on the as-needed work she performed for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">\u00b65 Sturchio filed a claim with the WCC alleging, among other things, that she was entitled to higher compensation benefits because Wausau incorrectly calculated her average actual wage from concurrent employments when it determined her wage-loss benefit. Wausau responded that Sturchio was not entitled to additional benefits. After conducting discovery, the parties submitted the case to the WCC on a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">\u00b66 The parties agreed that Sturchio was employed by five concurrent employers when she was injured and that \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), governed the calculation methods to determine Sturchio\u2019s average actual wage; they disagreed, however, as to the proper method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>calculating her average actual wage. Sturchio argued that each of the concurrent employments should be considered individually and that the average actual wage should be determined pursuant to the statutory method best suited to each employment\u2019s particular circumstances. Wausau responded that the statute authorizes specific methods of calculating wages and that, while more than one of the methods may be appropriate, only one method should be used for all concurrent employments-the injured worker cannot \u201cpick and choose\u201d which method to use depending on each individual employment. The WCC rejected Wausau\u2019s single-calculation method and held that Sturchio correctly interpreted \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003). The WCC then calculated Sturchio\u2019s average actual wage using this interpretation. Wausau appeals the WCC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b67 We review for correctness the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Simms v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 511, \u00b6 11, 116 P.3d 773, \u00b6 11. We apply the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act) effective at the time an employee suffers an injury. <em>Wilson v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins., </em>273 Mont. 313, 316, 903 P.2d 785, 787 (1995). The 2003 version of the Act governed when Sturchio was injured on June 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b68 Did the WCC err when it interpreted \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), to allow the use of multiple methods to calculate Sturchio\u2019s average actual wage from concurrent employments?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b69 Wausau asserts that the WCC abandoned the rules of statutory construction and failed to defer to the Legislature when it interpreted \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), as allowing Sturchio to determine her average actual wage pursuant to both subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b). Wausau maintains that Sturchio could calculate her wages under either subsection, but she could not use both.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b610 The WCC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), presents a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 150, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 320, \u00b6 15, 50 P.3d 530, \u00b6 15. When interpreting statutes, we seek to implement the Legislature\u2019s objectives. <em>Boettcher v. Montana Guar. Fund, </em>2007 MT 69, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 393, \u00b6 19, 154 P.3d 629, \u00b6 19. The statute\u2019s plain language controls our interpretation if we can discern the legislative intent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words. <em>Boettcher, </em>\u00b6 19. Further, we refuse to insert \u201cwhat has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b611 Section 39-71-123, MCA (2003), sets forth the methods for calculating an injured employee\u2019s wages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">(3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b), for compensation benefit purposes, the average actual earnings for the four pay periods immediately preceding the injury are the employee\u2019s wages, except that if the term of employment for the same employer is less than four pay periods, the employee\u2019s wages are the hourly rate times the number of hours in a week for which the employee was hired to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">(b) For good cause shown, if the use of the last four pay periods does not accurately reflect the claimant\u2019s employment history with the employer, the wage may be calculated by dividing the total earnings for an additional period of time, not to exceed 1 year prior to the date of injury, by the number of weeks in that period, including periods of idleness or seasonal fluctuations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">(4) (a) For the purpose of calculating compensation benefits for an employee working concurrent employments, the average actual wages must be calculated as provided in subsection (3). As used in this subsection, \u201cconcurrent employment\u201d means employment in which the employee was actually employed at the time of the injury and would have continued to be employed without a break in the term of employment if not for the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b612 Wausau argues that the WCC effectively amended subsection (4)(a) to read: \u201cthe average actual wages must be calculated as provided in subsection (3)(a) or (b) or both.\u201d (Emphasis added by Wausau.) Wausau reasons that, because \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (2003), refers to subsection (3) to calculate the wage-loss benefit for concurrent employments, wages for concurrent employments must be calculated one of two ways \u2014 either pursuant to subsection (3)(a) or subsection (3)(b), but not both subsections. Wausau further argues that \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA (2003), the Legislature\u2019s public policy declaration requiring that wage-loss benefits \u201cbear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost[,]\u201d cannot be used to expand the calculation methods. Wausau relies on <em>King v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>wherein we refused to use the public policy provision to vary the specific provisions of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA. 282 Mont. 335, 339, 938 P.2d 607, 609-10 (1997). We disagree with Wausau\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003). \u00b613 Section 39-71-123, MCA (2003), focuses on determining an injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>employee\u2019s proper wages. The statute defines \u201cwages\u201d as \u201call remuneration paid for services performed by an employee for an employer <em>...\u201d </em>Section 39-71-123(1), MCA (2003). Subsection (1) describes the employer as a singular entity and subsection (3) instructs that the \u201caverage actual earnings for the four pay periods immediately preceding the injury\u201d constitute the employee\u2019s wages, unless that calculation fails to accurately reflect the injured employee\u2019s employment history. The statute provides alternate calculation methods for situations in which the four-pay-period method inadequately approximates an employee\u2019s average actual earnings. Section 39-71-123(3), MCA (2003). Thus, \u00a7 39-71-123(1) and (3), MCA (2003), detail the appropriate calculation methods to determine an injured employee\u2019s average actual earnings with a single employer.</p>\n<p id=\"AMq\">\u00b614 As with injured workers employed by a single employer, \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(c), MCA (2003), provides that employees working for multiple employers also receive a wage-loss benefit based on their average actual wages. The only calculation difference between injured employees with single employment and those with concurrent employments is that the latter are entitled to benefits based on \u201cthe aggregate of average actual wages of all employments!)]\u201d Section 39-71-123(4)(c), MCA(2003). Rather than restate the calculation methods, the statute simply instructs that the methods applicable to single employment also apply to concurrent employment: \u201c[flor the purposes of calculating compensation benefits for an employee working concurrent employments, the average actual wages must be calculated as provided in subsection (3).\u201d Section 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"Ahu\">\u00b615  Though we agree that only one of the methods described in subsection (3) can ultimately apply to individual employments, the statutory language fails to support Wausau\u2019s position that an employee\u2019s concurrent employments must be grouped together and considered as a single employment to determine the employee\u2019s actual average wage. We refuse to \u201cinsert what has been omitted\u201d from the statute, and thus, we reject Wausau\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Section 1-2-101, MCA. A reasonable reading of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), in its entirety, supports the WCC\u2019s interpretation that the calculation methods contained in subsection (3) should apply to each individual employment comprising the concurrent employments in the same manner they apply to individual employments that are singular. \u00b616 Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s express public policy supports the WCC\u2019s interpretation and precludes the interpretation offered by Wausau. Montana law instructs that wage-loss benefits \u201cshould bear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of work-related injury or disease.\u201d Section 39-71-105(1), MCA (2003). As the WCC recognized, determining Sturchio\u2019s average actual wage for her individual employments would require using different statutory methods: the average actual wage for some of Sturchio\u2019s employments properly would be determined under subsection (3)(a) and others under subsection (3)(b). The WCC rejected Wausau\u2019s argument for a single-calculation method, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">This would require injured workers with concurrent employments to sacrifice the reasonable relationship between their wage-loss benefits and their actual wages lost for the sake of using a single calculation method, when the express language of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA [(2003)], recognizes the validity of using different calculation methods for different employment situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">We agree with the WCC; the only interpretation that honors the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), and furthers the legislative policy that wage-loss benefits \u201cbear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost\u201d is the interpretation the WCC employed-applying subsection (3) to each concurrent employment and then using the resulting figures to calculate the employee\u2019s aggregate average actual wage. Section 39-71-105(1), MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b617 Additionally, Wausau finds no support from our holding in <em>King. </em>The injured worker in <em>King </em>requested that this Court create an exception to the \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA, calculation methods because a three-pay-period calculation would have entitled her to greater benefits than the four-pay-period calculation detailed in the statute. 282 Mont, at 338, 938 P.2d at 609. Ring argued that her proposed calculation method would bear a more reasonable relationship to her actual earnings in furtherance of the public policy expressed in \u00a7 39-71-105(1), MCA. Ring\u2019s proposed calculation method, however, was inconsistent with the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA, and we stated that public policy could not be used to ignore the Legislature\u2019s express statutory language. <em>King, </em>282 Mont, at 339, 938 P.2d at 609-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b618 In the present case, a statutory interpretation that allows flexible compensation calculations for concurrent employments is consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003). Moreover, the public policy underlying the Act supports the WCC\u2019s interpretation. Though, in <em>King, </em>we refused to allow the public policy provisions of \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA, to displace the express language of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA, the Legislature specifically directs that \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA (2003), be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>used to interpret the Act. Wage-loss benefits are designed to assist injured workers at a reasonable cost to employers and the benefit should \u201cbear a reasonable relationship to the actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.\u201d Section 39-71-105, MCA (2003). Adopting Wausau\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-123(3) and (4), MCA (2003), would negate the Legislature\u2019s express intent that the wage-loss benefit reasonably relate to the actual wages lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">\u00b619  The WCC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA (2003), honors the statute\u2019s plain language and furthers the principles set forth in \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA (2003).
