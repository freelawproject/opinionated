We affirmed Price\u2019s conviction on direct appeal in <em>State v. Price, </em>2003 MT 373N, 319 Mont. 424, 82 P.3d 37 (Table). Price now appeals the order of the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County, denying his petition for postconviction relief. We reverse and remand for entry of an order granting Price a new appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b63 Did Price\u2019s appellate defense counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to raise on direct appeal the issue of Price\u2019s absence from numerous in-chambers trial proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b64 On August 21, 2001, Price was charged with sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. Price\u2019s trial began on June 3, 2002, with Timothy J. Whalen serving as Price\u2019s defense counsel. Throughout the course of the trial, twelve in-chambers conferences took place between the District Court judge and counsel for the State and defendant. The topics discussed at those conferences encompassed a broad range, including but not limited to jury selection, presentation of witnesses and witness testimony, exclusion of evidence, removal of certain jurors after trial began, and basic scheduling matters. However, Price was present for only one of those conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u00b65 In eight of the eleven in-chambers conferences for which Price was absent, Whalen purported to waive Price\u2019s right to be present when questioned by the judge about Price\u2019s absence. In the other three conferences, Whalen did not waive Price\u2019s right to be present. At the postconviction hearing, Whalen testified that he believed he had advised Price, prior to trial, of Price\u2019s right to be present at all in-chambers meetings between the court and counsel, and that Price declined to participate in those meetings. No written record of that waiver was made by Whalen or the court. Price testified that Whalen did not advise him that the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution guaranteed him the right to be present during all critical stages of his trial. Price testified that he would have attended the in-chambers conferences if he had been told of his right to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">\u00b66 After Price was convicted he retained Gary Wilcox to handle his direct appeal. Wilcox raised two evidentiary issues in that appeal: whether the District Court erred in excluding evidence of a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>inconsistent statement by the victim, and whether the District Court erred in excluding evidence designed to show that the victim\u2019s stepbrother committed the offense charged. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15. Wilcox did not raise the issue of Price\u2019s absence from the eleven in-chambers meetings and Whalen\u2019s purported waiver of Price\u2019s constitutional right to be present at eight of those meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b67 Wilcox testified that he did not raise this issue because he had concluded the issue was more appropriate for postconviction relief, given that Whalen\u2019s purported waiver of Price\u2019s right to be present could constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Wilcox admitted that he was unaware of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Bird, </em>2001 MT 2, 308 Mont. 75, 43 P.3d 266, which was released before he filed Price\u2019s appeal, and which held that a trial court must advise a defendant of his constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of the trial and obtain an on-the-record waiver by the defendant if he chooses not to attend those critical stages. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b68 After this Court affirmed Price\u2019s conviction on direct appeal, Price retained new counsel to file a petition for postconviction relief in the District Court. In addition to challenging several alleged errors by his trial counsel, Price alleged that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to appeal the issue of Price\u2019s absence from the in-chambers meetings and Whalen\u2019s waiver of Price\u2019s right to be present.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court applied the <em>Strickland </em>test to Price\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel against Wilcox. <em>See Strickland v. Wash., </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984); <em>State v. Hagen, </em>2002 MT 190, \u00b6 37, 311 Mont. 117, \u00b6 37, 53 P.3d 885, \u00b6 37. The District Court found that Price satisfied the first prong because Wilcox\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, in that he failed to apply <em>Bird </em>and challenge Price\u2019s absence from in-chambers meetings on appeal. Under the second prong, however, the District Court found that Price was not prejudiced because, taking into account only the three meetings at which Whalen did <em>not </em>waive Price\u2019s right to be present, the outcome would not have changed had he been there. With respect to the other eight meetings for which Whalen waived Price\u2019s right to be present, the District Court briefly observed that such meetings were merely \u201cprocedural.\u201d Price now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Hendricks v. State, </em>2006 MT 22, \u00b6 10, 331 Mont. 47, \u00b6 10, 128 P.3d 1017, \u00b6 10. \u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 10. \u00b610 A district court\u2019s determination of whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at the critical stages of trial has been violated presents a question of constitutional law, for which our review is plenary. <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 160, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 476, \u00b6 10, 139 P.3d 159, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b611 <em>Did Price\u2019s appellate defense counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to raise on direct appeal the issue of Price\u2019s absence from numerous in-chambers trial proceedings without a valid waiver of his constitutional right to be present?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b612 \u201cThe right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment, and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 11, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 11. \u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are analyzed, like those of trial counsel, according to the standard set forth in <em>Strickland.\u201d Hagen, </em>\u00b6 37. A petitioner must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test in order to prove that appellate counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective. Under the first prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Hagen, </em>\u00b6 37. Under the second prong, a petitioner must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the petitioner would have prevailed on appeal. <em>Hagen, </em>\u00b6 37. \u201cThe first prong carries a strong presumption in favor of the State, as counsel is allowed wide latitude in deciding what tactics [he] should, and should not, employ in defending [his] client.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u00b613  In addition to the right of effective assistance of counsel, a criminal defendant has a federal constitutional right to be present at all criminal proceedings against him, pursuant to the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>S. Ct. 1057, 1058 (1970). Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution also expressly guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be present at his trial. <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 47, 327 Mont. 196, \u00b6 47, 113 P.3d 281, \u00b6 47. In <em>Riggs, </em>we noted that \u201c[s]ince the right to appear and defend in person is found within Montana\u2019s Declaration of Rights, it is a fundamental right.\u201d <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 47. We also quoted this Court\u2019s 1922 discussion of the right to appear and defend, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1NQ\">No principle of law, relating to criminal procedure, is better settled than that, in felony cases, nothing should be done in the absence of the prisoner. It is his unquestioned right to be confronted with his accusers and witnesses. He has the legal right to be present when the jury are hearing his case, and at all times during the proceeding of the trial, when anything is done which in any manner affects his right[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 48 (quoting <em>State v. Reed, </em>65 Mont. 51, 58, 210 P. 756, 758 (1922)).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b614 Under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the District Court concluded, and we agree, that Wilcox\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. As the court observed, Wilcox had access to standard legal databases for researching case law, and could have easily found <em>Bird </em>and other case law discussing Price\u2019s right to be present. Knowledge of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bird </em>would have led appellate counsel, in the reasonable performance of his duties, to include Price\u2019s absence from in-chambers meetings in the direct appeal. Thus, the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b615 As stated above, the second prong of <em>Strickland </em>requires that Price establish a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, but for appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance, Price would have succeeded on appeal. <em>Hagen, </em>\u00b6 37. \u2018\u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u2019 but it does not require that a defendant demonstrate that he would have been acquitted.\u201d State <em>v. Rogers, </em>2001 MT 165, \u00b6 14, 306 Mont. 130, \u00b6 14, 32 P.3d 724, \u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068). While acquittal is not the result sought in this case, it is nonetheless true that Price need not establish that success on direct appeal was certain; rather, he must show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of that outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b616 We agree with Price that Wilcox\u2019s failure to raise the issue of Price\u2019s absence from in-chambers meetings created a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d of Price\u2019s direct appeal. In its order denying Price\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, the District Court focused only on the three in-chambers meetings at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>which Whalen did not waive Price\u2019s right to be present and did not analyze, except by brief reference, the other eight conferences from which Price was absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b617 In <em>Bird, </em>the District Court met with several prospective jurors in-chambers during the State\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>after the jurors indicated they had personal experiences with domestic violence. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 12. Although the prosecutor and defense counsel were in attendance for the in-chambers meetings, the defendant was not. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 12. Later, the court recessed again and allowed counsel to exercise their peremptory challenges in chambers. Once again the defendant was not present. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 14. Despite the fact that defense counsel waived his client\u2019s right to be present after the fact, we held that the defendant\u2019s exclusion from the in-chambers <em>voir dire </em>proceedings was structural error necessitating a new trial. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b618 In contrast to our holding in <em>Bird, </em>we held in <em>Riggs </em>that two in-chambers meetings between the district court judge, counsel, and two jurors did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. There, one juror was brought into chambers to briefly have his concerns addressed after he recognized one of the witnesses as a former student of his. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 44. The juror was briefly questioned, and both counsel agreed the juror could continue to serve. Later, a second juror was brought into chambers after he expressed concern that he might lose a nonrefundable airline ticket for a flight scheduled to depart the following day. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 45. The district court advised the juror that the jury might have to deliberate into the night, but that he would not have to sacrifice his ticket. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 45. When the defendant challenged these two meetings as infringing his right to be present at all critical stages of the trial, we observed that the meetings were merely \u201cbrief interludes in a complex trial... and defendant had no role to play at either.\u201d <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54 (citations omitted). Thus, we held that the defendant\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages was not infringed. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b619  Here, the State argues that Riggs supports the District Court\u2019s holding, because a defendant need not be present at every in-chambers meeting that occurs. However, this appeal, addressing Price\u2019s claim that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the issue, need not reach the merits of whether Price\u2019s absence actually constituted error requiring a new trial. It is enough to conclude that there was a legitimate legal basis upon which to raise the issue and which is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the appeal. Clearly, this Court\u2019s precedent provided such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>sufficient grounds. Appellate counsel should have raised the issue on direct appeal, and his failure to do so constituted prejudicial error. \u00b620 Accordingly, we reverse the denial of the postconviction petition on the grounds discussed herein and remand for entry of an order by the District Court granting Price an opportunity for a new appeal upon this issue. The entry of the order by the District Court will initiate the time and procedural requirements for completion of the appellate process.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> In the appeal <em>subjudice, </em>Price does not challenge the District Court\u2019s denial of his ineffective assistance claims against Whalen, his trial counsel. Thus, only Price\u2019s postconviction claim against Wilcox is raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
