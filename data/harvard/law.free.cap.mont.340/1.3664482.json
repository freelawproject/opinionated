We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred by denying Hastings\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b63 In 1998, the youth court of the Seventh Judicial District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Dawson. County, adjudicated then-16-year-old Hastings as a delinquent youth upon Hastings\u2019 admissions that he had committed acts which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted five felony offenses, including one offense of sexual intercourse without consent. The court committed Hastings to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for placement at the Threshold Program in Deer Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b64 On February 24,2000, shortly after Hastings turned 18, the youth court transferred jurisdiction of Hastings to the district court and placed him under adult supervision until age 25, based on the parties\u2019 stipulation that Hastings had not successfully completed sex offender treatment at Threshold, had not paid $3,625.52 in restitution and was at high risk to re-offend. In June of 2000, the district court entered an order revoking Hastings\u2019 \u201csuspended sentence\u2019-apparently referring to the transfer order-upon determining Hastings had violated conditions set forth in that order by the youth court. Among other things, the revocation order stated that \u201cfor each of the five (5) offenses, DAN HASTINGS shall be committed to the [DOC] for a period of five (5) years with recommendation... for commitment to Prerelease if appropriate, upon the Defendant\u2019s compliance with the following conditions: 1. The Defendant shall be required to register as a Level II Sex Offender.\u201d The five-year commitments were to run concurrently. Hastings spent approximately four years in Montana State Prison, and was transferred in November of2004 to Alternatives, Inc., a pre-release center in Billings. His commitment pursuant to the revocation order was entirely discharged on May 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b65 In June of 2005, the State of Montana charged Hastings by Information in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, with the felony offense of failure to register as a sexual offender \u201con or about May 9, 2005 to May 27, 2005.\u201d According to the supporting affidavit, Hastings had registered as a sex offender with the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Office on or about December 4, 2004, giving his address as Alternatives, Inc. in Billings. The affidavit further states a detective determined that after being \u201ccompletely discharged from the sentence on May 8, 2005,\u201d Hastings had not returned to live at Alternatives, Inc., and had not changed his address with the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Office. In addition, the affidavit states the Billings Police Department arrested Hastings on May 22, 2005, on a charge of misdemeanor theft, and he gave the arresting officers an address subsequently learned to have been false. The detective discovered Hastings\u2019 true address on or about May 27, 2005 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>and arrested him there for failure to maintain registration as a sex offender. The supporting affidavit states that Hastings had been \u201cconvicted of sexual intercourse without consent\u201d and \u201c[a]s a result, the Defendant is required to register as a sexual offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b66 Hastings moved to dismiss the charge. He asserted that, because he had not been convicted of a sexual offense, neither Montana statutes nor the revocation order required him to register as a sex offender after the discharge of his sentence on May 8, 2005. After the State responded, the District Court denied Hastings\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b67 Hastings then pled guilty to the offense of failure to register as a sex offender, reserving the right to appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. The court entered judgment and sentence, and Hastings appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b68 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law. We review conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>State v. Villanueva, </em>2005 MT 192, \u00b6 9, 328 Mont. 135, \u00b6 9,118 P.3d 179, \u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Hastings\u2019 motion to dismiss ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\u00b610 Title 46, chapter 23, part 5, and \u00a7 46-18-255, MCA, make up the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (SVORA). Section 46-23-501, MCA. A \u201csexual or violent offender,\u201d defined as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexual or violent offense,\u201d must register with law enforcement-by providing an address and, on some occasions, other information-at certain times. Sections 46-23-502(7), -504, and -505, MCA. In imposing a sentence on an offender convicted of a sexual or violent offense, the sentencing judge may not waive the registration requirements of SVORA. Section 46-18-201(7), MCA. With exceptions not at issue here, a \u201csexual offender\u201d must register for life. Section 46-23-506(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\u00b611 Before addressing the District Court\u2019s reasoning regarding the relevant statutes, we first note that Hastings is not challenging the Seventh Judicial District Court\u2019s authority to impose the registration requirement in the first instance. Indeed, he could not do so, since his time to appeal from the order imposing that requirement has long passed. Hastings\u2019 argument is that he was required to register only during his five-year commitment, which was discharged on May 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>2005-before his alleged failure to register on or about May 9 to May 27, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b612 In this respect, Hastings asserts that nothing in the revocation order authorizes a lifelong registration requirement under SVORA. The State responds that the revocation order reflects a \u201cclear substantive intent\u201d to impose the SVORA requirement. The language of the revocation order, as set forth above, reasonably could be interpreted in two ways: (1) setting forth the registration requirement as a condition for the District Court\u2019s recommendation to the DOC for prerelease; or (2) recommending Hastings be released to a prerelease program at the DOC\u2019s discretion, and requiring him to register during his participation in such a program. In either event, the absence of any mention of SVORA mandates a conclusion that nothing in the revocation order supports an intent by the Seventh Judicial District Court to trigger SVORA provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b613 In denying Hastings\u2019 motion to dismiss, the District Court provided several statutory and jurisprudential analyses. On appeal, Hastings\u2019 overarching argument is that the District Court erred in concluding he had been required to register pursuant to SVORA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b614 The District Court determined that, after Hastings\u2019 transfer to district court in 2000, the Seventh Judicial District Court had imposed a registration requirement as an \u201cadult\u201d condition of a new sentence and, therefore, SVORA required him to register for life. In interpreting a statute to discern legislative intent, we first look to the statute\u2019s plain language. If that language is clear and unambiguous, no farther interpretation is required. <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 178, \u00b6 11, 152 P.3d 1288, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b615  Section 46-18-201(7), MCA, and the SVORA statutes require a \u201cconviction\u201d before SVORA registration requirements may be imposed. The statutes are unambiguous in that regard. Thus, because it is undisputed that Hastings\u2019 youth court adjudication did not constitute a \u201cconviction\u201d as contemplated in \u00a7 46-23-502(7), MCA, the SVORA registration requirements could not be imposed by a district court under those statutes. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 41-5-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b616  The District Court also reasoned, however, that \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(c), MCA, provided a means to \u201cbypassO\u201d the conviction requirement so that SVORA could apply to adjudicated youths. Section 41-5-1513(l)(c), MCA, provides, in part, that \u201cthe youth court may ... require a youth found to be a delinquent youth, as the result of the commission of an offense that would be a sexual offense or violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>offense, as defined in 46-23-502, if committed by an adult, to register as a sexual or violent offender pursuant to Title 46, chapter 23, part 5.\u201d This language is unambiguous in vesting a youth court with the discretion to impose a SVORA registration requirement in an appropriate case. Here, however, it is undisputed that the youth court did not impose a SVORA registration requirement. Thus, while the District Court did not err in concluding that \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(c), MCA, provides a means for a youth court to \u201cbypass\u201d the general requirement for a conviction in SVORA, no such \u201cbypass\u201d occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u00b617 Citing to statements regarding the purposes of SVORA set forth in <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, 317 Mont. 481, 78 P.3d 829, the District Court also determined the basic policy of SVORA, and its incorporation into the Montana Youth Court Act in \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(c), MCA, reflected the Montana Legislature\u2019s intent to extend the scope of SVORA to adjudicated youths. With regard to <em>Mount, </em>we need only say that it did not involve either a juvenile or a youth court adjudication. Thus, it has no application to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b618  Moreover, in construing statutes, the function of the court is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. <em>See State v. English, </em>2006 MT 177, \u00b6 61, 333 Mont. 23, \u00b6 61, 140 P.3d 454, \u00b6 61 (citation omitted); <em>see also Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11. Nothing in \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(c), MCA, the pertinent language of which is set forth above, even suggests a wholesale incorporation of SVORA into the Youth Court Act. Consequently, we conclude the District Court erred in construing the statutes at issue here by looking beyond their plain, unambiguous language.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b619 [4] The District Court also reasoned that, because Hastings had not been convicted and was not ordered to register by a youth court under \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(c), MCA, the registration requirement condition was the \u201conly method\u201d by which the Seventh Judicial District Court could have ensured SVORA applied to Hastings. The problem, of course, is that unless Montana statutes permit the imposition of a SVORA registration requirement, a court may not impose one. The District Court\u2019s apparent belief that SVORA registration was appropriate for Hastings does not translate into statutory authority for the Seventh Judicial District Court to impose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b620 Finally, we address <em>Villanueva, </em>decided after the District Court denied Hastings\u2019 motion and advanced by both parties as authority for their respective positions. There, the defendant was adjudicated guilty of first degree rape in a Washington juvenile court in 1993 and several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>years later, after moving to Montana, was charged here with-among other things-failing to register as a sex offender. <em>Villanueva, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-6. The district court denied his motion to dismiss the failure to register charge. <em>Villanueva, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b621 On appeal, we addressed a legislative amendment to the registration statute, making it applicable to \u201csexual offenders\u201d sentenced or, as a result of such a sentence, under agency supervision in any state on or after July 1, 1989. <em>Villanueva, </em>\u00b6 13. We concluded the defendant could not rely on the Montana Youth Court Act in relation to the definition of \u201csexual offenders\u201d-which, as discussed above, does not encompass a youth adjudicated in a Montana youth court unless the youth court discretionarily imposes a registration requirement-to avoid registration here. We reasoned that, in the context of the amendment, a \u201csexual offender\u201d was defined by Washington law, where his adjudication had occurred, not by Montana law. <em>See Villanueva, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b622 Hastings asserts that, unlike the defendant in <em>Villanueva, </em>he was adjudicated under the Montana Youth Court Act and, therefore, may rely on its provisions distinguishing an adjudication from a conviction and leaving it to the discretion of youth courts to impose SVORA registration requirements in appropriate cases. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-106 and - 1513(l)(c), MCA. In this regard, Hastings observes that Washington law, applicable to the defendant in <em>Villanueva, </em>mandates registration for all adults or juveniles \u201cfound to have committed\u201d or \u201cconvicted of\u2019 a sex offense. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.44.130(1). The State responds that <em>Villanueva </em>stands for the proposition that a person\u2019s adjudication-as opposed to conviction-has no bearing on whether the person has a duty to register under SVORA, so Hasting\u2019s lack of a conviction is not a controlling factor. The State is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b623  The 2001 legislative amendment to the SVORA registration statute discussed in <em>Villanueva </em>applies SVORA retroactively-to July 1,1989-to \u201csexual offenders\u201d as defined by the law of the state where the proceeding occurred. Only Montana law is at issue here. As discussed above, Hastings is not a \u201csexual offender\u201d under Montana law because he was not \u201cconvicted,\u201d and the youth court did not \u201cbypass\u201d the conviction requirement. Therefore, we conclude SVORA does not attach to the condition in the revocation order and Hastings was not required to register for life-or at any time after his commitment was discharged on May 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u00b624 We hold the District Court erred by denying Hastings\u2019 motion to dismiss. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b32-4\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b32-5\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AK8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b625 The Court has engaged in a hypertechnical reading of the Montana Youth Court Act and created a loophole between that Act and SVORA where none should exist. While any lack of clarity in the Act has since been resolved by the Legislature\u2019s amendment of \u00a7 46-23-502(7), MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I do not believe those statutes ever allowed the result this Court reaches today.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b626 The Court observes that \u201cHastings is not challenging the [District Court\u2019s] authority to impose the registration requirement in the first instance.\u201d \u00b6 11. Oddly, the Court then addresses that precise issue and holds that the District Court had no such authority. \u00b6 19. The Court\u2019s analysis of the issue, whether appropriate or not, is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b627 The Court acknowledges that a youth court can \u201cbypass\u201d SVORA\u2019s general requirement of a conviction by requiring a youth adjudicated of a sexual offense to register in accordance with SVORA. However, the Court then reads SVORA in a way that allows <em>only </em>the youth court to order an adjudicated youth to register. I believe the District Court stood in the shoes of the youth court when supervisory responsibility was transferred and could thereby require Hastings to register pursuant to the youth court statutes, and thus SVORA. I see no basis to prohibit the District Court from ordering the same disposition allowed in youth court, and thus would hold that the District Court had authority to order Hastings to register pursuant to SVORA.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\u00b628 Because I believe the District Court had the authority to require registration, I also interpret those statutes as necessarily incorporating SVORA, thus requiring anyone registering under SVORA to do so on a lifetime basis. The sentencing order cannot be read in a vacuum to require registration only for the period of Hastings\u2019 confinement-by ordering Hastings to register, the SVORA statutes were incorporated into the sentencing order and required lifetime registration. Indeed, the registration requirement goes beyond the length of Hastings\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>sentence because it is not a punishment, but rather a regulatory requirement that is allowed to continue. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6 56. When the District Court required registration, SVORA applied and lifetime registration was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b629 Hastings is trying to find a loophole between the Montana Youth Court Act and SVORA where none exists but by the Court\u2019s creation. Although the youth court chose not to order Hastings to register as a sex offender, when that option was exercised by the District Court it incorporated all of the SVORA requirements, including lifetime registration. Regardless of whether the District Court\u2019s holding is considered to have occurred under the youth court act or under the adult sex offender statutes, SVORA applied, and the lifetime registration requirement applied with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b630 I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-10\"> Section 46-23-502(7), MCA, previously defined a \u201csexual or violent offender\u201d as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexual or violent offense.\u201d That statute was amended by the 2007 Montana Legislature and now defines a \u201csexual or violent offender,\u201d under \u00a7 46-23-502(10), MCA, as \u201ca person who has been convicted of or, in youth court, found to have committed or been adjudicated for a sexual or violent offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
