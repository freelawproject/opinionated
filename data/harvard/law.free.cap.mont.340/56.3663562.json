Terzo, Jr., Myrna S. Terzo, and 216, LLC (collectively, the Lot 14A Defendants) appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of their motion for judgment on the pleadings based on lack of jurisdiction/standing. We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it determined it had subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">\u00b64 In 2003, James and Jennifer Terzo (collectively, Terzo) owned two adjacent residential lots, Lot 14 and Lot 15, on South Avenue East in Missoula, Montana. Each lot was zoned as R-l single family residential and measured 30\u2019 x 139\u2019 (4,170 square feet). Ahouse straddled the two lots. The City of Missoula approved Terzo\u2019s May 2003 request to reconfigure the properties\u2019 boundary line to create two lots measuring 60\u2019 x 69.5\u2019 (4,170 square feet each), presently known as Lot 14A and Lot 15A. The reconfiguration\u2019s effect was to place the original residence entirely on Lot 14A. The Missoula Office of Planning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Grants (OPG) then granted Terzo\u2019s application for a building permit to construct a house on Lot 15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b65 Jerrel and Michele Balias (collectively, Balias), Terzo\u2019s next-door neighbors, appealed to the Missoula City Board of Adjustment (BOA), contesting the building permit\u2019s issuance. Balias contended that a Missoula City Ordinance required a minimum lot area of 5,400 square feet for a residential structure; thus, because Terzo\u2019s lots were each 4,170 square feet, the building permit violated the City ordinance and should not be issued. Balias also argued that OPG incorrectly had determined the proper setback required for Terzo\u2019s new house. BOA denied both appeals, and Balias appealed to the District Court in October 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b66 In the midst of the ongoing litigation, Terzo generated a flurry of deeding activity. On June 29, 2004, Terzo conveyed Lots 14 and 15 to James Terzo\u2019s parents, Anthony J. Terzo, Jr. (Anthony) and Myrna S. Terzo (Myrna). A month later, Terzo issued a corrected deed, which conveyed Lots 14A and 15A to Anthony and Myrna. Terzo issued another corrected deed again conveying Lots 14A and 15A to Anthony and Myrna on September 20, 2004. That same day, Anthony and Myrna conveyed Lot 14A to 216, LLC, a Montana Limited Liability Company located at the same address as Anthony and Myrna.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b67 On September 15, 2005, Balias filed a supplemental complaint joining the Lot 14A Defendants as parties to the lawsuit. Anthony and Myrna then executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest in Lot 15A to Terzo on September 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b68 The Lot 14A Defendants then filed several motions including a motion for judgment on the pleadings for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Lot 14A Defendants appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction presents a question of law which we review for correctness. <em>Lurie v. Blackwell, </em>285 Mont. 404, 407-08, 948 P.2d 1161, 1163 (1997). The inquiry is whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would grant the district court subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Barthule v. Karman, </em>268 Mont. 477, 483, 886 P.2d 971, 975 (1994). A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewable prior to final judgment. M. R. App. P. 6(3)(c). Our review is restricted to whether the district court correctly decided the limited question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it determined it had subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b611 The Lot 14A Defendants assert the District Court erred in determining that it had subject matter jurisdiction over them because Balias failed to establish standing to challenge the boundary line relocation that created Lot 14A. The Lot 14A Defendants argue that Balias \u201cmust have some basis under the law granting them standing, i.e., subject matter jurisdiction, to appeal or challenge the common boundary line relocation.\u201d The Lot 14A Defendants claim that Balias has failed to establish standing; thus, they reason, the District Court erred in determining that it had subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b612 Subject matter jurisdiction refers simply to a court\u2019s power to hear and adjudicate a case. <em>Harland v. Anderson Ranch </em>Co., 2004 MT 132, \u00b6 31, 321 Mont. 338, \u00b6 31, 92 P.3d 1160, \u00b6 31. District courts have original jurisdiction in all civil matters. Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4. Additionally, district courts are authorized to hear appeals from municipal board of adjustment decisions. Section 76-2-327, MCA. Ballas\u2019s First Amended Complaint appeals the Missoula BOA\u2019s denial of Ballas\u2019s challenges to OPG\u2019s issuance of Terzo\u2019s building permit. The District Court is statutorily authorized to hear such appeals, and we conclude that the District Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b613 The Lot 14A Defendants tie their lack of subject matter jurisdiction claim to their contention that Balias lacks standing. The brief filed with the District Court contained no substantive challenges to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, but challenged only Ballas\u2019s standing. Similarly, on appeal, the Lot 14A Defendants reason that the District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Balias failed to satisfy the standing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b614  The Lot 14A Defendants mistakenly link the requirement that a court have subject matter jurisdiction with the requirement that a plaintiff have standing to sue; though both are required, they are not interdependent. As discussed in \u00b6 12, subject matter jurisdiction refers to a court\u2019s power to hear a particular type of case. Standing, on the other hand, refers to the threshold justiciability requirement that a plaintiff have a personal stake in a particular case. <em>Bowen v. McDonald, </em>276 Mont. 193, 201, 915 P.2d 201, 206 (1996). If a plaintiff lacks standing, a court can grant no relief because a justiciable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>controversy does not exist. <em>Powder River County v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 101, 312 Mont. 198, \u00b6 101, 60 P.3d 357, \u00b6 101. A party\u2019s lack of standing, however, does not deprive a district court of its subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b615 Perhaps some of the confusion stems from the broad nature of the term \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>has defined jurisdiction as a \u201cterm of comprehensive import embracing every kind of judicial action.... It is the power of the court to decide a matter in controversy and presupposes the existence of a duly constituted court with control over the subject matter and the parties.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>853 (6th ed., West 1990) (citations omitted). Further, jurisdiction exists when a court has cognizance of the class of cases involved, the proper parties are present, and the points to be decided are within the court\u2019s powers. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 853 (citation omitted). Thus, the term \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d when referred to generally, encompasses subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, issue jurisdiction, and constitutional requirements, such as ripeness and standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b616  Although a party\u2019s lack of standing can effectively divest a court of jurisdiction, or power, to resolve a case, the party\u2019s lack of standing does not affect a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over the type of case. We recognized in <em>In re Parenting of D.A.H. </em>the close link between standing requirements and a court\u2019s jurisdiction, and we stated that a court \u201cthat would otherwise have jurisdiction to hear and decide a matter will not have jurisdiction if a person without standing attempts to bring the action.\u201d 2005 MT 68, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 296, \u00b6 8, 109 P.3d 247, \u00b6 8; <em>see also Edwards v. Burke, </em>2004 MT 350, \u00b6 22, 324 Mont. 358, \u00b6 22, 102 P.3d 1271, \u00b6 22 (case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction based on party\u2019s lack of standing). We emphasize that a court lacks the power to resolve a case brought by a party without standing because such a party can present no actual case or controversy, not because the court has been stripped of its subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b617 In this case, the District Court determined that Balias had standing to challenge the boundary line relocation. In substance the Lot 14A Defendants appeal this determination. Though M. R. App. P. 6(3)(c) allows interlocutory appeals from an order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, no such rule exists to challenge a court\u2019s ruling on standing. Thus, the Lot 14A Defendants\u2019 appeal is premature. We refuse to review a district court\u2019s standing determination prior to final judgment. Additionally, we will not allow a party\u2019s characterization of an issue to eclipse its substance, nor will we allow parties to relitigate a district court\u2019s ruling merely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the appealing party has stylized the issue on appeal as one of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Searight v. Cimino, </em>238 Mont. 218, 222, 777 P.2d 335, 337 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\">\u00b618  We conclude the District Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case, and we dismiss as premature the Lot 14A Defendants\u2019 appeal and remand to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
