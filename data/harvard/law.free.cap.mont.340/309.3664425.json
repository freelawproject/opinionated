The District Court found in Qwest\u2019s favor, vacated the PSC\u2019s orders and remanded the matter to the PSC. The PSC appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">\u00b62 The PSC presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">\u00b63 1. Whether the PSC\u2019s actions were ripe for review by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">\u00b64 2. Whether the investigation undertaken by the PSC in this case was subject to review under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b65 3. Whether the PSC may investigate utilities in any manner necessary to effectuate its statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b66 4. Whether the PSC\u2019s investigation of Qwest violated the PSC\u2019s administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b67 Because we reverse the decision of the District Court and hold that this case is not ripe for judicial review, we do not address Issue 4 as it is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u00b68 Qwest is a regulated public utility pursuant to \u00a7 69-3-101, MCA. It offers regulated telecommunications services as defined at \u00a7 69-3-803, MCA. The PSC is the state agency that administers Montana laws governing rates and services of public utilities operating in Montana, such as Qwest. Pursuant to \u00a7 69-3-203, MCA, Qwest must file an annual report with the PSC containing information about Qwest\u2019s annual revenues and earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\u00b69 On March 14, 2003, PSC issued a \u201cNotice of Investigation\u201d to determine whether the rates charged by Qwest are \u201creasonable and just\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 69-3-201, MCA. The PSC indicated in the notice that revenues earned by Qwest since 2001 may be in excess of its authorized rate of return. Qwest did not respond to the notice. The PSC issued its \u201cSecond Notice of Investigation and Request for Information\u201d on April 24, 2003, directing Qwest to state whether its 2001 annual report contained accurate information, and if it did not, directing Qwest to demonstrate why by providing information in a form that would meet the minimum filing requirements contained in Admin. R. M. 38.5.2803 through 38.5.2820.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\u00b610 Qwest responded to the second notice on May 22, 2003, stating that it could not represent to the PSC that the information contained in its 2001 Annual Report was accurate because Qwest was currently undergoing an external audit. Qwest pointed out that the PSC \u201cseems to seek a specific correlation between [the information in its annual report] and the detailed cost of service information which a party seeking a rate change would file in compliance with the [PSC\u2019s] minimum filing standards.\u201d Qwest also pointed out that using 2001 financial data to prepare a rate case filing for 2003 violated the PSC\u2019s own administrative rules establishing rate case filing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"AQY\">\u00b611 On June 16, 2003, the PSC issued its Order No. 6493 directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Qwest to submit the information requested for the PSC\u2019s investigation. In response, Qwest filed a Motion for Reconsideration stating that the PSC\u2019s order was unlawful because Qwest\u2019s current rates were established by previous orders of the PSC and were, therefore, prima facie lawful; because the PSC had the burden to prove that Qwest\u2019s rates were unjust and unreasonable and the investigation attempted to shift that burden to Qwest; and because ordering Qwest to use 2001 financial data in a 2003 rate case violated the PSC\u2019s own administrative rules. The PSC denied Qwest\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration in its Order No. 6493a issued July 10, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b612 On August 6, 2003, Qwest petitioned for judicial review under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA (Cause No. CDV 2003-464). In its petition, Qwest asserted that its current rates had previously been approved by the PSC and that the PSC\u2019s orders unlawfully required Qwest to file a rate case reproving the reasonableness of its existing rates. Qwest also asserted that the PSC\u2019s investigation was an unlawful attempt to shift the burden of proof in the rate case to Qwest. That same day, the PSC filed a complaint in the District Court seeking to compel Qwest\u2019s compliance and requesting that the court assess civil fines and penalties against Qwest for failing to comply with the PSC\u2019s orders (Cause No. BDV 2003-465).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b613 The PSC moved to consolidate the actions and Qwest moved to stay BDV 2003-465 (the PSC\u2019s complaint proceeding) pending the outcome of CDV 2003-464 (the proceeding on Qwest\u2019s petition for judicial review). The District Court denied the PSC\u2019s motion to consolidate and granted Qwest\u2019s motion for a stay of the PSC\u2019s complaint proceeding pending resolution of Qwest\u2019s petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b614 In a Memorandum and Order issued October 14,2004, the District Court determined that the issues presented were ripe for review. The court also determined that the PSC\u2019s orders unlawfully imposed a rate case filing requirement upon Qwest in violation of Montana statute and the PSC\u2019s own administrative rules. The District Court remanded to the PSC and the PSC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b615 When reviewing an agency decision, we apply the same standard as did the district court. <em>Montana Power Co. v. Public Service Com\u2019n, </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 18, 305 Mont. 260, \u00b6 18, 26 P.3d 91, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>Synek v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>272 Mont. 246, 250, 900 P.2d 884, 886 (1995)). Under \u00a7 2-4-704(2), MCA, a reviewing court: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for farther proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">(i) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">(ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">(iii) made upon unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">(iv) affected by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">(v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">(vi) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">In addition, questions of law are reviewed to determine if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Ruby Mountain Trust v. DOR, </em>2000 MT 166, \u00b6 13, 300 Mont. 297, \u00b6 13, 3 P.3d 654, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department. of Revenue, </em>245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">ISSUE 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the PSC\u2019s actions were ripe for review by the District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">\u00b617 The PSC asserts that the District Court adjudicated issues that the PSC neither decided at the agency level nor argued to the District Court. Hence, the PSC argues that the issues adjudicated by the court were not ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">\u00b618 Qwest argues on the other hand that the PSC\u2019s orders are orders of compulsion, issued in a contested case proceeding which the District Court determined violated Montana law. Qwest asserts that the legal issues raised by the orders are not hypothetical or abstract as the PSC has already filed an original action in the District Court against Qwest seeking to enforce the challenged orders through mandatory injunction and the imposition of civil fines. Consequently, Qwest argues that because it has no other adequate remedy, the PSC\u2019s orders are ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">\u00b619 The ripeness doctrine is <em>\u201ca </em>principle of law, grounded in the federal constitution as well as in judicial prudence, that requires an actual, present controversy, and therefore a court will not act when the legal issue raised is only hypothetical or the existence of a controversy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>merely speculative.\u201d <em>Montana Power Co., </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Pearson v. Virginia City Ranches Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 12, \u00b6 30,298 Mont. 52, \u00b6 30,993 P.2d 688, \u00b6 30; <em>Portman v. County of Santa Clara, </em>995 F.2d 898, 902-03 (9th Cir. 1993)). \u201c[T]he ripeness requirement is designed \u2018to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Forestry Association v. Sierra Club, </em>523 U.S. 726, 732-33, 118 S. Ct. 1665, 1670 (1998) (quoting <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 </em>U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 1515 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b620 Furthermore, in deciding whether an agency\u2019s decision is ripe for judicial review, it is necessary to examine \u201cboth the \u2018fitness of the issues for judicial decision\u2019 and the \u2018hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Forestry, </em>523 U.S. at 733, 118 S. Ct. at 1670. Thus, a reviewing court \u201cmust consider: (1) whether delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs; (2) whether judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action; and (3) whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.\u201d <em>Ohio Forestry, </em>523 U.S. at 733, 118 S. Ct. at 1670.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b621 Applying these three factors from <em>Ohio Forestry </em>to the present case, we conclude that the PSC\u2019s actions are not ripe for review. First, Qwest would not suffer any hardship if judicial review is not taken at this juncture. Contrary to Qwest\u2019s assertions, the PSC did not demand that a rate case be initiated. The PSC was simply seeking information as to the accuracy of Qwest\u2019s 2001 annual report. Qwest is obligated to provide the Information requested and nothing more. What the PSC <em>might </em>do with the information requested from Qwest is not an appropriate matter for review. An agency\u2019s decision is not ripe for review if no legal consequences, rights or duties flow from an agency\u2019s actions because those actions are merely a step that could lead to a recommended change of the status quo. <em>Ecology Center v. United States Forest Service, </em>192 F.3d 922, 925 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>see also Western Seafood Co. v. City of Freeport, </em>346 F. Supp. 2d 892, 902-03 (S.D. Tex. 2004) (holding that administrative agency\u2019s application for a permit to develop a marina not ripe for review because claim of harm was only speculative that permit might be used in the future to accomplish an unlawful purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b622  Moreover, judicial review of a preliminary step that has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>binding legal consequences is not available even where the initiation of proceedings is serious and may have severe consequences. <em>Ewing v. Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, Inc., </em>339 U.S. 594, 600, 70 S. Ct. 870, 873 (1950). In order to be final and thereby subject to review, agency action must mark \u201cthe consummation\u201d of the agency\u2019s decision making process. <em>Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, </em>531 U.S. 457, 478, 121 S. Ct. 903, 915 (2001) (citing <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 177-78, 117 S. Ct. 1154, 1168 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u00b623 In the present case, there are no irremediable adverse consequences that flow from the PSC\u2019s investigation, thus we conclude that delayed judicial review will not cause a hardship to Qwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b624  Second, judicial intervention at this juncture would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action by the PSC. One of the basic purposes of the PSC is to investigate public utilities, however, an investigation is not a final agency action. While the PSC could do several things with the information it requested, including negotiating with Qwest to reach a mutually agreeable solution; initiating a contested case proceeding; or simply doing nothing, it is not appropriate for courts to speculate on future actions or to interfere with the process of obtaining the information. When premature review would deny an agency the opportunity to apply its expertise, courts should decline review. <em>Ohio Forestry, </em>523 U.S. at 735, 118 S. Ct. at 1671. Thus, we conclude that judicial interference at this investigatory stage would frustrate the PSC\u2019s ability to review the information and to make decisions about the best possible course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b625 Third, there is no specific factual record before this Court. The only action taken by the PSC was an initiation of an investigation, yet the District Court reviewed issues on which the PSC had not rendered any decision. Judicial appraisal of agency action stands on surer footing when it takes place in the context of a specific factual record. <em>Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S 158, 164, 87 S. Ct. 1520, 1524 (1967). Moreover, depending on the PSC\u2019s actions, review in this case may turn out to be unnecessary. Certainly both the District Court and this Court would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b626  Accordingly, we hold that the PSC\u2019s actions were not ripe for review by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">ISSUE 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b627 <em>Whether the investigation undertaken by the PSC in this case was </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>subject to review under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b628 Section 2-4-701, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">Immediate review of agency action. A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b629 The PSC argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s review of this action under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA, was erroneous because the PSC\u2019s request for information was not necessarily a prelude to further action by the PSC. In addition, the PSC contends that, even if a final agency action were pending, the District Court erred by not making any findings that review of a final decision would not provide Qwest with an adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b630 Review under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA, is available when a determination is made that a final agency decision will not provide an adequate remedy justifying immediate review. <em>Shoemaker v. Denke, </em>2004 MT 11, \u00b6 30, 319 Mont. 238, \u00b6 30, 84 P.3d 4, \u00b6 30 (citing <em>Gilpin v. State, </em>249 Mont. 37, 39, 812 P.2d 1265, 1266-67 (1991)). When an agency has not adjudicated the issues raised on appeal, there is no final agency action upon which a district court can assume jurisdiction. <em>Marble v. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Serv., </em>2000 MT 240, \u00b6 28, 301 Mont. 373, \u00b6 28, 9 P.3d 617, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b631 Qwest\u2019s justification for seeking intermediate review under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA, was that if it did not challenge the lawfulness of the PSC\u2019s orders, Qwest would eventually suffer harm. However, Qwest did not allege any concrete harm. Instead, Qwest\u2019s allegation of harm presumes a rate case that would reduce Qwest\u2019s rates. According to the PSC, this potential financial harm would actually correct a situation in which Qwest is collecting revenues above what it is authorized to collect and would not actually \u201charm\u201d Qwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u00b632  Judicial review under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA, is not justified where the only allegation of harm is speculation that further agency action <em>may </em>take place, and <em>if </em>it takes place, it <em>may </em>have legal consequences. Courts may intervene in agency process only when a specific final agency action has an actual or immediately threatened effect. <em>Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, </em>497 U.S. 871, 894, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 3191 (1990) (citing <em>Toilet Goods, </em>387 U.S. at 164-66, 87 S. Ct. at 1524-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b633  Accordingly, we hold that the investigation undertaken by the PSC in this case was not subject to review under \u00a7 2-4-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ISSUE 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">\u00b634 <em>Whether the PSC may investigate utilities in any manner necessary to effectuate its statutory duties.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b635 The District Court concluded that although the PSC possesses the power to request information from Qwest, it may not force Qwest to do so \u201cin this manner,\u201d i.e., by requiring Qwest to provide information \u201cin the form that would meet the minimum filing requirements contained in ARM 38.5.2803 through 38.5.2820.\u201d The court determined that \u00a7 69-3-110(2), MCA, establishes that Qwest\u2019s rates are prima facie lawful and any party that wishes to challenge the existing rates must carry the burden of proof. Here, the court concluded that the PSC\u2019s orders were unlawful because they attempted to reverse the burden of proof. The District Court stated that \u201c[i]f the PSC desires to show Qwest\u2019s rates are unjust and unreasonable, <em>the PSC may collect the information it needs </em>and carry its burden forward\u201d (emphasis added). However, that is precisely what the PSC is trying to do in this case, \u201ccollect the information it needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b636 The PSC argues that the District Court\u2019s conclusions that the PSC may not ask for information from Qwest \u201cin this manner\u201d is premised on the court\u2019s acceptance of Qwest\u2019s argument that by requiring Qwest to provide the information in the form that would meet the minimum filing requirements contained in Admin. R. M. 38.5.2803 through 38.5.2820, the PSC was forcing Qwest to file a rate case, and that the PSC intended to use the information in a manner that would be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b637 Qwest is reading too much into the PSC\u2019s request. While the cited rules are entitled \u201cMinimum Rate Case Filing Requirements for Telephone Utilities,\u201d that does not mean that because the PSC ordered Qwest to file <em>information </em>in conformity with those rules, the PSC was forcing Qwest to file a rate case. On the contrary, the PSC\u2019s enabling statutes authorize the PSC to obtain information from utilities in any manner necessary to perform its duties. To that end, \u00a7 69-3-106(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">The [PSC] shall have authority to inquire into the management of the business of all public utilities, shall keep itself informed as to the manner and method in which the same is conducted, and <em>shall have the right to obtain from any public utility all necessary information to enable the [PSC] to perform its duties. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">And, \u00a7 69-3-203(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">The [annual] reports must be in the form prescribed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>[PSC] and must contain all the information that the [PSC] considers necessary for the proper performance of its duties. <em>The [PSC] may at any time request information omitted from the reports or not provided for in the reports whenever, in the judgment of the [PSC], the information is necessary. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b638 Moreover, this Court has stated that administrative agencies have broad investigatory power in Montana and an agency should not be denied access to information necessary to perform its statutory investigative duties. <em>Montana Human Rights Div. v. City of Billings, </em>199 Mont. 434, 444-45, 649 P.2d 1283, 1288-89 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b639  Accordingly, we hold that the PSC\u2019s statutory duty to investigate utilities may not be hindered by limiting its ability to obtain information in a specific manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b640 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
