R. Civ. P. 54(b), when, in fact, the judgment appealed from is not one certified as final under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"A0V\">\u00b62 M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) permits a court faced with multiple parties or multiple claims to enter a final judgment \u201cas to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company, </em>2007 MT 325, \u00b6 15, 340 Mont. 176, \u00b6 15, 178 P.3d 689, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">\u00b63 Under M. R. App. P. 4(4)(b) and 6(6), appeals certified as final pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) are initially treated differently from other appeals. For that reason, Forms 1 and 2 appended to the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that the appellant or cross-appellant certify that the appeal or cross-appeal \u201c_is/is not_\u201d from a judgment certified as final under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"A9r\">\u00b64 Obviously, most appeals and cross-appeals are not from judgments certified as final under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). And, while it would seem to go without saying, we expect counsel to actually determine whether their appeal or cross-appeal involves a judgment certified as final under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). It is not acceptable practice to certify that every judgment is final under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b)-as a number of attorneys have-when the judgment appealed from has not been so certified by a district court. Nor is it acceptable practice for attorneys to draft a form of notice of appeal that certifies that every appeal is from a judgment certified as final pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Finally-and it should embarrass some that we even need to say this-the certification statements on Forms 1 and 2 include blank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>spaces and alternative statements, e.g., \u201c_is/is not_.\u201d It was and is this Court\u2019s intention that counsel check [/] or [X] whichever alternative statement is true, not simply include both statements, albeit without the blanks, in his or her form notice of appeal. This procedure is to be followed for each of the other certification statements with blanks as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b65 Therefore, in order to obviate this Court wasting its limited time and resources reviewing notices of appeal and cross-appeal that do not involve appeals from judgments actually certified as final under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b),</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b66 IT IS ORDERED that, upon filing a notice of appeal or cross-appeal which improperly certifies that the appeal is from a judgment certified as final under M. R. Civ. P. 54(b), the Clerk of this Court shall notify the person filing the notice to file a corrected notice of appeal or cross-appeal on Form 1 or 2 within eleven (11) days or face dismissal of the appeal or cross-appeal. The Clerk shall include a copy of this Opinion and Order with the notice. If the corrected notice is not timely filed, the Clerk shall refer the matter to this Court. The Clerk\u2019s costs of notice, postage and photocopying shall be paid by the person filing the corrected notice at the time it is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b67 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of this Opinion and Order be posted to the State Law Library and State Bar of Montana Websites and be published in the <em>Montana Lawyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Dated this 12th day of December, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">/S/KARLA M.
