We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b62 Oie presents the following issue for review: Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Oie to serve four years at MSP after revoking his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\u00b63 Oie was charged by Information on July 31,2000, with Operating or Being in Actual Physical Control of a Motor Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or Drugs, a Fourth or Subsequent Offense, a Felony. After entering into a plea agreement with the State, Oie pled guilty to the charge on December 11, 2001. The District Court sentenced Oie to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for 13 months followed by four years of supervised release. The court also ordered that Oie pay a fine of $1,000 and reimburse Missoula County $500 for his court appointed attorney. In addition, the court set various conditions on his probation and recommended that Oie be placed at the Connections Corrections program followed by time at the Missoula Pre-Release Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">\u00b64 On September 4, 2003, Oie\u2019s probation officer filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cPetition-Suspected Violation of Probation\u201d stating that Oie had been apprehended on September 3, 2003, for allegedly violating the conditions of his probation. Oie posted bond and was released from custody. Oie\u2019s probation officer filed a second \u201cPetition-Suspected Violation of Probation\u201d on October 16, 2003, stating that Oie had been apprehended on October 14,2003, for allegedly violating the conditions of his probation once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b65 It appears from the record that nothing further occurred in this matter until October 15, 2004, when Oie\u2019s probation officer filed a \u201cReport of Violation\u201d alleging that Oie had been stopped by a law enforcement officer on October 12, 2004, as Oie left a bar, that the officer could smell alcohol on Oie and that Oie refused a breath test. Thereafter, the State filed a Petition to Revoke Oie\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b66 On April 14, 2005, while the original Petition to Revoke was still pending, the State filed a \u201cSupplemental Petition to Revoke\u201d alleging that on March 25, 2005, Oie had been cited for misdemeanor assault. Oie admitted the various violations of the conditions of his probation and, on April 26,2005, the District Court revoked Oie\u2019s prior sentence and sentenced him to four years at MSP with credit for 74 days of time served. Oie appeals the District Court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b67 Oie had originally presented a second issue for review by this Court regarding the District Court\u2019s failure to give him credit for all of the time served at the Missoula Pre-Release Center while serving the suspended portion of his sentence. The District Court subsequently amended its judgment in this case giving Oie credit for an additional 166 days of time served and Oie withdrew that issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b68  Trial judges are granted broad discretion to determine the appropriate punishment for offenses. <em>State v. Webb, </em>2005 MT 5, ? 8, 325 Mont. 317, \u00b6 8, 106 P.3d 521, \u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Hembd, </em>254 Mont. 407, 411, 83 P.2d 412, 415 (1992)). On appeal we will not review a sentence for mere inequity or disparity. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 8. Instead, we will only review a criminal sentence for its legality; that is, whether the sentence is within statutory parameters. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 8, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 8, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 8). Moreover, a trial court's statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review to determine whether it is correct. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Oie to serve four years at MSP after revoking his suspended sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b610 We have previously stated that the law in effect at the time the crime was committed controls as to the possible sentence. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 24, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 24. In the instant case, since Oie committed his offense in June 2000, the 1999 version of the Montana Code is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b611 On appeal, Oie contends that the District Court erred in sentencing him to serve four years in the MSP after revoking his suspended sentence. He maintains that the District Court was limited to sentencing him to serve only the remaining portion of the suspended sentence. In other words, Oie argues that the court could not impose a sentence that was greater than the remainder of the probationary term. To that end, Oie relies on \u00a7 61-8-731(5), MCA (1999), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">If a violation of the restrictions or conditions of the probation is established, the court may continue the period of probation or may require the defendant to serve <em>the remainder of the probation sentence </em>in one of the facilities set forth in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b). The court may credit the remainder of the probation or the time to be served in a facility set forth in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b) with all or part of the time already served on probation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b612 The State contends that Oie\u2019s argument is persuasive if one looks only to the plain language of \u00a7 61-8-731(5), MCA, and ignores \u00a7 61-8-731(4)(b), MCA (1999). This latter subsection provides that \u201c[t]he department of corrections may order all or any portion of the term of probation to be served under intensive supervision.\u201d Section 61-8-731(4)(b), MCA. The second sentence of subsection (4)(b) provides that the provisions of Title 46, chapter 23, part 10, relating to probation, apply to the probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b613 Relying on this second sentence of subsection (4)(b), the State points out that under \u00a7 46-23-1013(2), MCA, the sentencing court is afforded broader authority when imposing a sentence upon revocation. Specifically, \u00a7 46-23-1013(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">If the violation is established, the court may continue to revoke the probation or suspension of sentence and may require him to serve the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence and, if imposition of sentence was suspended, <em>may impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u00b614 The State fails, however, to take into consideration that subsection (4)(b) provides that <em>\u201c[t]he department of corrections </em>may order all or any portion of the term of probation to be served under <em>intensive supervision\u201d </em>(emphasis added). There is no indication here that Oie\u2019s probation was to be served under \u201cintensive supervision.\u201d Indeed, the DOC placed Oie in the Connections Corrections program followed by time at the Missoula Pre-Release Center. Upon completing that program, Oie was released from the DOC commitment and began serving the supervised release portion of the sentence. Consequently, contrary to the State\u2019s contentions, since Oie was never placed under \u201cintensive supervision,\u201d subsection (4)(b), and concomitantly, \u00a7 46-23-1013(2), MCA, do not come into play. Furthermore, subsection (4)(b) refers to the <em>DOC </em>imposing an order on probation for intensive supervision, it does not, as the State implies, give a <em>district court </em>any authority to order a defendant to serve <em>all </em>of the term of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"ALO\">\u00b615 In his brief on appeal, Oie directs our attention to an unpublished opinion from this Court, <em>State v. Fode, </em>2005 MT 83N, 327 Mont. 534, 115 P.3d 219, noting that <em>Fode </em>was actually resolved without specifically addressing \u00a7 61-8-731(5), MCA. Similarly, the State cites to an unpublished order of this Court, <em>State ex rel. William Best v. Slaughter, </em>No. 04-497 (August 31, 2004), in support of its argument that a sentencing court is not limited to imposing the remainder of the suspended term upon revocation of the probationary portion of a DUI sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b616 Once again we take this opportunity to stress that unpublished orders and opinions from this Court are not to be cited as precedent. Indeed, unpublished opinions begin with an unambiguous and specific directive to counsel: \u201cthe following decision shall not be cited as precedent.\u201d These sorts of orders and opinions are unpublished for a reason. And, we admonish counsel not to cite to or rely on such orders and opinions in the future. Moreover, when included in briefs, we give no regard to such citations. Our decision here disregards both Oie\u2019s and the State\u2019s improper citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b617  The proper subsection of \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA, to apply in this case is, as Oie argues, subsection (5) providing that the court \u201cmay continue the period of probation or require the defendant to serve the <em>remainder of the probation sentence </em>in one of the facilities set forth in subsection 2(a) or 2(b)\u201d (emphasis added). As Oie points out in his brief on appeal, absent \u00a7 61-8-731(5), MCA, Oie\u2019s revocation of sentence would be controlled by \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (1999). Under \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, a district court could sentence a defendant to continue probation without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>a change in conditions; continue the probation with modified or additional terms and conditions; or require the defendant to serve either the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence. However, \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, directly conflicts with the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-731(5), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA, in interpreting statutes \u201c[w]hen a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d Thus, when a general statute conflicts with a more specific statute, the more specific statue controls. Section 61-8-731(5), MCA, specifically applies to felony DUI revocations, while \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, applies to all revocation proceedings in general. Consequently, \u00a7 61-8-731(5), MCA, governs the imposition of sentence upon the revocation of Oie\u2019s suspended sentence for felony DUI and limits the District Court to either continuing the period of probation or requiring Oie \u201cto serve the <em>remainder </em>of the probation sentence\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b618  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in sentencing Oie to serve four years at MSP after revoking his suspended sentence and we remand to the District Court for resentencing consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b619 Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, RICE, COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
