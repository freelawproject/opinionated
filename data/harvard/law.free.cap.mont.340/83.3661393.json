We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b62 Scholz presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly denied Scholz\u2019s unanswered motions to reconsider the protective order and to dismiss the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court properly relied on its determinations from the June 20,2006, hearing to deny Scholz\u2019s motion to dismiss the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">\u00b66 Whether the District Court correctly included in the protective order terms contradictory to the hearing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">\u00b67 Scholz operates an ice-making business on 84 acres at the edge of the Cabinet Mountain Wilderness area near Noxon, Montana. Improvements on the property include a residence, an ice house, hydro-electric plant, and out-buildings. Jill Lundstrom (Lundstrom) acquired an interest in the real property in 2004. Scholz and Lundstrom married soon after she acquired the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">\u00b68 This dispute began in Justice Court when Lundstrom petitioned for a temporary protective order against Scholz on February 20,2006. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Lundstrom alleged that Scholz had shoved her against the bathroom wall during an argument. Lundstrom claimed that she broke her fingernail during the argument. The State charged Scholz with partner or family member assault in connection with Lundstrom\u2019s allegations in a separate Justice Court proceeding. Scholz did not appear at the protective order hearing on March 13, 2006. The Justice Court issued a permanent protective order in his absence \u201ceffective until further order of the court.\u201d The Justice Court amended the protective order on March 20, 2006, to allow Scholz to enter the ice plant upon advance telephone notice to Lundstrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b69 Lundstrom filed a petition to dissolve the marriage in the District Court on March 8, 2006. Scholz separately petitioned the District Court, on May 30, 2006, under the dissolution\u2019s cause number, to dismiss or modify the Justice Court\u2019s protective order. Scholz argued that he could not conduct his ice business effectively under the existing protective order. Scholz contended that the overly restrictive protective order unfairly subjected him to Lundstrom\u2019s whim regarding whether she chose to take his telephone calls giving her advance notice of his intent to enter the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b610 The District Court held a hearing on Scholz\u2019s petition on June 20, 2006. Neither party offered new evidence or testimony. The parties\u2019 counsel and the court simply discussed the scope of the protective order. The District Court indicated that it was unwilling to modify the existing protective order to the extent that it would concern Scholz\u2019s pending criminal charge in Justice Court. The District Court agreed, however, to modify several terms of the protective order to allow Scholz more liberal access to his business properties. The District Court requested both parties to submit proposed orders memorializing the terms agreed upon during the hearing. On August 10, 2006, the court signed the order that Lundstrom\u2019s counsel had prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b611 Scholz filed a motion to reconsider. Scholz alleged that the June 20, 2006, order improperly included terms contradictory to those agreed upon in the hearing. Scholz also later filed in District Court a motion to dismiss the protective order. Scholz alleged in the motion that the corut had denied him the right to a hearing on the protective order\u2019s validity pursuant to \u00a7 40-15-202(1), MCA. Lundstrom did not answer either motion. The District Corut denied both motions. The court determined that those issues were \u201cspecifically considered at the hearing on June 20, 2006 and addressed in the Court\u2019s Order Regarding Respondent\u2019s Motion for Temporary Orders filed August 10, 2006.\u201d Scholz appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b612 Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction presents a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Boe v. Court Adm\u2019r for the Mon. Jud. Branch, </em>2007 MT 7, \u00b6 5, 335 Mont. 228, \u00b6 5, 150 P.3d 927, \u00b6 5. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to continue, amend, or make permanent an order of protection. <em>Edelen v. Bonamarte, </em>2007 MT 138, \u00b6 6, 337 Mont. 407, \u00b6 6, 162 P.3d 847, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the protective order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b614  District courts and justice courts have concurrent jurisdiction to hear and issue protective orders. Section 40-15-301(1), MCA. Section 40-15-301(3), MCA, provides that either party to a protective order \u201cmay appeal or remove the matter to the district court\u201d before or after a hearing on the protective order. A district court may not take jurisdiction of a justice court case on its own initiative, however, under the plain language of \u00a7 40-15-301 (l)-(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b615 Scholz contends that the Justice Court retained jurisdiction over the protective order until September 6, 2006, when Lundstrom formally removed the matter to the District Court. Scholz argues that the District Court impermissibly exercised jurisdiction of its own initiative over the protective order when it considered Scholz\u2019s May 30, 2006, motion to dismiss or modify the order. Scholz relies on the fact that neither party formally had removed or appealed the protective order, as required by \u00a7 40-15-301(3), MCA, to bestow jurisdiction on the District Court, until September 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">\u00b616 The District Court did not consider the protective order on its own initiative. The District Court acted upon Scholz\u2019s petition. Scholz effectively availed himself of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction when he petitioned the court. His petition operated like an appeal to the District Court to review the Justice Court\u2019s order. Section 40-15-301(3), MCA, provides for this appeal and the statute confers jurisdiction on the District Court to hear the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">\u00b617  We long have held that \u201c[p]arties voluntarily submitting a controversy to a court having jurisdiction of the subject-matter cannot question its authority.\u201d <em>Deich v. Deich, </em>136 Mont. 566, 576, 323 P.2d 35, 41 (1958) (citing <em>Hall v. Hall, </em>70 Mont. 460, 226 P. 469 (1924). Scholz attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Deich </em>on the basis that the District Court failed to take a firm position on its jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>rule on the protective order. Scholz cites the court\u2019s professed unwillingness to stray too far from the Justice Court\u2019s original modified protective order at the June 20,2006, hearing as an example of the court\u2019s failure to accept fully its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b618 The record reveals, however, that the District Court did not waver in exercising its jurisdictional authority over the protective order at the June 20, 2006, hearing. Instead, it only declined to address issues concerning the partner or family member assault charge against Scholz pending in the Justice Court. The District Court fully accepted jurisdictional authority over the order when it considered and ruled on Scholz\u2019s petition to modify or dismiss the protective order. The court also fully accepted jurisdictional authority when it considered Scholz\u2019s two subsequent attempts to avail himself of that court\u2019s jurisdiction: Scholz\u2019s August, 25,2006, motion to reconsider, and his September 18, 2006, motion to dismiss. Scholz cannot now challenge the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b619 <em>Whether the District Court properly denied Scholz\u2019s unanswered motions to reconsider the protective order and to dismiss the protective order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b620 The District Court denied Scholz\u2019s August 25, 2006, motion to reconsider, notwithstanding Lundstrom\u2019s failure to file an answer brief within ten days of Scholz\u2019s supporting brief as required by Montana Uniform District Court Rule 2. The District Court also denied Scholz\u2019s September 18, 2006, motion to dismiss without allowing Lundstrom\u2019s ten day response window to expire. The District Court denied both motions on the grounds that the court previously had decided the issues at the June 20, 2006, hearing regarding Scholz\u2019s motion to modify the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b621 Scholz argues first that the District Court could not base its denial of both motions on the June 20, 2006, hearing in light of the District Court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over the protective order at that hearing. We have held above that the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the protective order beginning with Scholz\u2019s May 30, 2006, petition to modify or dismiss the protective order. \u00b6 18. Scholz\u2019s jurisdictional claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u00b622 Scholz next argues that under Rule 2 of the Montana Uniform District Court Rules the District Court should have granted his August 25, 2006, motion to reconsider the protective order and his September 18, 2006, motion to dismiss when Lundstrom failed to file answer briefs. Rule 2(a) mandates adverse parties to file briefs in support of their answers. Rule 2(b) provides that an adverse party\u2019s failure to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>an answer brief within ten days of the moving party\u2019s brief \u201cshall be deemed an admission that the motion is well taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b623 Montana Uniform District Court Rule 2 does not require the district court, however, to grant an unanswered motion. <em>State v. Pizzola, </em>283 Mont. 522, 524-25, 942 P.2d 709, 711 (1997); <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 466, 914 P.2d 592, 596 (1996); <em>Maberry v. Gueths, </em>238 Mont. 304, 308-09, 777 P.2d 1285, 1289 (1989). We stated in <em>Maberry, </em>that \u201cthe rule does not remove the discretion of the District Court to grant or deny unanswered motions as it sees fit.\u201d <em>Maberry, </em>283 Mont. at 309, 777 P.2d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b624 In <em>Maberry, </em>the adverse party did not file answer briefs in response to a motion to amend findings, motion for new trial, and a motion to alter the judgment until after the ten-day period had elapsed. We held that the district court properly exercised its discretion to deny the motions despite Rule 2. <em>Maberry, </em>238 Mont, at 308-09, 777 P.2d at 1288-89. The district court in <em>Loh </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress even though the State did not answer until after the ten-day period. We again held that the district court properly exercised its discretion. <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont, at 465-67,914 P.2d at 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b625 The District Court denied Scholz\u2019s motions even though Lundstrom filed no response, timely or otherwise. The District Court determined, however, that both parties already had argued the issues fully and the court had addressed them at the June 20, 2006, hearing. We determine that it was within the District Court\u2019s discretion to deny Scholz\u2019s motions based on these circumstances notwithstanding Lundstrom\u2019s failure to file answer briefs. We now address whether the District Court properly exercised that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the District Court properly relied on its determinations from the June 20, 2006, hearing to deny Scholz\u2019s motion to dismiss the protective order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b627 Scholz argues that the District Court improperly relied on its determinations from the June 20, 2006, hearing to deny his motion to dismiss the protective order. He contends that he raised issues at the hearing different from those that he raised in the motion. Scholz argued in the motion to dismiss that the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing, as required by \u00a7 40-15-202(1), MCA, to determine whether the protective order should remain in place invalidated the protective order. Scholz did not advance this same argument at the June 20, 2006, hearing. Scholz contends, therefore, that the District Court erred when it did not review the motion to dismiss on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u00b628 We agree that the District Court failed to address Scholz\u2019s sole argument in his motion to dismiss-an argument the court had not yet had an opportunity to address. If it had addressed Scholz\u2019s argument, however, the District Court likely would have noted that the Justice Court held a hearing on the temporary protective order on March 13, 2006. Scholz failed to appear at that hearing. Nothing in \u00a7 40-15-202(1), MCA, required the District Court to provide Scholz with a second opportunity to challenge the validity of the order of protection issued by the Justice Court. He could not have successfully dismissed the protective order on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b629 The District Court may have failed to address the substance of Scholz\u2019s motion to dismiss regarding the claimed lack of a hearing. The District Court nevertheless reached the correct conclusion. We will uphold a district court that has reached the right result even if for a different reason. <em>Solid Waste Cont. v. Dep. of Pub. Ser. </em>Reg., 2007 MT 154, \u00b6 29, 338 Mont 1, \u00b6 29, 161 P.3d 837, \u00b6 29. The lack of a second hearing did not invalidate the protective order. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Scholz\u2019s motion to dismiss. \u00b630 <em>Whether the District Court correctly included in the protective order terms contradictory to the hearing record.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b631 Scholz argues that the District Court improperly included in the August 10, 2006, protective order, terms either contradictory to those discussed at the June 20, 2006, hearing on the matter, or outside the scope of the hearing. In <em>In re C.S.F., </em>232 Mont. 204, 209, 755 P.2d 578, 582 (1988), we held that \u201cthe rule in Montana as well as in other jurisdictions seems to be well settled that a judgment must be based on a verdict or findings of the court and <em>must be within the issues presented to the court.\u201d </em>(Internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b632 Counsel for C.S.F.\u2019s mother and father discussed the terms of a parenting plan on the record during a hearing to consider parental visitation rights. The district court adopted the mother\u2019s proposed plan that included several paragraphs relating to the father\u2019s written notice requirements for scheduling conflicts. The pleadings and hearing transcript addressed only accumulated visitation, not scheduling conflicts. <em>In re C.S.F., </em>232 Mont. at 205-07, 755 P.2d at 579-80. We inspected the hearing transcript and determined that the court\u2019s order was \u201ca substantial departure in its provisions from the order requested by the District Court at the conclusion of its hearing ....\u201d <em>In re C.S.F., </em>232 Mont. at 208, 755 P.2d at 581. We held invalid portions of the order that deviated from the issues presented at the hearing because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u201c[a] district court does not have jurisdiction to grant relief outside of the issues presented ... unless the parties stipulate that the other questions be considered <em>....\u2019\u2019In re C.S.F., 232 </em>Mont, at 209, 755 P.2d at 582 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b633 The District Court adopted verbatim Lundstrom\u2019s draft of the order. The order includes significant deviations from the issues covered at the June 20, 2006, hearing, as Scholz alleges. The District Court agreed at the hearing that Scholz would have unlimited access to the ice house upon telephonic notice to Lundstrom. The order provided that Scholz\u2019s access to the ice house would be conditional. The order required Scholz to submit written notice by mail of his schedule to Lundstrom one week in advance of any visits. The court did not specify at the hearing how, if at all, Lundstrom could consent. The order required that Scholz receive Lundstrom\u2019s written consent before he could access the ice house at unscheduled times. The court also agreed at the hearing that Lundstrom could not obstruct the driveway to deny Scholz appropriate access to the ice house. The order unconditionally prohibited Scholz from entering, regardless of consent issues, if Lundstrom obstructed the driveway. Finally, the court did not discuss how Scholz could notify Lundstrom of his need to access the ice house in case of emergency \u2014 certainly because the parties agreed at the hearing to telephonic access in any event. The order provided only for emergency telephonic notice procedures and narrowly defined what circumstances would constitute an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b634  The District Court lacked the authority to order terms either contradictory to matters discussed at the hearing or matters completely absent at the hearing. <em>In re C.S.F., </em>232 Mont. at 209, 755 P.2d at 582. We recognize, however, that Scholz\u2019s proposed order included many of the same contradictory terms as Lundstrom\u2019s. Scholz\u2019s proposed order provided for weekly written notice, although it allowed for telephonic notice as to unforeseen changes. Scholz\u2019s proposed order also discussed emergency notice, although it defined emergency much more broadly. Scholz\u2019s order did not, however, require advance written consent, consistent with the court\u2019s determination at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b635 Our decision in <em>C.S.F. </em>provides that a district court may not \u201cgrant relief outside of the issues presented ... <em>unless the parties stipulate that the other questions be considered ...\u201d In re C.S.F., 232 </em>Mont. at 209, 755 P.2d at 582 (emphasis added). We determine that Scholz effectively stipulated that the District Court could order specific terms when he included those terms in his own proposed order. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>stipulation creates space in which the District Court can deviate from the issues that the parties originally presented. The space created should be no broader, however, than the specific term or issue to which the parties stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b636  The parties stipulated to written notice of a weekly schedule for regular access to the ice house in their respective proposed orders. The District Court properly included this term in the protective order. The parties also stipulated to emergency access procedures. The District properly included this provision in the order. The District Court should not have required written notice as the <em>exclusive </em>means of access to the ice house, however, because the parties did not stipulate to it. The parties did not stipulate to the requirement of Lundstrom\u2019s written consent. The parties did not discuss Lundstrom\u2019s consent at the hearing. The District Court improperly included the requirement of Lundstrom\u2019s consent. The parties did not stipulate to Lundstrom\u2019s right to restrict unconditionally Scholz\u2019s access by obstructing the driveway. Once again, the District Court improperly included this term in the order. The District Court should have deviated from its original determination at the hearing to no greater extent than the parties actually agreed by stipulating.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b637 We affirm in part and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
