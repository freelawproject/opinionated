Satterlee, James Zenahlik, and Joseph Foster appeal from the order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC) granting Montana State Fund\u2019s (State Fund) motion for partial summary judgment. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue is whether the WCC erred when it certified as final its grant of partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">\u00b63 Catherine Satterlee was injured in 1992 during the course and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>scope of her employment. Following our decision in <em>Satterlee v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>280 Mont. 85, 929 P.2d 212 (1996), Satterlee received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for permanent total disability (PTD). Satterlee attained the age of sixty-five on September 30, 1999, and her PTD benefits ceased on that approximate date.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b64 James Zenahlik was injured in 1996 during the course and scope of his employment. He received PTD benefits as a result of his injury. State Fund informed Zenahlik that his PTD benefits would cease when he reached age sixty-five, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b65 Joseph Foster was injured in 1999 during the course and scope of his employment. He received PTD benefits as a result of his injury. State Fund informed Foster that his PTD benefits would cease when he reached age sixty-five, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b66 Following the cessation of PTD benefits, Satterlee and Zenahlik petitioned the WCC and challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, as an impermissible delegation of legislative power. The petition was soon amended to add additional petitioners, including Foster, and a second constitutional challenge to \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, based on equal protection grounds. One year later, Satterlee, Zenahlik, and Foster (collectively, Satterlee) filed a second amended petition and raised two additional constitutional challenges to \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, based on substantive due process and age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b67 In the midst of the ensuing litigation, we decided <em>Reesor v. Montana State Fund, </em>in which we determined that no rational basis existed to deny permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits to a class of injured workers based on their age, and thus, \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, violated the Equal Protection Clause contained in Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution. 2004 MT 370, \u00b6 25, 325 Mont. 1, \u00b6 25, 103 P.3d 1019, \u00b6 25. Relying on <em>Reesor, </em>Satterlee moved the WCC for partial summary judgment on the equal protection claim and the improper delegation claim. Satterlee requested the WCC to rule that the statute\u2019s treatment of PTD benefits violated the Equal Protection Clause because \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, makes no distinction between the termination of PTD benefits and PPD benefits. State Fund filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment that was later joined by Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation and Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company. After allowing extensive briefing from the parties, intervenors, and amici curiae, the WCC distinguished <em>Reesor </em>from Satterlee\u2019s case and determined that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, as it pertains to PTD benefits, was constitutionally sound. In a one-line entry, the WCC certified its order as final for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u00b68 Satterlee filed a motion for reconsideration and requested that the WCC remove its order of final certification and allow additional discovery. The WCC determined that it prematurely had certified its order as final and granted Satterlee\u2019s motion insofar as it removed the final certification. The WCC stated that its order did not constitute a final judgment because it dealt solely with Satterlee\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The WCC noted that, though M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) authorizes a court to certify issues as final for purposes of appeal, \u201cthe Montana Supreme Court has stated that a court must justify such a certification when other issues remain unresolved.\u201d The WCC then set forth the guiding principles that courts must follow when certifying an order as final and concluded that, \u201c[i]n the present case, this Court [the WCC] did not provide any justification for certification of its Order as final for purposes of appeal. Consequently, the Court did not comport with Rule 54(b).\u201d The WCC granted Satterlee leave to submit a brief relating to her requested discovery, and it reserved ruling on State Fund\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">\u00b69 The WCC ultimately denied Satterlee\u2019s motion for additional discovery and granted State Fund\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The WCC again included a one-line entry certifying its order as final for purposes of appeal. Satterlee appeals the WCC\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b610 Did the WCC err when it certified as final its grant of partial summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b611 Though the parties did not question the sufficiency of the WCC\u2019s certification order, we raise the issue <em>sua sponte </em>to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in certifying an order under Rule 54(b). <em>Bell &amp; Marra, PLLC, v. Sullivan, </em>2003 MT 56, \u00b6 8, 314 Mont. 378, \u00b6 8, 66 P.3d 294, \u00b6 8. Our general practice is to dismiss appeals without prejudice if the trial court failed to certify its order or erroneously certified its order. <em>Bell &amp; Marra, PLLC, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b612 In general, parties may only appeal a district court\u2019s final judgment. M. R. App. P. I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 54(b) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 54(b)), however, expressly allows a district court to certify an order as final for purposes of appeal prior to final judgment. Appeals from the WCC proceed in the same manner as appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>a district court. Admin. R. M. 24.5.348. The administrative rules governing the WCC\u2019s procedure also include a \u201cfinal certification for the purposes of appeal.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.5.348(2). The \u201cfinal certification\u201d under Admin R. M. 24.5.348(2) differs from Rule 54(b), however, in that it functions as a notice of entry of judgment, rather than as a method to authorize interlocutory appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b613 Though the WCC\u2019s procedural rules do not expressly authorize appeals prior to final judgment, the rules provide that \u201c[i]f no express provision is made in these rules [the WCC\u2019s Procedural Rules] regarding a matter of procedure, the court will be guided, where appropriate, by considerations and procedures set forth in the Mont. R. Civ. P.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.5.352. In its order removing certification from the denial of Satterlee\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the WCC correctly recognized that Rule 54(b) applies to appeals from the WCC prior to a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b614 In <em>Scott v. Utility Line Contractors </em>we questioned Rule 54(b)\u2019s applicability to WCC orders and noted that \u201cthe procedural rules of the [WCC] do not allow for such certification.\u201d 226 Mont. 154, 155, 734 P.2d 206, 207 (1987). The <em>Scott </em>decision, however, predated Admin. R. 24.5.352, which referenced the rules of civil procedure. Under the WCC\u2019s current procedural rules, the WCC must comply with Rule 54(b) and certify an order as final for purposes of appeal if the order fails to constitute a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b615 Rule 54(b) allows a court faced with multiple parties or multiple claims to enter final judgment \u201cas to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). In Roy <em>v. Neibauer, </em>we set forth guiding principles to aid trial courts in determining the propriety of a Rule 54(b) certification: (1) the party seeking the final certification bears the burden of convincing the trial court that the case presents the \u201cinfrequent harsh case\u201d that merits a Rule 54(b) certification; (2) the trial court must \u201cbalance the competing factors present in the case\u201d to determine whether a certification serves the interest of public policy and sound judicial administration; and (3) the trial court must \u201c[marshal] and articulate the factors upon which it relied in granting certification\u201d to facilitate prompt and effective appellate review. 188 Mont. 81, 87, 610 P.2d 1185, 1189 (1980). We noted that trial courts have a duty to avoid piecemeal appeals and to \u201cprotect parties\u2019 rights against prejudice resulting from premature appeal.\u201d Roy, 188 Mont. at 86, 610 P.2d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00b616 When reviewing the propriety of a trial court\u2019s Rule 54(b) certification, we consider five factors to determine whether the court abused its discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-3\">(1) the relationship between the adjudicated and unadjudicated claims; (2) the possibility that the need for review might or might not be mooted by future developments in the [trial] court; (3) the possibility that the reviewing court might be obliged to consider the same issues a second time; (4) the presence or absence of a claim or counterclaim which could result in a set-off against the judgment sought to be made final; (5) miscellaneous factors such as delay, economic and solvency considerations, shortening the time of trial, triviality of competing claims, expense, and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqR\"><em>Bell &amp; Marra, PLLC, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Roy, </em>188 Mont, at 87, 610 P.2d at 1189) (parentheses added).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b617  A judgment is the final determination of the parties\u2019 rights in an action. M. R. Civ. P. 54(a). The WCC recognized Rule 54(b)\u2019s applicability to non-final judgments when it removed final certification from its denial of Satterlee\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. In this case, no question exists that the WCC\u2019s order granting State Fund\u2019s motion for <em>partial </em>summary judgment failed to constitute a final judgment: Satterlee has two remaining constitutional challenges to \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, based on substantive due process and age discrimination that the WCC has yet to consider. Nevertheless, the WCC failed to comply with Ride 54(b) and this Court\u2019s precedent when it certified as final its grant of partial summary judgment in favor of State Fund. The WCC set forth no rationale or reasoning supporting its decision to certify its order as final. We require \u201csome basis for distinguishing between well grounded orders which have considered all of the relevant factors and mere boilerplate approval unsupported by the facts or an analysis of the law.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>188 Mont, at 86, 610 P.2d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b618 We note that the WCC\u2019s orders on appeal generally contain a one-line entry certifying a judgment as final for purposes of appeal. Presumably this entry serves as the WCC\u2019s notice of entry of judgment under Admin. R. M. 24.5.348(2); however, in this case, such an entry is inapplicable because multiple issues remain unresolved. For future reference, to avoid confusion between a \u201ccertification\u201d under Admin. R. M. 24.5.348 and a \u201ccertification\u201d under Rule 54(b), it would be beneficial if the WCC would designate whether its certification is under Admin. R. M. 24.5.348(2) or under Rule 54(b) as a judgment with remaining issues or parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u00b619  In the present case, Satterlee appeals an order that falls short of a final judgment, and therefore requires a Rule 54(b) certification. The WCC failed to comply with Rule 54(b); thus, we dismiss Satterlee\u2019s appeal without prejudice. <em>Bell &amp; Marra, PLLC, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, RICE, WARNER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\"> The rules applicable to Satterlee\u2019s appeal were superseded on October 1, 2007.
