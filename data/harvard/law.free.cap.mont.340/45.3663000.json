The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-19\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana provides that \u201cthe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (\u00a746-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<otherdate id=\"b478-6\">Done in open Court this 3rd day of May, 2007.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate id=\"Anp\">DATED this 22nd day of May, 2007.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is excessive due to the fact that the judge\u2019s sentence did not purport with the recommendation of the pre-sentence investigation writer as was indicated in the reasons of the judge\u2019s sentence. Furthermore, for this particular defendant, the sentence does not consider rehabilitative aspects as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be modified to a commitment to the Department of Corrections for a term of five (5) years, with two (2) years suspended. The terms and conditions shall remain as imposed in the Judgment of July 11,2006, with an added recommendation that the defendant be screened for Connections Corrections.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-8\">Chairperson, Hon.
