The state was represented by George Corn who appeared via videoconference.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive in light of other sentences across the state for similarly situated defendants convicted of similar crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended as follows: Count I: Forty (40) years in the Montana State Prison, with twenty (20) years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>suspended; Count II: Twenty (20) years in the Montana State Prison, to run concurrently with Count I; and Count III: Twenty-five (25) years in the Montana State Prison, with five (5) years suspended to run concurrently to Counts I &amp; II; and Ten (10) years in the Montana State Prison for Persistent Felony Offender status, to run consecutive to Counts I - III. The terms and conditions shall remain as imposed in the Judgment of May 1, 2002.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"b467-4\">Done in open Court this 8th day of February, 2007.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aru\">DATED this 23rd day of February, 2007.</decisiondate>\n<judges id=\"b467-6\">Chairperson, Hon.
