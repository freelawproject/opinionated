He moved to dismiss the charges against him. The District Court denied his motion; he now appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Thomas Knudson\u2019s motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b192-18\">\u00b64 Knudson pled guilty to a felony charge of sexual intercourse without consent and two misdemeanor charges of drug possession. He received a five-year sentence, with all but thirty days suspended. As a condition of his suspended sentence, the District Court ordered Knudson to register as a sexual offender in compliance with the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), Title 46, Chapter 23, Part 5, MCA (2005), \u201cand [to] give appropriate notice of any address change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-19\">\u00b65 Following his release from custody in 2002, Knudson moved into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>his father\u2019s house in Fort Benton. All mail in Fort Benton is delivered to post office boxes. Knudson\u2019s street address is 1301 Front Street, but his official mailing address is P. O. Box 56. When Knudson first registered with the sheriffs department, as required by the Act, he gave P. O. Box 56 as his address.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b66 The Act simply states that offenders must provide their \u201caddress,\u201d and fails to specify whether a mailing or residential address is required. The State did not inform Knudson that his registration was invalid nor ask him for a residential address.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b67 In September 2005, Knudson began spending more time at his girlfriend\u2019s house. Kim Cooke, Knudson\u2019s girlfriend, resided at 905-1/2 Main Street in Fort Benton, about five blocks away from Knudson\u2019s father\u2019s house. Ken Knudson, Thomas\u2019s father, set up the utilities for the Main Street apartment in his name since neither Thomas nor Kim could open an account with Northwestern Energy. Northwestern\u2019s records show that Thomas paid the electric bill at 905-1/2 Main Street from September 2005 to March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b68 Thomas moved a few of his personal effects, including a chair, a spare bed, and his pet ferret, from his father\u2019s house to Cooke\u2019s house. However, Thomas maintained a room at his father\u2019s house and occasionally slept there. Thomas did not change his mailing address and thus continued to receive mail at P. O. Box 56. At trial, Ken Knudson testified that he took calls for his son and that he saw Thomas once a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b69 On December 2, 2005, the Chouteau County Attorney filed an Information charging Knudson with violating \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), for failing to \u201cregister in Chouteau County, Montana within ten days of changing his address in Chouteau County for the purposes of residing.\u201d The State claimed Knudson should have re-registered using Cooke\u2019s residential address. Knudson moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that since his mailing address did not change, his registration was still current under \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005). He further argued that since the term \u201caddress\u201d was not defined in the Act, \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b610 The District Court denied Knudson\u2019s motion to dismiss. Knudson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review de novo. <em>State v. Pyette, </em>2007 MT 119, \u00b6 11, 337 Mont. 265, \u00b6 11, 159 P.3d 232, \u00b6 11. We review a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Pyette, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b612 Statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality. <em>Wing v. State Ex Rel. Dept. of Transp., </em>2007 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 336 Mont. 423, \u00b6 12, 155 P.3d 1224, \u00b6 12. The person challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Wing, \u00b6 12. The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law. <em>State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 321, \u00b6 14, 292 Mont. 192, \u00b6 14, 974 P.2d 1132, \u00b6 14. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Constitution to determine if it is correct. <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 14. Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>Wing, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err in denying Knudson\u2019s motion to dismiss, and in finding that \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), was not unconstitutionally vague?</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b614 Knudson argues that \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), is unconstitutionally vague on its face, and as applied to him, because the word \u201caddress\u201d is ambiguous. Section 46-23-505, MCA(2005), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">If an offender required to register under this part has a change of address, the offender shall within 10 days of the change give written notification of the new address to the agency with whom the offender last registered or, if the offender was initially registered under 46-23-504(l)(b), to the department and to the chief of police of the municipality or sheriff of the county from which the offender is moving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Knudson maintains the term \u201caddress\u201d has more than one generally accepted meaning: it could refer to either a mailing address or a residential address. Knudson argues that since the Act does not define \u201caddress,\u201d the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face. Knudson also asserts that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him, because the State did not inform him that the mailing address that he provided in 2002 did not satisfy the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\u00b615 The State replies that when \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), is read as part of the Act as a whole, it is clear that the Legislature intended the word \u201caddress\u201d to mean \u201cresidential address.\u201d Since the Act\u2019s purpose is to keep track of the whereabouts of sex offenders, the State argues, Knudson should have known he was required to provide a residential address. Thus, the State concludes, Knudson\u2019s as-applied challenge must fail. Further, the State argues, Knudson lacks standing to bring a facial challenge to the statute because \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), was reasonably clear in its application to Knudson\u2019s conduct. As such, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>State asserts, we should decline to consider his facial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b616 Vagueness challenges to statutes may take two different forms: (1) \u201cfacial,\u201d where the statute is so vague that it is void on its face, and (2) \u201cas-applied,\u201d where the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of a particular situation. <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 17. As described above, Knudson raises both facial and as-applied challenges to \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005). Because we conclude that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to Knudson, we need not reach the question of whether the statute is facially invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b617 Is \u00a7 46-23-505. MCA (2005). vague as applied to Knudson?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b618  A criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague if \u201ca person is required to speculate as to whether his contemplated course of action may be subject to criminal penalties.\u201d <em>State v. Mainwaring, </em>2007 MT 14, \u00b6 18, 335 Mont. 322, \u00b6 18, 151 P.3d 53, \u00b6 18 (citation omitted). Both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution protect against vague statutes which infringe upon a citizen\u2019s right to due process. U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 17. The void for vagueness doctrine \u201crequires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 1858 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b619 Relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Kolender, </em>we developed a two-part test to determine whether a statute is unconstitutional as applied to a particular situation. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 27, 299 Mont. 165, \u00b6 27, 998 P.2d 544, \u00b6 27 (citations omitted). First, we consider whether actual notice was given to citizens. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 27. Second, we ask whether the statute contains minimal guidelines sufficient to govern law enforcement. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 27. \u00b620 <em>1. Does \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), provide Knudson with actual notice that his conduct was proscribed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b621 In the context of an as-applied challenge, we determine whether a statute provides constitutionally adequate notice by examining the statute \u201cin light of the conduct with which the defendant is charged in order to determine whether the defendant could have reasonably understood that his conduct was proscribed.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 28. In the instant case, then, the question is whether Knudson could have reasonably understood that his conduct was proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b622 [2] Since the Act does not define the term \u201caddress,\u201d we look to the ordinary meaning of the word. <em>Fandrich v. Capital Ford Lincoln Mercury, </em>272 Mont. 425, 430, 901 P.2d 112, 115 (relying on the ordinary definition of a word that was not specifically defined in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>statute). As the District Court pointed out, the word \u201caddress\u201d has multiple generally accepted meanings. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>notes the possible ambiguity in the term, defining address as the \u201c[p]lace where mail or other communications will reach [a] person.... Generally a place of business or residence; though it need not be.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 38 </em>(6th ed., West 1990). For most Montanans, one\u2019s residential and mailing addresses are the same. However, when those two addresses differ, it is unclear from the face of the statute which of the two an offender should provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b623 If the plain words of a statute are ambiguous, then we interpret the statute according to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Jordan v. State, </em>2007 MT 165, \u00b6 8, 338 Mont. 113, \u00b6 8, 162 P.3d 863, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted). The word \u201caddress\u201d is ambiguous, because it has more than one generally accepted meaning. Thus we turn to the legislative history of the statute to attempt to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent. In 1997, \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">If an offender required to register under this part changes residence, the offender shall within 10 days of the change give written notification of the new address to the agency with whom the offender last registered. The agency shall, within 3 days after receipt of the new address, forward it to the department of justice, which shall forward a copy of the new address and photograph to the sheriff having jurisdiction over the new place of residence and to the chief of police of the municipality of the new place of residence if the new place of residence is in a municipality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In 2005, the Legislature amended this section to replace the word \u201cresidence\u201d with the word \u201caddress.\u201d Since the State claims Knudson violated the Act on November 22, 2005, \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b624 Unfortunately, the legislative history of this amendment does not shed much light on the Legislature\u2019s decision to replace the word \u201cresidence\u201d with the word \u201caddress.\u201d The Senate committee meeting minutes reflect that one of the purposes of the 2005 amendment is to clarify the Act\u2019s change of address requirements. Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on HB 49, </em>2005 Reg. Sess. 7 (Mar. 14, 2005). Specifically, the amendment requires offenders to register their change of address with both the Department of Corrections and the local sheriff or chief of police. Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on HB 49, </em>2005 Reg. Sess. 8-9 (Mar. 14, 2005). However, neither the House nor the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting minutes discuss why the amended version of the bill uses the word \u201caddress\u201d instead of \u201cresidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00b625  The very fact that the Legislature chose to replace the word \u201cresidence\u201d with \u201caddress\u201d undermines the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201caddress\u201d could only mean \u201cresidential address.\u201d Given the ambiguity inherent in the wording of the 2005 amendment, and the multiple generally accepted meanings of the word \u201caddress,\u201d we conclude that the statute failed to provide Knudson with actual notice that a mailing address would be insufficient for purposes of registering under the Act. Knudson could not have known the State expected him to provide a residential address when he registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b626 <em>2. Does \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), provide minimal guidelines sufficient to govern law enforcement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b627 Under this second prong of the as-applied vagueness inquiry, we consider whether the legislature established minimal guidelines sufficient to govern the enforcement of the statute. We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuJ\">[L]aws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 30 (citations omitted). Thus, the question before us is \u201cwhether the law provides sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\u201d with regard to Knudson\u2019s conduct. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b628 When Knudson was first released from custody, he used his father\u2019s mailing address to register. Neither the sheriff nor the Department of Corrections informed Knudson that a mailing address was insufficient for registration purposes. Knudson relied on the assumption that he was in compliance with the Act\u2019s requirements for more than two years. Knudson never changed his mailing address. Yet, in December 2005, the State charged Knudson with a violation of the Act for failing to update his residential address, though his mailing address remained the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b629  If Knudson\u2019s mailing address sufficed for purposes of registration under the Act in February 2002, then it must suffice for purposes of registration in November 2005. The State\u2019s action in charging Knudson for failing to register under the Act is arbitrary and discriminatory. If Knudson violated the Act by providing a mailing address instead of a residential one, the State should have notified him when he first registered in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u00b630  In conclusion, \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), is vague as applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Knudson\u2019s particular circumstances. Our holding is limited to the unique facts of this case; Knudson had two addresses: an official mailing address recognized by the United States government, and an unofficial residential address. The statute\u2019s text does not require Knudson to register using a residential address. Knudson registered using his official mailing address; neither the sheriff nor the Department of Corrections told Knudson that his registration was not in compliance with the Act. Knudson did not have actual notice, from either the statute or the officials enforcing it, that a mailing address was insufficient. In this case, the State\u2019s enforcement of the Act was arbitrary and discriminatory. Because the Act is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of Knudson\u2019s case, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion by denying Knudson\u2019s motion to dismiss. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b198-6\">JUSTICE WARNER did not participate.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b198-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"At4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b631 Section 46-23-505, MCA (2005), is neither vague on its face nor as applied to Knudson. While the word \u201caddress\u201d may, under certain circumstances, have more than one generally accepted meaning, in the context of the Act it clearly has only one, and Knudson was on notice from the day he registered that the only appropriate meaning of the word \u201caddress\u201d was his residential address.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\u00b632 When read as a whole, the 2005 version of the Act clearly intended the word \u201caddress\u201d to mean a registrant\u2019s residential address. The Legislature\u2019s minor change in the wording of \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA, clearly did not represent a change in the requirements of that statute. As the State points out, a registrant\u2019s residence is a pervasive theme throughout the Act, appearing in at least four places in the statutory text. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-23-503(2)(a), MCA (2005) (referring to \u201cthe address at which the offender intends to reside upon release ...\u201d); \u00a7 46-23-504(c), MCA (2005) (imposing a duty to promptly register upon entering a county \u201cfor the purpose of residing or setting up a temporary domicile ...\u201d); \u00a7 46-23-506(3), MCA (2005) (providing for relief from lifetime registration for certain offenders by filing a petition in the judicial district where the registrant \u201cresides\u201d); \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2005) (permitting Level 2 offenders to petition for change in designation in the judicial district where the registrant \u201cresides\u201d). In contrast, nothing in the Act indicates a desire by the Legislature to enable authorities to track a registrant\u2019s mailing address, and common sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>dictates that such is clearly not a purpose of the Act. Rather, a \u201creasonable person of average intelligence\u201d can comprehend \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), to require a residential address, not a mailing address, for purposes of informing authorities and the public of the locations in which registered sex offenders are residing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b633 To say that Knudson \u201cdid not have actual notice, from either the statute or the officials enforcing it, that a mailing address was insufficient[,]\u201d is simply not the case. When Knudson was released from custody, he was required to register with the sheriff\u2019s department pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-503, MCA (2001). At that time, Knudson was required to notify the sheriffs department of the \u201caddress\u201d at which he intended to \u201creside.\u201d Section 45-23-503(2)(a), MCA (2001). There is nothing unclear about that requirement. Nonetheless, he failed to do that, instead providing his father\u2019s mailing address. Though regrettable, it is irrelevant that the sheriffs department\u2019s nonfeasance led him to believe a mailing address was sufficient. Simply because the sheriff s department erroneously accepted his mailing address does not mean that providing his mailing address \u201csufficed.\u201d Knudson\u2019s mailing address did not suffice in February 2002, and it did not suffice in November 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b634 Nor do such circumstances justify this Court\u2019s exercise of its constitutional power of judicial review to declare the Act unconstitutional as applied here. Indeed, the meaning of \u201caddress\u201d aside, the statute in effect at the time Knudson registered in 2002, and even when Knudson began living with his girlfriend in September 2005, required Knudson to notify the sheriff if he \u201cchanges residence.\u201d Section 45-23-505, MCA (2001); \u00a7 45-23-505, MCA (2003). Thus, Knudson was on statutory notice, for three years before the statute was amended and until shortly before he was charged, that providing his mailing address was insufficient to meet the requirements of the Act. He changed residences, but failed to notify authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b635 For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005), is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-7\">JUSTICE MORRIS joins in the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
