We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AfO\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\u00b63 <em>Does DNRC\u2019s issuance of final permits for appropriating groundwater to Utility Solutions render moot Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s requests for an injunction, civil penalties, and attorney fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\u00b64 <em>Does the Montana Water Use Act create a private right of action that allows Faust and McManus to enforce the civil penalty provisions of the Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\u00b65 Landowners in the Four Corners area of Gallatin County filed a petition in August, 2002, to organize and incorporate a county water and sewer district. <em>Lohmeier v. Gallatin County, </em>2006 MT 88, \u00b6 4, 332 Mont. 39, \u00b6 4, 135 P.3d 775, \u00b6 4. The Gallatin County board of commissioners approved the petition and created the Four Corners County Water and Sewer District (Water District) in December of2002 to provide water and sewer services within the proposed district\u2019s boundaries. <em>Lohmeier, </em>\u00b6 5. Utility Solutions, LLC (Utility Solutions) operates water and wastewater systems to service private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>developments. The Water District contracted with Utility Solutions to provide water and sewer services within the Water District\u2019s boundaries. Faust and McManus reside in Gallatin County and own real property and water rights in the Four Corners area.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b66 Utility Solutions submitted applications to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) for permits to appropriate groundwater to service various businesses and residences in the Four Corners area of Gallatin County. DNRC issued Utility Solutions a conditional permit that authorized groundwater pumping only after DNRC had granted final approval. Utility Solutions began pumping groundwater, however, before DNRC provided the necessary final approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b67 Faust and McManus filed a complaint in District Court on September 7,2006. They allege that \u201c[d]espite the fact that it does not have any exercisable water rights, Utility Solutions has begun appropriating water ....\u201d The amended complaint alleges that the groundwater appropriations by Utility Solutions would adversely affect Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s water rights. Faust and McManus also allege that they \u201care suffering direct and irreparable harm ... as a result of Utility Solutions\u2019 and/or the [Water District\u2019s] violations of the Montana Water Use Act.\u201d The amended complaint includes a request to the District Court to \u201cissue an injunction against Utility Solutions\u2019 and the [Water District\u2019s] violations of the Montana Water Use Act.\u201d \u00b68 Faust and McManus also ask the District Court to impose civil penalties against Utility Solutions pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-122, MCA, the civil penalty provision of the Water Use Act. Faust and McManus conclude their amended complaint by asking the District Court to award attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-125(3), MCA (renumbered as \u00a7 85-2-125(2), MCA). Faust and McManus also seek attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b69 Utility Solutions moved the court to dismiss the complaint pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Water District filed a separate motion to dismiss. The District Court granted the motions to dismiss on October 16, 2006, on the grounds that Faust and McManus lacked standing to enforce the Montana Water Use Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b610 Faust and McManus appealed the District Court\u2019s ruling on November 22, 2006. DNRC issued the requisite groundwater appropriation approval to Utility Solutions, however, approximately two weeks before Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s appeal. Utility Solutions moved this Court to dismiss the appeal as moot in light of DNRC\u2019s issuance of the final groundwater appropriation permits. We dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Utility Solutions\u2019 motion without prejudice to allow the parties to brief fully the merits of Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) presents a conclusion of law. <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co. v. Ehlert, </em>2002 MT 12, \u00b6 31, 308 Mont. 140, \u00b6 31, 40 P.3d 378, \u00b6 31. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Bar OK Ranch, </em>Co., \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b612 <em>Does DNRC\u2019s issuance of final permits for appropriating groundwater to Utility Solutions render moot Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s requests for an injunction, civil penalties, and attorney fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b613 Utility Solutions maintains that DNRC\u2019s issuance of final groundwater appropriation permits renders moot the claims presented by Faust and McManus. Faust and McManus argue that the current legal status of Utility Solutions\u2019 groundwater pumping does not render moot their claims with respect to Utility Solutions\u2019 earlier unauthorized pumping of groundwater. Faust and McManus implicate the Water District only in their request for injunctive relief. Our resolution of that issue eliminates the need to address the Water District\u2019s involvement in the proceedings. We focus, therefore, on Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s claims only as they relate to Utility Solutions. \u00b614 A justiciable controversy must exist for this Court to adjudicate a dispute. <em>Clark v. Roosevelt County, </em>2007 MT 44, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 118, \u00b6 11, 154 P.3d 48, \u00b6 11. This Court will not render advisory opinions. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 11. We limit our rulings to those matters in which we can grant effective relief. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Claim for Injunctive Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u00b615 Faust and McManus allege in their amended complaint that they \u201care suffering direct and irreparable harm ... as a result of Utility Solutions\u2019 ... violations of the Montana Water Use Act.\u201d Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s amended complaint also alleges that their \u201cwater rights will be adversely affected ...\u201d if DNRC approves Utility Solutions\u2019 groundwater pumping. Faust and McManus correctly assert that DNRC\u2019s decision to approve Utility Solutions\u2019 groundwater appropriation does not directly address any adverse effects that Faust and McManus may be suffering as a result of Utility Solutions\u2019 current groundwater pumping. DNRC\u2019s decision also does not address the alleged past violations of the Montana Water Use Act committed by Utility Solutions. DNRC\u2019s issuance of final permits to Utility Solutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>effectively ended, however, any on-going violations of the Water Use Act by Utility Solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b616  Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s request for injunctive relief seeks only to end those acts committed by Utility Solutions that violate the Water Use Act. Their request for injunctive relief does not seek to end Utility Solutions\u2019 now authorized groundwater pumping. \u201cAn injunction will not issue to restrain an act already committed. Injunction is not an appropriate remedy to procure relief for past injuries, it is to afford preventive relief only.\u201d <em>Bouma v. Bynum Irrigation District, </em>139 Mont. 360, 364, 364 P.2d 47, 49 (1961) (citations omitted). Utility Solutions now has obtained the requisite DNRC approval. Utility Solutions has ceased violating the Act. We conclude that DNRC\u2019s issuance of the final groundwater appropriation permits renders moot Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s request for injunctive relief. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b617  Faust and McManus seek attorney fees in their amended complaint pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-125(2), MCA, in connection with their request for injunctive relief. Section 85-2-125(2), MCA, directs a court to award attorney fees to \u201c[t]he party obtaining injunctive relief in an action to enforce a water right ....\u201d DNRC\u2019s issuance of the final permits for groundwater appropriation prevents Faust and McManus from obtaining injunctive relief against Utility Solutions\u2019 violations of the Water Use Act. \u00b6 16, <em>supra. </em>We similarly conclude that the Utility Solutions\u2019 receipt of final permits also renders moot Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s request for attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-125(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AVLK\">\u00b618  Faust and McManus also seek attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine. Faust and McManus must succeed in some measure in the underlying controversy in order to obtain attorney fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine. <em>Grabow v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n, </em>2002 MT 242, \u00b6 17, 312 Mont. 92, \u00b6 17, 59 P.3d 14, \u00b6 17; <em>see Laudert v. Richland County Sheriffs Dept., </em>2001 MT 287, \u00b6 20, 307 Mont. 403, \u00b6 20, 38 P.3d 790, \u00b6 20. Faust and McManus no longer can succeed in their underlying claim for injunctive relief. \u00b6 16, <em>supra. </em>Faust and McManus cannot recover attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine with regard to their claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Claim for Civil Penalties</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b619 Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s amended complaint separately asks the court to impose civil penalties against Utility Solutions pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-122, MCA, for its violations of the Montana Water Use Act. Section 85-2-122(2), MCA, states that a person who violates certain provisions of the Water Use Act or any order or rule of DNRC \u201cis subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 per violation.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>violator may incur a $1,000 penalty for each separate day of violation. Section 85-2-122(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b620 Faust and McManus allege that \u201c[djespite the fact that it does not have any exercisable water rights, Utility Solutions has begun appropriating water ....\u201d Courts must consider a non-moving party\u2019s allegations of fact as true when reviewing a motion to dismiss. <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co., </em>\u00b6 31. DNRC\u2019s subsequent decision to issue final permits to Utility Solutions does not necessarily eliminate Utility Solutions\u2019 liability for any past violations that it may have committed under the Water Use Act. The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s request for civil penalties pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-122, MCA, remains a justiciable issue. We turn, therefore, to Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s argument that the Montana Water Use Act creates a right of action that allows private citizens to enforce its civil penalty provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>\u00b621 Does the Montana Water Use Act create a private right of action that allows Faust and McManus to enforce the civil penalty provisions of the Act?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b622 The District Court granted Utility Solutions\u2019 motion to dismiss by concluding that no private right of action exists under Montana\u2019s Water Use Act. Faust and McManus attempted to pursue two distinct private actions under the Water Use Act. Faust and McManus continue to argue on appeal that \u00a7 85-2-125(2), MCA, provides a statutorily based right of action for private citizens to seek an injunction. They further contend that by providing a private right of action for an injunction, \u00a7 85-2-125(2), MCA, implicitly enables private citizens to enforce the Water Use Act\u2019s civil penalty provisions found at \u00a7 85-2-122, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b623 DNRC\u2019s issuance of final permits to Utility Solutions renders moot Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s attempt to obtain an injunction through the Water Use Act. \u00b6 16, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, we need not consider whether the Water Use Act authorizes a private cause of action for injunctive relief. We consider only whether the Montana Water Use Act creates a right of action that allows private citizens to enforce its civil penalty provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b624 Whether a statute creates by implication a private cause of action presents a matter of statutory construction. <em>Wombold v. Assoc. Financial Services Co., </em>2004 MT 397, \u00b6 35, 325 Mont. 290, \u00b6 35, 104 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 35, <em>overruled on other grounds by Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 17 n. 3, 338 Mont. 423, \u00b6 17 n. 3, 166 P.3d 451, \u00b6 17 n. 3. We consider the following four factors when construing a statute for this purpose: (1) consistency within the statute as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>whole; (2) the intent of the legislature considering the statute\u2019s plain language; (3) the avoidance of absurd results; and (4) any construction of the statute by the agency charged with its administration. <em>Montana Power Co. v. Cremer, </em>182 Mont. 277, 280-81, 596 P.2d 483, 485 (1979). We also examine legislative history to determine whether a statute implicitly creates a private cause of action. <em>See Wombold, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b625 We note initially that the Water Use Act\u2019s provision entitled \u201cjudicial enforcement\u201d refers only to actions initiated by DNRC, the attorney general, or the county attorney. Section 85-2-114, MCA. Section 85-2-114, MCA, does not provide expressly for an action brought by a private citizen. Section 85-2-114(3), MCA, provides specifically for enforcing the civil penalty provisions \u201cwithout being requested to do so by the department.\u201d This provision refers, however, only to the county attorney\u2019s authority to initiate such an action. Section 85-2-114(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b626 Faust and McManus argue that the Water Use Act allows for private enforcement based on the language of its attorney fee provision. The attorney fee provision requires the district court to award reasonable costs and attorney fees in an action to \u201cenjoin the use of water by a person that does not have a water right.\u201d Section 85-2-125(2), MCA. The attorney fee provision addresses actions seeking injunctive relief. Nothing in the attorney fee provision suggests that a private party can enforce the civil penalty provisions of the Water Use Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b627 The civil penalty provision of the Water Use Act admittedly does not expressly prohibit enforcement actions by private citizens. Section 85-2-122(2), MCA, states merely that a violator \u201cis subject ...\u201d to a penalty. Indeed, the statute accounts for the collection of fines imposed as civil penalties by either DNRC, the county attorney, or \u201ca district court ....\u201d Sections 85-2-122(3)(a) and (b), MCA. These deposit provisions do not explicitly limit who may bring an action to enforce the civil penalty provision when a district court collects the fine. A district court must deposit any collected civil penalty fines, however, into an account maintained specifically for the judicial enforcement provision found at \u00a7 85-2-114, MCA. Section 85-2-122(3)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b628 Thus, the statute accounts for the fines collected by the district court pursuant to the civil penalty provision. The statute earmarks such fines for the enforcement of a provision that refers to actions initiated only by governmental entities. Furthermore, the civil penalty provision creates an allowance for an \u201cindependent action.\u201d Section 85-2-122(3)(b), MCA. Section 85-2-122(3)(b), MCA, employs this term, though only in reference to an action brought by the county attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The statute makes no reference to an \u201cindependent action\u201d in any other context.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b629 The Water Use Act\u2019s legislative history further casts doubt on the availability of a private right of action to enforce the Act\u2019s civil penalty provisions. Representative Jim Shockley sponsored House Bill 570 (HB 570) in 2001. Mont. H. 570, 57th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Feb. 13, 2001). HB 570 introduced the provisions in the Water Use Act that authorize and account for the county attorney\u2019s ability to enforce civil penalty provisions. HB 570 amended \u00a7 85-2-114(3), MCA, to authorize the county attorney to bring an action under the civil penalty provisions. Mont. H. 570, 57th Leg., Reg. Sess. at 1. HB 570 also amended \u00a7 85-2-122(3), MCA, to account for any fines collected as a result of an \u201cindependent action\u201d brought by the county attorney to enforce the civil penalty provisions. Mont. H. 570, 57th Leg., Reg. Sess. at 2. Representative Shockley stated the bill would clarify that, in addition to DNRC and the attorney general, a county attorney had the authority to enforce the civil penalty provisions of the Water Use Act. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on H, 570, </em>57th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Feb. 16, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b630  To allow private citizens to enforce the civil penalty provisions of the Montana Water Use Act would run counter to the judicial enforcement framework set forth in the Act. Both the plain language of the statute and legislative history reveal the legislature\u2019s intent to task DNRC, the attorney general, or the county attorney with enforcing the Water Use Act\u2019s civil penalty provisions. We hold that the Montana Water Use Act does not create a private right of action to enforce its civil penalty provisions. We emphasize that we do not address whether the Act allows for a private right of action for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b631 Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s amended complaint also includes a request for attorney fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine in pursuit of their civil penalties claim. Faust\u2019s and McManus\u2019s claim for attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine must fail in light of our determination that no private right of action exists to enforce the Water Use Act\u2019s civil penalty provisions. <em>Grabow, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b214-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
