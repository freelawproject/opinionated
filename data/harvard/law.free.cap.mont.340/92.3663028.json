Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation (Liberty), as insurer of Stimson, moved for summary judgment on the ground that Kessel\u2019s Petition was time-barred. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC) denied Liberty\u2019s motion. Liberty appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">\u00b63 Did the WCC err when it ruled that the two-year statute of limitations provided for at \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, does not begin to run until after the occupational disease evaluator issues its report?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">\u00b64 Kessel worked for Stimson from 1993 until January 2001 during which time he asserts he contracted asbestos-related lung disease. He submitted a claim for occupational disease (OD) benefits on December 3, 2001. On August 2, 2002, an adjuster for Liberty wrote a letter to Kessel informing him that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">Based on the healthcare information received as of this date, this letter is to notify you that your claim for asbestos related disease is denied. It is our opinion there is not sufficient evidence to indicate this is related to your employment at Stimson Lumber Co.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">\u00b65 On August 22, 2002, the Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI) in accordance with \u00a7 39-72-602(2)(a), MCA (1999), notified Kessel and Liberty that a medical panel examination of Kessel had been scheduled for September 20, 2002. Kessel contacted Liberty and requested cancellation of the evaluation. Liberty replied that it was constrained by \u00a7 39-72-602, MCA, which required such an evaluation when an insurer has not accepted liability for an occupational disease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>claim. It acquiesced however to cancellation but did so without waiving \u201cany other rights or defenses that it may have with regard to [the] claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b66 On August <em>2, </em>2004, Kessel submitted a Petition for Workers\u2019 Compensation Mediation Conference to the DOLI. The conference took place on August 27, 2004. The mediator issued a recommendation on August 31, 2004, and mailed it to the parties on September 2, 2004. Subsequently, on October 18,2004, Kessel underwent an occupational disease panel evaluation (OD evaluation). The doctor who conducted the evaluation concluded that Kessel was suffering from asbestos-related lung disease as a result of his employment. On November 12, 2004, Kessel filed a Petition for Hearing with the WCC. On January 31,2005, Liberty moved for summary judgment on the ground that the two-year statute of limitations period provided in \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, had run prior to Kessel filing his Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b67 Liberty requested a hearing on its motion which was held on March 28, 2005. On August 4, 2005, the WCC, by order of then-WCC Judge McCarter, denied Liberty\u2019s motion and ruled that Kessel\u2019s Petition had been filed within the applicable statute of limitations period. The trial scheduled for the week of October 31, 2005, was vacated by agreement of counsel so that the parties could resolve the statute of limitations issue before proceeding to trial. Counsel stipulated to certification, and on July 10, 2006, current-WCC Judge Shea ordered that the August 4,2005 ruling denying Liberty\u2019s motion for summary judgment be certified as final for purposes of appeal. Liberty filed a Notice of Appeal with this Court on July 12, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b68 We review a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence. We review a WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Preston v. Transportation Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 339, \u00b6 19, 324 Mont. 225, \u00b6 19, 102 P.3d 527, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b69 <em>Issue: Did the WCC err when it ruled that the two-year statute of limitations provided for at \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, does not begin to run until after the occupational disease evaluator issues its report?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b610 Based on Kessel\u2019s January 2001 last working day at Stimson, the statutes applicable to his case are the 1999 versions of the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Compensation Act, \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-101 through 2914, MCA (WCA), and the Occupational Disease Act of Montana, \u00a7\u00a7 39-72-101 through 714, MCA (ODA) (repealed 2005). <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp., </em>224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382 (1986) (law in effect on the date of the injury determines compensation), and <em>Gidley v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>221 Mont. 36, 38, 717 P.2d 21, 22 (1986) (The last date of actual employment sets the contractual rights of the parties.). Section 39-72-402(1), MCA (1999), provides that except as otherwise specified, the practice and procedure prescribed in the WCA applies to proceedings under the ODA. The relevant provisions of the two acts are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">Section 39-71-2905, MCA, (1999) (of the WCA) which provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">(1) A claimant or an insurer who has a dispute concerning any benefits under chapter 71 of this title may petition the workers\u2019 compensation judge for a determination of the dispute after satisfying dispute resolution requirements otherwise provided in this chapter.... After parties have satisfied dispute resolution requirements provided elsewhere in this chapter, the workers\u2019 compensation judge has exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations concerning disputes under chapter 71....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">(2) A petition for hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation judge must be filed within 2 years after benefits are denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">Section 39-72-602, MCA, (1999) (of the ODA) provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">Insurer may accept liability \u2014 procedure for medical examination when insurer has not accepted liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">(1) An insurer may accept liability for a claim under this chapter based on information submitted to it by a claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">(2) In order to determine the compensability of claims under this chapter when an insurer has not accepted liability, the following procedure must be followed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">(a) The department shall direct the claimant to an evaluator on the list of physicians for an examination. The evaluator shall conduct an examination to determine whether the claimant is totally disabled and is suffering from an occupational disease. In the case of a fatality, the evaluator shall examine the records to determine if the death was caused by an occupational disease. The evaluator shall submit a report of the findings to the department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">(b) Within 7 working days of receipt, the department shall mail the report of the evaluator\u2019s findings to the insurer and claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">(c) Upon receipt of the report, if a dispute exists over initial compensability of an occupational disease, it is considered a dispute that, after mediation pursuant to department rule, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>subject to the jurisdiction of the workers\u2019 compensation court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az8\">\u00b611 Liberty maintained that Kessel\u2019s Petition was time-barred, and posited the following alternative theories to the WCC in support of its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">* Section 39-71-2905(2), MCA, does not include a tolling provision and is a statute of repose, <em>not </em>a statute of limitation. A statute of repose cannot be tolled by a mediation request or an OD evaluation. Kessel\u2019s cause of action accrued on August 2, 2002 \u2014 the day Liberty denied his claim for benefits-and the two-year time period expired on August 1, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">* <em>If </em>the two-year time period in \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, can be tolled by a mediation request, Kessel\u2019s request filed on August 2, 2004, was filed one day too late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">* <em>If </em>the two-year time period actually expired on August 2, 2004, rather than August 1, <em>and </em>the statute can be tolled by a mediation request, it cannot be tolled further by an OD evaluation; therefore, in Kessel\u2019s case the statute expired on September 25, 2004, twenty-five days after the August 31, 2004, mediation recommendation was issued. As such Kessel\u2019s Petition for Hearing filed on November 12, 2004, was untimely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">* Lastly, <em>if </em>an OD evaluation can toll the statute, in this case, the limitations period nonetheless expired before Kessel filed his Petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b612 Liberty further maintained that \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2905 and 39-72-602, MCA, can be read harmoniously, and that the statutes when read together simply require that a claimant submit to an OD evaluation within the two-year statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b613 Kessel countered that <em>Preston </em>supported his contention that the time limitation provided in \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, was tolled by his request for mediation. He further asserted that because his claim was an occupational disease claim, the OD evaluation process mandated in circumstances such as his by \u00a7 39-72-602, MCA, also tolled the two-year statute of limitation. Additionally, he submitted that DOLI allowed the insurer thirty days after the completed OD evaluation recommendation to determine if it would accept or deny the claim. Based on this allowance, Kessel calculated a limitations expiration of November 25,2004, i.e. October 26, 2004, plus thirty days. Using this calculation, he maintained that his November 12, 2004 Petition was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u00b614 The WCC, citing <em>Fleming v. International Paper Co., </em>2005 MTWCC 34, rejected Liberty\u2019s argument that the relevant statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>a statute of repose, having held in <em>Fleming </em>that it is a statute of limitations that is tolled upon the filing of a mediation petition. Additionally, the court held that under <em>Bosch v. Town Pump, Inc., </em>2004 MT 330, 324 Mont. 138, 102 P.3d 32, a limitations period is calculated by excluding the day of the event which gives rise to the claim. In this case, August 2, 2002, is the day the claim arose; therefore, the statute of limitations began running on August 3,2002. As a result, August 2, 2004, was the last day of the limitations period <em>and </em>the day that Kessel requested mediation which stopped the running of the limitations period. However, after so finding, the WCC then held that \u201cthe event triggering the limitations period under section 39-71-2905(2), MCA (1995-2003), [was] not Liberty\u2019s original denial but rather its denial after the medical panel evaluation\u201d (emphasis in original); therefore, Kessel\u2019s November 12,2004, filing of his Petition was within the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b615 The WCC reasoned that \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2905 and 39-72-602, MCA, must be read and applied together. By so doing, the court concluded that Liberty\u2019s letter denying Kessel\u2019s occupational disease claim on August 2, 2002, was a \u201cnon-acceptance\u201d rather than a \u201cdenial\u201d under \u00a7 39-72-602, MCA. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">The language of [\u00a7 39-72-602, MCA,] indicates that an initial, premedical panel denial of an occupational disease claim is to be treated as nonfinal, i.e., a \u201cnonacceptance\u201d rather than a denial. The section expressly requires that where a claim is not initially accepted, the medical panel provisions must be followed, and only after a report is issued does a denial become a dispute which is both subject to mediation and to the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Thus, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court lacks jurisdiction over an occupational disease claim which has not been accepted by an insurer until the medical panel provision is satisfied, and until such time, section 39-71-2905(2), MCA (1995-2003), does not come into play. I therefore conclude and hold that the limitations period under section 39-71-2905(2), MCA (1995-2003), did not commence running until November of 2004, after the medical panel report issued. Thus, the petition in this case is not time-barred. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b616  The rationale underlying the WCC\u2019s order appears to be somewhat conflicting-in one part of the order the court, relying on <em>Preston </em>and <em>Bosch, </em>states that the statute of limitations began running on August 3,2002, but was tolled by Kessel\u2019s request for mediation on August 2, 2004, while, in its conclusion, the court states that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>limitations period under \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA (1995-2003), did not commence running until after the medical panel report was issued some time in November 2004. While the WCC\u2019s interpretation of <em>Preston </em>and <em>Bosch </em>was correct, we conclude these cases do not dictate the date the statute of limitations began to run in this case. We also conclude that the WCC\u2019s holding that the statute did not begin to run until after the OD evaluation report was issued was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b617 Whether the statute of limitations applicable to this case is tolled until after a statutorily-mandated OD evaluation has been conducted is a question of first impression for this Court. As stated by the WCC, resolution of this issue requires the joint reading and application of both relevant statutes. We begin with \u00a7 39-72-602, MCA (1999), which expressly states that in the event an insurer \u201chas not accepted liability,\u201d the DOLI <em>must </em>direct the claimant to an evaluator and an examination <em>must </em>be performed. The language of the statute is unequivocal and mandatory. While Liberty takes issue with the WCC\u2019s characterization that its denial in August 2002 was a \u201cnonacceptance\u201d of Kessel\u2019s claim under \u00a7 39-72-602, MCA, rather than a denial which triggered the two-year limitations period in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, the fact remains that under the language of the statute, a final \u201cdenial\u201d of an OD claim cannot take place until after an OD evaluation has been conducted. Turning to \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, the statute plainly, and without ambiguity, states that a petition for hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation judge must be filed within 2 years after benefits are denied. Again, however, interpreted in the context of \u00a7 39-72-602, MCA, such a denial in an OD claim can take place only after an OD evaluation has been conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b618  Liberty argues that the statutes, read together, can operate simultaneously by requiring that an OD evaluation be conducted within the two-year statutory period. It maintains that, as a result of the WCC\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 39-71-2905(2), MCA, now reads, \u201cA petition for hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation judge must be filed within 2 years after benefits are denied, <em>and after an injured worker can file for mediation and then petition the Court.\u201d </em>The insurer opines that the court\u2019s interpretation violates the rule of statutory construction that a judge is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. We note, however, that \u00a7 39-72-602, MCA, of the now-repealed ODA, did not impose a requirement that a claimant submit to the statutorily-required medical examination within a specific amount of time. Were we to adopt Liberty\u2019s construction of the statute, we would, in essence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>be inserting a requirement that an evaluator conduct an OD examination within two years of the insurer\u2019s notice to the claimant that it \u201chas not accepted liability.\u201d Moreover, we would be required to omit, or ignore, the mandatory language that, in a case where an insurer has not accepted liability, an OD evaluation must occur before a dispute can be presented to and resolved by the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b619 We acknowledge concerns that our interpretation could result in an OD claimant\u2019s claim being open for an indeterminate amount of time after discovery of the medical condition underlying the claim. However, our ruling in this case will, in any event, have limited application. Section 39-71-2905, MCA, was enacted in 1997. The Occupational Disease Act was repealed, effective July 1, 2005. Therefore our ruling will apply only to those OD cases arising prior to June 30, 2005, where medical evaluations have already occurred. Moreover, it is reasonable to conclude that claimants will not unnecessarily delay the evaluation as such delay will also delay receipt of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b620  Having determined that Liberty did not \u201cdeny\u201d Kessel\u2019s OD claim until sometime after the DOLI issued the OD examination report on October 26, 2004, Kessel\u2019s Petition filed on November 12, 2004, is timely. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we conclude the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and that its conclusion of law is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b621 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-8\">JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON, RICE and LEAPHART CONCUR.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
