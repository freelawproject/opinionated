(Povsha), sought to enjoin and set aside a zoning change and subdivision approval by the City of Billings, et al. (the City), to accommodate a request by James Capser and Sunworks, LLC (collectively Capser) to build Big Sky Auto Auction (BSAA) adjacent to Povsha\u2019s residence. The District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County, granted the City\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. Povsha appeals the court\u2019s decision along with an earlier order of the court denying Povsha\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b62 Povsha raises two issues on appeal which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the City given the City\u2019s failure to compel or require the developers of BSAA to erect an appropriate sound wall structure or buffer adjacent to BSAA\u2019s property line as called for under the City-County Uniform Zoning Regulations (UZR); permitting an increase in the allowable building-size limitations called for under the UZR; and permitting the land to be used as a wholesale auto auction in contravention of the mandates of the UZR.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Povsha\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and rejecting Povsha\u2019s claim that the City\u2019s approval of this development was tantamount to illegal spot zoning. \u00b65 Because we hold that the issues presented are moot, we dismiss this appeal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u00b66 BSAA was a commercial automobile auction facility. It had been in operation in Billings since 1997. The facility consisted of an auto auction building, body shop and detail shop. BSAA employed 120 to 150 full-time employees and it generally had 1,500 cars on site at a given time. The lease on BSAA\u2019s original location was due to expire November 1, 2002, and BSAA management had determined that this location could no longer accommodate BSAA\u2019s business needs due to growth. Consequently, in late 2001 or early 2002, BSAA began looking for an alternate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">\u00b67 Joseph Miller (Miller) owned approximately 60.9 acres of undeveloped land south of Interstate 90, one-quarter of a mile east of the South Billings Boulevard Interchange. This land lay outside of the boundary for the Billings Urban Planning Area and the Billings city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>limits. The land was eventually designated as the Willowbrook subdivision. Miller sold a segment of this land to Capser to be used as the site of the new BSAA facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b68 In early January 2002, Capser and Miller applied to the City-County Planning Department requesting expansion of the Billings Urban Planning Area to encompass this property which, at that time, was zoned \u201cAgricultural-Open.\u201d The application asked that the property be designated as an \u201cUrban Study Area\u201d and stated that the requested expansion \u201cis in anticipation of an annexation request for a portion of the 60.9-acre study area\u201d and that the \u201cintention will be to develop the study area for commercial uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b69 On February 14,2002, the City\u2019s Development Review Committee held a preliminary review meeting to discuss this proposed zone change. At the meeting, Povsha, and others residing near the property, raised numerous concerns regarding the potential incompatibility of the proposal with the adjacent residential area and the nearby Riverfront Park. Following the public hearing, the zoning commission voted to recommend denial of the proposed zone change due largely to the incompatibility of the wholesale auto auction use with the character of the surrounding residential area.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b610 At its meeting on March 25, 2002, the City Council voted to conditionally approve annexation of Lots 1 through 4 of the subject property with Lot 4 to be dedicated to use by BSAA and Lot 5 to remain \u201copen-agricultural.\u201d Because one of these five lots was situated within the jurisdiction of Yellowstone County (the County), the Board of County Commissioners voted on April 9, 2002, to approve the subdivision application. On April 22, 2002, the City Council formally adopted and approved the zoning change.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b611 On May 22, 2002, Povsha filed his initial complaint seeking to enjoin and set aside the zoning change and corresponding subdivision approval. Povsha subsequently filed an amended complaint accompanied by an application for a preliminary injunction to prevent the development from going forward. Following an evidentiary hearing on June 18, 2002, the District Court denied Povsha\u2019s application. Povsha did not appeal the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u00b612 The City issued Sunworks abuilding permit for BSAA on June 13, 2002, and the BSAA development was completed sometime in the fall of2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">\u00b613 On June 20, 2002, the County, which had also been named as a defendant in these proceedings, filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. Povsha filed his opposition to the motion on July 5, 2002. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Because the District Court considered matters outside of the pleadings, the County\u2019s motion was converted into a Motion for Summary Judgment. After a hearing on December 6, 2002, the District Court denied the County\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b614 On May 1,2003, Povsha filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that the underlying actions upon which the development was approved constituted a form of illegal spot zoning or special legislation and were thus invalid. A hearing on Povsha\u2019s motion was held on August 29, 2003, after which the court denied the motion determining that triable issues remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b615 After several postponements, trial in this matter eventually was rescheduled for March 2, 2005. However, on February 11, 2005, counsel for the City requested a postponement of the trial so that he could file a Motion for Summary Judgment. The District Court granted the City\u2019s request and said motion was filed on April 28, 2005. In its motion, the City asserted that although reasonable minds could differ as to the advisability of the development, the actions of the City Council were entitled to presumptive validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b6 16 Following a hearing conducted on July 25,2005, the District Court entered an order granting the City\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. The court concluded that this zoning change was part of a gradual and pervasive transition from agricultural use to entry-way commercial use and that use of the land for a wholesale auto action as part of a planned development was consistent with the uses in the surrounding area since the construction of the Interstate Interchange. Hence, the court determined that the planned development was not spot zoning or special legislation and that the process leading to the zoning change was fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b617 Povsha appeals from the District Court\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u00b618 Povsha requests on appeal that we reverse the underlying determinations of the District Court and enter judgment in Povsha\u2019s favor. Povsha concedes in its brief on appeal that the damage in this case has already been done-i.e., the City granted the zoning change and approved the subdivision and BSAA was built adj acent to Povsha\u2019s property. Because we can no longer grant effective relief in this case, we hold that this appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">\u00b619  Mootness is a threshold issue which must be resolved before addressing the underlying dispute. <em>Grabow v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 159, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 227, \u00b6 14, 3 P.3d 650, \u00b6 14 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6 17, 293 Mont. 188, \u00b6 17, 974 P.2d 1150, \u00b6 17). This Court has consistently held that \u201ca moot question is one which existed once but because of an event or happening, it has ceased to exist and no longer presents an actual controversy.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Lewis and Clark, </em>1999 MT 106, \u00b6 12, 294 Mont. 310, \u00b6 12, 980 P.2d 1049, \u00b6 12 (quoting <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Murray, </em>183 Mont. 499, 503, 600 P.2d 1174, 1176 (1979)). Moreover, a case will become moot for the purposes of an appeal \u201cwhere by a change of circumstances prior to the appellate decision the case has lost any practical purpose for the parties, for instance where the grievance that gave rise to the case has been eliminated ....\u201d <em>Matter of T.J.F., </em>229 Mont. 473, 475, 747 P.2d 1356, 1357 (1987) (quoting 5 Am. Jur. <em>2d Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 762 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b620 We recently determined <em>in Henesh v. Board of Commissioners of Gallatin County, </em>2007 MT 335, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 340 Mont. 239, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 173 P.3d 1188, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, that because this Court could no longer grant effective relief in that case, the appeal was moot and we granted the County\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. Henesh had alleged that Gallatin County\u2019s preliminary approval of the Dry Minor Subdivision was unlawful. While the action was pending, the District Court did not enter an injunction prohibiting the County or the developer from proceeding with the process to secure approval of the subdivision. Consequently, Gallatin County approved the Dry Minor Subdivision and the lots in the subdivision were sold to a third party. <em>Henesh, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b621 We noted in <em>Henesh, </em>that although Henesh timely appealed from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing her complaint, she did not apply for a stay of the judgment in either the District Court or this Court. Thus, there was no order in effect which would have prohibited the County from finally approving the Dry Minor Subdivision, or preventing the lots in the subdivision from being sold. <em>Henesh, </em>\u00b6 3. We stated that because Henesh failed to seek available remedies to preserve the status quo pending appeal, she could not be heard to complain because the opposing parties continued with the process to secure final approval of the subdivision. <em>Henesh, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b622 Similarly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the City long ago granted the zoning change at issue here and BSAA was built adjacent to Povsha\u2019s property. In its First Amended Complaint filed June 18,2002, Povsha requested that the District Court enjoin the City from implementing approval of a final plat map and from approving the subdivision, and that any further proceedings be stayed. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>subsequently denied Povsha\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"A8L\">\u00b623  Povsha could have appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for injunctive relief under M. R. App. P. 1(b)(2), but he failed to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Povsha also could have moved the District Court and then this Court to stay the zoning change and subdivision proceedings in the City and County under M. R. App. P. 7,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before those proceedings became final. Again, he failed to do so. If this Court cannot restore the parties to their original position, the appeal becomes moot. <em>Shamrock Motors, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Martin Development Co. v. Keeney Const. Co., </em>216 Mont. 212, 219, 703 P.2d 143, 148 (1985)). Thus, having abdicated the two remedies which would have preserved the status quo pending this Court\u2019s final resolution of the merits of his claim on appeal, we are no longer able to grant Povsha effective relief. <em>Turner v. Mountain Engineering and Const., Inc., </em>276 Mont. 55, 59-60, 915 P.2d 799, 803 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b624 Therefore, we hold that the grievance that gave rise to this case-zoning change and subdivision approval to allow the development of BSAA-has lost any practical purpose for the parties and is thus moot for the purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b625 Dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> As of October 1, 2007, M.
