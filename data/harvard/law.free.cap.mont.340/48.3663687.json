We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">\u00b62 Owens raises a number of issues for the first time on appeal that we decline to review. Generally, this Court will not address issues that were not raised before the district court. <em>Wheelsmith Fabrication v. Dept. of Labor, </em>2000 MT 27, \u00b6 11, 298 Mont. 187, \u00b6 11, 993 P.2d 713, \u00b6 11. We need to address only whether the District Court correctly affirmed the Director\u2019s decision to revoke Owens\u2019s all-beverage license.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">\u00b63 Owens applied for an all-beverages license in April of 1996 for Flathead County. The Department of Revenue (Department) may award a county license only for those locations whose nearest entrance sits more than five miles from the nearest city limit. Section 16-4-201, MCA. Owens provided in her application a Certified Survey Affidavit signed by a private licensed land surveyor named Christopher Balstad, Jr. (Balstad) to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. The affidavit asserted that the premises sat \u201cmore than five miles from the incorporated city of Kalispell.\u201d The Department approved the application based on this information and Owens received the license. \u00b64 Montana Department of Justice Investigator Andrew Brinton (Brinton) received three separate contacts in March of 1998 alleging a problem with Owens\u2019s license, including a charge that her establishment was not located beyond the five mile requirement. Brinton learned that Balstad had measured the distance for the original application merely by taking a scaled reading from a map.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">\u00b65 Brinton solicited three bids for conducting a land-based survey to confirm whether Owens\u2019s bar satisfied the distance requirement. The successful bidder, Eby and Associates of Kalispell, measured the radial survey distance and determined that the bar\u2019s nearest entrance sat 4.911 miles (470 feet short of 5 miles) from the nearest boundary of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>city limits of Kalispell. The Department notified Owens that it was revoking her license based upon the incorrect information in her application and her noncompliance with the distance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b66 Owens contested the revocation before a hearing examiner pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-611, MCA. Tom Sands (Sands), the former owner of the property, testified. Sands, a licensed surveyor who had performed numerous certified surveys for liquor license applications, knew that an establishment must sit five miles outside of city limits in order for an applicant to obtain a county all-beverages license. Sands testified that he knew that Owens intended to use the property for a bar, and that he believed he had informed her that the property sat within five miles of the city limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b67 Balstad testified that he took his measurement by scaling the distance on a map. He testified that he went to the City Planner\u2019s Office in Kalispell to obtain the map and to determine the location of the city boundary. Balstad testified that the city zoning administrator, Brian Wood (Wood), showed Balstad the location of the Kalispell city limit. Balstad testified that he used an engineer\u2019s ruler to measure the distance from the city limit to Owens\u2019s property. Balstad also testified that he did not use the nearest door entrance as his measuring point, but instead measured from the property boundary closest to the Kalispell city limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b68 Wood testified that Balstad came to his office to measure the distance of the property from the Kalispell city limit. Wood testified that his primary responsibility in their exchange constituted giving accurate information to Balstad regarding the existing city boundary. Wood testified that Balstad made no determination regarding the property\u2019s compliance with the five mile distance requirement on the initial visit to the City Planner\u2019s Office. He testified that he and Balstad discussed Balstad\u2019s \u201cconclusion\u201d that the property sat beyond the five mile radius on a subsequent visit. Wood testified that he concurred in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b69 The hearing examiner heard testimony from both Eby and surveyors testifying on behalf of Owens, most notably Balstad himself, regarding the imprecise nature of scaling from a map. In contrast, both Eby and another surveyor present on behalf of Owens, testified as to the high degree of precision attainable with the equipment and methods employed by Eby. Eby testified in detail as to the equipment she used and her methodology. The hearing examiner recommended that the Director affirm the revocation. Owens objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00b610 Owens and the Department filed briefs and presented argument to the Director. The Director adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact and recommendation without modification in the Final Agency Decision and revoked Owens\u2019s license. The Director pointed to the substantial evidence supporting the hearing examiner\u2019s findings as detailed in the 44-page recommendation. Owens sought judicial review and the District Court upheld the Department\u2019s revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b611 The District Court based its initial order on documents provided by the parties as the Department had failed to transmit the administrative record. Owens appealed. We dismissed the appeal without prejudice to provide the District Court the opportunity to make its decision based upon the entire administrative record. <em>Owens v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, </em>2006 MT 36, 331 Mont. 166, 130 P.3d 1256. The District Court again affirmed the Department\u2019s decision to revoke the all-beverages license after reviewing the entire record, including the hearing transcript and the parties\u2019 briefs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b612 We review agency findings to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(v), MCA. We review an agency\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Hofer v. Montana DPHHS, </em>2005 MT 302, \u00b6 14, 329 Mont. 368, \u00b6 14, 124 P.3d 1098, \u00b6 14. The same standard of review applies to \u201cboth the District Court\u2019s review of the administrative decision and our subsequent review of the District Court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Hofer, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b613 The scope of our review is narrow in considering the Director\u2019s factual findings. <em>Ramage v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>236 Mont. 69, 74, 768 P.2d 864, 867 (1989). We may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence. Section 2-4-704(2), MCA. We employ a three-part test to determine whether an agency\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous: (1) we review the record to see if substantial evidence supports the findings, (2) if substantial evidence supports the findings, we determine if the agency misapprehended the effect of the evidence, and (3) if both of the above are satisfied, we still may decide a finding is clearly erroneous if a review of the record leaves the Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Kiser v. State, Dept. of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 228, \u00b6 7, 296 Mont. 93, \u00b6 7, 987 P.2d 363, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b614 Owens contends that the Director lacked sufficient evidence to determine that her property sat within the five mile radius. She also contends that the Director lacked sufficient evidence to determine that her application contained false information. She further asserts that the Director misapprehended the effect of the evidence in deciding to revoke her license.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b615 The hearing examiner set forth his findings of fact in great detail after conducting a thorough hearing. The examiner found that Sands, the seller of the property, had put Owens on notice that the property might not comply with the distance requirement. The examiner heard testimony from both sides regarding the potential for error in the scaled map measurement performed by Balstad.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b616 Balstad testified that he had measured from Owens\u2019s nearest property boundary rather than from the nearest door entrance. The administrative rules governing the applications, however, define \u201cpremises\u201d as the actual building and areas outside, and attached to, the licensed buildings to which patrons have free access and where the preparation, sale, service or consumption of alcohol occurs. Admin. R. M. 42.13.111(7)-(8). Thus, the hearing examiner heard testimony that Balstad not only employed an unreliable methodology, but that he also used an invalid landmark in taking his measurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u00b617  Witnesses for Owens and the Department spoke to the reliability of Eby\u2019s land-based survey. The examiner heard no testimony to refute Eby\u2019s determination that the distance was less than five miles. The examiner found that Balstad\u2019s survey was unreliable and that Eby\u2019s land-based survey accurately measured the distance at 4.911 miles. Consequently, the examiner found that Owens had received invalidly a county license despite the fact that her property sat within the five mile radius. The examiner also found that Owens\u2019s original application included false information in that it asserted that the proposed location sat beyond the five mile limit. The Director adopted all of these findings without modification. Substantial evidence supports the Director\u2019s findings and nothing in the record indicates that the Director misapprehended the effect of these findings. \u00b618 Owens next asserts that the Director misapplied the statutes and administrative rules concerning all-beverages licenses. As outlined in \u00a7 16-4-201, MCA, establishments operating with county all-beverages licenses must sit in unincorporated county areas, and the nearest entrance of the premises must be at least five miles from incorporated cities or towns. The governing administrative rules require applicants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>to provide a sworn statement or affidavit from a surveyor or government official attesting to the \u201cexact distance from the nearest corporate boundary to the proposed premises ....\u201d Admin. R. M. 42.12.130(2). The agency may revoke the license if it finds that an applicant made a false statement in any part of the original application. Sections 16-4-402(3)(a), 16-4-406(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b619 Owens filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority during this appeal. Owens directed this Court\u2019s attention to an amendment to \u00a7 16-4-402, MCA, enacted by the 2007 legislature. Section 1, Ch. 257, L.2007. The amendment prohibits the Department from revoking a license on the basis of a false statement in an application if the statement \u201cis based upon a verifiable assertion made by a governmental officer, employee, or agent that an applicant relied upon in good faith....\u201d Section 1, Ch. 257, L.2007; \u00a7 16-4-402(3)(b), MCA. The provision applies to all revocation proceedings that \u201chave not been finally adjudicated on ...\u201d as of April 26, 2007. Section 3, Ch. 257, L.2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b620 Owens claims that she based the statement in her application regarding the situs of the property upon a \u201cverifiable assertion\u201d made by Wood, the city zoning administrator. She contends that she relied in good faith on Wood\u2019s concurrence that her property met the five mile distance requirement. She asserts that the Department cannot revoke her license based upon her good faith reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b621 The Department did not revoke Owens\u2019s license, however, solely on the basis of the false statement included in her application. The Department correctly noted that the quota provisions for all-beverages licenses also invalidated Owens\u2019s license. Section 16-4-201, MCA, constrains the Department\u2019s ability to issue all-beverages licenses when administering the program. The quotas set forth in \u00a7 16-4-201, MCA, limit the number of city licenses that the agency can issue. The Department may not issue licenses to applicants who do not satisfy the distance requirements. Section 16-4-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b622  The hearing examiner found that Owens\u2019s bar sat within five miles of the nearest city limit of Kalispell. This finding conflicted with Owens\u2019s survey affidavit. The examiner\u2019s finding revealed not only the presence of false information in Owens\u2019s application, but also that the Department had issued invalidly a county license for an establishment that required a city license. The Director correctly concluded that the statutory and administrative guidelines allowed for the revocation of Owens\u2019s license. The District Court, in turn, correctly affirmed the Director\u2019s application of the law. We will not disturb that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b78-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b78-5\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Asv\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b624 I dissent from the Court\u2019s blithe dismissal of Owens\u2019s claims. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment affirming the Final Agency Decision and remand with instructions to reinstate Owens\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u00b625 The Court offers two bases for its decision. The first-that there was a false statement included in Owens\u2019s application justifying the revocation-was effectively dealt a death blow by the recent amendment to \u00a7 16-4-402, MCA, as referenced in \u00b6 19 of the Court\u2019s Opinion. The amendment provides that if a false statement in an application is based upon a verifiable assertion of a governmental agent upon which an applicant relied in good faith, the Department may not revoke a license on the basis of such a false statement. This amendment applies by its terms to this case, as these revocation proceedings have not yet been finally adjudicated (Opinion, \u00b6 19), and is dispositive of the \u201cfalse statement\u201d grounds for revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b626 As Owens points out and this Court concedes, Brian Wood, the city zoning administrator, concurred with Balstad\u2019s conclusion that the property sat beyond the 5-mile radius. Opinion, \u00b6 8. Woods testified during the administrative hearing of March 8-9, 2001, to this effect, confirming that he and Balstad together performed a \u201cfairly simple mathematical procedure\u201d using the scale of the USGS maps to determine where the 5-mile line would be, and further that he concurred in the conclusion that the property in question was beyond the 5-mile line. Owens and Balstad had every right to rely on this assertion. Thus, Owens has demonstrated on the record \u201ca verifiable assertion made by a governmental officer, employee or agent\u201d upon which she was entitled to and did rely in good faith. Under the law as amended, therefore, any false statement as to distance may not be used as a basis for revocation of her license.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b627 Seemingly conceding the preclusive effect of this statutory change (Opinion, \u00b6 21), the Court offers an alternative conclusion, that being that the quota provisions for all-beverage licenses also invalidated Owens\u2019s license. The Court states that because \u201cthe Department had issued invalidly a county license for an establishment that required a city license,\u201d the Director correctly concluded that Owens\u2019s license should be revoked. Opinion, \u00b6 22. With all due respect, this conclusion is both unfair and wrong. It is unfair because the reasoning is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>circular-the argument that the license was invalid rests upon the \u201cfalse statement\u201d grounds eliminated by the statutory amendment noted above. Moreover, any mistake ostensibly made was that of the Department, and not Owens. More importantly, it is wrong because in 1997, the City of Kalispell informed the Department that as a result of an annexation, Owens\u2019s premises was now located within the corporate boundaries of Kalispell, thus requiring Owens to obtain a City license. Owens proceeded to obtain a City license as directed by the Department, paying twice the fee for the privilege when she renewed her license the following year. Therefore, any problem ostensibly created by virtue of the erroneous issuance of a County license was eliminated by the Department when it instructed Owens to secure a City license and she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b628 Owens jumped through every administrative hoop required, securing all approvals and the license needed to proceed with the construction of her bar. Justifiably assuming that her license was valid, she then spent 13 months and considerable money in improving the premises. The revocation of her license years after the fact is neither just nor legally supportable. I would therefore reverse and remand with instructions to reinstate Owens\u2019s license. I strongly dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
