The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"b559-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Done in open Court this 1st day of November, 2007.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate id=\"AZL\">DATED this 15th day of November, 2007.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b559-3\">Rule 17 ofthe Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana provides that \u201cthe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (\u00a746-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed, with the clear understanding that this sentence shall run concurrently with Powell County District Court Cause Number DC-04-15 to reflect Judge McLean\u2019s intent at sentencing and the recommendation within the plea agreement.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-8\">Chairperson, Hon.
