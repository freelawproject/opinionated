The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive in light of sentences for similar crimes around the state. The Division also stresses the importance that restitution be included and that there is time permitted to the Defendant to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended as follows: Count I: A commitment to the Department of Corrections for a term of ten (10) years, with seven (7) years suspended, and credit for time served (105) days; Count II: A commitment to the Department of Corrections for a term of five (5) years, all suspended, and credit for time served (105) days; and Count III: A commitment to the Department of Corrections for a term of five (5) years, all suspended, and credit for time served (105) days. Counts I, II and III shall run concurrently with each other.
