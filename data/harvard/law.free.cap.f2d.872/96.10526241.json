RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">An insurance company denied a dentist disability payments due to his misrepresentations of material facts on his insurance application. The dentist contends that (1) while his application contained misrepresentations, the insurance broker was an agent of the insurance company and the company is bound by the broker\u2019s alleged knowledge of them; and (2) the facts he misrepresented were not material because they were not \u201cobjectively relevant.\u201d The district court found these arguments to be without merit. As the district court\u2019s fact findings are supported by the record and it applied correct legal principles, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">In response to a solicitation from Charles Edwards, an employee of Omni Group, Dr. Martin Manzella purchased a $4,000 monthly disability-income policy from The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company in 1985. Omni Group is a broker which sells insurance to its clients from several different companies. When filling out the Paul Revere application, Manzella informed Edwards that he had existing disability insurance with Union Mutual, providing benefits of $1,200 a month, and with Commercial, providing benefits of $6,000 a month. Edwards explained that if Manzella obtained additional insurance he would be \u201coverin-sured\u201d according to Paul Revere\u2019s underwriting guidelines. Manzella agreed to \u201cdrop\u201d his Commercial coverage and have Edwards later \u201crewrite\u201d it so that he could obtain insurance from Paul Revere.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">In filling out the Paul Revere application, Manzella did not disclose that he also had a disability policy with Provident providing coverage of $3,500 per month. Manzella allegedly informed Edwards of the existence of his Provident policy three months after filling out the Paul Revere application, but Edwards did not reveal to Paul Revere either this information or the information about the Commercial policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">In addition, on the Paul Revere application Manzella represented his income for each of the past three years as having been $120,000, although he had reported annual earnings of approximately $50,000 on his federal income tax returns for those same three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">In May 1986, Manzella was blinded when some amalgram filling exploded in his eyes. He filed claims for disability with Union Mutual, Commercial, Provident, and Paul Revere, but in his Paul Revere claim he denied the existence of any other policies. After investigating Manzella\u2019s disability claim, agents for Paul Revere discovered his misrepresentations and told Manzella that they knew that he had other coverage. Manzella then admitted that he had two other policies but continued to conceal the existence of his Provident policy. At that time he was receiving benefits from Provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>dent and he had also failed to disclose in his claim to Provident that he was receiving disability benefits from Paul Revere. Upon confirmation from Provident that Manzella\u2019s coverage with Provident predated his application to Paul Revere, Paul Revere stopped payment on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Manzella sued to recover the remainder of his alleged coverage, and Paul Revere filed a counter-claim to recover the $49,-766.82 it had paid Manzella before it discovered the misrepresentations on his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Whether Edwards\u2019 knowledge is imputed to Paul Revere depends upon his legal status with respect to that company. An insurer is bound by its agent\u2019s actions and knowledge of the agent is imputed to the insurer, but an insurer is not charged with the same responsibility for the acts of independent brokers who are not its agents in a legal sense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Under Louisiana law, which is applicable in this diversity-jurisdiction case, the distinction between insurance agent and broker is drawn in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">(a)n insurance agent is a person expressly or impliedly authorized to represent an insurance company in dealing with third persons in matters relating to insurance. An \u201cinsurance agent\u201d is tied to his company ... whereas an \u201cinsurance broker\u201d is an independent middleman not tied to a particular company....<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">A Louisiana appellate court explained this distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">Insurance agents are persons employed by the insurance company to solicit risks and effect insurance. Insurance brokers solicit insurance from the public under no employment from any special company, placing the insurance with any company selected by the insured, or, failing such selection, by the broker himself <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">The evidence presented at trial established that Edwards and Omni acted as brokers, not as agents of Paul Revere, in obtaining the Paul Revere policy for Manzella. Edwards was employed by Omni, a group of brokers who provided disability insurance to clients from several different companies. Edwards testified that he considered Manzella to be \u201chis client.\u201d After Manzella became disabled, Edwards aided Manzella in making claims to the various disability insurers. Edwards acted in Manzella\u2019s best interest at all times, including the \u201cdrop and rewrite\u201d scheme he executed with Manzella\u2019s Commercial policy. These actions support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Edwards and Omni were \u201cindependent middlemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">Manzella relies on a decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court, <em>Tiner v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held that a broker is deemed to be an agent of an insurer as a matter of law under certain circumstances. In <em>Tiner, </em>however, correct information had been given by the applicant with no intent to deceive. The <em>Tiner </em>court held that the broker was acting as an agent because the broker misrepresented information while the plaintiff was relying on his expertise. In contrast, Manzella, apparently acting in concert with Edwards, knowingly misrepresented material facts, and the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of this case therefore did not require the district court to find that Edwards was Paul Revere\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">A Louisiana statute provides that the falsity of a statement in an application for insurance does not bar the insured\u2019s right to recover \u201cunless such false statement was made with actual intent to deceive or unless it materially' affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Louisiana courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>not interpreted this statute to mean that both components must be present, but rather, that materiality is determined by <em>either </em>the acceptance of the risk <em>or </em>the hazard assumed by the insurer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order for the applicant\u2019s misrepresentations to be material, therefore, it is not necessary that they increase the underwriting risk involved so long as they affect the decision of the insurer to issue the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Manzella\u2019s misrepresentations in this case did not affect the hazard assumed \u2014that is, they did not increase the risk that he would become disabled. The misrepresentations did, however, affect the acceptance of the risk because undisputed evidence at trial showed that Paul Revere would not have issued the coverage if it knew that Manzella had disability coverage with Provident and that his earned income was significantly less than he had reported. Paul Revere offered evidence that it declined overinsurance because an overinsured person has a strong inducement not to return to work in any capacity when his disability benefits pay more than he would earn when working. Indeed, Manzella, who had reported income when working of $50,000 a year, received more than $360,-000 in insurance benefits in the year following his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The application Manzella signed stated that his answers must be true and complete and that Paul Revere would rely on these answers in determining coverage. It is not necessary, as Manzella contends, that a \u201cred flag\u201d be raised when an insurance company asks a question in order to determine a material fact. There are no \u201cclasses\u201d of misrepresentations that are permissible merely because an applicant has not been specifically instructed to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Indeed, Manzella was aware that knowledge of his other disability policies was material to Paul Revere because Edwards informed him that Paul Revere\u2019s issue-and-participation limits prevented him from being overinsured. This is the reason Manzella agreed to drop his Commercial coverage and have Edwards rewrite it after he had been accepted by Paul Revere. Manzella understood that, since he was continuing his Union Mutual coverage, he would quality for Paul Revere coverage only if his income was as high as he had reported and he had no other coverage in force. Manzella\u2019s participation in the Commercial \u201cdrop and rewrite\u201d scheme shows that he realized the materiality of his other disability coverage in Paul Revere\u2019s decision to insure him and that he misrepresented information with the requisite \u201cintent to deceive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The evidence at trial refutes Manzella\u2019s assertion that his misrepresentations were \u201cmere oversight.\u201d Manzella had disability insurance with Provident dating back to 1975 and had upgraded his policies in 1980. He had received annual premium notices from Provident and had paid the policy premiums every year. He personally paid the premiums on his two Provident policies eight months before applying to Paul Revere for coverage. He listed his Provident insurance on an application to Commercial for a business overhead policy less than six months before applying to Paul Revere, as well as on every other disability insurance application he executed before and after applying to Paul Revere. These actions show clearly Manzella\u2019s intent to deceive Paul Revere by keeping his Provident policy a secret, rather than mere forgetfulness on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">As for Manzella\u2019s intent to deceive Paul Revere about his income, he alleges that he included \u201cperks\u201d in his income estimate on the application which asked for \u201cearned income\u201d rather than income as specified on tax returns. It is unlikely that such perks would more than double his salary, however, and Manzella also listed the inflated income on Paul Revere\u2019s financial supplement which specifically asked for income as reported on federal tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Manzella further demonstrated his appreciation of the materiality of his misrep-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>reservations by perpetuating his deception when filling out his disability claims. After he had become disabled, Manzella deliberately attempted to keep both Paul Revere and Provident ignorant of the existence of his insurance coverage with the other. Manzella\u2019s allegation that he did not remember his Provident coverage is refuted by the fact that he was receiving monthly benefits from Provident and that he had failed to list his Paul Revere coverage on the Provident claim forms. Manzella continued to deny the existence of his Provident policy even when specifically questioned by Paul Revere agents. His failure to disclose his Provident coverage provided compelling evidence of his intent to deceive Paul Revere.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">For these reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\">. <em>Karam v.
