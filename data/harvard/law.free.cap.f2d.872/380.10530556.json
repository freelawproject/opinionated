(ULC).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tax Commissioner audited the Webbs, disallowed the charitable contribution deductions, and determined income tax deficiencies and additions. The Webbs petitioned the Tax Court to review the Commissioner\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The Tax Court sustained the deficiencies and additions determined by the Commissioner. The Tax Court found that the Webbs had failed to establish that they had made deductible charitable contributions to an organization qualified to receive such contributions under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 170(c)(2)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Tax Court found the Webbs liable for $2,300 in damages under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6673.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The Commissioner\u2019s determination of a deficiency is presumed correct, and the taxpayer has the burden of proving it is incorrect. <em>Taylor v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>771 F.2d 478, 479 (11th Cir.1985). The Tax Court\u2019s findings must stand unless clearly erroneous. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1199-1200, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). The Tax Court found that the Webbs used the funds in the ULC chapter solely for their living expenses. The Webbs failed to demonstrate any charitable use of the money. Further, the Webbs made no contributions to ULC Modesto. The record supports the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the Webbs made no deductible charitable contributions to a qualified section 170(c)(2)(B) organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">Review of the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of statutory damages against a taxpayer is for abuse of discretion. <em>Pollard v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, </em>816 F.2d 603, 604 (11th Cir.1987). The Tax Court assessed $2,300 against the Webbs for instituting and maintaining a frivolous and groundless proceeding primarily for delay. The Tax Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing damages against the Webbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">The Commissioner requests that we impose sanctions, including attorney\u2019s fees, against the Webbs for bringing these frivolous appeals. Where an appeal is frivolous, we may assess damages against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>appellees, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and double costs. Fed.R.App.P. 38; 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1912; <em>see Pollard v. CIR, </em>at 605. In <em>Pollard, </em>we imposed $1,500 in sanctions without remanding the case for a determination of costs. <em>Pollard v. CIR, </em>at 605. Similarly, we award sanctions against the Webbs in the amount of $1,500 and double costs shall be taxed by the clerk. The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-10\">. In 1982, Gene Webb became an ordained minister in the Universal Life Church (ULC) of Modesto, California by mail. The Webbs opened a ULC chapter bank account under the name Universal Life Church, Inc. Debra maintained sole signatory authority over the account, and withdrew funds from personal accounts to deposit money in the ULC chapter account, allegedly as charitable contributions to ULC. Using the chapter account as a financial alter ego to their personal checking account, Debra wrote checks for the Webbs on the chapter account to pay personal bills and for personal living expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\">.
