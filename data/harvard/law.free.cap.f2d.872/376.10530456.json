BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">In 1983, Kenton Lee Bernard pleaded guilty to two violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2312 (West 1970) (interstate transportation of stolen vehicles) and to one violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314 (West 1970) (interstate transportation of a trailer attached to one of the vehicles). The district court sentenced Bernard to five years in prison for each section 2312 violation and to ten years in prison for the section 2314 violation. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">In 1987, Bernard filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West 1971) challenging the constitutionality of his punishment. Bernard contended that the court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences violated the fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The government contended that theft of the vehicle and the trailer constituted separate criminal actions. The government argued that theft of the vehicle violated section 2312 because the vehicle was \u201cself-propelled.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Theft of the trailer, the government argued, violated section 2314 because the trailer constituted non-self-propelled \u201cgoods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">In February, 1988, the district court summarily denied Bernard\u2019s section 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">The issue in this appeal is whether the district court violated the fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy by imposing consecutive sentences for Bernard\u2019s violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2312 and 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">Double jeopardy prohibits a court from imposing greater punishment than the legislature intended. <em>United States v. Ricks, </em>817 F.2d 692, 698 (11th Cir.1987) (citing <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.Ct. 673, 678, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983)). \u201cTo support a claim of double jeopardy, a defendant must show that the offenses are in law and fact the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>859 F.2d 863, 864 (11th Cir.1988). Stealing a vehicle and an attached trailer are not \u201cin law and fact the same offense.\u201d Bernard\u2019s actions violated two separate statutes; one relating to self-propelled \u201cvehicles\u201d and another relating to non-self-propelled \u201cgoods.\u201d The fact that the good was attached to the vehicle does not merge the violations. <em>See United States v. Kidding, </em>560 F.2d 1303, 1308-09 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 872, 98 S.Ct. 217, 54 L.Ed.2d 151 (1977) (\u201c[W]e think it likely that dealing illicitly with a tractor and trailer, even if the two items are already hooked together when stolen and when moving in interstate commerce, involves a larger misdeed than dealing with a single trailer.\u201d); <em>United States v. Lofty, </em>455 F.2d 506 (4th Cir.1972) (a trailer is not self-propelled and should be defined as a \u201cgood\u201d rather than as a \u201cvehicle\u201d); and <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>435 F.2d 1288 (9th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 921, 91 S.Ct. 909, 27 L.Ed.2d 802 (1971) (trailer constitutes \u201cgood\u201d because it is not self-propelled). Further, section 2312 requires proof that the stolen item constitutes a self-propelled vehicle. Section 2314 requires no such proof. <em>See Vaughn, </em>859 F.2d at 864 (\u201cWhether multiple charges constitute one offense turns on whether each charge requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u201d). <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>849 F.2d 522, 524 (11th Cir.1988) (citing <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences did not violate the fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Bernard\u2019s section 2255 motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-12\"> Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2311 (West 1970) defines a motor vehicle as \"an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motorcycle, or any other <em>self-propelled </em>vehicle designed for land but not on rails.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
