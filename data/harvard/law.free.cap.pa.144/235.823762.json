The association itself was neither a manufacturer of, nor a dealer in cigars.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b261-12\">(\u0431) The label certified, over the signature of the president, that the cigars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>in the box to which it was affixed were made by a first class workman whot was a member of the union, which was \u201copposed to inferior Rat-shop, Cooly, Prison, or Filthy Tenement-house Workmanship; \u201d and therefore recommended the cigars to smokers throughout the world:</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b262-4\">1. Not being a trader in any sense, the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union could have no distinctive trade-mark, entitled to protection under the act of congress of July 8, 1870; and the registration of said label in the patent-office, in the manner prescribed for the registration of trademarks, is unauthorized by the act, and would confer no right to have imitations thereof enjoined.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b262-5\">2. Nor, apart from the law of trade-marks, will equity give relief by enjoining the making and use of counterfeit copies of such a label; the purpose of which is to do harm to non-union men by covering them with opprobrium and preventing the sale of their work, the right of the association to use it being at least doubtful, whether the question be treated as one of morals or of law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b262-6\">3. It seems: As such injunction must issue at the suit of the owner of the device infringed, and the ownership of the label was admittedly in the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union, the officers of a local tributary association, subordinate to and a parcel of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union, had no standing to maintain a bill to enjoin the imitation of the label: Per Mr. Justice Williams.</syllabus>\n<judges data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b262-7\">Before Paxson, C.

Hicks, Frank Gastiger and H. Brownstetter, trustees of the Cigar Makers\u2019 Union, No. 126, of Ephrata, Pa., filed a bill in equity for themselves and for all other members of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America, against John H. Brendel, praying for an injunction to restrain the defendant from using, upon boxes of cigars to be sold by him, certain labels charged to have been made in imitation of labels issued by the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America, and from disposing of such counterfeit labels, or the plates from which they were made, otherwise than by their destruction. A preliminary injunction was awarded, and after argument was dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-10\">After answer by the defendant and replication, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. JE.

Said union is connected with and acknowledges the jurisdiction and control of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America, and they complain for themselves and for all the other members of the said Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America, numbering many thousands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">Said union is a voluntary unincorporated association of practical cigar-makers, formed for the purpose of promoting the mental, moral, and physical welfare of its members, by assisting them to obtain labor at remunerative prices, by affording them pecuniary aid in sickness, and to maintain a high standard of workmanship and fair wages as cigar-makers. For the purpose of designating the articles manufactured by members of the union, the latter, in convention assembled in 1880, devised and adopted a trade-mark or label to which they gave the name of \u201c Union Label,\u201d a fac-simile of which label is attached to plaintiffs\u2019 bill and made a part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The

not been known or used in this country or elsewhere, and ever since said adoption the members of said union have been and are now entitled to the exclusive use of said union labels, and the same have been pasted conspicuously on the outside of all boxes containing cigars made by the plaintiffs and all the other members of the said union.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-15\">The said union label affixed to cigar boxes is intended as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>guaranty that the cigars therein contained are manufactured by members of the said union; that fair wages and good workmanship have been thereby secured, and that the cigars were not made in prisons or filthy tenement houses, and by inferior workmanship; and for those reasons the same command a higher price in the market than cigars of a similar appearance, but without said union label; and the use of said union label is a source of great profit to the plaintiffs and the other members of said union.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">John H. Brendel, the defendant, is a manufacturer of cigars in Brecknock township, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, and his shop is a strict union shop, and has been connected with the Cigar Makers\u2019 Union, No. 126, of Ephrata, continuously since some time in the year 1887, it having withdrawn from the union in 1887, and entered it again the same year. The defendant never was a member of the union, but he employed twelve hands in his shop, most of the time, who were members of the Cigar Makers\u2019 Union, No. 126, of Ephrata, which consists of about eighty members; and at the time the plaintiffs\u2019 bill was filed, he had about ten or eleven men employed in his shop, each of whom would make, on an average, about two thousand cigars per week, which were packed in boxes, some of which contained fifty cigars each and some of which contained twenty-five cigars each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">In accordance with article XI., \u00a7 8, of the constitution of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America, the defendant\u2019s shop was entitled to receive from the said local union, the Cigar Makers\u2019 Union, No. 126, of Ephrata, free of all charges, as many of these union labels as might be required from week to week for all cigars actually made by members of the union in his shop.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">Since the defendant\u2019s shop re-entered the union in 1887, and up to the time of filing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, the said local union furnished to the defendant all union labels that he or his shop collector asked for or demanded from time to time; and the said local union did not, nor did the proper officer thereof, nor the proper parties of whom demand was made, refuse to furnish to the defendant all the union labels that he or his shop collector demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">Shortly before the first day of June, 1888, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>gave to Charles S. Yeager, a printer in Ephrata, a label of the same kind as the one attached to the plaintiffs\u2019 original bill, and instructed him to have made therefrom plates for the printing of said label. In pursuance of said instructions, Mr. Yeager had the plates made, and printed therefrom and sent to the defendant the proof of the said label, whereupon the defendant gave him an order for twenty-nine thousand of the said labels; and in pursuance of said order, Mr. Yeager printed for the defendant, from the said plates, twenty-nine thousand of the said labels, two thousand of which he sent to the defendant by mail about the first day of June, 1888, and the remaining twenty-seven thousand he delivered to the defendant personally, on or about the eighth day of June, 1888, together with the plates from which the said labels were printed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">These labels which Mr. Yeager printed for the defendant so closely imitate and resemble the genuine union label used by the plaintiffs, in the shape, size, and color of the paper, in the kind, size, arrangement and juxtaposition of the type, in the seal of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America and its relative position on the paper, in the signature of the president of the said international union, in the space left for the local stamp and its position on the paper, in the color of the ink used, in the character of the border surrounding the printed matter, and in general appearance, that they are well calculated to deceive, and would, if used, deceive and mislead the public into the belief that the cigars bearing the said counterfeit label were manufactured by members of the aforesaid union.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">The said defendant intended to buy cigars from other factories in the vicinity where he lived, and to paste these counterfeit labels on the boxes containing those cigars; that is to say, on boxes containing cigars not made in his shop, nor by members of the said union, and he intended to sell the said cigars for union-made cigars, and thus to infringe the exclusive rights of the plaintiffs, and the other members of said union, to the use of the said union label.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-8\">The Cigar Makers\u2019 Union, No. 126, of Ephrata, did not, as a union, at the time of filing this bill, or at any time before, own, manufacture, trade in, or sell any cigars. The members of the Cigar Makers\u2019 Union, No. 126, of Ephrata, did not, at the time of filing this bill, buy or sell any cigars, but they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>practical cigar-makers and made cigars; and this union label bad been used on cigars made by tbe members of said local union, and the cigars made by them were sold by others with these union labels on them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\">This union label is sometimes used by members of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union, of America, on cigars manufactured by them and sold by them, and it has been used on cigars manufactured by the members of the said union, and sold in the market since the adoption of said label by the said union in 1880. Some of the members of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America did, at the time of filing this bill, or before, manufacture and sell cigars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">The defendant had no authority from the union to have these labels printed. All the members of the said union, including the plaintiffs herein, have a common valuable pecuniary interest, right or property, in the union labels in question, or in the use thereof, or in both combined, which is entitled to protection in a court of equity, and the plaintiffs and the other members of the union will suffer irreparable injury if an injunction be not granted as prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">\u2014Upon the facts so found b}*- him, the master, citing and considering: (1) High on Injunctions, \u00a7 748; Beatty v.

Justice Williams :</author>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The question presented by this appeal is a new one; at least, it is new in this state. It involves important consequences to employers and employees, and it touches the rights and obligations of workmen in their relation to each other. The facts upon which the question is presented, as found by the learned master, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America is a voluntary, unincorporated association of workmen, organized, as its constitution affirms, \u201c for promoting the mental, moral, and physical welfare of its members.\u201d It has devised and registered the label which is the subject of this controversy, and claims an exclusive right to control its use. The office of the label is to advise the public that the cigars in the box which bears it were made by members of the union. Every member of the union in the United States and Canada is entitled to have this label upon the cigars made by him. The plaintiffs represent'neither the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union, the alleged owner of the label, nor Strasser, the officer whose name appears upon it, but a subordinate local organization, known as No. 126, located at Ephrata, Lancaster county, Pa. No 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>did not devise or register the label, and does not claim to own it, but asserts the ownership of the international organization, to which it is a tributary and whose jurisdiction it acknowledges. The defendant is a manufacturer whose shop is, as the learned master finds, \u201ca strict union shop\u201d belonging to Union No. 126. His workmen, ten or twelve in number, are members of the union. He, as the owner of a union shop, and his men, by virtue of their membership, are entitled to the use of the label on the cigars made by them. He procured a quantity of imitation or counterfeit labels, because, as he alleges, he was refused the genuine when he applied for them, and avowed his purpose to use them. The plaintiffs then filed a bill, and asked the court to enjoin the defendant against the use of the imitation labels for any purpose whatever. Upon these facts, the master recommended, and the court made the decree asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The grounds upon which an injunction will issue to restrain the infringement or appropriation of a trade-mark are well settled. They are, first, the protection of property in a trademark ; and, second, the prevention of fraud by an imitator. In either case, it issues at the suit and for the protection of the owner of the device or trade-mark infringed. The plaintiffs represent Union No. 126, which has no other ownership in or control over the international union\u2019s label than any others of the hundreds or thousands of subordinate unions scattered over the United States and the Canadas. If it can maintain this bill, then each and every subordinate union can do the same thing, although no one of these devised, registered, or claims to own the trade-mark, and may prevent its use by workmen and in shops which, under the general rules of the international body, are entitled to use it. But we are not disposed to impale this case upon what may be thought to be a technical point. On the other hand, we will consider whether the International Cigar Makers\u2019 Union is a trader, whether the label in question is a trade-mark, and whether, upon any ground of equitable relief, the plaintiffs are entitled to consideration in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The first question is disposed of by the learned master upon the pleadings. The organization that devised, registered, and owns the label is neither a manufacturer nor dealer, and has no trade in which a trade-mark can be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The second question would seem to go with the first. Trade-marks are provided for by the act of congress of July 8, 1870. Registration is made under it by furnishing a statement, to be recorded in the patent-office, showing the names of the parties applying for the registration, with their residences and places of business; the class of merchandise, and a description of the goods composing the class, by which the trade-mark has been or is intended to be appropriated, together with a description of the trade-mark and fac-similes of it. This provision of the act clearly contemplates an actual business conducted by the person or persons named, the adoption of a trade-mark in that business, and its appropriation to a particular \u201c class of merchandise \u201d produced or sold by the parties making the registration. Any device, figure, or inscription which seems to indicate the personal origin of the goods may be adopted as a trade-mark: Laughman\u2019s App., 128 Pa. 19. Such trade-mark will be protected against fraudulent imitation, whether registered or not: Hoyt v. Hoyt, 143 Pa. 623. Registration affords evidence of ownership. Its object is to secure to the maker or dealer the fruits of his skill, industry, and reputation by a positive legislative provision: Pratt\u2019s App., 117 Pa. 411. But the act of congress referred to makes it clear that it is a maker or a dealer only who is entitled to protection, for it declares that the commissioner of patents \u201c shall not receive and record any proposed trade-mark which is not and cannot become a lawful trade-mark.\u201d Now, if the Cigar Maker\u2019s International Union was a business organization engaged in making cigars for sale, it could adopt and use a trade-mark in its business, and acquire property in it. But it is not a business .organization. It neither makes nor sells cigars, but directs its attention to cigar-makers, and seeks \u201c to promote the mental, moral, and physical welfare of its members.\u201d These are worthy objects. They deserve and should receive the encouragement and support of all right-minded men. It is obvious, however, that they are personal and social objects, not commercial ones. They do not look towards the production or sale of any class or quality of cigars or tobacco, but towards the personal elevation and comfort of cigar makers. I conclude, therefore, that the Cigar Makers \u2019 International Union of America is neither a trader, within the meaning of the common law, nor within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the purview of the act of congress. Not being a trader in any sense, it can have no distinctive trade-mark. Registration, under such circumstances, is not authorized by the act of congress, and if made, confers no title, and gives no standing-ground in a court of law or equity.</p>\n<p id=\"ADv\">I come now to inquire whether the adoption of the label for the purposes set forth in the bill gives to the international union any ground for equitable relief. We have seen that this label is not a trade-mark, and that the union is not in a business that enables it to adopt or acquire a trade-mark. Still, it is urged that, as the defendant was about to use an imitation of the label, he should be enjoined, whether the label is a trade-mark or not. But what is this label, and why should it be protected? It purports to be \u201c issued by the authority of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America \u201d to the person who uses it. The name of the workman who made the cigars does not appear upon it, nor the owner or location of the shop at which they are made. It does not point out the personal or the local origin or ownership of the goods on which it is placed. On the other hand, it issues to every one of the hiany thousands of workmen who make up the membership of the union, and it certifies, in the name of the union, that the cigars in the box on which it is placed were made \u201c by a first-class workman, a member of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union.\u201d Who this first-class workman was, where he lived, for whom he worked, the label does not tell. He is indorsed as a \u201c first-class workman,\u201d because he is \u201c a member \u201d of the union. As to all who are not members, the label proceeds to define the position of the organization that issues it by describing their work as \u201c inferior rat-shop, cooly, prison, or filthy tenement-house workmanship.\u201d The label then proceeds in these words: \u201c Therefore we recommend these cigars to all smokers throughout the world.\u201d The value of this label is in the recommendation and the reasons given for it. The label is thus seen to be something quite different from a trade-mark in its character, its purpose, and the manner of its use, viz., a device to' distinguish, between union and non-union workmen, and to discriminate against the work of the latter. It says to the public in spirit and in effect: \u201c Buy the cigars that bear this label, because they were made by a member of this union. Do not buy those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>not bearing it, because they were made by workmen who do not belong to us, Such cigars are the product of \u2018inferior rat-shop, cooly, prison, or filthy tenement-house workmanship.\u2019 \u201d It is the request of a powerful labor organization to \u201c all smokers throughout the world \u201d to take sides with it in its contest with those who are outside of its membership, by refusing to buy the work of such persons. It is an attempt to use the public as a means of coercion upon them, compelling them to unite with the union in order to find a market for their goods or their labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Right here, let us distinguish broadly between an object and the means employed to reach it. Organization is the privilege, perhaps I might say the duty, of labor; and an organization seeking to promote \u201c the mental, moral, and physical welfare of its members,\u201d by securing fair wages, steady work, and the comforts of home for them, occupies a legitimate field of usefulness, and is capable of doing great good to its members and to the public. The Cigar Makers\u2019 Union is no doubt seeking to do such a work, and accomplishing much\u2019in that direction. What we are now considering is one of the means it employs to increase its membership, and to hurt workmen who do not belong to it. The real question now before us is whether the international organization of workmen shall have the help of a court of equity in making war upon all cigar makers who do not belong to it, and in driving their work out of the market by representing if as coming from inferior rat-shops, from coolies, prisons, or filthy tenement-houses. A \u201c first-class workman \u201d is one who does first-class work, whether his name is on the rolls of any given society or not. Filthiness and criminality of character depend on conduct, not on membership of the union. Legitimate competition rests on superiority of workmanship and business methods, not in the use of vulgar epithets and personal denunciation. When the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union of America stigmatizes those who do not belong to it, and seeks t\u00f3 induce the public to discriminate against them and their work, by covering them with opprobrious epithets, it is not engaged in \u201c promoting the mental, moral, and physical welfare of its members,\u201d but in trying to hurt a\u00f1d * destroy those who do not choose to become members. While the courts would aid the former purpose in all ways within their power, they cannot help the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We cannot justify the defendant\u2019s conduct. There is no rule of morals or of business upon which he can defend himself in the preparation and use of spurious labels. But it is not every wrong action that a chancellor will enjoin, because the purpose of an injunction is to protect the plaintiff in the exercise and enjoyment of a clear legal right, for an infringement of which the law does not afford an adequate remedy. If, therefore, the right of the plaintiff is doubtful, equity will withhold its aid. The plaintiffs in this case have no trade-mark to protect, and no right to a decree resting on the law relating to trade-marks. What they have is a label which recommends the purchase of cigars made by union men, and warns against the purchase of all others as inferior and unwholesome, because made in rat-shops, or prisons, or by coolies, or tenants of filthy tenement houses. Their right to use such a label may well be doubted, whether the question be treated as one of morals or of law. But the plaintiffs come into a court of equity, and seek to enlist the conscience of a chancellor in their behalf. They must come with clean hands, with a conscionable regard for the rights of others, ready to do equity on their part, and seeking only equity at the hands of the court. They do come in this case with the avowed purpose to do harm to non-union men, to prevent the sale of their work, to cover them with <em>opprobrium; </em>and they ask a court of equity to say that they have a right to do it. We decline to say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The decree of the court below is reversed, the injunction- dissolved, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As we cannot approve the conduct of the defendant, we shall not award him costs, but direct that each party pay the costs it has made, and that the fees of the master be paid in equal parts by the plaintiffs and the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
