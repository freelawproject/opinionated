Passmore and others presented their petition showing that they were children and heirs at law of James Woodrow, who died on or about December 13, 1880, seised in fee of a tract of land containing one hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and sixteen acres, more or. less, in Little Britain township; that, by proceedings duly had in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Lancaster county, the said land was sold for the payment of the debts of said decedent; that one third of the proceeds of sale,' \u201c after payment of debts, remained charged on said lands as dower, for and during the lifetime of Ann W. Woodrow, widow of said James Woodrow, deceased, the interest thereon to be paid annually and regularly to said Ann W. Woodrow for life, and at her decease the principal sum to be paid to the heirs of the said James Woodrow,\u201d dec\u00e9ased; that Robert A. Evans was the purchaser of the real estate, upon the terms and conditions aforesaid, and had received the deed therefor from the administrators of said deceased; \u201c that the dower charged on said messuage and tract of land was fixed at the sum of $894.45, and \u2018recorded;\u2019\u201d that the said Ann W. Woodrow died October 26, 1889, and the principal of said fund was payable to the said heirs, to wit, Harriet H. Passmore, Lydia A. Richardson, Philena R. Patton, Emma Eurniss and Sallie J. Pennock, all of whom were of age; that said Robert A. Evans, the purchaser of the land, died on August 28, 1889, seised of the said land in fee; that by his will dated. May 17, 1889, and duly admitted to probate, he devised the said land to William W. Evans, for life, and after his death to Annie M. Hess, Gertrude K. Cox and Augusta Evans, his children, to each one third thereof for life, and after their decease severally to their children, as set forth in the seventeenth item of said will copied. Said will contained no provision in reference to said dower charge. Thus showing their interests therein, the petitioners prayed the court to order and direct the payment of the principal of said dower charge by the devisees of said lands, or the persons legally bound to pay the same, and to make such other order and decree for the payment thereof out of said real estate as should be just and proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-4\">To a rule granted upon the foregoing petition, William W. Evans, Gertrude K. Cox and Annie M. Hess, answered, averring inter alia that by the sale and conveyance of the said tract of land to Robert A. Evans, and the charge of the dower principal, \u201c the payment of the said money or dower was thereby made the personal obligation of the said Robert A. Evans, and he and his personal representatives became liable therefor; \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that the said Robert A. Evans continued to be the owner of the said land until his death; that by his will he directed that his debts should be paid, and the inventory of his estate filed showed that his personal estate amounted to the sum of about \u00a7200,000, and that the respondents believed that there were practically no debts except the said dower principal; that A. J. Eberly, the executor of said Robert A. Evans, had not been made a party to the proceedings; and, submitting that said executor should be made a party, and that an order should be made requiring him to pay said money or dower, the respondents prayed judgment and that the petition be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-4\">On May 13,1890, after argument, the court, Patterson, J., filed an opinion, wherein, citing De Haven v. Bartholomew, 57 Pa. 126, and the act of May 17, 1866, P. L. 1096, it was ruled that the proceeding might be sustained, provided the bill or petition brought into court by due notice the owners of such real estate and such other persons as might be interested; and in order that the proceeding might be properly adjudicated, the surviving executor of Robert A. Evans, deceased, should be served and have his day in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">A rule upon A. J. Eberly, surviving executor of Robert A. Evans, deceased, to show cause, etc., having been granted, the said A. J. Eberly, surviving executor, answered, inter alia, that the sale and conveyance' of the said real estate by order of the Orphans\u2019 Court to the said Robert A. Evans, did not make the dower charged on the said land the personal obligation of the said Robert A. Evans, and he and his survMng executor were not liable therefor; that the said Robert A. Evans, deceased, did not indicate an intention in his said will to charge said dower principal on his personal assets, nor did he in his lifetime deal with the same so as to make it his personal obligation; that the personal estate of said Robert A. Evans, after the payment of his debts and the expenses of the settlement of his estate, would not be sufficient to pay all the pecuniary legacies bequeathed by him in his will in full, and could not go in ease, of said real estate charged with said dower, so as to defeat the pecuniary legacies bequeathed or any part thereof; praying judgment, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">After argument, the court, Patterson, J., on January 17, 1891, filed an opinion in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The surviving executor, in his answer, sets forth, in the exact words as contained in the last will of Robert A. Evans, the devise of the said farm purchased from the administrators of James Woodrow, at Orphans\u2019 Court sale, and at which sale said Robert A. Evans became the purchaser and received a deed for same, charged with the dower aforesaid, and remained and continued to be the owner of the said premises until the date of his death, to wit, August 28, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">The testator bequeathed to his wife, Catharine E. Evans, all his household goods, carriage horses, carriages and other chattels, and twenty-five hundred dollars, absolutely; then his dwelling-house during her life; then he bequeathed fifty thousand dollars to his executors, in trust to pay her the interest thereof, after deducting expenses, semi-annually. As before stated, Robert A. Evans accepted a deed, being the purchaser at.an Orphans\u2019 Court sale by the administrators of James Woodrow, deceased, charged with the widow\u2019s dower, to wit, $394.45, and paid the interest on the same during his life and up to his death. And the widow of the said Robert A. Evans refused to accept the provisions of testator\u2019s will, and claimed her dower. \u25a0 Also, said widow petitioned the court to appoint appraisers to value and appraise the real estate of her said husband, which was done, and the appraisers so appointed valued and appraised the said Woodrow farm with dower of $1,000. The devisees of said farm are therefore restricted in the enjoyment of their devise, it being encumbered with the said Woodrow dower and. also the statutory dower of $1,000, the interest payable to the widow of Robert A. Evans, and the interest on said sum at six per cent during the lifetime of the said widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">Now, the will of Robert A. Evans does not refer to or mention in his devise of the said Woodrow farm, the dower lien aforesaid, due to the Woodrow heirs. What was the intention of the testator? Was it that the devisees should pay the said dower lien ? The will is the law of his estate. No such intention is apparent. Here the Woodrow dower lien forms part of the price of the purchase money agreed to be paid by Robert A. Evans, and he would most likely suppose his estate would have to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">It was ruled in Metzgar\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 330, that where land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>is sold subject to purchase money and interest due a third person, it is a covenant by the vendee to pay such purchase money; it need not appear affirmatively that such encumbrance was payable out of the purchase money. In Hoff\u2019s App., <em>24 </em>Pa. 200, Hoff had bought land subject to a mortgage, which he made his own debt. He bequeathed the land to his wife. It was held that his executors ought to pay the mortgage. But, is not the rule in Sandoe\u2019s App., 65 Pa. 314, applicable and ruling in this case ? \u201c Where a widow elects not to take under a will, her substituted devises and bequests are a trust in her, for the benefit of the disappointed claimants to the amount of their interests therein. A court of equity will sequester the benefit intended for the wife, to secure compensation to those whom her election disappoints.\u201d Also, Young\u2019s App., 108 Pa. 17. And Mansell\u2019s Est., 1 Pars. 367, says: \u201c It is a rule of equity, that the devisee of lands, which the devisor has before or after making his will charged with a mortgage, is entitled to have his lands exonerated therefrom out of the testator\u2019s personal estate, unless the devisor indicates an intention that the devisee should take them cum onere.\u201d \u201c The personal estate is the natural fund for the payment of the debts of a testator,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">In this case, the testator had purchased at Orphans\u2019 Court sale under proceedings in partition. The act .of 1866, already quoted, provides that \u201c in all cases in which proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court of any county, any money has been charged upon real estate, payable at a future period, etc., such court shall proceed, according to equity, to make such decree or order as shall be just and proper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">Therefore, it is now, to wit, January 17, 1891, ordered and decreed that A. J. Eberly, Esq., the surviving executor of Robert A. Evans, deceased, pay the said charge of dower upon the farm or tract of land mentioned and described in the petition, property of said Robert A. Evans, at his death, and situated in Little Britain township, Lancaster county, containing 116 acres, more or less, being three hundred and ninety-four and forty-five hundredths dollars, and all interest due thereon arid also the costs of this proceeding.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">\u2014Thereupon, A. J. Eberly, surviving executor of Robert A. Evans, deceased, took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>1. In making the foregoing decree.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-4\">2. In not directing that William W. Evans, Gertrude K. Cox and Augusta Evans, devisees for life under the will of said Eobert A. Evans, deceased, of the real estate on which the dower principal of $394.45 was charged, should pay the same to those legally entitled thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">3. In assuming, without evidence, that said Eobert A. Evans made the payment of said dower principal his personal obligation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>Mr. J. W. Denlinger </em>and <em>Mr. A. J. </em>Fberly, for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">At the time of the death of the testator, Robert A. Evans, the dower charge was an estate in the land, not an encumbrance: Diefenderfer v. Eshleman, 113 Pa. 309; Zeigler\u2019s App., 35 Pa. 173; Miller v. Leidig, 3 W. &amp; S. 458; Bachman v. Chrisman, 23 Pa. 162. But, if it were merely an encumbrance, the grantee of real estate subject to it would not be personally responsible therefor, unless by agreement in writing he expressly assumed a personal liability therefor: \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 205; Hirst\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 494; Mansell\u2019s Est., 1 Pars. 367. While the dower charge is not strictly an encumbrance created by a former owner, it operates just the same as if it had been so created. The testator, however, took the farm subject to said statutory dower, placed upon it by operation of \u00a7 43, act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 203.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-8\"><em>Mr. G-eorge Fauman </em>(with him <em>Mr. J. W. F. Swift </em>and Mr. <em>ff. It. </em>Fulton), for the- appellees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-9\">The act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 205, has no application. Evans did not buy \u201c under and subject\u201d to an encumbrance, from a vendor who had created it. He created the charge himself by the .purchase of the land at Orphans\u2019 Court sale. He paid interest on it till he died, and the principal became due within two months after his death. Such being the case, his personal estate must be applied in payment, in relief of his devise. It is true, of course, that a widow\u2019s dower interest is in a certain sense an estate, yet upon her death the amount due is nothing more than a mere lien or charge, and being such, the land devised subject to it must be relieved by the personal estate: Hoff\u2019s App., 24 Pa. 200; Unangst v. Kraemer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>8 W. &amp; S. 400 ; Kinter\u2019s App., 62 Pa. 324 ; 1 Story\u2019s Eq. J., \u00a7 571; Moore\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 451; Metzgar\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 330.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AVO\">Mr. Justice Sterrett :</author>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Exactly in what form the \u201c charge,\u201d out of which the claim involved in this appeal grew, stands upon the records of the court below, does not appear. The effect of the sale made for payment of debts was to divest, not only the estate which was In James Woodrow, deceased, but that of his widow, and vest them in Robert A. Evans. This \u201c charge \u201d was undoubtedly part of the price; and the implication is that it was a deferred instalment, secured on the land sold under the order of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Assuming, for the purposes of this appeal, that Robert A. Evans became personally liable for the charge, the court below was without jurisdiction, in the form adopted to enforce its payment. Distribution of the personal estate of decedent could only be made upon the audit of the executor\u2019s account in the mode prescribed by statute. There, creditors and legatees, as well as devisees, would have a right to be heard, and it is impossible to anticipate what questions they might raise; while here, they have no status, and may be prejudiced by the decree made. The executor, as such, has nothing to do with \u25a0questions of distribution : Bracken\u2019s Est., 138 Pa. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The decree below is not within the purview of the act of May 17, 1866, P. L. 1096. That act has no relation to personal estate, but by its terms gives the Orphans\u2019 Court jurisdiction to enforce payment of money \u201c charged \u201d by its order on real estate, \u201c out of the real estate.\u201d The \u201c charge \u201d being admitted, these creditors had a right to elect the remedy provided by the act of 1866. They were not bound to resort to the personal estate first: Sergeant v. Ewing, 30 Pa. 75, 81, and the court below should have decreed accordingly. Robert A. Evans, living, could not have objected, and his devisees have no higher rights. The rights of these creditors are paramount, .and the equities between the devisees and the legatees under the will cannot be adjusted at their expense. The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court must therefore be reversed, and a decree made in accordance with the original petition, without preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>dice to the adjustment of equities as between the devisees and the legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Decree reversed, with costs to be paid by the ap- \u25a0 pellees ; and record remitted with instructions to proceed in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
