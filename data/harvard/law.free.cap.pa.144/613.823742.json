Kenyon, generally known as Burr Kenyon, went into possession of the land about 1840 and farmed it until his death about forty years later, and that the plaintiffs were his heirs.

J. B. Kenyon, the plaintiffs\u2019 ancestor, went into possession of the land in question under a purchase thereof from Isaac London, the land being conveyed to him by the deed of Isaac London dated February 14,1840, recorded April 6, 1840, and containing the following words: \u201c Excepting and reserve of coal to Thomas Meredith.\u201d On August 11, 1860, Benjamin S. Bentley, then the holder of the Meredith title, filed a bill in equity against J. B. Kenyon, which, after setting out the agreement of October 1, 1828, between London and Meredith, averred that Meredith paid to London the $150 therein mentioned, and punctually paid the rent of one dollar per year up to December 10, 1838; that on December 10, 1838, Isaac London conveyed said premises to Meredith, a copy of the deed of that date being annexed to the bill; that the title thereto had become vested in the plaintiff, who was desirous of opening and mining said coal, but that the defendant therein denied the plaintiff\u2019s rights and resisted his claim ; praying that the defendant be required to answer certain interrogatories touching the matters of fact averred in this bill, and that the court adjudicate and determine the rights of the parties, and grant the plaintiff such relief as he might require. After a hearing, apparently on bill and answer,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the court, on August 18,1862, dismissed tlie bill, for the reason that it presented no case for chancery jurisdiction, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy being by action of ejectment. It was shown further that,.-,on October 13, 1862, William Jessup, who had succeeded to the title of Benjamin S. Bentley, brought ejectment against Burr Kenyon for the coal now in question, and that a verdict was recovered by the plaintiff in said action and judgment entered thereon. To a writ of habere facias possessionem issued upon said judgment, the sheriff made return that he executed the same on April 3, 1868, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>delivery of possession to the plaintiff\u2019s agent. It further appeared that no mine-opening was ever made upon the surface of the land in question; that no attempt to exercise the right to mine the coal, under the grant from London to Meredith, was made until after April, 1868, but how long after that mining was commenced did not clearly appear; and that for some time prior to the trial the defendant was engaged in taking out the coal beneath said land, by means of subterranean workings extended into it from an adjoining property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\">The defendant offered in evidence the depositions of certain deceased witnesses, taken in a proceeding in the Orphans\u2019 Court for the partition of the real estate of Edward London, deceased, to which Isaac London, who was his son, was a party, the depositions tending to show that Isaac London was in adverse possession of the land'in question from about 1815 to 1836 or 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">Objected to, for the reason that the depositions were taken in a suit to which Burr Kenyon was not a party, nor up,on the same subject matter, and not between the same parties, as the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-7\">By the court: Objection overruled; evidence admitted; exception.08</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-8\">In rebuttal, the plaintiffs presented testimony tending to show that the coal in dispute was not assessed separately, for purposes of taxation, in 1862, or in any year prior thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-9\">The testimony being closed, the court, Connolly, J., charged the jury in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-10\">We feel constrained, at this juncture of the case, to assume the entire responsibility of this matter, and if we are wrong we will have an opportunity hereafter to correct the disposal of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-11\">The plaintiffs in this case, as stated to you, are the heirs at law of J. Burr Kenyon, who purchased or obtained his title to this land from Isaac London about the year 1840. The evidence shows that prior to 1840, and for a great number of years prior thereto, Isaac London was in possession of and claimed the ownership of this land. A warrant was originally issued for this land by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to Edward London, who was the father of Isaac London. The title of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Isaac London in this land is not questioned by the plaintiffs in this case, nor is it questioned by the defendant; hence it must stand as the title to this land, if he had any title to it, in 1840. The grantee of Isaac London was J. Burr Kenyon, of whom the plaintiffs in this case are the heirs at law. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">For a number of years subsequent to 1840, J. Burr Kenyon was in the sole possession and control of this property. [Prior to 1840, there was a lease executed, I believe it was in 1828, a lease of coal underlying this land, with certain reservations and certain rentals, made by Isaac London to Thomas Meredith. Subsequent to that there were two other papers executed, a deed of further assurance, and another paper, on the tenth day of December, 1838, between Isaac London and Thomas Meredith. In our judgment these papers control the present action in this case ; that is, the construction which we place upon these papers governs and controls the present action of the plaintiffs against the defendant. And we hold that these papers, taken in connection with the paper executed between Isaac London and Thomas Meredith, on the first day of October, 1828, impel us to say to you as a matter of law that there can be no recovery on the part of the plaintiffs in this case.] 1 . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-7\">The defendant in this case has requested us to charge you upon certain points, which we shall proceed to do, and give our answers thereto in writing :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\">2. The only title claimed by the plaintiffs in this case is title by adverse possession of the surface by Burr Kenyon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-9\">Answer : This point we affirm.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-10\">3. That, under the undisputed testimony in the case, Burr Kenyon bought and went into possession of the land overlying the coal in dispute, under Isaac London, by his deed of February 14, 1840, which contained an exception and reserve of coal to Thomas Meredith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-11\">Answer: This point we affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-12\">4. That, both parties claiming under Isaac London, his title must be considered perfect to the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-13\">Answer: This point we affirm.4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-14\">6. That by the lease from Isaac London to Thomas Meredith of 1828, and the deed of 1838, in evidence, the title to the coal became severed from the surface, and the possession by Kenyon of the surface of the land is not possession, of the coal be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>low ifc, so as to bar tbe right of Thomas Meredith, or the defendant claiming under him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\">Answer: This point we affirm.5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\">7. That the lease of 1828 and the agreement and conveyance of 1838, from Isaac London to Thomas Meredith, are a grant of an interest in land, and not a mere license to take coal, and being on record before Burr Kenyon purchased of Isaac London, were notice to him (Kenyon) that the coal had been severed from the surface.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">Answer: This point we affirm.6</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-8\">8. That when the title to the coal has been severed from the surface, as in this case, the person in possession of the surface cannot gain title by the statute of limitations, to the coal, unless he has taken possession of the coal by opening the surface to it and continuously using the same for twenty-one years adversely to the owners of it; and, as Burr Kenyon never opened or mined any of the coal under the land conveyed to him by Isaac London, he gained no title to the same by his possession of the surface, and the plaintiffs only claiming as his heirs, are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">Answer: This point we affirm.7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-10\">10. That, upon the whole evidence, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-11\">Answer: This point we affirm.9</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-12\">The plaintiffs have submitted twenty-one points, and have requested us to charge you thereon :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-13\">6. That if the jury should find that J. B. Kenyon entered upon the land and took actual possession thereof in the spring of 1840, claimed, occupied and actually possessed the same as his own up to the year A. d. 1862, and that during all that time Thomas Meredith and those claiming under him did not search for coal, nor mine or dig any coal from said lands, or make any improvements or appliances thereon for that purpose, and did not offer to pay any rent to the said Kenyon pursuant to the aforesaid instruments of writing, and did not during the said time have the coal in question assessed to the said Meredith or those claiming under him, such acts of omission and non-user would be an abandonment of and work a forfeiture of all the rights which the said Thomas Meredith and those claiming under him ever had to the said coal by virtue of the said instruments of writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Answer: This point we do not affirm.14</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\">7. That if the jury should find that Thomas Meredith, or those claiming under him, have conveyed the coal in question and all the coal that is in the said land, to any other person or persons or corporation in fee-simple, such conveyance is a disaffirmance of the lessor\u2019s title and a cloud upon his title which forfeit all the rights, interest and estate that Thomas Meredith and those claiming under him ever had to the said coal by virtue of the said instruments of writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-7\">Answer: Thomas Meredith could convey no greater estate in the land than he had under the lease and conveyances to him by Isaac London; with this qualification we affirm this point.15</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-8\">8. That the ejectment suit brought by William Jessup, claiming under Thomas Meredith, and one of the persons through whom the defendant claims under Thomas Meredith, for the absolute possession and ownership of the whole of the coal in dispute, was a disaffirmance of the title of J. B. Kenyon to the said coal, and works a forfeiture of all the rights and interests that the said Thomas Meredith, and those claiming under him, had in and to the said lands by virtue of the aforesaid instruments of writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-9\">Answer: This point we do not affirm.16</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-10\">12. The suit of Benjamin S. Bentley against Burr Kenyon, in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne county, on the equity side of said court, to wit, of August Term, 1860, No. 3, was the proper remedy for the plaintiffs in that suit, for a redress of the wrong and injury therein complained of; that court had full jurisdiction of the subject matter set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint in that suit, and the final disposition of that suit is final and conclusive of the subject matter of that suit, while \u25a0the decree or judgment in that case remains unreversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-11\">Answer: This point we do not affirm.80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-12\">18. The fact that Kenyon purchased an outstanding claim or title from Isaac London, does not in any manner affect, weaken or destroy any other title he had before the purchase was made or acquired after that purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-13\">Answer: This point we cannot affirm; we cannot find any evidence that he claims title through any other source than that derived from Isaac London.84</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>19. That the possession of the surface of land is the possession of all that is beneath such surface, so long as the actual possession and title to the surface and substrata are not separated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-5\">Answer: Under the evidence we cannot affirm this point.35</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-6\">22. That the statute of limitations never runs against the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-7\">Answer : We affirm this point, but do not think it is applicable under the evidence to this case.36</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-8\">[With these remarks, gentlemen of the jury, we state to you that in our judgment, in our opinion, under the law and under the evidence in this case, we are obliged to charge you as a matter of law that you are to find in favor of the defendant.]3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-9\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and judgment was entered thereon ; whereupon the plaintiffs took this appeal, assigning for error, inter alia:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-10\">1, 2.

They constituted a mere lease or license to take out coal for a fixed and definite period. The case is clearly distinguishable from Caldwell v. Fulton, 31 Pa. 475; Caldwell v.

It is to be governed by the law as laid down in such cases as Gloninger v. Coal Co., 55 Pa. 16; Funk v. Haldeman, 53 Pa. 243; Johnstown I. Co. v. Iron Co., 32 Pa. 241; Grubb v. Grubb, 74 Pa. 25; Grubb v. Grubb, 101 Pa. 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-16\">1. If the right to mine be limited to a term of years, the instrument is a lease: Delaware etc. R. Co. v. Sanderson, 109 Pa. 583; 5 Bac. Abr., 60, 433; Moore v. Miller, 8 Pa. 272; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Bussman v. Ganster, 72 Pa. 285; even though no periodical rent be reserved: Callen v. Hilty, 14 Pa. 286; Mitchell v. Commonwealth, 87 Pa. 187; Folden v. Commonwealth, 13 Neb. 328. The intention of the parties, appearing from the whole instrument, must govern its construction: 2 Shars. &amp; B. L. Cas., 31. The intention of the parties, in the present instance, appears from the fact that they themselves called the instrument a lease, and from the language in which they defined their rights thereunder. Words of grant in a deed are controlled in their meaning by the evident purpose of the parties : Doe v. Wood, 2 B. &amp; Ald. 724; Lord Mountjoy\u2019s Case, 1 And. 307; and the habendum may control their effect: Moss v. Sheldon, 3 W. &amp; S. 160; Griffin v. Fellows, 81* Pa. 114.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXp\">2. If these London papers constitute a lease, then we claim that the lessee has forfeited all rights under it, by denial of the landlord\u2019s title and by non-user and abandonment. The bringing of the ejectment suit was a denial of the landlord\u2019s title which ipso facto forfeited the lease: 5 Bac. Abr., 668; Co. Litt., 251; Newman v. Rutter, 8 W. 51; Willison v. Willison, 3 Pet. 43; Peyton v. Stith, 5 Pet. 485; Wall v. Goodenough, 10 Ill. 41; Fortier v. Ballance, 16 Ill. 415; Walden v. Bodley, 14 Pet. 156; Taylor onL. &amp; T., 386; Sheaffer v. Sheaffer, 37 Pa. 525 ; Hamilton v. Elliott, 5 S. &amp; R. 374; Kenrick v. Smick, 7 W. &amp; S. 41; Galloway v. Ogle, 2 Binn. 468; Graham v. Moore, 4 S. &amp; R. 466; Jackson v. Harper, 5 Wend. 246 ; Sharp v. Kelley, 5 Den. 431; Rankin v. Tenbrook, 5 W. 386. So, also, the making of a conveyance in fee by the lessee, is such a disaffirmance of the lessor\u2019s title as works a forfeiture: Stump v. Findlay, 2 R. 168; Co. Litt., 233b.; Willison v. Watkins, 3 Pet. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">3. Again; the lease was forfeited by non-payment of rent. The bill in equity filed by Bentley practically admits that none was paid after December 10,1838. It is true, one of the agreements made in 1838 seems to release the rental, but it releases only that reserved in the lease of 1828, and the grant of 1838 Was made subject to the payment of rent. It is clear also that there was no attempt to exercise mining rights prior to the filing of the bill, and such non-user forfeited the lessee\u2019s rights : Brown v. Vandergrift, 80 Pa. 142; Munroe v. Armstrong, 96 Pa. 307. If, however, the instruments did not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>lease, then they created nothing more than a license. The case at bar seems to be almost identical with Funk v. Haldeman, 58 Pa. 229. This being a license, subject to the payment of an annual rent, non-payment of the rent from 1888 to 1862 is a sufficient cause of forfeiture. The non-exercise of the licensee\u2019s privileges for the same period, together with Kenyon\u2019s open denial of their existence, put an end to the license: Erb v. Brown, 69 Pa. 216; Bombaugh v. Miller, 82 Pa. 208. All licenses are revocable: Woodward v. Seely, 11 Ill. 157 (50 Am. Dec. 445); Huff v. McCauley, 58 Pa. 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-4\">4. The admission of the depositions taken half a century ago in the Orphans\u2019 Court proceeding, in the estate of Edward London, was error. Without them the attempt to show a possessory title in Isaac London must fail; and hence, as the coal was never owned by him he could give Meredith no title thereto, and could not sever the coal from the surface. The court was not correct in saying that the plaintiffs claimed under Isaac London. They claimed by adverse possession of Burr Kenyon, and by a patent from the commonwealth. That adverse possession was sufficient to maintain ejectment, notwithstanding the intermediate adverse recovery after the twenty-one years possession had run : Pederick v. Searle, 5 S. <em>&amp;. </em>R. 236; Jackson v. Dieffendorf, 3 Johns. 269. If the agreements between London and Meredith constituted a lease or a license, as we contend, then equity had jurisdiction of the bill filed by Bentley, and the final disposition of the equity suit was the final conclusion of the matter, as stated in our twelfth point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-5\"><em>Mr. W.

B. Kenyon made in his answer to the bill, that he claimed title under the deed from Isaac London to himself, dated February 14, 1840.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"A07\">Mr. Justice McCollum:</author>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The Hillside Coal &amp; Iron Company, a domestic corporation, is in possession of and engaged in mining the coal field in dispute. It has the title thereto which Thomas Meredith acquired by his contract with Isaac London, on the first day of October, 1828, which was confirmed by a conveyance dated the tenth day of December, 1838. By an agreement in writing between London and Meredith, bearing even date with the conveyance, there was a modification of the original contract, including an extinguishment of the rent reserved in it. The appellants are. the heirs of Burr Kenyon, who entered into possession of the land containing the coal field under a deed from Isaac London executed and delivered on the fourteenth day of. February; 1840, in which the coal covered by the contract and conveyance to Meredith was excepted from the grant. Their contention is that Meredith was a lessee of the coal, and that his rights under the lease were lost by abandonment and nonpayment of rent; that Kenyon\u2019s possession under the London deed was hostile to the Meredith title ; and that the dismissal of the bill in equity filed by Benjamin S. Bentley against Burr Kenyon in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne county, on the eleventh day of August, 1860, was an adjudication against it, which, unreversed, is a bar to any claim founded upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Isaac London\u2019s title to the coal field cannot be controverted in this action. The appellee is in possession of it under his grant to Meredith, and the appellants demand possession of it, and hold the land overlying it under his deed to their ancestor. As the respective titles of the parties litigant are dependent on the conveyance from him, our first inquiry relates to their construction, and the estates or interests acquired by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The original agreement between London and Meredith was acknowledged on the thirty-first of July, 1829, and recorded on the fourteenth of August following. It was called a lease, and it was stipulated therein that London should execute such further writings as counsel learned in the law might deem necessary to secure to Meredith, his heirs and assigns, the full enjoyment of the premises as a coal field. In fulfilment of this stipulation, London made to Meredith a deed, which was acknowledged on the fifteenth, and recorded on the twenty-fourth of December, 1838; being the conveyance to which we have already referred as in confirmation of the original contract. These instruments gave to Meredith, his heirs and assigns, the right to possession of the coal field for a term of one hundred years from the first of October, 1828, for the purpose of mining, removing, and selling coal, subject only to the payment of the nominal rent of one dollar a year, and to the agreement of Meredith that London or his heirs, while residing on the premises, should have the right to dig coal for their own use. In the agreement, of even date with the conveyance, the clause in the original contract \u201c relative to the right of London to dig coal for his own use \u201d was extended \u201c to such person' or persons as he might sell to, but to no others; \u201d and the provision in said contract for the payment of rent was declared null and void in consideration of the satisfaction of a certain judgment which Meredith and others held against London in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne county. When, therefore, Kenyon received possession of the premises under his deed from London, he was invested with the privilege, while he resided thereon, of digging coal there for his own use, and, subject only to the exercise of this privilege by him, Meredith had the exclusive right to the coal, with a definite term in which to mine and remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The agreements between London and Meredith, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>deed from the former to the latter, constituted a sale and conveyance of a coal field for a consideration paid, and a severance of the title thereto from the title to the overlying surface. They created an estate in Meredith, his heirs and assigns, which was distinctly excepted from the grant to Kenyon, and of which he had, by the record as well as by the exception, full notice. These instruments conferred on Meredith and his successors in title an exclusive right to mine and sell all the coal in the tract described, subject to the exercise b^ the grant- or and his vendee of the privilege aforesaid. It is obvious that the parties to them intended a sale of the coal. The sum paid for the mine-right was the price of the coal in place, and in London\u2019s receipt on the first contract, it was called \u201c purchase money.\u201d A grant of a mine-right under which the grantee is authorized to remove and sell, for his own benefit, all the coal contained in a tract described, is. a sale of the coal, and not a lease of it. It is contended, however, that the creation of a term within which the right is to be exercised clearly stamps the transaction as a lease. In Hope\u2019s App., 29 W. N. 365, the instrument was in form a lease for a term of ninety-nine years, and it was held to constitute a sale of the coal, with a definite term in which to mine and remove it. In Montooth v. Gamble, 123 Pa. 240, the agreement was regarded as a sale of coal, to be mined and removed within seven years, although it contained a provision that the coal unmined, if any, at the end of the term, should revert to the vendor. Where a fair interpretation of the written agreement shows that a sale was intended by the parties, and a right to mine and remove all the coal is conferred by it, in express terms or by plain and necessary implication, it will constitute a sale, notwithstanding a term is created within which the coalisto be taken out. We hold that the writings in this case constituted a sale of the coal to be mined within the term stated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In this view of the case, Kenyon\u2019s possession was not hostile to the Meredith title, and no question of forfeiture arises. The dismissal of the bill in equity for want of jurisdiction was not an adjudication against that title, and the appellants take nothing by it in this contest. We think the court below committed no error in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
