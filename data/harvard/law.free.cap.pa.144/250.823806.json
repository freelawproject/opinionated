The offer was objected to, on the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ground that it was not accompanied by an offer of the affidavit of defence, which was necessary that the court might determine what material averments of the statement were denied by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">The plaintiff then offered the affidavit of defence in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s statement, for the purpose of showing that the defendant had not denied \u201c the sale, or price of the goods sold.\u201d Objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">By the court: It is not contended that there is any other affidavit filed, except the affidavit of defence. It appearing from the affidavit of defence, just offered in evidence in connection with the offer first made, that the material matters set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement entitling him to recover in the case, are sufficiently denied to put the plaintiff upon proof, the offer is overruled and excluded; exception.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">The plaintiff making no further offers of evidence, on motion of defendant\u2019s counsel, the court, Bittenger, J., entered a judgment of nonsuit, with leave, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\">A rule to show cause why the judgment of nonsuit should not be lifted having been argued, the court, Latimer, P. J., and Bittenger, J., concurred in an opinion filed in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-10\">We have carefully heard and considered this application, and adhere to the opinion that the court was right in its action in ordering the judgment of nonsuit to be entered, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-11\">1. The affidavit of defence is a substantial denial of the specific averments of fact, set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement and affidavit. The affidavit of defence, in substance, alleges the receipt of the personal property described in the statement, and for the recovery of the value of which this suit is brought, in payment of a debt due the defendant by Thomas Neely, deceased, at the time of his death, on an agreement with the plaintiff who was the administrator of said Thomas Neely, deceased. The defendant further swears that he \u201c does not owe and is not indebted to said John Neely, either individually, or as one of the administrators of said Thomas Neely, deceased, for said horse, buggy, buggy tongue and set of harness, or for any of said several pieces of property, or for the purchase money therefor, or for any part or portion thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The defendant denies the existence of the contract on which the plaintiff claims the right to recover by suing individually, and disclaiming as administrator of Thomas Neely, deceased. The defendant denies in said affidavit any indebtedness to the plaintiff, either as an individual or in his representative capacity, for the goods described in the statement. He furthermore asserts a payment by the administrator of said Thomas Neely, deceased, in kind, by these goods, of the debt due by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, at the time of his decease, to the defendant, and a credit of said payment on his book-account evidencing said indebtedness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-4\">This affidavit of defendant is full and strong enough, and sufficient in law, to prevent the admission in evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s statement under the rule of the court: McCloy v. Maffett, 59 Pa. 344; Hultz v. Gibbs, 66 Pa. 360; Thorne v. Insurance Co., 80 Pa. 15; Kaiser v. Fendrick, 98 Pa. 528; Corcoran v. Trich, 20 W. N. 372; Kountz v. Oil Ref. Co., 72 Pa. 392.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">2. The only matter of substance contained in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, not denied in the defendant\u2019s affidavit, was the receipt by the defendant from the plaintiff, of the property described in the statement, and the price of the same. The entire statement and plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, with the affidavit of service, and affidavit of defence, were embraced in one offer. A plaintiff\u2019s statement or narr cannot be a proper instrument of evidence in his behalf. Certainly, these portions of the statement material to the plaintiff\u2019s case, the truth of which was denied by the defendant, under the rule were not admissible: Kaiser v. Fendrick, supra. The offer as a whole could not be admitted, and was properly excluded. The court is not bound, when an offer is objected to, to separate the part admissible from that which is inadmissible: Smith v. Arsenal Bank, 104 Pa. 518.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\">3. If the offer had been admitted as made, and the plaintiff rested, as his counsel proposed, he would have proved by the affidavit of defence, included in the offer, that he was not entitled to recover, and the court would, on motion being made by defendant\u2019s counsel, have been constrained to order a judgment of nonsuit: Pittsb. etc. R. Co. v. Gazzam, 32 Pa. 340.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">If the plaintiff shall suffer a hardship by reason of the judgment of the court, it is his own fault. He was present at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>trial, sitting by Ms counsel at the counsel table. All the facts sworn to by Mm in his statement, which he struggled to have admitted in evidence, were in his mind and knowledge. Both the plaintiff and his counsel had ample notice of the exclusion of his offer of evidence under the objection of defendant\u2019s counsel, and the pendency of a motion for judgment of nonsuit, yet the plaintiff did not take the witness stand or give any competent evidence to sustain his claim and action. He did not even give any reason for his failure to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-4\">And now, February 19, 1891, the motion to set aside the judgment of nonsuit in this case is overruled; exception.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">\u2014Thereupon, the plaintiff took this appeal and assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">1.

To this is appended a statement showing \u201c balance due August 18,1890, $698.03,\u201d to recover which this suit is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">This statement and affidavit of claim having been duly served, as required by rule of court, the defendant filed an affidavit of defence in the nature of confession and avoidance of the cause of action set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement. He says that on the twenty-sixth day of June, 1884, \u201c the plaintiff, as one of the administrators of the said Thomas Neely, sold to the defendant the said black horse, buggy, buggy tongue and set of harness, mentioned in said plaintiff\u2019s statement, for the respective prices therein set forth,\u201d but, by way of avoidance of the liability springing from this explicit - admission, he immediately adds, \u201c upon the clear, distinct, and express contract and agreement, made and entered into by and between the said John Neely, as one of said administrators, and this defendant, at the time of said sale, that the purchase money for said black horse, buggy, buggy tongue and set of harness, mentioned in said plaintiff\u2019s statement and amounting in the aggregate to $580, should be appropriated and applied to the full payment, satisfaction, and extinguishment of the said defendant\u2019s individual account of $510.26 against the said Thomas Neely,\u201d etc. It is true he avers, in the beginning of his affidavit, that \u201c he has a just, legal, and complete defence to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claimand in the concluding sentence he avers \u201c that he does not owe and is not indebted to the said John Neely, either individually, or as one of the administrators of the said Thomas Neely, deceased, for said horse, buggy, buggy tongue and set of harness, or for any one of said pieces of property, or for the purchase money therefor, or for any part or portion thereof.\u201d These averments are, of course, referable solely to the defence set up in avoidance of the liability resulting from the undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>fact that the property was sold and delivered to defendant at the time and for the consideration mentioned. It cannot be pretended that they refer to anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">If the defence thus disclosed were presented in the form of a special plea, it would be a confession of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, coupled with allegations of fact in avoidance thereof, \u2014a plea in confession and avoidance, under which the onus probandi would be on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">On the trial, plaintiff claimed that, under the rule of court, the facts upon which his claim was based were, in effect, admitted, and that he had a right to rest. upon that admission until evidence in avoidance thereof was introduced by defendant. The learned court thought otherwise, and finally entered judgment of nonsuit, which it afterwards refused to take off. Hence this apxjeal. The rule referred to is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u201c 11. If the plaintiff shall file with his declaration or statement a Specific averment of facts sufficient to support his claim, verified by affidavit, and serve a copy on the defendant or his counsel of record, such items of claim and material averments of fact as are not denied by the defendant, by affidavit filed with or before plea pleaded, shall be taken as admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">^ The object of this and similar rules of court, obviously, is to dispense with the formal proof, on trial, of all such facts and circumstances, material to the plaintiff\u2019s case, as the defendant shall be required to deny under oath, which facts, if not so denied as required by the rule, shall, for the purposes of trial, be taken as admitted. A proper system of practice under such rules greatly facilitates and expedites the trial of causes, and often relieves the jury from the consideration of a heterogeneous mass of testimony bearing upon facts which the defendant cannot deny, but which plaintiff would otherwise be required to establish by formal proof. The controversy is thus narrowed down to such items of claim and material matters of fact as are really disputed. In such cases, it is the province of the court to examine the respective affidavits, and thus ascertain what items of claim, and averments of fact in support thereof, are not denied by defendant, and then confine the testimony to such items of claim and material averments of fact as are denied. I have known cases in which the items of claim were as many as twenty or more, and the averments of fact in support of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>even more numerous. On examination of the verified statement of claim and affidavit of defence, it would perhaps be found that a very small percentage of these was denied. All that is necessary, in such cases, is to confine the testimony to such material averments of fact as are denied by defendant\u2019s affidavit; and, in submitting the case to the jury, to call their attention to the items of claim and averments of fact that are not denied, and should therefore be accepted as established, and instruct them as to those that are denied, etc. The \u201c specific averment of facts \u201d contemplated by the rule need not be separate and distinct from the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. If the latter is as full and as specific as it should be, it will answer all the purposes of a separate specific averment of facts, under the rule of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The subject of complaint in the first specification of error is the rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s offer to show, by the plaintiff\u2019s statement, filed under the rule above quoted, and the defendant\u2019s affidavit, the sale, delivery, and price of the property. The offer shows that the attention of the court was called to the fact that neither the sale, nor the price of the property sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant, as averred in the statement of claim, was denied, and that plaintiff proposed to rest upon the admission under the provisions of the rule. This was specially objected to because \u201cthe affidavit of defence, which is necessary in order that the court may determine what material points have been denied by the defendant,\u201d etc., was not off\u00e9red in connection with plaintiff\u2019s statement. The objection was met by an offer of the affidavit of defence in connection with plaintiff\u2019s statement, \u201c for the purpose of showing that the defendant has not denied the sale or price of the goods sold.\u201d Of course, this offer was to the court, and was doubtless so understood by the learned judge who presided at the trial. His reason for ruling against the plaintiff, as stated by himself, was \u201c that the material matters, set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, entitling him to recover in the case, are sufficiently denied to put the plaintiff upon proof.\u201d In this he was clearly in error. Why put the plaintiff upon proof of the sale and delivery of the horse and other articles specified in plaintiff\u2019s statement, when, as we have already seen, the fact of the sale, including price and delivery, as claimed by plaintiff, is not only undenied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>but distinctly admitted by the defendant. The averment of \u201c complete defence,\u201d denial of liability, etc., are referable to the defence set up by way of avoidance. . As well might the plaintiff, in an issue on a formal plea in confession and avoidance, be required to make out a prima-facie case by calling witnesses to prove the very matters confessed. Suppose, in a suit on an ordinary promissory note, the defendant has filed a verified statement, averring the making and delivery of the note by the defendant, etc., and the latter, in his affidavit of defence, admits the making and delivery of the note as alleged, but avers that at the time it was so made and delivered it was expressly agreed that it should be paid in merchandise on or before its maturity, that payment in merchandise was duly tendered, etc., and that he is not indebted to the plaintiff, etc. What propriety would there be in requiring the plaintiff to make out his case by testimony showing the making and delivery of the note ? Such a construction of a wise and salutary rule would not only needlessly impair its usefulness, but it would have nothing, either in reason or authority, to sustain it. It follows from what has been said, that the plaintiff had a right to avail himself of the defendant\u2019s admissions, under the rule, of the sale and delivery of the horse and other articles as averred, and rest upon the same until something, by way of defence, was shown by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">It is suggested that plaintiff had no right to sue in his individual capacity. The ruling of the court was not based on any such ground, and we express no opinion in regard to it. The plaintiff was improperly nonsuited, and of course, the refusal to take off the nonsuit was errbr. Both specifications are sustained..</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Judgment reversed, and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
