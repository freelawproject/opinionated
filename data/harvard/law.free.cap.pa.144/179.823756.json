In an action by an administrator against an administrator, to recover an indebtedness barred by the statute of limitations, admissions of the debtor, made more than six years before the suit was brought, are inadmissible to establish an acknowledgment and promise to pay, as a basis of a right to recover notwithstanding the statute.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b205-15\">2. A statement by a debtor to his creditor, within the six years, that \u201che knew that he owM him, and that he will see that he will pay it; that the boys (the debtor\u2019s sons) had got the best farms, and they must pay it,\u201d is not such an acknowledgment, implying an unequivocal promise to pay, as is sufficient to toll the bar of the statute.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b205-16\">3. A son and heir at law of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, interested in the settlement of the estate, is a competent witness op behalf of the plaintiff to prove that a book produced was one of his father\u2019s books of original entry, and that certain accounts therein charged to the defendant\u2019s intestate, are in the handwriting of the father. \"</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b205-17\">4. An account of a year\u2019s farming by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, made up \u2022 the year thereafter and entered on a blank page of an old copy-book containing no other accounts, and signed, as alleged, by the defendant\u2019s intestate in his own handwriting, is not such a book entry as is admissible on the part of the defendant, as evidence of a set-off or payment.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b205-19\"><em>(a) </em>The debt claimed in the action, if it existed at all, was subsisting at the time the defendant\u2019s intestate conveyed a farm to one of his sons without valuable consideration.

Objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-14\">By the court: Objection sustained, offer refused on account of the incompeteney of the witness; exception.4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-15\">The ease being closed on the. evidence, the court, Patterson, J.. charged the jury in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-16\">Now, it is true that when a claim commences to run, if six years has run\u201dfrom that time before the suit is brought, it cannot be recovered, unless the party owing the debt revives it by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>a promise to pay. If the parties meet and have a conversation about a debt which is owing, and the original debtor,\u2014here David Zartman,\u2014within the six years promises to pay it, it revives it for another six. jmars, and it can be recovered. Now, it is true, as has been argued before you, that that promise to pay must be made to the creditor, or to an authorized agent of the creditor. [In two instances, however, under the testimony, you will find that the promise by David Zartman in his lifetime was made to the actual creditor, and therefore we need not go further into that subject.] 6.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\">Now, what is the testimony in regard to the promise to pay, to take this claim out of the operation of the statue of limitations ? Because, you see that some of it was contracted for in 1864, and more than six years has run from that time to the time of bringing the suit; and therefore, it would be cut out by the statue of limitations. The testimony must satisfy you that David Zartman, the defendant, did promise to pay it after that six years was up. [The first witness is John D. Matthews, Esq., a gentleman who has been a justice of the peace, and who knows something about the law in that kind of matters, of course. Now, his testimony is that the defendant, David Zartman, in the course of a conversation between David Zartman and Emanuel Keener in 1880, did reply, after an admission that the debt was owing, that he would pay it; therefore, you must take all his testimony together. In that same conversation Mr. Zartman, who is now deceased, admitted that they would settle it, and he would pay it, <em>he </em>would pay it. Jwould pay it. And they both admitted, that is Mr. Zartman as well as Emanuel Keener, that the claim or debt was over three hundred dollars. That was in 1880 that they had this conversation.] 6 Now Mr. Pannebecker\u2019s testimony was in relation to a conversation had between David Zartman and Emanuel Keener in 1882, when Mr. Keener said that it was about or over three hundred dollars, and Mr. Zartman said it was at least three hundred dollars. Mr. Zartman asked Mr. Keener on that occasion, according to the testimony of John Pannebecker, \u201c How much is it?\u201d Mr. Keener said it was about three hundred dollars. Mr. Zartman said he would pay it. At first he said he would pay it. Then he said his two sons had got the best farms, and he would make them pay it, after saying he would pay it himself. Now that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>was in 1882, less than six years previous to the bringing of this suit. This suit was brought on June 7, 1887. So, that that would make it less than six years before the suit was brought, that this conversation was had and this promise to pay was made on the part of David Zartman.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">The court is requested by the defendant to charge the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">3. If the jury believe the following testimony of John Pannebecker, it is insufficient to remove the bar of the statue of limitations, and the verdict must be in favor of the defendant: [The matter here quoted was but an abbreviated form of the testimony of the witness in chief, given ante, 181.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">Answer: We say, ybs, to that; according to the proposition here, according to that quotation from John Pannebecker\u2019s testimony, we say, yes ; but that is not all of the testimony of Mr. Pannebecker.7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-8\">4. In order- to take .this case out of the operation of the statute of -limitations, the acknowledgment of the alleged debt must be clear, express, and unequivocal, and so distinct and palpable in its extent and form as to preclude hesitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-9\">Answer: We say, yes, to that. The acknowledgment of the debt must be clear, express, and unequivocal, and so distinct and palpable in its extent and form as to preclude hesitation. Therefore, you must be satisfied that this debt is three hundred dollars or more, according to the testimony, and that it has not been paid, and that the evidence is so clear that it will preclude your minds from any hesitation about it but that David Zartman in his lifetime renewed the debt,- or promised to pay it; that is made clear by the testimony of John Pannebecker, Squire Matthews and others. Your minds ought to be directed to the testimony, to satisfy yourselves. Now, you must look at the testimony, and take the law which we have submitted to you, and find a verdict which will satisfy your own conscience and do justice to the parties.7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-10\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $444.

Justice Geeen:</author>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The claim of the plaintiff in this case is exceedingly old and stale. It is founded upon an allegation that money was paid by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate for the defendant\u2019s intestate, for wages owing by the latter, and that boarding was furnished to the men who did the work, as far back as the year 1864, which was twenty-three years before the present action was brought. A further claim of the same character, in the year 1873, is included, and that was fourteen years prior to the suit. We know nothing of the items of these claims, as neither the appellant nor the appellee has printed the book entries which are the foundation of the action. But it is a fact not disputed that, during all the period of the account, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was the tenant of the defendant\u2019s intestate, having the means of satisfaction in his hands every yrear, by applying the landlord\u2019s share of the grain to the extinguishment of the debt. It seems incredible that such extraordinary laches should transpire between men so situated, especially as the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a tenant only, and his debtor was his landlord who was the owner of a large amount of real estate. No action was brought in the lifetime of either party, though three years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>elapsed before the death of either, after the promise set up to bar the statute was alleged to have been made. It needs hardly to be said that in such highly exceptional circumstances the evidence in support of the alleged acknowledgment and promise should be of the most satisfactory character.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Upon reading the testimony we find that there was but one witness who gave any evidence as to any declarations of the defendant\u2019s intestate made within six years prior to the commencement of the action. His name is John Pannebecker, and the whole of his testimony on this subject is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u201c Q. Did you hear any talk between him (David Zartman) and Emanuel Keener? A. Yes, sir. Q. About a debt? A. Yes, sir. Q. State what it was? Tell us what was said between them ? A. Emanuel Keener asked him to pay for his debt about hauling lumber and boarding the men, and for the building of the barn and the house; and Mr. Zartman said that he knew that he owed him, and that he will see that he will pay it; that the boys, Davy and Pete, had got the best farms, and. they must pay it. . .'. . Q. What, then, did the old man say? A. The old man then said that he knows that he owes him, and that he wants to see that he will get his pay from the two boys ; David and Peter have got the best farms, and they must pay it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">This is the whole of the testimony of the witness upon the direct question as to what was actually said by David Zartman, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">It is a perfectly familiar and well-settled principle in the law of this state that, in order to take a debt out of the statute, an acknowledgment must be clear, distinct, and unequivocal, and it must be consistent with a promise to pay: Palmer v. Gillespie, 95 Pa. 340; Wesner v. Stein, 97 Pa. 322; Lawson v. McCartney, 104 Pa. 356; Shaeffer v. Hoffman, 113 Pa. 1. In Palmer v. Gillespie we said: \u201c A clear, distinct, and unequivocal acknowledgment of a debt is sufficient to take a case out of the statute. It must be an admission consistent with a promise to pay.....There must not be uncertainty as to the particular debt to which the admission applies. It must be so distinct as to remove hesitation as to the debtor\u2019s meaning.\u201d The same language was repeated in Wesner v. Stein. In Lawson v. McCartney, the defendant himself testified that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>said to the plaintiff: \u201c I wished I could pajr him all I owed him. .....In the first conversation he wanted me to promise to pay him. He may have thought I would. I said I was sorry I could not pay him all I owed him. I admitted I owed it. .....I told him if he would let this go on I would do the best I could to pay him.....He did not show me the note. I knew it. I never disputed it.\u201d On the question whether these admissions were sufficient to toll the statute, we said, Mercur, C. J.: \u201c We think they are not. When a claim to recover a debt barred by the statute rests on the admission of the indebtedness, the acknowledgment thereof must be unqualified. It must be consistent with a promise to pay on demand. It must not be accompanied by such other expressions as indicate a willingness to pay at some future time: Kensington Bank v. Patton, 14 Pa. 479. No implication less than this will toll the statute. The language should be so clear as to preclude hesitation as to the debtor\u2019s meaning.\u201d In Montgomery v. Cunningham, 104 Pa. 349, we said: \u201c The acknowledgment must be clear, distinct, and unequivocal. It must be such that a promise is clearly implied.\u201d In this case a part of the defendant\u2019s declaration was, \u201c He said he would pay me, and make it all right.\u201d In Shaeffer v. Hoffman, 113 Pa. 1, the debtor,' acknowledging the execution of the note, saying: \u201c It must be fixed. I and W. will have to pay it,\u201d was held not to be such an acknowledgment of the debt as implies a promise that he will pay it, and does not, therefore, toll the statute. Mr. Justice Paxson, in delivering the opinion, said: \u201c It is not such an acknowledgment of the debt from which an unequivocal promise to pay can be inferred. It does not prove an express promise nor an implied one.....The expressions that it must be \u2018 fixed \u2019 and that he \u2018 and William would have to pay it,\u2019 are equivocal. In the one instance it is not the equivalent of \u2018 pay; \u2019 in the other, it involves another person, and may refer to a supposed liability, rather than an intention to pay. .....A statement by the defendant that he and some one else would have to fix a note, or would have to pay it, contains nothing from which an implied pror&amp;ise that the defendant alone would pay [follows?].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">If we recur to the testimony in the present case, we find nothing from which it can be implied that David Zartman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>alone intended to pay the debt. The witness said that \u201c Mr. Zartman said that he knew that he owed him, and that he will see that he will pay it; that the boys, Davy and Pete, had got the best farms, and they must pay it.\u201d And the same witness, repeating the same conversation, said: \u201cThe old man then said that he knows that he owes him that, and he wants to see that he will get his pay from the two boys; David and Peter have got the best farms, and they must pay it.\u201d The only thing that is unequivocal, in reality, in all this, is that the old man intended that the two boys should pay the debt. It cannot be said of this testimony that it contained a clear, distinct, and unequivocal acknowledgment .of the debt, consistent with a promise that he, David Zartman, alone, would pay or intended to pay the debt at any time. On the contrary, such an inference is precluded by- his saying that the boys must pay it, or that he would see that they would pay it. Of course, the language is highly equivocal as to any intent of his to pay the debt himself. W\u00e9 are of opinion that the testimony of the witness was entirely insufficient to toll the statute, and therefore sustain the seventh assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The sixth assignment is sustained, and also the second, because the conversation testified to by the witness Matthews occurred in the year 1880, which was more than six years before suit brought. It should not have been admitted, and, having been received in evidence, it was entitled to no consideration, as the basis of a right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The first assignment is not sustained, as the witness, though a party, and interested, was only examined to prove book entries, and for that purpose he was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The third assignment is not sustained, because the entry in David Zartman\u2019s book was not such a book -entry as could be given in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">We think the witness Peter Zartman was not competent to testify for the defendant, for this reason: He was the alienee, by mere gift, of one of his father\u2019s farms. The debt in suit, if a debt at all, was a subsisting debt at the time of the alienation, due by his father to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. Hence the conveyance of the land would.be a voluntary conveyance, and therefore a fraud upon David Zartman\u2019s creditors. That being so, the land could be followed in Peter Zartman\u2019s hands for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, if a judgment were recovered in the present action. If there were personal estate of David Zartman in the hands of his administrator sufficient for the payment of all his debts, the land of the witness could not be followed for the debt of David Zartman, and in that event the witness, 'having assigned all his interest in the estate of David Zartman, would be disinterested, and would be competent to testify. But it is alleged by the appellee, and not denied by the appellant, that David Zartman left no personal estate, and that the administrator\u2019s account showed a balance of $83.69 due the accountant. If this be so, the witness Peter Zartman would be interested in preventing a recovery in this action, and of course the assignment of his interest in his father\u2019s estate would have no effect to divest that interest. His interest would be adverse to that of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and he would be disqualified under clause <em>(e) </em>of the fifth section of the act of 1887, P. L. 159; and he would not be qualified under the sixth section of the act, because his own interest in his own land is not covered by the assignment, and consequently still remains. We think the fourth and fifth assignments are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Judgment reversed, and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
