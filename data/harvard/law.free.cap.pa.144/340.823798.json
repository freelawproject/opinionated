Roe, now deceased, a citizen of the United States, and that they have published two editions of the said books, one an inferior edition in paper covers, which is sold at retail for fifty cents per volume, the other an edition in cloth covers, stamped with an elaborate and handsome design, which is sold at retail for one dollar and fifty cents per volume.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">3. \u201c That the firm of H. J. Smith &amp; Co., publishers and booksellers in the city of Philadelphia, Pa., and the defendants in this suit, recently purchased a large consignment of the cheaper edition of the said works of E.

P. Roe\u2019s books, and that the book bought b^ the witness was an exact copy of the best edition and the cover was the same: \u201c I asked him how he could sell them for forty-five cents, and he said they bought the paper-bound books, and put a cloth back on them which was exactly like the original.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">On January 17,1891, the court, Finletteb, P.
