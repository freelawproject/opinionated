Ridelsperger, post, 423. In cases coming up from counties outside of Philadelphia, rarely, if ever, is a formal bill of exceptions shown; only an \u201c appendix \u201d containing such of the pleadings as it was thought proper to print, and a verbatim copy of the stenographer\u2019s notes of testimony, translated into longhand. Exceptions to the rulings on offers of testimony and to the charge are usually noted, but seldom do the printed notes show an actual sealing of an exception, which is done, of course, only by the signature and seal of the trial judge. When exceptions are sealed at all, the signature and seal of the judge follow immediately the ruling excepted to. But, in Philadelphia, the regular practice is to present and have sealed by the trial judge a formal \u201c bill of exceptions \u201d showing, briefly, all the proceedings on the trial, and the offers and rulings excepted to fully and carefully, the whole certified at the end and signed and sealed by the trial judge. This bill of exceptions is then printed in the appendix to the paper-book. The entire subject is clearly discussed, and forms given, in 2 Brewst. Pr., \u00a7 3057, et seq., p. 1249 Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Aq12\">Me. Justice Mitchell :</author>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The bill of exceptions is extremely imperfect, no notes of the testimony apparently having been taken except those by the judge, which were merely for his own use, and much abbreviated and incomplete.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The first, fourth, and sixth assignments of error must therefore be disregarded, as the record affords us no way of determining whether or not they are well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The second and third assignments are to the refusal to allow the prisoner to show that by special contract with his employers he was entitled to the exclusive possession of the room where the assault took place, and particularly that the prosecutor, Osborne, was not to enter it. Such an arrangement was unusual, perhaps improbable, but the appellant had a right to give it in evidence, and ask the.jury to believe it; and, if they did so, it would put the occurrence in a different light, perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>even to the extent of justifying the prisoner in attempting to eject Osborne forcibly. The question for the jury then would be, not whether this was a wanton and unprovoked attack, but whether more, violence was used than the occasion justified. The evidence, therefore, was material to the appellant\u2019s case, and should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Judgment reversed, and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
