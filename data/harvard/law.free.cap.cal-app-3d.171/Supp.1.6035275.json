Each defendant was then sentenced, which sentence was suspended, and placed on summary probation on certain terms and conditions. On appeal from the judgments defendants attack their respective convictions and orders of probation. Finding no merit to defendants\u2019 contentions, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">The record of the trial proceedings reflects the following facts:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-6\">Defendant Nelson is the co-owner with his wife of \u201cPenny Lane,\u201d a retail store located at 6711 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. Defendants Vitale and Wolf are employed at Penny Lane as manager and salesperson, respectively. Penny Lane stocks and sells novelties such as T-shirts and posters. In addition, however, the store has a substantial supply of items which, in the opinion of several experts who testified at trial, are drug paraphernalia as that term is defined in section 11014.5, the companion section to section 11364.7, subdivision (a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">These materials included bongs (small water pipes), roach clips (devices for holding burning marijuana cigarettes), coke kits (packages containing items commonly used for preparing and ingesting cocaine), coke spoons (small spoons used for inhaling cocaine), as well as items which have legitimate uses such as scales and bulk chemicals but which, in the opinion of the expert witnesses, were stocked by the store for the purpose of weighing and preparing drugs and narcotics. Prior to January 1, 1983, the sale of such merchandise was not unlawful. However, when section 11364.7 took effect on that date, Penny Lane employees, at Nelson\u2019s order, erected signs declaring that the same merchandise which they had always sold was now being offered for sale only for legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">On January 21, 1983, David Turnquist, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, entered Penny Lane in plain clothes. Defendant Wolf was working at the time. Turnquist asked for a \u201cbong\u201d and was sold one by Wolf. Subsequently, the police entered and seized several boxes of suspected drug paraphernalia. During the course of the seizure, defendant Nelson appeared at the store, identified himself to the police as the owner, and admitted that he had anticipated the police action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">On February 10, 1983, Kenneth Cook, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, entered Penny Lane in plain clothes. A conversation ensued between Cook and defendant Vitale, who was working at the time, during which Vitale declined to sell drug paraphernalia to Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">The next day, February 11, police officers with a search warrant seized additional supplies of chemicals and other drug paraphernalia. On May 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.6\">*Supp.6</page-number>1983, police officers, again with a search-warrant, seized further quantities of paraphernalia. At trial, the officers explained why in their opinion the items seized on all three occasions constituted drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Harold M. Wallack, who had sold tobacco and tobacco products his entire working life, explained on behalf of the People why none of the miniature pipes and bongs seized at Penny Lane were suitable for smoking tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The defense called Los Angeles Police Officer David Richardson as its initial witness. Richardson\u2019s testimony essentially corroborated the opinion of the People\u2019s witnesses that the items seized from Penny Lane were drug paraphernalia. Each defendant then testified. Although all admitted varying degrees of familiarity with drug paraphernalia and usage, each disclaimed any intent for the items sold in Penny Lane to be used for the preparation or ingestion of controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Prior to trial, each defendant filed a demurrer challenging the validity of section 11364.7, subdivision (a), on constitutional grounds. At the conclusion of a consolidated hearing on the matters, the court overruled the demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">On appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> defendants reassert their position that section 11364.7, subdivision (a), is constitutionally infirm. The thrust of their challenge is that section 11364.7, subdivision (a), is void for vagueness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   \u201cAs generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Kolen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.7\">*Supp.7</page-number><em>der </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 352, 357 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 909, 103 S.Ct. 1855].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Defendants initially assert that the phrases \u201cdesigned for use\u201d and \u201cmarketed for use\u201d in section 11014.5 are impermissibly vague for the reason that there are many items that \u201care not solely designed to be drug paraphernalia but are [dependent] upon the ingenuity or purpose of the purchaser . . . We construe this argument to be an attack on the sufficiency of the mens rea or scienter element of section 11364.7, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">Defendants\u2019 remaining argument also concerns the adequacy of that element, albeit in conjunction with the phrase \u201creasonably should know\u201d contained in subdivision (a) of section 11364.7. Defendants contend that this phrase forces a merchant to be \u201cfaced with the difficult, if not impossible, task of determining what gives rise to a reasonable belief that a purchaser intends to utilize the paraphernalia for an illegal purpose. ... In short, the statute makes the retailer responsible for knowing what a customer intends to do with a purchase. This constructive knowledge [standard] as a basis for criminal liability is completely unacceptable and unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Defendants\u2019 two-prong position is grounded essentially in their concern that the state statute imposes a standard of virtual strict liability against a seller, in that the seller is held accountable even when an object has innocent, legitimate uses and is charged with a customer\u2019s undisclosed or disguised reason for purchasing an item that has the potential to be utilized as drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">To evaluate defendants\u2019 vagueness claims, \u201cwe look first to the language of the statute, then to its legislative history, and finally to California decisions construing the statutory language.\u201d <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 246 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">A. Statutory Language</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">We commence our three-part analysis with a threshold examination of the statutory language of the charged drug paraphernalia offense in the context of defendants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">Section 11364.7, subdivision (a) reads: \u201cIt is a misdemeanor for any person to deliver, furnish, or transfer, or to possess with intent to deliver, furnish, or transfer, or to manufacture with intent to deliver, furnish, or transfer, drug paraphernalia, knowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know, that it will be used to plant, propagate, cultivate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.8\">*Supp.8</page-number>grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled substance in violation of this division. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">The definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d referred to in that subdivision is found in section 11014.5. Subdivision (a) reads in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018Drug paraphernalia\u2019 means all equipment, products and materials of any kind which are designed for use or marketed for use, in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repackaging, storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance in violation of this division. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">This general definition is followed by a nonexhaustive list of eight examples of drug paraphernalia. (\u00a7 11014.5, subd. (a)(1)\u2014(8).) Each of the items listed in the eight examples is characterized as drug paraphernalia if it is \u201cdesigned for use or marketed for use\u201d with controlled substances. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The eighth example, \u201cObjects designed for use or marketed for use in ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing marijuana, cocaine, hashish, or hashish oil into the human body,\u201d is itself further particularized by a nonexhaustive list of eleven examples. (\u00a7 11014.5, subd. (a)(8)(A)\u2014(K).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Subdivision (b) of section 11014.5 defines the phrase \u201cmarketed for use\u201d to mean \u201cadvertising, distributing, offering for sale, displaying for sale, or selling in a manner which promotes the use of equipment, products, or materials with controlled substances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">Subdivision (c) of that section lists seven factors that \u201ca court or other authority should consider, in addition to all other logically relevant factors\u201d to determine whether an object constitutes drug paraphernalia. Two of the listed factors are: \u201cStatements by an owner or by anyone in control of the object concerning its use\u201d and \u201cWhether the owner, or anyone in control of the object, is a legitimate supplier of like or related items to the community, such as a licensed distributor or dealer of tobacco products.\u201d (\u00a7 11014.5, subd. (c)(1), (6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">Subdivision (d) sets forth the Legislature\u2019s intent to sever, if possible, any invalid \u201cprovision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance . . . held invalid\u201d from the remainder of the section\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">From our perusal of the preceding statutory language, we observe that section 11364.7, subdivision (a), embodies the offense component while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.9\">*Supp.9</page-number>section 11014.5 contains the definitional component of the drug paraphernalia offense at issue. Additionally, while section 11014.5 discloses no overt scienter requirement, section 11364.7, subdivision (a), exhibits what appears to be a two-tier or double scienter standard (i.e., \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cknowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is that a provision is to be construed so as to effect the intent of the Legislature. [Citations.] When determining legislative intent, the plain meaning of clear statutory language should be followed unless there is compelling evidence that another meaning is intended. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>DePaul </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 409, 414 [187 Cal.Rptr. 82].)  Moreover, where the requisite scienter may be infused to clarify an ambiguous word or phrase, a statute will not be held void for vagueness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCaughan </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 409, 414 [317 P.2d 974].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Mindful of these principles, we conclude that the \u201cdesigned for use or marketed for use\u201d language in section 11014.5\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d reflects the Legislature\u2019s attempt to assign the appropriate scienter to each category of offender within that section\u2019s ambit. (See <em>Levas &amp; Levas </em>v. <em>Village of Antioch, III. </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 684 F.2d 446, 450. In other words, the \u201cdesigned for use\u201d phrase pertains to the state of mind of the manufacturer of an item while the \u201cmarketed for use\u201d phrase refers to the seller, including distributor, of the item. The common denominator in both instances is that the requisite state of mind belongs to the person in control of the item at the time the item is manufactured, or delivered, furnished or transferred, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">In reaching this conclusion we rely primarily on the analysis of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hoffman Estates. </em>In that case the Supreme Court had before it \u201ca pre-enforcement facial challenge to a drug paraphernalia ordinance on the ground that it is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The ordinance in question requires a business to obtain a license if it sells any items that are \u2018designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 491 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 367].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">The <em>Hoffman Estates </em>court disposed of Flipside\u2019s overbreadth argument by pointing out that \u201cthe overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 496-497 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 370-371].) Turning to Flipside\u2019s vagueness argument, the court reiterated the principle that \u201ca scienter requirement may mitigate a law\u2019s vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.\u201d (Id<em>., </em>at p. 499 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.10\">*Supp.10</page-number>The court then found the phrase \u201cdesigned for use\u201d not to be ambiguous, reasoning: \u201cA principal meaning of \u2018design\u2019 is \u2018[t]o fashion according to a plan. \u2019 Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language 707 (2d ed 1957). Cf. <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 454, n. 3, (1939). It is therefore plain that the standard encompasses at least an item that is principally used with illegal drugs by virtue of its objective features, i.e., features designed by the manufacturer. A business person of ordinary intelligence would understand that this term refers to the design of the manufacturer, not the intent of the retailer or customer. It is also sufficiently clear that items which are principally used for nondrug purposes, such as ordinary pipes, are not \u2018designed for use\u2019 with illegal drugs.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 501 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Similarly, the court next found \u201cthe alternative \u2018marketed for use\u2019 standard [to be] transparently clear . . . .\u201d Based on its review of the ordinance\u2019s guidelines, which \u201crefer to the display of paraphernalia, and to the proximity of covered items to otherwise uncovered items,\u201d the court concluded that \u201c[t]he standard requires scienter, since a retailer could scarcely \u2018market\u2019 items \u2018for\u2019 a particular use without intending that use.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at p. 502 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Although the phrases \u201cdesigned for use\u201d and \u201cmarketed for use\u201d in the <em>Hoffman Estates </em>ordinance appeared in the offense provision instead of a definition provision, which is the case here, we conclude this to be a distinction without a difference.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore follow the cogent reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Hoffman Estates </em>and infuse the phrases \u201cdesigned for use\u201d and \u201cmarketed for use\u201d in section 11014.5 with the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.11\">*Supp.11</page-number>element of scienter, which is construed solely from the viewpoint of the person in control of the item, i.e., the manufacturer or seller, without reference to a third person\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">This conclusion is further buttressed by a plain reading of the phrase \u201cmarketed for use\u201d in the context of section 11014.5 as a whole. The unambiguous language of subdivision (b) of that section specifically defines that phrase to mean \u201cadvertising, distributing, offering for sale, displaying for sale, or selling in a manner which promotes the use of equipment, products, or material with controlled substances.\u201d The clear import of this language is to focus only on the intent and actions of the seller. Additionally, subdivision (c) spotlights the owner or anyone in control of the object with regard to two of the seven enumerated factors that may be used to determine whether an object constitutes drug paraphernalia. There is nothing in the language of section 11014.5, however, which would give rise to an inference that the intent of a third person is relevant to the definition of what constitutes drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">On the other hand, turning to the phrase \u201creasonably should know\u201d in subdivision (a) of section 11364.7, we note that this phrase is already a part of the two-tier scienter component of that subdivision; thus, infusing scienter to clear up any vagueness is inapposite. We also note that this phrase is not further defined, nor is there anything in that section or in a related section which clarifies what that phrase signifies. We therefore must look elsewhere for guidance in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">B. Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">It is a well-established principle of statutory construction that an enactment will be upheld against a claim of vagueness if its terms may be made reasonably certain by reference to legislative history. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCaughan, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 414; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614, 620 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100].)  Accordingly, we pivot our attention next to a review of the legislative history of sections 11014.5 and 11364.7 in conjunction with our construction of the phrases \u201cdesigned for use,\u201d \u201cmarketed for use,\u201d and \u201creasonably should know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Both sections 11014.5 and 11364.7 were added to the Health and Safety Code by the same enactment in 1982.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Stats. 1982, ch. 1278, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.12\">*Supp.12</page-number>respectively, pp. 4725-4727.) As we observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark-Van Brunt </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8, 10, footnote 1 [205 Cal.Rptr. 144], the plain purpose of the California Drug Paraphernalia statutes, particularly section 11364.7, subdivision (a), and its companion, section 11014.5, is to \u201celiminate the use and sale of such items. . . .\u201d We also observed that these statutes are \u201cpatterned after the Model Drug Paraphernalia Act [Model Act] drafted by [the Drug Enforcement Administration of] the United States Department of Justice.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">In addition to California, at least 25 states have adopted drug paraphernalia legislation based on the provisions of the Model Act in varying degrees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Model Act \u201cand its progeny were designed to overcome the constitutional infirmities of early \u2018headshop\u2019 legislation. These laws were written in the belief that the sale of drug paraphernalia encourages the use and sale of illegal drugs. The [Model Act] drafters stated: \u2018[T]he availability of Drug Paraphernalia has reached epidemic levels. An entire industry has developed which promotes, even glamorizes, the illegal use of drugs, by adults and children alike. Sales of Drug Paraphernalia are reported as high as three billion dollars a year.\u2019 [Model Act], Prefatory Note.\u201d <em>(Stoianoff, supra, </em>695 F.2d at p. 1217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">\u201cIn recent years communities across the country have come to believe that criminal laws prohibiting the possession, sale, and distribution of drugs do not adequately deter drug use, particularly among the young. Accordingly, many states, counties, and municipalities have enacted drug paraphernalia [laws] designed to stop or control the sale of equipment that can be used to grow, purify, store, ingest, inhale, or inject drugs. The drafting problem inherent in such [laws], however, is that few items are useful solely as drug implements, and an astonishing variety of ordinary articles can be converted to drug use. The Model Drug Paraphernalia Act, drafted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, is an attempt to write a statute that will be broad enough to deal with the problem effectively, yet not so broad that it impinges on constitutionally protected conduct or so vague that neither the law\u2019s targets nor its enforcers know what it means. The distinctive features of the Model Act are two: it attempts to give content to the necessarily general definition of drug paraphernalia by listing examples and factors to be considered; and it contains an intent requirement that is meant to mitigate any definitional uncertainty.\u201d <em>(Levas and Levas </em>v. <em>Village of Antioch, III., supra, </em>684 F.2d at p. 449; fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.13\">*Supp.13</page-number>The Model Act, as it has been adopted in its various manifestations by numerous states, counties, and municipalities, has been subject to vagueness challenges on the grounds that: (1) the act\u2019s scope encompasses both multipurpose objects with drug-related and legitimate uses as well as innocent items capable of drug use; and (2) violation of the act could be established by transferring a purchaser\u2019s intent to use an innocent object with proscribed drugs to an unaware seller. (See <em>Garner </em>v. <em>White </em>(8th Cir. 1984) 726 F.2d 1274, 1279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Every federal circuit court that has considered a vagueness challenge to an enactment based on the Model Act has upheld the enactment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Parenthetically, we note that the Ninth Circuit has not yet had the occasion to pass on the validity of the California drug paraphernalia statutes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Those circuit courts have categorically rejected the first vagueness claim above by infusing a scienter element<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> into the enactment in question to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.14\">*Supp.14</page-number>nullify the possibility that a seller of objects which have innocent or legitimate uses as well as potentially proscribed drug uses could be subject to prosecution for a violation in the absence of a showing that the seller intended to sell, distribute, etc., the objects for use with controlled substances or cannabis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">As one court observed, \u201ccomments to the Model Act make clear that the potential defendant is the person in control of the item. The comments state, for example: [\u00b6] \u201cTo insure that innocently possessed objects are not classified as drug paraphernalia, Article I makes, the knowledge or criminal intent of the person in control of an object a key element of the definition. Needless to say, inanimate objects are neither \u2018good\u2019 nor \u2018bad, \u2019 neither \u2018lawful\u2019 nor \u2018unlawful.\u2019 Inanimate objects do hot commit crimes. But, when an object is controlled by people who use it illegally, or who intend to use it illegally, or who design or adapt it for illegal use, the object can be subject to control, and the people subjected to prosecution. ...[\u00b6] Hinging the definition of drug paraphernalia on a specific intent to violate, or to facilitate a violation of, the drug laws also provides \u2018fair warning\u2019 to persons in possession of property potentially subject to this Act. A statute is not unconstitutionally vague if it embodies a specific intent to violate the law.

(Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 341 (1981-82 Reg. Sess.) September 15, 1981.) We further note that prior to this deletion and substitution a proposed revision of section 11014.5 would have inserted the following language after subdivision (b): \u201cFor the purpose of this section, the phrase \u2018intended for use\u2019 shall refer to the intent of the person or business suspected or accused of using, possessing, delivering, furnishing, transferring, or manufacturing the equipment, materials, or products referred to in this section.\u201d (Sen.

The <em>Stoianoff </em>court, and the other circuit courts construing the \u201cintended for use\u201d phrase, nonetheless defused any ambiguity or transferred intent problems by infusing the phrase with the appropriate scienter, e.g., \u201cthe retailer or distributor must sell or market an item with the intent that it be used with drugs (\u2018intended for use\u2019).\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Casbah, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thone </em>(8th Cir. 1981) 651 F.2d 551, at p. 559; <em>Murphy, supra, </em>742 F.2d at pp. 570-571 (collecting cases).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Our Legislature apparently entertained a similar concern.

The definitional provision of the ordinance adopted the Model Act\u2019s phrases \u201cused, or intended to use,\u201d which in section 11014.5 the Legislature rejected in favor of the \u201cmarketed for use\u201d alternative. The ordinance also included the \u201cdesigned for use\u201d phrase and a knowledge requirement similar to the one in section 11364.7, i.e., \u201cknowing, or . . . where one reasonably should know.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">In concluding that the phrase \u201cdesigned for use\u201d was not impermissibly vague, the <em>Bamboo Brothers </em>court relied on <em>Hoffman Estates, supra, </em>and <em>Casbah, Inc., supra.

Vague laws may trap the innocejit by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d <em>(Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108-109 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 227-228, 92 S.Ct. 2294]; fns. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1086-6\"> The text of the Village of Hoffman Estates ordinance is set out in an appendix to the Supreme Court opinion. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 505-507 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 375-377].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1086-7\"> That ordinance, which was not based on the federal Model Drug Paraphernalia Act (hereafter Model Act), imposed a civil fine of not less than $10 and not more than $500 for each violation.

In <em>Camille Corp. </em>v. <em>Phares </em>(7th Cir. 1983) 705 F.2d 223, the Seventh Circuit Court explained that this deletion was not challenged on appeal in <em>Levas, </em>and thus, the clarity of that phrase had not in fact \u201cpreviously been addressed by this court.\u201d <em>(Camille Corp., supra, </em>at p. 230.) The <em>Camille </em>court then addressed the phrase \u201cor should reasonably know\u201d in the Model Act ordinance before it and concluded that the phrase was not impermissibly vague. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 230-231.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1092-9\"> In arriving at this conclusion the <em>Casbah, Inc. </em>court <em>(supra, </em>at p. 561, fn. 12) adopted the analysis of Judge Stapleton in <em>Delaware Accessories Trade Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Gebelein </em>(D.Del. 1980) 497 F.Supp. 289, 294 who reasoned: \u201cIn the context of an alleged sale or delivery of drug paraphernalia, the Act requires the state to prove both (1) that the defendant intended that an item would be used for the production or consumption of controlled substances and also (2) that he either knew, or that he acted in a set of circumstances from which a reasonable person would know, that the buyer of the item would thereafter use it for those purposes. So-called constructive knowledge thus has significance only in a situation where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp.17\">*Supp.17</page-number>defendant is selling or delivering items that he intends to be used to produce or consume illicit drugs in the first place. The legitimate merchant who sells innocuous items need make no judgment about the purpose of the buyer based upon the surrounding circumstances. The dealer, on the other hand, who sells innocuous items with the intent that they be used with drugs is, in effect, put on notice by the illicit nature of his activity that he must be careful to conform his conduct to the law. Even the illicit dealer, however, is not held legally responsible, as plaintiffs would suggest, for guessing what is in the mind of a buyer. The seller is safe as long as he does not actually know the buyer\u2019s purpose and as long as the objective facts that are there for him to observe do not give fair notice that illegal use will ensue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1094-9\"> In <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark Van-Brunt, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8, no challenge was made to the constitutionality of these sections. Accordingly, we did not reach that issue. Likewise, the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Morton) (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 899 [199 Cal.Rptr. 153] expressly declared that it was <em>\u201cnot </em>pass[ing] upon the validity or scope of California\u2019s new statutory definition of \u2018drug paraphernalia\u2019, or upon the relevance of the federal decisions to the California drug paraphernalia statute. None of these issues is before us.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 903, italics in original.) The <em>Morton </em>court, however, rejected the <em>Hoffman Estates\u2019 </em>construction of the term \u201cdesigned for use\u201d as a limiting construction on the items to be seized pursuant to a search warrant. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 902-903.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"AeZ8\"> The text of the ordinance is set out at 133 Cal.App.3d 132-136.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1095-9\"> In upholding the Santa Barbara ordinance the <em>Bamboo Brothers </em>court expressly found no state preemption. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 122.) At that time no pervasive, comprehensive state scheme to regulate all drug paraphernalia existed. Instead, section 11364, which the court considered, merely makes it \u201cunlawful to possess an opium pipe or any . . . paraphernalia used for unlawfully injecting or smoking [certain specified controlled substances].\u201d Moreover, section 11364.5 and Penal Code section 308, which the court also considered, pertained only to the regulation of drug paraphernalia with regard to minors. However, with the enactment of sections 11364.7 and 11014.5, which essentially permeate the field of drug paraphernalia regulation, the Legislature expressed its intent to expand such regulation to adults as well. The fact that the Legislature intended preemption of the subject matter is also evident from our reading of section (1) of Senate Bill No. 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1095-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page Supp. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
