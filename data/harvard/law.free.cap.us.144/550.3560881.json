The essential prerequisite to the jurisdiction of courts of equity is that there is no adequate remedy at law\u2014otherwise the constitutional right to a trial by jury would be invaded \u2022and taken away.

The fact is that the defendants have done nothing except submit the question at issue to the courts for settlement, and this is now pending, and complainant\u2019s right has never been established otherwise than in this proceeding.

It was a mining partnership, and, as such, not subject to legislative control. It was already in possession and actual occupation o'f the entire Coosaw Eiver, and further had the right to mine in all the other waters of the State in which it was mining, which contract the State could not alter without its consent. Differences had arisen between the company and the State as to the construction of that contract which it was . desirable to settle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-6\">The acts in its title sets out, that it is to \u201c settle \u201d \u2014 not prescribe\u2014that is, to amicably arrange existing differences,\u2014 and to define the period of making returns, and also to fix the terms on which it might be accepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-7\">The act then lays down the terms- desired on the part of the State as new terms, to be suggested to the company, and as constituting a new contract .between the company and the State. 1</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-8\">The act admits that unless consented to by the company, the terms of the act would not be binding upon them, and that it was desirable on the part of the State that the .company should accept, and make thems\u00e9lves liable to the terms of the act.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-9\">And the act further admits that the company had already expended large sums of money in the purchase of sufficient plant, to mine certain portions .of the Coosaw Eiver. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaI2\">It proposed, therefore, to the company, that, in consideration of their accepting the terms stated in the act, and in consideration of the .expenditures which they had made, and for the further condition, implied in the act, that they were to continue to maintain such plant and continue such operations theretofore conducted, it should have the exclusive right to mine in that' part of, the Coosaw Eiver only so long as,- and no longer than, they shopld make true and faithful returns and pay the royalty prescribed in- the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asv\">Assuming this to be .a .contract between individuals, would any question be made as to the right of the company to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>tinue their mining operations, so long as they fulfilled the conditions contained in the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-4\">The legislature itself recognizes the fact that a consideration has been asked and paid; that both sides have given and taken, and that the terms and conditions of the contract as expressed in the act are therefore binding on both sides.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">Is not this, therefore, a contract, based upon valuable consideration, paid to the State by the company? If so, then, under ,the cases cited, it must be construed as though the contract was made between the individuals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">And if it is, then it must be construed in favor of the company, for the only ground upon which the court below rested its decision in favor of the State, was that it must fie construed liberally to the State, and all doubts resolved in her favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-7\">In construing the act of 1876 no reference can be made to the act of 1870. The established principle is, that while recourse may be had to the doctrine of <em>in pari materia </em>to resolve a doubt, it can never be called into action to create a doubt; that- when the wording of a statute is clear in' itself and leads to no absurd conclusions, it\u2019 is not allowable to go elsewhere in search of conjectural constructions ; and that when there is a difference between an older and a junior statute, especially where the latter has a repealing clause, it is presumed that the legislature intended that there should be a difference, and the prior act must be considered repealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">The rule of construction <em>\u201cin pari materia'1'1 </em>is resorted to-for the purpose, of ascertaining the meaning of a statute, when explanation is necessary, either because of seeming conflict in its own provisions, or incompleteness of detail in its-subject matter, or a doubt as to the sense in which uncertain words or phrases are- used. In such cases, and to preserve harmony and consistency, the rule is resorted to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">But the rule carries the limitation, that where the statute is itself plain, the rule cannot be resorted to; nor can its clear language be controlled by the supposed policy of a former one. Therefore where the words of a statute, as in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>are not doubtful, these words are the best guide to legislative, intention, and if they differ from former acts, it must be held that the legislature in using them, intended that there should, be a difference. The act. of 1876, set out expressly to make alterations and changes in the existing law, and in order that there might be no question or doubt as to this purpose, adds the clause repealing all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the'provisions of this act.. It seems impossible to add by way of argument anything which would make more clear, or more plain, the declaration in the act sustaining the claim of the-defendants to the continuing right to mine, in Coosaw Biver, than the words: \u201c That upon accepting- the terms of the act they should have exclusive right to occupy and mine in said river, \u00a3 so long as and no\u2019 longer than \u2019 they should make true' and faithful returns of the number of tons, and punctually pay the royalty thereon.\u201d Upon this the defendants stand. They, have made true and faithful returns, and have punctually paid the royalty on -the rock mined, as provided in the section of the act, and having so done, they claim the right to continue to dig, and to mine in said territory, \u00a3-\u00a3 <em>so long as arid no longer than\u201d </em>said conditions shall be fulfilled. <em>Market Co. </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>101 U.

Justice Hablan,</author>\n<p id=\"A2vr\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The Coosaw Mining Company undoubtedly acquired by the act of 1870, and upon the conditions therein prescribed, the right, for the full term of twenty-one years, to dig, mine and remove phosphate rocks and phosphatic deposits in the navigable waters of South Carolina. But the right thus acquired was not made an exclusive one. The State was at liberty, so far as that act was concerned, to grant similar rights to other associations, corporations or persons. This is not disputed.,</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Did the appellant, by its acceptance of the act of 1876, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>quire an exclusive yigM with respect to that part of Coosaw River then occupied for the purposes of its business ? If this question be answered in the affirmative^-as, in view of the express language.of the act, it must-be \u2014 the State is, nevertheless, entitled to a decree, upon the issue as to the impaironent of the obligation of the alleged contract, unless it be held that that act gave an exclusive right to the Coosaw Mining Company, <em>in perpetuity, </em>conditioned only upon its meeting the terms prescribed by the third section, namely, that it would make true and faithful returns of the number of tons of phosphate rock and phosphatic deposits dug, mined, removed, shipped or otherwise sent to market, and pay the royalty as provided for in the first section of that act. It cannot be denied that the third section, if it be construed literally and without reference to other sections or to the act of 1870, will bear this interpretation. But the act of 1876, if interpreted, as it ought to be, in connection with that of 1870, will, to say the least, bear equally another construction, namely,that the right granted by the original act for the term of twenty-one years, was made, by the act of 1876, exclusive, <em>only during the remainder of that term, </em>as to the part of Coo-saw River occupied by the appellant\u2019s works, \u201c so long as and no longer than \u201d it made the returns -and paid the royalty prescribed by the latter act. Under the latter construction, the right of the appellant, by the 'acts of 1870 and 1876, to dig, mine and remove phosphate rocks and phosphatic deposits in the navigable waters of the State, ceased altogether after the expiration of twenty-one years from March 1, 1870. If the act of 1876 materially altered that of 1870, in respect to: the times and manner of making returns, or the royalty to be paid, the Coosaw Mining Company received in consideration therefor what it did not previously have, that is, an exclusive right, for a limited period, in the particular part of Coosaw River -which it occupied when the act of 1876 was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">If the act of 1876 is fairly susceptible of either of the constructions we have indicated, as we think it is, the interpretation must be adopted which is most favorable to the State. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The doctrine is firmly established that only that which is. granted in clear and explicit terras passes by a grant of property, franchises or privileges in which the government or the public has an interest. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Railroad </em>Co., 1 Black, 358, 380; <em>Fertilizing Co. </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>97 U. S. 659, 666; <em>Hannibal &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>Missouri River Packet Co., </em>125 U. S. 260, 271; <em>Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Pullman's Car Co., </em>139 U. S. 24, 49; <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Bienville Water Supply Co., </em>141 U. S. 67, 80; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pacific Guano Co., </em>22 So. Car. 50, 83, 86. Statutory grants, of that character, are to- be construed strictly in favor of the public, and whatever is' not unequivocally granted is withheld; nothing passes by mere implication. <em>Holyoke Co. </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>15 Wall. 500; <em>The Binghamton Bridge, </em>3 Wall. 51, 75. This principle, it has been said, \u201cis a wise one, as it serves.to defeat any purpos\u00e9 concealed by the skilful use of terms to accomplish something not apparent on the face of the act, and thus sanctions only open dealing with legislative bodies.\u201d <em>Slidell </em>v. <em>Grandjean, </em>111 U. S. 412, 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The wisdom of the rule adverted to is well illustrated by the present' case. Neither the title nor the preamble of the act of ' 1876 suggests the purpose on the part of the Coosaw Mining Company, or of any other association or corporation, to obtain, or the intention of the legislature to grant, a new right to dig, mine and remove phosphate rocks and phosphatic deposits, much less a grant of such a right in perpetuity. The title discloses only a purpose to settle definitely the time for making returns of rocks and deposits, so dug, mined and removed, to establish the royalty to. be paid, and to fix the terms on which the act might be accepted by the parties named in it.' If the parties, so named, had in mind to acquire a grant for an indefinite period, their purpose was concealed under the general words in the title, \u201c and also to fix the terms on which this act may be accepted by the parties named therein.\u201d Turning to the preamble, which has been said to be a key to open the understanding of a statute, we find that the occasion of the passage of the act of 1876 was a dispute between the Coosaw Mining Company and the comptroller general of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>State, not as to the right of that company to dig, mine and remove phosphat\u00e9 rock and phosphatic deposits, but only as to the times and manner in which it should-make its returns, and pay the prescribed royalty ; and that \u201c for remedy thereof\u201d the act was passed. Neither the title nor the preamble indicates a purpose to enlarge the right given by the act of 1870 for twenty-one years to one for an indefinite period. While express provisions in the body of an act cannot be controlled or restrained by the title or preamble, the latter.may be referred to when ascertaining the meaning of a statute which is susceptible of different constructions. In <em>United States </em>v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 386, Chief Justice Marshall said: \u201cNeither party contends that the title of an act can control plain words in the body of the statute; and neither denies that, taken, with other parts, it may assist in removing ambiguities. Where the intent is plain, nothing is left to construction. Where the mind labors to -discover the design of the legislature it seizes everything from which aid can be derived; and in such case the title claims a degree of notice, and will have its due share of consideration.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>3 Wheat. 610, 631. This rule is especially applicable in States whose constitutions, like that of South Carolina, provide that \u201c every act or -resolution, having the force of law, shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the -title.\u201d <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Car Co., </em>102 U. S. 1, 11, 12. So, in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Rowan, </em>9 Pet. 301, 317: \u201c The preamble in the act may be resorted to, to aid in the' construction of the enacting clause, when any ambiguity exists.\u201d The ambiguity here referred to is \u25a0 not simply th|it arising from the meaning of particular words, but such as- may arise, in respect to the general scope and meaning of. a statute, when all of its' provisions are examined. Interpreting the act of 1876, with such aid as may be' properly derived from its title and preamble, we are of opinion that the legislature did not intend to grant the appellant an exclusive right, for an indefinite period, but only an exclusive right, during the balance of the term of twenty-one years fixed by the act of 1870; and not even an exclusive ri^b.t for that period except upon the performance of the conditions set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>forth in the act of 1876 as to making returns and paying the prescribed royalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">It results that the contention of the State must be sustained, whether we apply the rule requiring public grants to be favorably construed for the government, or whether, independently of that rule, we give effect to' the intention of the legislature as disclosed by the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">It is contended by the appellant that this case is not one of which a court of the United States, sitting in equity, could take cognizance. In meeting this question, the counsel for the State have placed some reliance upon the provisions in the act of 1890 authorizing the Board of Phosphate Commissioners, In the name and on behalf of the State, \u201c to take such measures or proceedings, as they may be advised are proper, to enjoin and terminate\u201d any molestation, interference or obstruction of the peaceable possession and occupation for mining purposes of the navigable streams of the State, either by the Board, or by any one licensed or authorized by it, and to take such action, for and in behalf of the State, as they deem proper for the protection of its interests. This statute .is not important here except as showing the authority of that board to bring suits, in the name of or for the State, to protect its interests. The suit may have been cognizable in the state court, sitting in equity. But if it was not one of which the Circuit Court of the United States, sitting in equity, could properly take cognizance, <em>(Payne </em>v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430; <em>Arrowsmith </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>129 U. S. 86, 98,) the pleadings, upon removal of the case from the state court, should have been reformed so as to make it a case t\u2018o be tried at law. It is necessary, therefore, to inquire whether, according to the principles of equity, as recognized in the courts of the United States, the State can obtain relief by a suit in -equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The grounds of equity jurisdiction in such cases as the one before us are, substantially, those upon which courts of equity interfere in cases of waste, public nuisance and purpresture.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gear, </em>3 How. 120, 121, 133, bears upon this question. The United States, claiming to be the owner of certain lands upon which there was a lead mine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>brought an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit </em>against the party in possession. They, also brought a suit in equity for an injunction to stay wa)ste. This court held, in.the equity case, that digging ore from lead mines upon the' public lands was such waste as entitled the United States to a writ of injunction to restrain it.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqes\">In <em>City of Georgetown </em>v. <em>Alexandria Canal Company, </em>12 Pet. 91, 98, it was said to be \u201c now settled that a court of equity may take jurisdiction in cases1 of public nuisance by an information filed by the attorney general . . . upon the principle that equity can give more adequate and complete relief than can be obtained at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6bq\">In <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>2 Anstr. 603, an infoimation in equity in the name of the Attorney General, to restrain the erection of wharves.and docks in a certain harbor, and to abate those erected, was sustained, the court observing that \u201c where the King claims and proves a right to the soil, where a purpresture and nuisance have been committed, he may have a decree to abate it.\u201d In <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>2 My. &amp; Cr. 123, 133, it was said by. the Lord Chancellor that \u201cin informations and proceedings for the purpose of preventing public nuisances, the ordinary course is for the Attorney General to take it on himself to sue as representing the public.\u201d In reply to the suggestion that an application to the High. Court of Chancery to prevent a nuisance to a public road was never heard of before, he said: \u201c Many cases might have been produced in which the court has interfered to prevent nuisances to public rivers and to public harbors; and the Court of Exchequer, as well as this court, acting as a court of equity, has a well established jurisdiction, upon a proceeding by way of information, to prevent nuisances to public harbors and public roads; and, in short, generally to prevent public nuisances.\u201d So in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Atk. 182, in which an injunction was sought to restrain a defendant from opening mines upon an estate held by him under a deed containing reservations against waste, and the opening of mines, and in''which, it was objected that the matter was not for the determination of a court' of equity, Lord Chancellor Hard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>wicke said: \u201c The plaintiff may certainly come into this court to restrain the defendant from opening the mines, etc., even if he has only threatened t\u00f3 do it; nor is it necessary the plaintiff should have waited till the waste is actually committed, where the intention appears, and the defendant, even by his answer, insists on his right to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">An instructive case upon this subject is <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Jamaica Pond </em>Aqueduct, 133 Mass. 361, 363, 361. That was an information in equity, in the name. of the Attorney General, to restrain a corporation from doing certain illegal acts the necessary effects of which would be not- only to impair the rights of the public in the use of one of the great ponds of Massachusetts for purposes of fishing' and boating, but to create a nuisance by lowering the pond and exposing upon its shores slime, mud and offensive vegetation detrimental to the public health. It was held, 'Upon the authority of numerous cases, American and English, that where the nuisance is a public one, an information by the Attorney General was the appropriate remedy. After observing that the preventive force of a decree in equity, restraining the illegal acts before any mischief was done, would give a more efficacious and complete remedy than an indictment, or proceedings under a statute for the abatement of the nuisance, the court said \u201c There is another ground' upon which, in our opinion, this information can be maintained, though perhaps it belongs to the same general head of equity jurisdiction of restraining and preventing nuisances. The great ponds of \u2018 the Commonwealth belong to the public, and, like the tidewaters and navigable streams, are under the control and care of the Commonwealth. The rights of fishing, boating, bathing and other1 like rights which pertain to the public are regarded as valuable rights, entitled to the protection of the government. ... . If a corporation or an individual is found to be doing acts without right, the necessary effect of which is to destr\u00f3y or impair these rights and privileges, it furnishes a proper .case for an information by the Attorney G-eneral to'restrain and prevent .the mischief.\u201d \u2019 So, in Eden on Injunctions: \u201c The usual, and perhaps the more correct, mode of proceeding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>equity in cases of public nuisance is by information at the suit of the Attorney General,\u201d p. 267. Mr. Justice Story said that an information in equity at' the suit of the Attorney General would lie in cases of purpresture and public nuisance, the jurisdiction of courts of equity being sustained because of \u201c their ability to give a more complete and perfect remedy than is attainable at law, in order to prevent irreparable mischief, and also to suppress oppressive and vexatious litigations.\u201d Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 922, 923, 924; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>26 N. Y. 287, 293; <em>District Attorney </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad C</em>o., 16 Gray, 242, 245; Kerr on Injunctions, 262, 263; 1 Joyce on Injunctions, 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">These principles are applicable to the present case. The remedy at law for the protection of the State in respect to the phosphate rocks and phosphatic deposits in the beds .of' its navigable waters is not so efficacious or complete as a perpetual injunction against interference with its rights by digging, mining and removing such rocks and deposits without its consent. The Coosaw Mining Company, unless restrained, will not only appropriate to its use property held in trust for the public, but will prevent the proper administration of that trust, for an indefinite period, by obstructing others, acting under lawful authority, from enjoying rights in respect .to that property derived from the State. These conflicting claims cannot be so effectively or conclusively settled' by proceedings at law, as by a comprehensive .decree covering all the matters in controversy. Proceedings at law.or by indictmer can only reach past or present wrongs' done by the appellant, and will not adequately protect the public interests in the future. What the public are entitled to have is security for all. time against illegal interference with the control by the State of. the digging, mining and \u25a0 removing of phosphate rock and phosphatic deposits in the bed of Coosaw Kiver. Such security was properly given by the decree below.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
