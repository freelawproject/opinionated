Eaton, containing two counts. The first count alleged that on the 1st of November, 1886, and on divers days thereafter up to and until the 28th of June, 1887, at Boston, in that district, and at a place of business situated therein, the defendant was engaged in the business, avocation and employment qf a wholesale dealer in-oleomargarine, and was subject and liable to all needful regulations made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States, with the approval of \u2018the Secretary of the Treasury, for the carrying into effect of the act of Congress approved August' 2, 1886, c. 840, (24 Stat. 209,) entitled \u201c An act defining butter, also imposing a tax upon and regulating .the' manufacture, sale, importation, and exportation of oleomargarine ; \u201d, that, at the times above mentioned, said regulations were well known to the defendant, and it became his duty to keep a book showing the oleomargarine received by him, and from whom the same was received, and also showing the oleomargarine disposed of by him, and to whom the same was sold or delivered, in accordance with the regulations made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury on August 25, 1886 ; and that, at the times above mentioned, he wilfully, knowingly and unlawfully failed to keep such book showing the matters above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>stated, as required by law. The second count alleged, with the other averments contained in the first count, that it became the duty of the defendant to make a monthly return to the collector of internal revenue, showing the oleomargarine received by the defendant, and from whom it was received, and also that disposed of by him and to whom it was sold or delivered, in accordance with said regulations; and that, at the times above mentioned, he wilfully, knowingly and unlawfully failed to make such monthly return to the collector of internal revenue, as required by law. The defendant filed a demurrer to the indictment, alleging that it was insufficient in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b703-5\">At the hearing in the Circuit Court on the demurrer, the following-questions arose, upon which the judges by whom the court was held were divided in opinion; and those questions were stated and certified to this court: \u201c First. Whether a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine, who knowingly and wilfully fails and omits to keep a book showing the oleomargarine received by him and from whom the same was received, and also showing the oleomargarine disposed of by him and to whom the same was sold or delivered, as required by the regulations made by. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, August 25, 1886, is liable to the. penalty imposed by section 18 of the act of Congress approved August 2, 1886, entitled \u2018 An act defining butter, also imposing a tax upon and regulating the manufacture, sale, 'importation, and exportation of oleomargarine.\u2019 24 Stat. 209. Second. Whether a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine, who knowingly and wilfully fails and omits to make monthly returns to the collector of internal revenue, showing the oleomargarine received by him and from whom the same was received, and also showing the oleomargarine disposed of by him and to whom the same was sold or delivered, as required by the said regulations, is liable to the penalty mentioned in the first question.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b703-6\"><em>Mr. Assistant Attorney General Parker </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The sole question to -be reviewed here' is whether Congress possessed power to authorize the officers natned to establish a regulation requiring wholesale dealers in oleomargarine to keep a record of their dealings therein and to. report the details of such dealings as required by the regulation quoted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-5\">The regulation involved, which was made by the Comm-is- , sioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to said section 20, is as follows: Wholesale dealers in oleomargarine will keep a*, book (Form 61) and make a monthly return on Form 217, showing the oleomargarine received by them and- from whom ree\u00e9ived; also, the oleomargarine disposed of by them and to whom sold or delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-6\">It will be noticed' that this regulation when separated into its two propositions furnishes the two grounds of the indictment set forth in the record, and, correspondingly, the two questions which are set forth in the. certificate of division.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-7\">Form 61 provided for a record of all oleomargarine received by the wholesale dealer, showing the date of its receipt, from whom it was received, the amount, the manufacturer thereof, and also the date when the same was disposed of by the wholesale dealer, to whom it was sent, the name of manufacturer and the amount. The serial numbers of the packages were to be stated in both cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-8\">Form 2l7-provided for a monthly return of the same statements arid details by the wholesale dealer to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and a recapitulation of its contents was to be verified by the oath of the dealer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-9\">This rule is shown by the Department regulations to have been made August 25, 1886; it was terminated by the act of October 1, 1890 (26 Stat. 567, sec. 41, p. 621).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-10\">The oleomargarine act defines' butter and defines oleomargarine, and places 'a special tax upon manufacturers and on sellers of the last-named commodity, and requires payment of a stamp duty on the same, and provides for publicity and for-supervision of the manufacture, sale and exportation thereof;</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b704-11\">The regulation in question was duly formulated under said, section 20 to provide certain necessary rules for a compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>with the intent of and for the carrying out of the purposes of the enactment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-5\">The regulation is shown by Treasury Document of August 25, 1886, to have been made by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-6\">No contention appears to be made as to the needfulness of the rule, and as it was left to the Commissioner and Secretary to determine what was needful in the premises their decision was final.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-7\">The analogies of the customs laws and of the laws relating to the collection of duties upon tobacco and spirits naturally suggested the regulation adopted under the oleomargarine law, and it seems plain that the proper and effective execution of this law would be scarcely possible without a regulation equivalent to the one now under examination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-8\">As the word \u201cregulation\u201d has a technical meaning, an argument based'upon definitions or upon general reasoning would be of little service.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-9\">Cases involving the exercise of executive power have, in several instances, come before the courts, and questions of the application and force of departmental regulations have, from time to time, been passed .upon by the judicial branch of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-10\">The scope and effect of regulations of the departments have repeatedly come under consideration in the Court of Claims. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>3 C.

He may, with the approval of the President, establish regulations in execution of or supplementary to, but not in conflict with, the statutes, defining his powers or conferring rights upon others. The contrary has never been held by this court. \"What we now say is entirely consistent with <em>Gratiot </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 4 How. 80 and <em>Ex parte Reed, </em>100 U. S. 13, upon which the government relies. Referring in the first case to certain army regulations, and in the other to certain navy regulations, which had been approved by Congress, the court observed that they had the force of law. See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>116 U. S. 181. In neither case, however, was it held that such regulations, when in conflict with the acts of Congress, could be upheld.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b706-5\">The theory submitted on behalf of the piaintiff in error is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b706-6\">(1) That the regulation made by the'Commissioner of Internal Revenue and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury was a proper and a \u201c needful \u201d regulation under the oleomargarine law;</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b706-7\">(2) That this regulation was an outgrowth of the statute and acquired and possessed the force of law;</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b706-8\">(3) That the keeping of the records and the reporting of the details of the business, supervised under the law, became, as to the defendant, \u201c things required by law in the carrying out or conducting of his business\u201d (sec. 18); .</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b706-10\">(4) And that being authorized by Congress, and being for- \u2022 mulated and promulgated pursuant to an enactment, and being subordinate to, and in furtherance of, the statute, and not in conflict with it, the regulation should, under the decisions, be sustained and the demurrer should be overruled.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b706-11\"><em>Mr. P.

Assistant Attorney General, counsel for the United States, that one. of the regulations of August 25, 1886, named in the two counts of the indictment,' and claimed to be applicable to the present case, was as-follows : \u201c Wholesale dealers in oleomargarine will keep a book (Form 61) and make a monthly return on Form 217, showing the .oleomargarine received by them, and from' whom received; also, the oleomargarine disposed of by them and to whom sold or delivered ; \u201d that that regulation covers the two counts of; the indictment and the two questions\u00bb .certified; and. that Form 61, so referred to, is a form for a record'in a book, and Form 217 is one for the monthly return; and it is claimed that such regulation was properly made under \u00a7 20 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">It is provided by \u2022\u00a7 41 of the act approved October 1, 1800 c. 1244, entitled \u201c An act to reduce the revenue and equalize duties on imports, and for other purposes,\u201d 26 Stat; 567, .621, \u201cthat wholesale dealers in oleomargarine shall keep such books and render such returns in relation thereto as the Cow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>missioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may, by regulation, require, and such books shall be open at all times to the inspection of any internal revenue officer or agent.\u201d - '</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">But, although the regulation' above recited may have been a proper one to be made, under \u00a7 20 of the act of August 2,1886, yet the question to be determined in this case is whether a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine, who knowingly and wilfully fails and\u2019omits to keep the book and make the monthly return prescribed in the regulation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, thereby fails and omits, within the meaning of \u00a7 1.8 of the act, to do a thing \u201c required by law in the' carrying on or conducting of his business,\u201d so as to be liable to the penalty prescribed by that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In this connection, it is worthy of observation that \u00a7 5 of the act requires that every manufacturer of oleomargarine-shall keep such books, and render such returns of materials and products, as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may, by regulation, require; but it imposes no penalty on the manufacturer for any neglect to keep such books and render such returns, nor does it impose a duty to keep the books and render the returns on a wholesale dealer in the-article, such as the defendant in this case was. The question, therefore, is whether a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine, who omits to keep the books or to render the returns prescribed by the regulation made under the authority of \u00a7 20 of the act, is liable to the penalty prescribed by \u00a7 18, as having omitted or failed to do a thing \u201c required by law in the carrying on or conducting of his business,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Regulations for carrying the act into effect, to be made under the provisions of \u00a7 20, are necessary, as they are in various departments of the public service. . By \u00a7 161 of the Revised Statutes, the head of each department is authorized \u201c to prescribe regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the government of his department, the conduct of its officers and clerks, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use and preservation of the records, papers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>property appertaining to it;\u201d and, by \u00a7 251,-t\u00edre Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to make and issue instructions and regulations to collectors, receivers, depositaries, officers and others, and to prescribe rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, to be used in executing and enforcing the internal revenue laws and laws relating to raising revenue from imports, or duties on imports, or to warehousing.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Section 20 of the act in question would be fully carried out \u2022by making regulations of the character of those provided for in \u00a7 161 and \u00a7 251 of the Revised Statutes, without extending the provision of \u00a7 18 so as to make a criminal offence, as \u00e1 neglect to do a thing \u201c required by law,\u201d of a n\u00f3glect to do a thing required only by a regulation of tne Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">It is well, settled \u2022 that there are no common law offences against the United States. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>7 Cranch, 32; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coolidge, </em>1 Wheat. 415; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>108 U. S. 199, 206; <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>139 U. S. 240, 262, 263, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">It was said by this court in <em>Morrill </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>106 U. S. 466, 467, that the Secretary of the Treasury cannot by his regulations alter. or amend a revenue law, and that all he can do is to regulate the mode of proceeding to carry into effect what ' Congress has enacted. Accordingly, it was held in that case, under \u00a7 2505 of the Revised Statutes, which provided that live animals specially imported for breeding purposes from beyond the seas should be admitted free of duty, upon proof thereof satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury and under such regulations as he might prescribe, that he had no authority to prescribe a regulation requiring that, before admitting- the animals free, the collector should be satisfied that they were of superior stock, adapted to improving the\u2019 breed in the .United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">' Much more does this principle apply to a case where it is sought substantially to' prescribe a criminal offence by the' -\u25a0regulation of a department. It is a principle of criminal law. that an offence which may be the subject of 'criminal procedure is an act committed or omitted \u201cin violation of-\u2019a/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>public law, either forbidding or commanding it.\u201d 4 American <em>&amp; </em>English Encyclopedia of Law, 642; 4 Bl. Com. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">It would be a very dangerous principle to hold that a thing prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as a needful regulation under the oleomargarine act, for carrying it into effect, could be considered as a thing \u201crequired by law \u201d in the carrying on or conducting o'f the business of a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine, in such manner as to become a criminal offence punishable under \u00a7 18 of the act; particularly when the same act, in \u00a7 5, requires a manufacturer of the article to keep such books and render such returns as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the .Secretary of the Treasury, may, by regulation, require, and does not impose, in that section or elsewhere in the act, the duty of keeping such books and rendering such returns upon a Avholesale dealer in the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">It is necessary' that a sufficient statutory authority should exist for declaring any act or omission a criminal offence; and Ave do not think that the statutory authority in the present case is sufficient. If Congress intended to make it an offence for Avholesale dealers in oleomargarine to omit to keep books and render returns as required by regulations to be made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, it would have done so distinctly, in connection Avith an enactment such as that above recited, made in \u00a7 41 of the act of October 1, 1890.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Regulations prescribed by the President and by the heads of departments, under authority granted by Congress, may be regulations prescribed by law, so as lawfully to support acts done under them and in accordance with them, and may thus have, in a proper sense, the force of law; but it does not follow that \u00e1 thing required by them is a thing so required by law as to make the neglect to do the thing a criminal offence in a citizen, where a statute does not distinctly make the neglect in question a criminal offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\n<em>The questions certified a/re answered m the negafme.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
